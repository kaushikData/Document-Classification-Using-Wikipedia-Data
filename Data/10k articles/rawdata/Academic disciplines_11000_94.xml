[[File:Ecozone Afrotropic.svg|300px|thumb|The Afrotropical realm, marked in blue]]
:''See [[Tropical Africa]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] for other aspects.''
The '''Afrotropical realm''' is one of the Earth's eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It includes [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]], the southern and eastern fringes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the island of [[Madagascar]], southern [[Iran]] and extreme southwestern [[Pakistan]], and the islands of the western [[Indian Ocean]]. It was formerly known as the '''Ethiopian Zone''' or '''Ethiopian Region'''.

==Major ecological regions==
Most of the Afrotropic, with the exception of Africa's southern tip, has a [[tropical]] climate. A broad belt of deserts, including the [[Atlantic Desert|Atlantic]] and [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]] deserts of northern Africa and the [[Arabian Desert]] of the Arabian Peninsula, separate the Afrotropic from the [[Palearctic]] realm, which includes northern Africa and temperate [[Eurasia]].

===Sahel and Sudan===
South of the Sahara, two belts of [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical grassland and savanna]] run east and west across the continent, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Immediately south of the Sahara lies the [[Sahel]] belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and [[acacia]] savanna. Rainfall increases further south in the [[Sudanian Savanna]], also known simply as the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian Savanna is home to two great [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands]], the [[Sudd]] wetland in [[South Sudan]], and the [[Niger Inland Delta]] in [[Mali]]. The [[forest-savanna mosaic]] is a transitional zone between the grasslands and the belt of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] near the equator.

===[[Southern Arabian woodlands]]===
South Arabia, expressed as being mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwestern Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Some of the notable are [[Jabal Bura']], Jabal [[Raymah]], and [[Jabal Badaj]] in the Yemeni highland escarpment, and the seasonal forests in eastern Yemen and the [[Dhofar]] region of Oman. Other woodlands scatter the land and are very small and are predominantly [[juniper]] or [[acacia]] forests.

===Forest zone===
The [[forest zone]], a belt of lowland [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]], runs across most of equatorial Africa's [[intertropical convergence zone]]. The [[Upper Guinean forests]] of West Africa extend along the coast from [[Guinea]] to [[Togo]]. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a zone of forest-savanna mosaic that reaches to the coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the [[Lower Guinean forests]], which extend along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from eastern [[Benin]] through [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]] to the western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The largest tropical forest zone in Africa is the [[Congolian forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]] in Central Africa. A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, from southern [[Somalia]] to [[South Africa]].

===East African grasslands and savannas===
* ''Acacia''-''Commiphora'' grasslands
* [[Serengeti]]

===Eastern Africa's highlands===
[[Afromontane]] region, from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] to the [[Drakensberg Mountains]] of South Africa, including the [[East African Rift]]. Distinctive flora, including ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus]]'', as well as giant ''[[Lobelia]]s'' and ''[[Dendrosenecio|Senecio]]s''.
* [[Ethiopian Highlands]]
* [[Albertine rift montane forests]]
* [[East African montane forests]] and [[Eastern Arc forests]]

===Southern African woodlands, savannas, and grasslands===
[[File:Afrotropic-Ecozone-Southern Africa.svg|200px|thumb|Southern Africa as described in Plant Taxonomic Database Standards No. 2]]
* [[Miombo woodlands]]
* Zambezian mopane and ''Baikiaea'' woodlands
* [[Bushveld]]

===Deserts of southern Africa===
* [[Namib Desert]]
* [[Kalahari Desert]]
* [[Karoo]]
* [[Tankwa Karoo]]
* [[Richtersveld]]

===Cape floristic region===
The [[Cape floristic region]], at Africa's southern tip, is a [[Mediterranean climate]] region that is home to a significant number of endemic taxa, as well as to plant families like the [[protea]]s (''Proteaceae'') that are also found in the [[Australasian realm]].

===Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands===
{{main|Ecoregions of Madagascar}}
[[Madagascar]] and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the realm, with numerous [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]] like the [[lemur]]s. Madagascar and the [[Seychelles]] are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and broke away from Africa millions of years ago. Other Indian Ocean islands, like the [[Comoros]] and [[Mascarene Islands]], are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains several important biospheres, as its [[biodiversity]] and ratio of endemicism is extremely high.

==Endemic plants and animals==

===Plants===
The Afrotropical realm is home to a number of endemic plant families. [[Ecoregions of Madagascar|Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands]] are home to ten endemic families of flowering plants; eight are endemic to Madagascar ([[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Didymelaceae]], [[Didiereaceae]], [[Kaliphoraceae]], [[Melanophyllaceae]], [[Physenaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]], and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]]), one to [[Seychelles]] ([[Mesdusagynaceae]]) and one to the [[Mascarene Islands]] ([[Psiloxylaceae]]). Twelve plant families are endemic or nearly endemic to South Africa (including [[Curtisiaceae]], [[Heteropyxidaceae]], [[Penaeaceae]], [[Psiloxylaceae]] and [[Rhynchocalycaceae]]) of which five are endemic to the [[Cape floristic region|Cape floristic province]] (including [[Grubbiaceae]]). Other endemic Afrotropic families include [[Barbeyaceae]], [[Montiniaceae]], [[Myrothamnaceae]] and [[Oliniaceae]].

===Animals===
{{main|Fauna of Africa}}
The East African Great Lakes ([[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Malawi]], and [[Tanganyika]]) are the center of biodiversity of many freshwater fishes, especially [[cichlid]]s (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2,000 species in the family).&lt;ref&gt;I.P.Farias et al., Total Evidence: Molecules, Morphology, and the Phylogenetics of Cichlid Fishes, Journal of Experimental Zoology (Mol Dev Evol) 288:76–92 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbours 322 of West African's fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even
to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas.&lt;ref&gt;T.Moritz and K. E. Linsenmair, West African fish diversity – distribution patterns and possible conclusions for conservation strategies (in African Biodiversity: Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems, Springer, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afrotropic has various endemic [[bird]] families, including [[ostrich]]es (Struthionidae), [[sunbird]]s, the [[secretary bird]] (Sagittariidae), [[guineafowl]] (Numididae), and [[mousebird]]s (Coliidae). Also, several families of [[passerines]] are limited to the Afrotropics; These include [[rock-jumper]]s (Chaetopidae) and [[rockfowl]] (Picathartidae).

Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the [[Tubulidentata]] ([[aardvark]]s), [[Afrosoricida]] ([[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s), and [[Macroscelidea]] ([[elephant shrew]]s). The [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|East-African plains]] are well known for their diversity of large mammals.

Four species of great apes ([[Hominidae]]) are endemic to Africa: both species of [[gorilla]] (western gorilla, ''Gorilla gorilla'', and eastern gorilla, ''Gorilla beringei'') and both species of [[chimpanzee]] ([[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', and [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus''). [[Human]]s and their ancestors originated in Africa.

An '''anacoluthon''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ə|k|ə|ˈ|lj|uː|θ|ɒ|n}} {{respell|AN|ə|kə|LEW|thon}}; from the Greek ''anakolouthon'', from ''an-'': "not" and ἀκόλουθος ''akólouthos'': "following") is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |title=Anacoluthon - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425165000/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the Italian proverb "The good stuff – think about it."&lt;ref&gt;''Alla buona derrata, pensaci su'', from {{cite book | last1 = Mawr | first = E.B. | year = 1885 | title = Analogous Proverbs in Ten Languages | page = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally it is considered to be an error in sentence structure, and results in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in "[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]" literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought. Anacoluthon is very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, a dash (—) is often included at the point of discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gowers | first = E. | year = 1973 | title = The Complete Plain Words | page = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.

==Examples==
*"Had ye been there – for what could that have done?" ([[John Milton]] in ''Lycidas'')

In [[Paradise Lost]], [[John Milton]] uses an anacoluthon with Satan's first words to illustrate his initial confusion:
*"If thou beest he; but O how fallen! How changed" (I.83)

[[William Shakespeare]] uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' IV iii 34-6):
*"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
*:That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
*:Let him depart."

Additionally, [[Conrad Aiken]]'s ''Rimbaud and Verlaine'' has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
*"Discussing, between moves, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] and [[spondee]]
*:Anacoluthon and the open vowel
*:God the great peacock with his [[angel]] peacocks
*:And his dependent peacocks the bright stars..."

[[Franz Kafka]] uses perhaps the most famed example of anacoluthon as the first line of [[The Metamorphosis]]:
"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin."

==Etymology==
The word ''anacoluthon'' is a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακόλουθον}} (''anakólouthon''), which derives from the [[privative]] prefix {{lang|el|ἀν-}} (''an-'') and the root adjective {{lang|el|ἀκόλουθος}} (''akólouthos''), "following". This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' in [[logic]].  However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used ''both'' for the logical error of ''non sequitur'' and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==

The term "anacoluthon" is used primarily within an academic context.  It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry.  For example ''[[The King's English]]'', an English [[style guide]] written by [[H. W. Fowler]] and [[F. G. Fowler]], mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term does occasionally appear in popular media as well.  The word, though not the underlying meaning (see [[malapropism]]), has been popularized, due to its use as an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] by [[Captain Haddock]] in the English translations of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series of books.

'''Analytical feminism''' is  a line of philosophy that applies analytic concepts and methods to feminist issues and applies feminist concepts and insights to issues that have traditionally been of interest to analytic philosophers. Like all [[Feminism|feminists]], analytical feminists insist on recognizing and contesting [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |title=One Woman's Attempt at a Definition |author=Ann E. Cudd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073853/http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “analytical feminism” dates back to the early 1990s when the Society for Analytical Feminism was opened in at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/|title= Society for Analytical Feminism |author= Norco College - Riverside Community College District}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an opportunity to discuss and examine issues concerning analytical feminism, in part to contrast the more prevalent influences of [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]], and also to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is neither inherently or  irredeemably male-biased. Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, [[epistemology]], [[metaphysic]]s and the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter01.html#chapter01sec04|title=History of Analytical Feminism|author=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the American philosophical magazine ''[[Hypatia]]'' published a special issue&lt;ref name="Hy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hypatia-Special Issue: Analytic Feminism-August 1995|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1111/hypa.1995.10.issue-3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophical positions]]. In this issue, the authors such as [[Ann Cudd]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ann Garry]] of [[California State University Los Angeles]], and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the [[University of Washington]] proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and  somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic  feminist agenda as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm|title=THE NATURALISM QUESTION. HOW TO RE-THINK THE ANALYTIC – CONTINENTAL DICOTHOMY FROM A FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|author=Alessandra Allegrini|access-date=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928142832/http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm#|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy, and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledge the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields.

==Philosophical approach==
Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: "Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter  [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]] is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy." (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially [[sociology]] and [[biology]]. They, like most [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches.

The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‘analytical’, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most analytic feminists, the  best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/analytic-feminism-eoph/ |title= Analytic Feminism |author= bookrags }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}, it is not doctrinaire—indeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a "core desire" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of [[norm (social)|norm]]ativity which is necessary for both [[feminist political theory]] and philosophy. This "core desire"  finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge building===
Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies.&lt;ref&gt;

One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'', is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline  (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).

Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns.

There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of [[intersectionality]] in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of [[Privilege (social inequality)]] in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and [[epistemic injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Honey bee]]s are sensitive to odors (including pheromones), tastes, and colors, including [[ultraviolet]]. They can demonstrate capabilities such as color discrimination through [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]] and retain this information for several days at least; they communicate the location and nature of sources of food; they adjust their foraging to the times at which food is available; they may even form [[cognitive map]]s of their surroundings.

==Learning==
[[Image:Bee swarm on fallen tree02.jpg|thumb|Swarming bees require good communication to all congregate in the same place]]

Honey bees are adept at [[associative learning]], and many of the phenomena of [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[classical conditioning]] take the same form in honey bees as they do in the [[vertebrate]]s. Efficient [[forage (honey bee)|foraging]] requires such learning. For example, honey bees make few repeat visits to a plant if it provides little in the way of reward.  A single forager will visit different flowers in the morning and, if there is sufficient reward in a particular kind of flower, she will make visits to that type of flower for most of the day, unless the plants stop producing nectar or weather conditions change. 
 
A relatively recent experiment demonstrates several aspects of bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple Y-shaped maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a branching point where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, which led to the food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used at the entrance to the maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do so when a different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol that was different from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in [[working memory]] for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = S | last = Zhang  |author2=Bock F|author3=Si A|author4=Tautz J|author5=Srinivasan MV | date = April 5, 2005 | title = Visual working memory in decision making by honey bees | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 14 | pages = 5250–5 | pmid = 15795382 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501440102 | pmc = 555688|bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5250Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.

===Color learning in honeybees===
A number of experiments have demonstrated color recognition, discrimination and memory in honey bees ''[[Apis mellifera]]''. Beginning in the early 1900s, scientists [[Karl von Frisch]] and later Randolf Menzel began asking questions about color vision and various aspects of color learning in bees.&lt;ref name=Carew2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Carew|first=Thomas J.|title=Behavioral Neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior|year=2000|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=978-0-87893-084-5|chapter=9. Associative Learning in Honeybees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Color discrimination====
[[Image:VonFrisch color vision experimental setup.jpg|thumb|alt=experimental design for testing color vision in honey bees.|Figure 1. Testing for color vision in honey bees. The majority of bees flew directly to the dish with the blue background as they had been trained to do. Thus, they were able to discriminate between gray and blue backgrounds, showing their capability for color vision.]]

The Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch began the exploration of color vision in honey bees when, in 1919, he asked whether or not bees have  [[color vision]].  He performed an elegant experiment that showed not only that the bees could discriminate colors but that they demonstrated associative learning.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt; He first trained his bees to feed from a small dish filled with a nectar-like sugar water.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt; This dish was placed on a piece of blue colored cardboard so that the color was visible to the bees as they arrived at the dish and fed. Next, von Frisch placed identically sized pieces of cardboard in varying shades of grey, each with a dish, all around the blue piece.&lt;ref name="vonFrisch"&gt;Frisch, K. von. 1956. Bees; their vision, chemical senses, and language. Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacking color vision, the bees should visit one or more of the gray pieces as often as the blue piece, but he found the vast majority of the bees flew directly to the blue piece of cardboard on which they had previously obtained their reward.&lt;ref name="vonFrisch"/&gt; The bees largely ignored the gray pieces which had not been rewarded.&lt;ref name="vonFrisch"/&gt; Von Frisch repeated the experiment with other colors like violet and yellow and got the same results.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt; Later other researchers used this experimental design to test the color vision of vertebrates.

====Color learning rates and preferences====
The German scientist Randolf Menzel continued the study of color vision in honey bees with more detailed tests. He was curious about whether bees would learn certain colors faster than others. He used lights of various color and intensity to project circles of light on a surface, a set-up like that used by von Frisch except that, by using light instead of cardboard, Menzel was able to easily change the intensity and color of the circles.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt; 
[[Image:Bee gathering pollen, Montreux.jpg|thumb|left|alt=bee collecting pollen.|Figure 2. Honey bee collecting pollen]]

To test bees ability to distinguish between two different colors, Menzel placed a small dish containing sugar-water in one circle and a second empty dish some distance away on a differently colored circle.  A single bee was placed equidistant between the two circles and allowed to choose between the dishes. The bees quickly learned to choose the color signaling the dish with the reward, and Menzel was able to measure how quickly the bees learned this task with various color differences.&lt;ref name="Menzel"&gt;Menzel, R. and Backhaus, W. 1989. Color vision in honey bees: Phenomena and physiological mechanisms. In D. Stavenga and R. Hardie (eds): Facets of vision. Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: 281-297&lt;/ref&gt;

Menzel's results showed that bees do not learn to discriminate between all color pairs equally well. Bees learned the fastest when violet light was rewarded, and the slowest when the light was green; the other colors fell somewhere in between. This evidence of inherent bias is evolutionarily reasonable, given that bees forage for differently-colored nectar-bearing flowers, many of which are to be found in green foliage which does not signal reward.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Menzel"/&gt;

====Color memory====
After his work on color preferences, Menzel extended his experiments to study aspects of color learning and memory. He wanted to know how many trials bees need to reliably choose a previously rewarded color when they are presented with several alternatives, and how long they would remember the rewarded color.

Menzel did several experiments to answer these questions. First, he gave individual bees a single sugar reward on a colored background.  He then kept these bees in small cages for several days without any further trials. After a few days, he presented each bee with an array of several dishes, each on a different colored background. One of the colors was the same as that used during the initial trial, and the others were novel, unrewarded colors. Remarkably, after a single rial and several days without exposure to the rewarded color, bees correctly chose to explore the color used in the first trial more than fifty-percent of the time.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Menzel"/&gt;

Menzel then repeated this experiment with another group of bees, keeping all factors the same except that in the second round of testing he gave the bees three initial trials with the rewarded color instead of just one. When, after several days in confinement. the bees were presented with a choice of colors they almost always chose the color that was used on the first three trials.&lt;ref name="Menzel"/&gt;

This ability to retain information about color-linked rewards for several days after minimal exposure to the rewarded color demonstrates the remarkable facility with which bees learn and retain color information.

====Timing in color learning====
In still other experiments, Menzel explored the timing of bee color learning by testing whether bees register color before, during, or after receiving their sugar-water reward. For this purpose Menzel displayed the color beneath a rewarded dish at different stages of the honey bee feeding process: during approach, feeding and departure.&lt;ref name="Carew2000"/&gt;

Menzel found that bees register color during both approach and feeding, and that they had to see the color for about a total of about 5 seconds, with best performance usually coming with about three seconds exposure during the approach and two seconds after landing and beginning to feed.&lt;ref name="Menzel1991"&gt; Menzel, R. and Backhaus, W. 1991. Colour Vision in Insects. In P. Gouras (ed): Vision and Visual Dysfunction. The Perception of Colour. London: MacMillan Press, 262-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication==
Foragers communicate their floral findings in order to recruit other worker bees of the [[beehive|hive]] to forage in the same area. The factors that determine recruiting success are not completely known but probably include evaluations of the quality of [[nectar]] and/or [[pollen]] brought in.

There are two main hypotheses to explain how foragers recruit other workers—the [[waggle dance|"waggle dance" or "dance language"]] theory and the "odor plume" theory. The dance theory is far more widely accepted, and has far more empirical support than the odor theory. Supporters of the dance theory often grant odor a significant role in recruitment, while supporters of the odor theory have claimed that the dance is essentially irrelevant to recruitment. The academic debate between these theories has been polarized and sometimes hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Dance communication ===
[[File:Bee waggle dance.png|thumb|Figure-Eight-Shaped waggle dance of the honeybee ([[Apis mellifera]]). A waggle run oriented 45° to the right of ‘up' on the vertical comb indicates a food source 45° to the right of the direction of the sun outside the hive. The abdomen of the dancer appears blurred because of the rapid motion from side to side.]]

It has long been known that successfully foraging [[Western honey bee]]s perform a ''[[waggle dance]]'' upon their return to the [[beehive|hive]]. The laden forager dances on the comb in a circular pattern, occasionally crossing the circle in a zig-zag or waggle pattern. [[Aristotle]] described this behaviour in his ''Historia Animalium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AriHian.html|title=HISTORIA ANIMALIUM|work=virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This waggle pattern of movement was thought to attract the attention of other bees. In 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://beesource.com/point-of-view/adrian-wenner/the-honey-bee-dance-language-controversy/ The Honey Bee Dance Language Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl von Frisch]] correlated the runs and turns of the dance to the distance and direction of the food source from the hive. He reported that the orientation of the dance is correlated with the relative position of the sun to the food source, and the length of the waggle portion of the run is correlated to the distance of the food from the hive. Von Frisch also reported that the more vigorous the display is, the better the food.  Von Frish published these and many other observations in his 1967 book ''The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees''&lt;ref&gt;von Frisch, K. (1967) ''The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discoveries. 

Later work has supported Von Frisch's  observations and added many details. It appears that all of the known species and races of [[honey bee]]s exhibit the behavior, but details of its execution vary among the different species. For example, in ''[[Apis florea]]'' and ''[[Apis andreniformis]]'' (the "dwarf honeybees") the dance is performed on the dorsal, horizontal portion of the nest, which is exposed. The runs and dances point directly toward the resource in these species. Each honey bee species has a characteristically different correlation of "waggling" to distance, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyer | first1 = F.C. | last2 = Seeley | first2 = T.D. | year = 1991 | title = Dance dialects and foraging range in three Asian honey bee species | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 227–233 | doi=10.1007/bf00175094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such species-specific behavior suggests that this form of communication does not depend on learning but is rather determined genetically. It also suggests how the dance may have [[Evolution|evolved]].

Other experiments further document the communicative nature of the waggle dance. For example, dances by robotic dummy bees induced some recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michelsen | first1 = A. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = B. B. | last3 = Kirchner | first3 = W. H. | last4 = Lindauer | first4 = M. | year = 1989 | title = Honeybees can be recruited by a mechanical model of a dancing bee | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 277–280 | doi = 10.1007/BF00368642 | bibcode=1989NW.....76..277M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that the dance may vary with the environmental context, a finding that may explain why the results of some earlier studies were inconsistent. &lt;ref&gt;Visscher, P.K. and Tanner, D.A.

===Odor plume ===
While many researchers believe that bee dances give enough information to locate resources, proponents of the odor plume theory argue that the dance gives little, or no actual guidance to a [[nectar source]]. They argue that bees instead are primarily recruited by odor. The purpose of the dance is simply to gain attention to the returning worker bee so she can share the odor of the nectar with other workers who will then follow the odor trail to the source. Most scientists agree that odor is used in recruitment to resources, but they differ strongly in opinion as to the information content of the dance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The primary lines of evidence used by the odor plume advocates are
#experiments with odorless sugar sources which show that worker bees are unable to recruit to those sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beesource.com/point-of-view/adrian-wenner/experiments-on-directing-bee-flight-by-odors/|title=Experiments on Directing Bee Flight by Odors|work=beesource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
#logical difficulties of a small-scale dance (a few centimeters across) giving directions precise enough to hold the other bees on course during a flight that could be several kilometers long. Misreading by even a few degrees would lead the bee off course by hundreds of meters at the far end. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Neither of these points invalidate the dance theory, but simply suggest that odor might be involved, which is indeed conceded by all proponents of dance theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Critics of the odor plume theory counter that most natural nectar sources are relatively large—orchards or entire fields— so, precision may not be necessary or even desirable. They have also challenged the reproducibility of the odorless source experiment.

Odor learning in bees is usually tested by the [[proboscis extension reflex]]. Significant to the argument are the experiments of William F. Towne, of the Kutztown University in Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.kutztown.edu/towne/Towne_2008_JEB_211_3737-3743.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which hives are moved to "mirror image" terrain settings, and the bees are thereby fooled into dancing about the wrong location for a nectar source.  Foragers were successfully recruited to the wrong location, but only when the sun was obscured by clouds, forcing them to rely on terrain-based navigation rather than "[[solar ephemeris]]"-based navigation. As the cloud cover broke up, more and more bees corrected their dances to indicate the actual location of nectar, and forager visits shifted to the correct location.

Odor is an essential and even necessary at various stages of the recruitment process, including once a recruited forager reaches the vicinity of the resource&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riley | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Greggers | first2 = U. | last3 = Smith | first3 = A.D. | last4 = Reynolds | first4 = D.R. | last5 = Menzel | first5 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The flight paths of honeybees recruited by the waggle dance | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = | pages = 205–207 | doi=10.1038/nature03526|bibcode = 2005Natur.435..205R | pmid=15889092}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some scientists think that dancing may be a simple [[idiothetic]] movement that conveys no information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beekeeping.com/articles/us/bee_dance.htm|title=Why do honeybees dance?|work=beekeeping.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the dance as conveying information, but doing it poorly compared to other means and potentially used backup approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327262.400-rethinking-the-bees-waggle-dance.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923193107/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327262.400-rethinking-the-bees-waggle-dance.html?full=true |archivedate=2009-09-23 |title=Rethinking the bee's waggle dance |date=18 September 2009 |first=Caroline |last=Williams |issue=2726 |journal=[[New Scientist]] |deadurl=yes |df= }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: much of the research on the two competing hypotheses of communication has been restricted to [[Western honey bee]]s (see the work of F.C. Dyer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu.edu/~fcdyer/pubs.html Publications of Fred C. Dyer]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914171408/http://www.msu.edu/~fcdyer/pubs.html |date=September 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though). Other species of ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'' use variants on the same theme, and other types of [[bee]]s use other methods altogether.

===Trophallaxis===
The exchange of food, [[trophallaxis]], can be used to communicate the quality of a food source, temperature, a need for water, and the condition of the queen (Sebeok, 1990).

====Primer pheromones====
{{for|more background on this topic|List of honey bee pheromones}}

Research that was published in November 2004, by scientists under the leadership of [[Zachary Huang]], [[Michigan State University]] indicates that so called primer [[pheromone]]s play an important part in how a honey bee [[colony]] adjusts its distribution of labor most beneficially.  In order to survive as a bee colony of sometimes 50,000–100,000 individual bees, the communal structure has to be adaptable to seasonal changes and the availability of food.  The division of labor has to adjust itself to the resources available from foraging.  While the division of labor in a bee colony is quite complex, the work can be roughly seen as work inside the hive and outside the hive.  Younger bees play a role inside the hive while older bees play a role outside the hive mostly as [[foraging|foragers]].  Huang's team found that forager bees gather and carry a chemical called [[ethyl oleate]] in the stomach.  The forager bees feed this primer pheromone to the worker bees, and the chemical keeps them in a nurse bee state.  The pheromone prevents the nurse bees from maturing too early to become forager bees.  As forager bees die off, less of the ethyl oleate is available and nurse bees more quickly mature to become foragers.  It appears that this control system is an example of decentralized decision making in the bee colony.

Other bees like ''[[Trigona corvina]]'' rely on pheromones for much of their communication with nest mates and rivals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =The use of food source scent marks by the stingless bee Trigona corvina (Hymenoptera: Apidae): the importance of the depositor's identity|url = http://www.apidologie.org/index.php?Itemid=129&amp;option=com_article&amp;access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/apido:2006001&amp;type=pdf|doi = 10.1051/apido:2006001|journal=Apidologie|volume=37 |year=2006|pages=366–375|author=Neeltje Janna Boogert|author2=Frouke Elisabeth Hofstede|author3=Ingrid Aguilar Monge}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produce pheromones from their labial glands.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Trail Pheromone of a Stingless Bee, Trigona corvina (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini), Varies between Populations|url = http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593|journal = Chemical Senses|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 0379-864X|pmid = 20534775|pages = 593–601|volume = 35|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjq057|first = Stefan|last = Jarau|first2 = Jochen|last2 = Dambacher|first3 = Robert|last3 = Twele|first4 = Ingrid|last4 = Aguilar|first5 = Wittko|last5 = Francke|first6 = Manfred|last6 = Ayasse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of signaling depends on the profitability, but they commonly will scent mark a food source either for self-orientation, to deter rivals or to direct a nest mate to the resource. Once an individual finds a good food source, they will return to the same source for many days. If an individual detects the scent of a rival bee, they will avoid the plant in order to avoid conflict and to save time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has also been shown that pheromones are a method of sexual selection between male drones and queens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Cognition==
Experiments by [[James L. Gould|James Gould]] suggest that honey bees may have a [[cognitive map]] for information they have learned, and utilize it when foraging. In an experimental demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, J L "A honey of a question, are bees intelligent?" Discover, 1986, August&lt;/ref&gt; Gould lured some bees to a dish of artificial nectar, then gradually moved it farther from the hive.  He marked the trained bees, placed them in a darkened jar, and relocated them to a spot where the dish could not be seen but the hive was still visible. When released one by one, the bees appeared disoriented for a few seconds, then flew directly to the dish, 73 of 75 bees reaching it in about 28 seconds.  They apparently accomplished this feat by devising a new flight path based on a cognitive map of visible landmarks.

Another test suggested not only the use of a map, but also an ability to remember and combine relevant information. Gould moved a supply of sugar water 25% further away from a hive each day. The bees communicated the location of the water to each other as usual.  Then he placed the sugar water on a boat anchored in the middle of a small lake.  When scouts returned to the hive to communicate their find, other bees refused to go with them, even though they frequently flew over the lake to reach pollen sources on the opposite shore. To Gould these observations suggested that "bees somehow consider information to see if it makes sense before they act on it".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J A "Biology" Science News; 4/23/1983, Vol. 123 Issue 17, p271, 1/6p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurobiology of color vision==
[[Image:Western honey bee.jpg|thumb|alt=Western Honey Bee.|Figure 3. Western honey bee]]

A seminal paper by Menzel (1975) described the morphology and spectral sensitivity of the honey bee eye that underlie their color vision.&lt;ref name="Menzel1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzel | first1 = R | last2 = Blakers | first2 = M | year = 1975 | title = Colour receptors in the bee eye — Morphology and spectral sensitivity | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A | volume = 108 | issue = | pages = 11–13 | doi=10.1007/bf00625437}}&lt;/ref&gt; He examined color-coding in the honey bee [[retina]] by marking individual cells with a fluorescent dye and recording from these cells as single units. From this analysis he determined that there are three types of receptors in the honey bee eye: 1) UV receptors, 2) blue receptors, and 3) green receptors The three receptors contain three rhodopsin-like pigments which have maximal absorbance at wavelengths of 350&amp;nbsp;nm, 440&amp;nbsp;nm, and 540&amp;nbsp;nm. Menzel also found that most of the cells he studied had secondary sensitivities that corresponded to wavelength regions at which the other two receptor types were maximally active. He used spectral efficiency experiments to suggest that these secondary sensitivities result from electric coupling between the receptors.&lt;ref name="Menzel1975"/&gt; 

Certain morphologies distinguished the receptor types.  [[UV]] cells were found to have long visual nerve fibers that penetrated the lamina with deep tree-like branchings.  Blue and green receptor cells had more shallow fibers.&lt;ref name="Menzel1975"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}

In [[human geography]], a '''catchment area''' is the area from which a city, service or institution attracts a population that uses its services. For example, a school catchment area is the [[geographic]] area from which students are eligible to attend a local [[school]].

Governments and [[community service]] organizations often define catchment areas for planning purposes and [[public safety]] such as ensuring universal access to services like fire departments, police departments, ambulance bases and hospitals.

==Creation==
Catchment areas are generally established and modified by local governments. These boundaries can be modeled using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLafferty |first1=Sara L. |title=GIS and Health Care |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=24 |issue= |pages=25–42 |year=2003 |pmid=12668754 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.24.012902.141012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be large variability in the services provided within different catchments in the same area depending upon how and when those catchments were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=C. |last2=Campbell |first2=J. |title=Catchment areas in general practice and their relation to size and quality of practice and deprivation: a descriptive study in one London borough |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7066 |pages=1189–92 |year=1996 |pmid=8916754 |pmc=2352502 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7066.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually contiguous but can overlap when they describe competing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=Nadine |last2=Fiedler |first2=Robert S |last3=Grzybowski |first3=Stefan CW |last4=Grund |first4=Darrin |title=Defining rational hospital catchments for non-urban areas based on travel-time |journal=International Journal of Health Geographics |volume=5 |issue= |pages=43 |year=2006 |pmid=17018146 |pmc=1617091 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-5-43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining===
Catchments can be defined based upon a number of factors including distance to the facility, actual travel time to the facility, geographic boundaries or population within the catchment.  In a distance based catchment, the area serviced will often depend on the number of visits expected to that institution by each individual.  For example, it may be more acceptable to have a larger catchment for a hospital where any one individual will have few annual visits in comparison to a school where visits will be daily and hence desired distance would be closer.  
When a facility’s capacity can only service a certain volume, the catchment may be used to limit a population’s ability to access services outside that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Eddie |last2=Chalkley |first2=Brian |last3=Jones |first3=Allan |title=School Catchments and Pupil Movements: A case study in parental choice |journal=Educational Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1080/03055690097727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, children may be unable to enroll in a school outside their catchment to prevent the school's services being exceeded.

==Examples==
*[[Airport]]s can be built and maintained in locations which minimize the driving distance for the surrounding population to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airports: Non-Financial Analysis |publisher=[[Transport Canada]] |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/airports/RSAS/nonfinanalysis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*A neighborhood or district of a city often has several small convenience shops, each with a catchment area of several streets.  Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with catchment areas of several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas).  This principle, similar to the [[central place theory]], makes catchment areas an important area of study for [[geographers]], [[economists]], and [[urban planners]].
*In Nigeria, most Federal Schools respect the fact that some states are educationally less developed than others. The country's higher education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admission: University Admission |publisher=Students Nigeria |url=https://www.students.com.ng/category/admission }}&lt;/ref&gt; catchment areas have therefore been designed to ensure a good mixture of students from different backgrounds.

The '''Center for Earthquake Studies''' ('''CES'''), is an academic earth science, [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake studies]] and mathematical national research institute, located in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Earthquake Studies|title=Center for Earthquake Studies|url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/ces.php|work=Center for Earthquake Studies|publisher=Center for Earthquake Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute is headquartered in the campus area of the [[National Centre for Physics]] (NCP) and conducts mathematical research in [[earth science]]s, with the close coordination with the NCP.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

==History==
The institute was founded by the [[Government of Pakistan]] after taking the scientific advice from the science adviser dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]].&lt;ref name="Islamic Academy of Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|last=IAS|title=Dr. Professor Ishfaq Ahmad|url=http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|work=Islamic Academy of Sciences|publisher=Islamic Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214010934/http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|archivedate=14 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established in response to the deadliest and devastating [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|earthquake]] in Pakistan, on October 8, 2005.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff report|title=Timely prediction can reduce quake devastation|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\10\09\story_9-10-2009_pg11_2|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=Daily Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially established as the Earthquake Studies Department at the National Center for Physics, it gained its independence shortly after its establishment. The CES undertakes research scientific studies in the development of expertise in anomalous [[Geophysics|geophysical phenomenon]] prior to the [[Seismic activity|seismic activities]]. The CES primarily produces its research outcomes by using the [[computer simulation]] and [[mathematical model]]ling to interpret the seismic activities and the [[earthquake prediction]]s.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

The CES's campus also includes the various ATROPATENA stations network, and supports its research and development with the close collaboration with the Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes"&gt;{{cite web|last=GNFE|title=International Station for the Forecasting of Earthquakes ATROPATENA-PK, Pakistan, Islamabad|url=http://seismonet.org/page.html?id_node=157|work=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|publisher=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first and founding director was dr. [[Ahsan Mubarak]] who is still designated as the CES's senior scientist.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"/&gt; As of current, dr. Muhammad Qaisar is the CES's current administrator.

{{About|the discipline|the journal|Communication Theory (journal)}}
'''Communication theory''' is a field of [[information theory]] and [[mathematics]] that studies the technical process of information&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |date=2011 |origyear=July and October 1948 |publisher=The Bell System Technical Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=55 |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life |last=Dainton |first=Marianne |authorlink= |author2=Elain D. Zellei |year=2011 |publisher= Sage Publications |location= |isbn=1-4129-7691-X |page= |pages=247 |url= http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4983_Dainton_Chapter_1.pdf |accessdate= November 4, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally communication theory is “any systematic summary about the nature of the communication process” (Dainton, 2019). It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, ''Communication Theory as a Field'' (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”

"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)

== Elements of communication ==

Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication process |publisher=Center for Literacy Studies of the University of Tennessee |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cls.utk.edu/pdf/ls/Week1_Lesson7.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:The cover of Ecclesia orans.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''Ecclesia orans'']]
'''''Ecclesia orans''''' is [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Sant’Anselmo]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=G /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
''Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' is the subtitle of the [[Review journal|review]].&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Origins and frequency ==
''Ecclesia orans'' was initiated in 1984.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt; Next year was the time of the first issue that used to appear three times a year; &lt;br /&gt;
a reader was given 120 pages of ''Ecclesia orans'' the format of which was not changed from the beginning.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; Since 2013 it has been occurring twice a year.&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

== Contents ==
Each time a reader can find [[Article (publishing)|articles]] on [[History|historical]] and [[Literature|literary]] study, [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[theology]] and pastoral questions, publications concerning crucial [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] affairs of the following kind: congresses, and noticeable publications on [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], and [[review]]s of [[book]]s. [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] life and activities are being described in a regular [[Newsletter]].&lt;ref name=A /&gt; At the end of ''Ecclesia orans'' one can find a section of useful [[index (publishing)|index]]es:&lt;ref name=F /&gt; names, [[manuscript]]s, documents of the [[Catholic Church|Church's]] [[magisterium]], as well as [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]], [[Patristics|patristic]] and [[Christian]] authors sources, passages of euchology and songs, and the main index.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;

== Characteristic ==
Both ''Ecclesia orans'' and the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Sant’Anselmo]] in [[Rome]] are worldwide.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; There is a varied group of people that can contribute: the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] [[professor]]s as well as other Faculties of the [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Athenaeum of Sant’Anselmo]] that come from different countries, the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] graduates, prominent [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] scholars, and from writers who specialize in topics that are connected with the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; One can read articles in the language of the writers: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The language that is used for editorial purposes is always English and Italian. ''Ecclesia orans, Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' has now its own [[Review journal|review]] that has been waiting for. Its twenty-two year experience and resources will help is an excellent tool to sanctify both men and women in [[Christ]] and worship [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Relations with the Pontifical Liturgical Institute in Rome ==
Future [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] [[professor]]s, [[research]]ers, directors of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] commissions, and [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] animators have been engaged with the formation by the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; In order to achieve its aim, the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]], raised to an Ecclesiastical Faculty in 1978 and organises courses so that students can be taught properly.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; [[Professor]]s of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]], for whom [[History|historical]] and [[Theology|theological]] approach to the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] is of vital importance. Not only formation of [[student]] is crucial for the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] but also [[book]]s that are published to promote the [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[science]]s.&lt;ref name=E /&gt; The following volumes are in three volumes: ''Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta'', ''Analecta Liturgica'', and ''Anàmnesis''.&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Principal objective ==
Another expression of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] is ''Ecclesia orans, Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' – its engagement is to extend the growth of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] on a larger, [[international]] scale.&lt;ref name=H /&gt; The direction of the new [[Review journal|review]] is to take is multi-faceted; a varied aspect of [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] as follows: [[Literature|literary]] (editing and study of texts), [[History|historical]], [[Theology|theological]], pastoral, and [[art]]istic.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; What one will find special and original in the [[Review journal|review]] is the [[scientific method]] and topic discussion. This is the way in which [[Liturgical Movement|conciliar and postconciliar liturgical renewal]] can be led to [[Science|scientific]] discussions. The [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] will respond authoritatively to current issues of pastoral [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] and to adapt to different [[culture]]s only provided that it builds on a solid [[Science|scientific]] basis.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Other tasks ==
The [[Review journal|review]] aimed to contribute to this process over the last 30 years; accepting various contributions to its pages strictly [[Academia|academic]] in nature, based on the [[research]] of their various authors, which is offered as a means to promote the [[science]] and [[technology]] needed to support a [[ritual]] celebration that is more committed and more aware of what he is doing. Among the objectives of the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and, before that, of the [[Liturgical Movement|liturgical movement]], was the intention to provide the necessary means for [[Science|scientific]] [[research]] of the celebration of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], which could lead to a greater awareness of the reality that is celebrated.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; That is why, during the 19th and 20th centuries, different series and editions of sources have come into existence, especially [[Patristics|patristic]] and [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] sources, which over the years have become indispensable tools for the construction of a [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] study and development of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[theology]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

== Strategy of the review ==
The strategy of this [[Review journal|review]] with a strictly [[Academia|academic]] nature is determined by this principle: to provide a place for fellowship, discussion and reflection necessary to provide a serious [[Theology|theological]] ground on which to base the [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration.&lt;ref name=F /&gt; Therefore, ''Ecclesia orans'' has become an reliable voice, the echo of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]], which for more than 50 years of its life has promoted [[research]] on what the [[Tradition]] of the [[Catholic Church|Church]], in its more authoritarian forms, has given us. And it is in this line that the most important contribution of this first edition of 2013 has been included, the [[Letter (message)|letter]] received by the [[Editing|editor]] of the [[magazine]], from the [[emeritus]] [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

'''Engineering fits''' are generally used as part of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] when a part or assembly is designed. In engineering terms, the "fit" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can move independently from each other, or are then temporarily or even permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a "shaft and hole" but are not limited to just round components. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] is often still used in North America.

ISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft - the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.

==ISO system of limits and fits==

=== Overview ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organisation for Standardization]] system splits the three main categories into several individual fits based on the allowable limits for hole and shaft size. Each fit is allocated a code, made up of a number and a letter, which is used on engineering drawings in place of upper &amp; lower size limits to reduce clutter in detailed areas.

=== Hole and shaft basis ===
A fit is either specified as shaft-basis or hole-basis, depending on which part has its size controlled to determine the fit. To elaborate: in a hole-basis system, the size of the hole remains constant and it is the diameter of the shaft that is varied to determine the fit; conversely in a shaft-basis system, the size of shaft remains constant and the hole diameter is varied to determine the fit.

The ISO system uses an alpha-numeric code to illustrate the tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example, in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the tolerance range of the hole and h6 represents the tolerance range of the shaft. These codes can be used by machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.

=== Types of fit ===
The three types of fit are:
# Clearance - the hole is larger than the shaft, enabling the two parts to slide and / or rotate when assembled. 
# Location / transition - the hole is fractionally smaller than the shaft and mild force is required to assemble / disassemble 
# Interference - the hole is smaller than the shaft and high force and / or heat is required to assemble / disassemble

parts affected by corrosion, heat, or contamination
|H11/c11
|-
|Free running
|Large clearance where accuracy is not essential and involves high running speeds, 
large temperature variations, or heavy journal pressures
|H9/d9
|-
|Easy running
|Moderate clearances with minimal requirements for accuracy - e.g. high running speeds,
large temperature variations, high journal pressures, long shafts, pump or fan bearings
|H9/e9
|-
|Close running
|Small clearances with moderate requirements for accuracy - e.g. moderate running speeds
and journal pressures, shafts, spindles, sliding rods
|H8/f7
|-
|Sliding
|Minimal clearances for high accuracy requirements, which can be easily assembled

=== Interference fits ===

{{main|Interference fit}}

''Interference Fits
', also known as ''Press Fits'' or ''Friction Fits'', are fastenings between two parts in which the inner component is larger than the outer component. Achieving an interference fit requires applying force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the mating surfaces will feel pressure due to friction, and deformation of the completed assembly will be observed.

==== Force fits ====
''Force fits'' are designed to maintain a controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point. Like interference fits, force fits are achieved by applying a force during component assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Force}}
FN 1 to FN 5

==== Shrink fits ====

''Shrink fits'' serve the same purpose as force fits, but are achieved by heating one member to expand it while the other remains cool. The parts can then be easily put together with little  applied force, but after cooling and contraction, the same dimensional interference exists as for a force fit. Like force fits, shrink fits range from FN 1 to FN 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smaller RC numbers have smaller clearances for tighter fits, the larger numbers have larger clearances for looser fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobanengineering.com/Tolerances/ANSILimitsAndFits.asp|accessdate=9 September 2013|title=ANSI Standard Limits and Fits (ANSI B4.1-1967,R1974)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RC1: close sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location of parts which must assemble without noticeable play.

==== RC2: sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location but with greater maximum clearance than class RC1. Parts made to this fit turn and move easily. This type is not designed for free run. Sliding fits in larger sizes may seize with small temperature changes due to little allowance for thermal expansion or contraction.

==== RC3: precision running fits ====

Fits of this kind are about the closest fits which can be expected to run freely. Precision fits are intended for precision work at low speed, low bearing pressures, and light journal pressures. RC3 is not suitable where noticeable temperature differences occur.

==== RC4: close running fits ====

Fits of this kind are mostly for running fits on accurate machinery with moderate surface speed, bearing pressures, and journal pressures where accurate location and minimum play are desired. Fits of this kind also can be described as smaller clearances with higher requirements for precision fit.

==== RC5 and R6: medium running fits ====

Fits of this kind are designed for machines running at higher running speeds, considerable bearing pressures, and heavy journal pressure. Fits of this kind also can be described with greater clearances with common requirements for fit precision.

==== RC7: free running fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended to use where accuracy is not essential. It is suitable for great temperature variations. This fit is suitable to use without any special requirements for precise guiding of shafts.

==== RC8 and RC9: loose running fits ====

This kind of fit is intended for use where wide commercial tolerances may be required on the shaft. With this fits, the parts with great clearances with having great tolerances. Loose running fits exposed to effects of corrosion, contamination by dust and thermal or mechanical deformations.

The '''European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats''' ('''Hybrid CoE'''; {{lang-fi|Euroopan hybridiuhkien torjunnan osaamiskeskus}}) is an intergovernmental think tank based in [[Helsinki]], Finland, focusing on responses to [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid threats]] under the auspices of the [[European Union]] (EU) and [[NATO]].

== Function ==
Hybrid CoE  is described as an in-house think tank that conducts training courses, hosts workshops to policymakers and practitioners, and produces [[White paper|white papers]] on hybrid threats, such as weaknesses in an electrical grid or possible exploitation of vaguely written legislation. The Centre was formally established on 11 April 2017 under Finnish law with a [[memorandum of understanding]] between eight European states and the [[United States]] and in alignment with EU and NATO decisions. Three more European states signed the memorandum later. The Centre was inaugurated on 3 October 2017 and allotted a budget of 1.5 million [[Euro|euros]]. It is located in the [[Sörnäinen]] neighbourhood of Helsinki and was manned by fifteen persons in 2018 with international expert networks to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2017/20170417|title=Laki Euroopan hybridiuhkien torjunnan osaamiskeskuksesta 417/2017|last=|first=|date=2017-06-28|website=www.finlex.fi|language=fi|trans-title=Act on the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats 417/2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070859/http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2017/20170417|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/18/inside-a-european-center-to-combat-russias-hybrid-warfare/|title=Inside a European Center to Combat Russia’s Hybrid Warfare|last=Standish|first=Reid|date=2018-01-18|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123003129/http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/18/inside-a-european-center-to-combat-russias-hybrid-warfare/|archive-date=2018-01-23|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-01-22|quote=Located in an unassuming office building filled with boardrooms, lecture halls, and projectors in the Finnish capital, a new entity under the joint auspices of the European Union and NATO was founded with a herculean mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1858">A '''fenestra''' ('''fenestration'''; plural '''fenestrae''' or '''fenestrations''') is any small opening or pore, commonly used as a term in the [[biology|biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fenestra - definition of fenestra in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fenestra|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Latin]] for the word "window", and is used in various fields to describe a pore in an [[anatomy|anatomical]] structure.

In [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], fenestrae are found in [[cancellous bone]]s, particularly in the [[Skull#Fenestrae|skull]]. In anatomy, the [[round window]] and [[oval window]] are also known as the ''fenestra rotunda'' and the ''fenestra ovalis''. In [[microanatomy]], fenestrae are found in [[endothelium]] of [[Capillary#Fenestrated|fenestrated capillaries]], enabling the rapid exchange of [[molecule]]s between the blood and surrounding [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The [[internal elastic lamina|elastic layer]] of the [[tunica intima]] is a fenestrated membrane. In [[surgery]], a fenestration is a new opening made in a part of the body to enable drainage or access.

In [[plant biology]], the perforations in a [[perforate leaf]] are also described as fenestrae, and the leaf is called a fenestrate leaf.  The [[leaf window]] is also known as a fenestra, and is a translucent structure that transmits light, as in ''[[Fenestraria]]''.	

In zoology, the trilobite ''[[Fenestraspis]]'' possessed extensive fenestrae in the posterior part of the body. In the [[paleognathae]], there is an ilio–ischiatic fenestra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43755">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy sets''' (aka '''uncertain sets''') are somewhat like [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Zadeh (1965) [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/papers/Fuzzy%20Sets-Information%20and%20Control-1965.pdf "Fuzzy sets"]. ''Information and Control'' 8 (3) 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dieter Klaua&lt;ref&gt;Klaua, D. (1965) Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre. Monatsb. Deutsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin 7, 859–876. A recent in-depth analysis of this paper has been provided by {{Cite journal | last1 = Gottwald | first1 = S. | title = An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory | doi = 10.1016/j.fss.2009.12.005 | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 161 | issue = 18 | pages = 2369–2379 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.
At the same time, {{harvtxt|Salii|1965}} defined a more general kind of structure called an [[L-relation]], which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as [[linguistics]] {{harv|De Cock|Bodenhofer|Kerre|2000}}, [[Decision making|decision-making]] {{harv|Kuzmin|1982}}, and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] {{harv|Bezdek|1978}}, are special cases of ''L''-relations when ''L'' is the [[unit interval]] [0, 1].

In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &amp;mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Dubois and H. Prade (1988) Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called [[Crisp set|''crisp'' sets]]. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily R. Liang, Shiyong Lu, Xuena Wang, Yi Lu, Vinay Mandal, Dorrelyn Patacsil, and Deepak Kumar, "FM-test: A Fuzzy-Set-Theory-Based Approach to Differential Gene Expression Data Analysis", BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (Suppl 4): S7. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A fuzzy set is a pair &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;m\colon U \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; a membership function. 
The reference set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is called '''universe of discourse''', and for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U,&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''grade''' of membership of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The function &lt;math&gt;m = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''membership function''' of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U, m)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite set &lt;math&gt;U=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\},&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{m(x_1)/x_1,\dots,m(x_n)/x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in U.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called 
* '''not included''' in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt; if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}} (no member), 
* '''fully included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;}} (full member), 
* '''partially included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (fuzzy member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic AAAI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805071058/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The (crisp) set of all fuzzy sets on a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with &lt;math&gt;SF(U)&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;F(U)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===Crisp sets related to a fuzzy set===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the following crisp sets are defined:
* &lt;math&gt;A^{\ge\alpha} = A_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)\ge\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''α-cut''' (aka '''α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;A^{&gt;\alpha} = A'_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''strong α-cut''' (aka '''strong α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;S(A) = Supp(A) = A^{&gt;0} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''support''' 
* &lt;math&gt;C(A) = Core(A) = A^{=1} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''core''' (or sometimes '''kernel''' &lt;math&gt;Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Note that some authors understand 'kernel' in a different way, see below.

===Other definitions===
* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; is '''empty''' (&lt;math&gt;A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;) [[iff]] (if and only if)
::[[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt; x \in U: \mu_A(x) = m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''equal''' (&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''included''' in a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, having
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; 
:is called a '''crossover point'''.

* For a given fuzzy set A any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A^{=\alpha} = \{x \in U | \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, is called a '''level''' of A. 
The '''level set''' of A is the set of all levels α∈[0,1] representing distinct-cuts. It is the target set (aka codomain) of &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_A = \{\alpha \in [0,1] \mid A^{=\alpha} \ne \varnothing\} = \{\alpha \in [0, 1] \mid\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Existential quantification|&lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = \alpha\} = \mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt;

* For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''height''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = sup \{\mu_A(x) \mid x\in{U}\}  = sup(\mu_A(U))&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;sup&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], which does exist because 1 is an upper bound. If U is finite, we can simply replace the supremum by the maximum.

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''normalized''' iff
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:In the finite case, where the supremum is a maximum, this means that at least one element of the fuzzy set has full membership. A non-empty fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be normalized with result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the membership function of the fuzzy set by its height:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x) = \mu_A(x)/Hgt(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:Besides similarities this differs from the usual [[normalizing constant|normalization]] in that the normalizing constant is not a sum.

* For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) having a core with [[Infimum and supremum|an upper and a lower bound]] the '''width''' is defined as
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = sup(Supp(A)) - inf(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:This does always exist for bounded a reference set U, especially if U is finite.
:In case that &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[closed set]], the width is just
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = max(Supp(A)) - min(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:In the n-dimensional case (U ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) the above can be replaced by the n-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In general there must exist some [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] for instance by integration (e. g. [[Lebesgue integration]]) of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

* A real fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (U ⊆ ℝ) is said to be '''convex''' (in fuzzy sense, not to be confused with a crisp [[convex set]]), iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in{U}, \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: \mu_A(\lambda{x} + (1-\lambda)y) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;,
:or (if we assume x≤y, which is no restriction), equivalent, iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in [x,y]: \mu_A(z) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;.
:In general, we may have to choose subsets Z of U and compare like follows:  
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in Z: \mu_A(z) \ge inf(\mu_A(\partial{Z}))&lt;/math&gt;,
:where &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Z and &lt;math&gt;f(X) = \{f(x)|x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Function (mathematics)#Image and preimage|image]] of a set ''X'' (here &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) under a function ''f'' (here &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;).

===Fuzzy set operations===
{{main|Fuzzy set operations}}
In contrast to the complement of a fuzzy set, for which there is a very common definition, union and intersection do have some ambiguity.
* For a given fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;\neg{A}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; or '''∁'''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the following membership function:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Let t be a [[t-norm]], and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; their '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A\cap{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cap{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
:and their '''union''' &lt;math&gt;A\cup{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cup{B}}(x) = s(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the definitions of t-norms, fuzzy sets inherit laws as [[Commutativity]], [[Monotonicity]], [[Associativity]] and for null and identity element (∅ and U, respectively). However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ∅. Intersection and union of a finite [[Indexed family|family]] of fuzzy sets can be defined by recursion, keeping associativity law in mind.

* If the standard negator &lt;math&gt;n(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha, \alpha \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by another [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]], the fuzzy set difference may be generalized by
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = n(\mu_A(x))&lt;/math&gt;. 
:The tripel of fuzzy intersection, union and complement build up a '''De Morgan Triplet''. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about [[t-norm]]s.

:The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Using arithmetic multiplication a t-norm instead, this defines a specific fuzzy intersection operation not being idempotent. By this, iterating multiplication of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It defines the '''m-th power''' of a fuzzy set which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way:

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \R^+&lt;/math&gt; the ν-th power of A is defined by its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A^{\nu}}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:Special case: Exponent is 2 (quadrature): For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''concentration''' &lt;math&gt;CON(A) = A^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined via its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{CON(A)}(x) = \mu_{A^2}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:With &lt;math&gt;0^0 := 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A^0 = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^1 = A&lt;/math&gt;.

* For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set '''Difference''' &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted just &lt;math&gt; A - B&lt;/math&gt;) maybe defined straightforward via membership functions:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),n(\mu_B(x)))&lt;/math&gt;,
:which means &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap \neg{B}&lt;/math&gt;, e. g.:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = min(\mu_A(x),1 - \mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoni Dhar: [http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJEIC/vol4_Is1/2.pdf Cardinality of Fuzzy Sets: An Overview], International Journal of Energy, Information and Communications Vol. 4, Issue 1, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014"&gt;N.R. Vemuri, A.S. Hareesh, M.S. Srinath: [http://www.math.sk/fsta2014/presentations/VemuriHareeshSrinath.pdf Set Difference and Symmetric Difference of Fuzzy Sets], in: Fuzzy Sets Theory and Applications 2014, Liptovský Ján, Slovak Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

:Another proposal for a set difference could be: 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A-{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) - t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been done by Dubois and Prade (1980), either using the absulute:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = |\mu_A(x) - \mu_B(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
:or, using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = max(min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x)), \,min(\mu_B(x), 1 - \mu_A(x)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

:Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analog to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et. al. (2005) and Bedregal et. al. (2009).&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* In contrast to crisp sets averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets.

===Disjoint fuzzy sets===
In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets:
Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = 0 \lor \mu_B(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:[[Existential quantification#Negation|&lt;math&gt;\nexists&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) &gt; 0 \land \mu_B(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and also equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: min(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will do the job here as well.

Fuzzy sets are disjoint, iff their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; any intersection will give ∅, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;A \dot{\cup} B = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\dot{\cup}{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) + \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(A \dot{\cup} B) = Supp(A) \,\dot{\cup}\, Supp(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows:
Given a family &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; of fuzzy sets with Index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...n}). This family is '''(pairwise) disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}\,\exists i\in{I}: \mu_{A_i}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A family of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports &lt;math&gt;Supp \circ A = (Supp(A_i))_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets.

Independend of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ∅ again, while the union has no ambiguity:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i = \bigcup_{i\in{I}} A_i&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i}(x) = \sum_{i\in{I}} \mu_{A_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Again only one of the summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint families of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i) = \dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} Supp(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Cardinality===
For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with finite &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. a 'finite fuzzy set'), its '''cardinality''' (aka '''scalar cardinality''' or '''sigma-count''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Card(A) = sc(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in{U}} \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that U itself is a finite set, the '''relative cardinality''' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A) = ||A|| = sc(A)/|U| = |A|/|U|&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be generalized for the divisor to be an non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A,G&lt;/math&gt; with G ≠ ∅, we can define the '''relative cardinality''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A,G) = sc(A|G) = sc(A\cap{G})/sc(G)&lt;/math&gt;,
which looks very similar to the expression for [[conditional probability]]&lt;!--and because of that, sc(A|G) is used instead of sc(A/G)- this in't **set** division, isn't it? --&gt;.
Note:
* &lt;math&gt;sc(G) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; here.
* The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. 
* For &lt;math&gt;G = U&lt;/math&gt; the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition.

===Distance and Similarity===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A: U \to U&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a family &lt;math&gt;\mu_A = (\mu_A(x))_{x\in{U}} \in [0,1]^U&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is a [[metric space]] with several metrics &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; known. A metric can be derived from a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (vector norm) &lt;math&gt;\|\,\|&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) = \| \alpha - \beta \,\|&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite, i. e. &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, such a metric may be defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) := max \{ |\alpha(x_i) - \beta(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are sequences of real numbes between 0 and 1. 
For infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. 
Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := d(\mu_A,\mu_B)&lt;/math&gt;,
which becomes in the above sample:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) = max \{ |\mu_A(x_i) - \mu_B(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt;
Again for infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e .g &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarity measures (here denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) may then be derived from the distance, e. g. after a proposal by Koczy:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 / (1 + d(A,B))&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else, 
or after Williams an Steele:
:&lt;math&gt;S = exp(-\alpha{d(A,B)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a steepness parameter and &lt;math&gt;exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beg20019"&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition for interval valued (rather 'fuzzy') similarity measures &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is provided by Beg and Ashraf as well.&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===L-fuzzy sets===
Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) [[algebraic structure|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a given kind; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. These are usually called '''''L''-fuzzy sets''', to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by [[Joseph Goguen]], who was a student of Zadeh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Goguen|Goguen, Joseph A.]], 196, "''L''-fuzzy sets". ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' '''18''': 145–174&lt;/ref&gt; A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f,t} instead of {0,1}.

An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov and Baruah. An '''intuitionistic fuzzy set''' (IFS) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by two functions:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of membership of x
:2. &lt;math&gt;\nu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of non-membership of x
with functions &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \nu_A: U \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

This resembles a situation like some person denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; voting 
* for a proposal A (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=1, \nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;), 
* against it (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=0, \nu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), 
* or abstain from voting (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=\nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;).
After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions.

For this situation, special 'intuitive fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms can be provided. 
With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta) \in [0, 1]^2 \mid \alpha + \beta = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and by combining both functions to &lt;math&gt;(\mu_A,\nu_A): U \to D^*&lt;/math&gt; this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets.

Once more, this has been expanded by defining '''picture fuzzy sets''' (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \eta_A, \nu_A&lt;/math&gt;, 'degree of positive membership', 'degree of neutral membership', and 'degree of negative membership' respectively and additional condition &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \eta_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility 'refusal of voting'.

With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in [0, 1]^3 \mid \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and special 'picture fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Cong Cuong, Vladik Kreinovich, Roan Thi Ngan: [http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2050&amp;context=cs_techrep A classification of representable t-norm operators for picture fuzzy sets], in: Departmental Technical Reports (CS).

== Fuzzy logic ==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}

As an extension of the case of [[multi-valued logic]], valuations (&lt;math&gt;\mu : \mathit{V}_o \to \mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[propositional variable]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{V}_o&lt;/math&gt;) into a set of membership degrees (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) can be thought of as [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] mapping [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation).  With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy [[premise]]s from which graded conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Gottwald]], 2001. ''A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics''. Baldock, Hertfordshire, England: Research Studies Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86380-262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the [[engineering]] fields of [[automation|automated]] control and [[knowledge engineering]], and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;"The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning," ''Information Sciences'' '''8''': 199–249, 301–357; '''9''': 43–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at [[fuzzy logic]].

== Fuzzy number and interval ==
{{main|Fuzzy number}}
A '''fuzzy number''' is a convex, normalized fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) whose membership function is at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} and has the functional value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; at at least one element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the assumed convexity the maximum (of 1) is 
* either an interval: '''fuzzy interval''', its core is a crisp interval (mean interval) with lower bound

::&lt;math&gt;\min \,C(A) = \min(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt; 
:and upper bound 
::&lt;math&gt;\max \,C(A) = \max(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt;.
* or unique: '''fuzzy number''', its core is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]; the location of the maximum is 
::℩ C(A) = ℩&lt;math&gt;x \in \R : \mu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; (where ℩ reads as '[[Definite description#Mathematical logic|this]]');
:which will assign a 'sharp' number to the fuzzy number, in addition to fuzzyness parameters like &lt;math&gt;Width(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the [[funfair]] game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).

A '''fuzzy interval''' is a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a core interval, i. e. a mean interval whose elements possess the membership function value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
The latter means that fuzzy intervals are normalized fuzzy sets. As in fuzzy numbers, the membership function must be convex, normalized, at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility," ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''1''': 3&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Like crisp intervals, fuzzy intervals may reach infinity. The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(A) = Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a fuzzy interval &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel.

However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity.

==Fuzzy categories==
The use of [[Set theory|set membership]] as a key components of [[category theory]] can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach which initiated in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen "Categories of fuzzy sets : applications of non-Cantorian set theory" PhD Thesis University of California, Berkeley, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of "Goguen categories" in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter "Goguen Categories:A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations"  2007 [[Springer Verlag|Springer]] {{ISBN|9781402061639}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=goguencateg&gt;Michael Winter "Representation theory of Goguen categories" [[Fuzzy Sets and Systems]] Volume 138, Issue 1, 16 August 2003, Pages 85–126&lt;/ref&gt; In these categories, rather than using two valued set membership, more general intervals are used, and may be lattices as in  L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref name=goguencateg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goguen, J.A., "L-fuzzy sets". Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 18(1):145–174, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy relation equation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The [[fuzzy relation equation]] is an equation of the form {{nowrap|1=''A'' · ''R'' = ''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are fuzzy sets, ''R'' is a fuzzy relation, and {{nowrap|''A'' · ''R''}} stands for the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''A'' with&amp;nbsp;''R'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Entropy==
A measure d of fuzzyness for fuzzy sets of universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; should fulfill the following conditions for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a crisp set: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \in \{0,\,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique maximum iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) \ge d(B)&lt;/math&gt; iff 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \ge \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \ge 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, 
::which means that B is 'crisper' than A.
#&lt;math&gt;d(\neg{A}) = d(A)&lt;/math&gt;   
In this case &lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of the fuzzy set A.

For '''finite''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; the entropy of a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = H(A) + H(\neg{A})&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_A(x_i) \ln \mu_A(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
or just
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n S(\mu_A(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x) = H_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Binary entropy function|Shannon's function]] (natural entropy function)
:&lt;math&gt;S(\alpha) = -\alpha \ln \alpha - (1-\alpha) \ln (1-\alpha), \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base ([[e (mathematical constant)|here: e]]) used.
Physical interpretation of k is the [[Boltzmann constant]] k&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a fuzzy set with a '''continuous''' membership function (fuzzy variable). Then 
:&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \ln \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and its entropy is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty S(\operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace )\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==
There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, a lot of new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way ({{harvnb|Burgin|Chunihin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Kerre|2001}}; Deschrijver and Kerre, 2003).

The diversity of such constructions and corresponding theories includes:
{{div col|colwidth=35em}}
* interval sets (Moore, 1966),
* ''L''-fuzzy sets (Goguen, 1967),
* flou sets  (Gentilhomme, 1968),
* Boolean-valued fuzzy sets (Brown, 1971),

'''GroupLens Research''' is a [[human–computer interaction]] research lab in the [[Department of Computer Science and Engineering (University of Minnesota)|Department of Computer Science and Engineering]] at the [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]] specializing in [[recommender system]]s and [[virtual community|online communities]]. GroupLens also works with [[mobile computing|mobile]] and [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous]] technologies, [[digital library|digital libraries]], and local [[geographic information system]]s.

The GroupLens lab was one of the first to study automated recommender systems with the construction of the "GroupLens" recommender, a [[Usenet]] article recommendation engine, and [[MovieLens]], a popular movie recommendation site used to study recommendation engines, tagging systems, and user interfaces.  The lab has also gained notability for its members' work studying open content communities such as [[Cyclopath]], a computational "[[geo-wiki]]" currently being used in the [[Twin Cities]] to help plan the regional cycling system.&lt;ref name="Cycloplan"&gt;{{cite web

==History==

=== Formation ===
In 1992, [[John Riedl]] and [[Paul Resnick]] attended the
[[Computer Supported Cooperative Work|CSCW]] [[academic conference|conference]]
together.  After they heard [[keynote|keynote speaker]] Shumpei Kumon talk
about his vision for an [[information economy]],&lt;ref&gt;

system for [[Usenet|Usenet news]].  The system collected ratings from Usenet readers and used those ratings to predict how much other readers would like an article before they read it.  This recommendation engine was one of the first automated collaborative filtering systems in which algorithms were used to automatically form predictions based on historical patterns of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2009-12-23--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall system was called the "GroupLens" recommender, and the servers that collected the ratings and performed the computation were called the "Better Bit Bureau".  This name was later dropped after a request from the [[Better Business Bureau]].  "GroupLens" is now used as a name both for this recommender system, and for the research lab at the University of Minnesota.

A [[feasibility study|feasibility test]] was done between [[MIT]] and
the University of Minnesota and a research paper was published including
the [[algorithm]], the system design, and the results of the feasibility
study, in the CSCW conference of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1993, Riedl and Resnick invited [[Joseph Konstan]] to join the
team.  Together, they decided to create a higher-performance
implementation of the algorithms to support larger-scale deployments.
In summer 1995 the team gathered
[[Bradley Miller (academic)|Bradley Miller]], [[David Maltz]],
[[Jon Herlocker]], and [[Mark Claypool]] for "Hack Week" to create
the new implementation, and to plan the next round of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

In the Spring of 1996, the first workshop on
[[collaborative filtering]] was put together by Resnick and
[[Hal Varian]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;

There, researchers from projects around the US
that were studying similar systems came together to share ideas and
experience.

=== Net Perceptions ===
In the summer of 1996, [[David Gardiner (academic)|David Gardiner]], a
former Ph.D. student of Riedl's, introduced [[John Riedl]] to [[Steven Snyder]].
Snyder had been an early employee at [[Microsoft]], but left
Microsoft to come to Minnesota to do a Ph.D. in [[Psychology]].  He
realized the commercial potential of collaborative filtering, and
encouraged the team to found a company in April 1996.  By June,
Gardiner, Snyder, Miller, Riedl, and Konstan had
[[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] their company, and by July
they had their first round of funding, from the [[Hummer-Winblad]]
[[venture capital]] company.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Net Perceptions went on to be one of the leading companies in
personalization during the [[dot-com bubble|Internet boom]] of the late 1990s, and stayed
in business until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;

the anonymous rating data they had collected, for other researchers
to use.  The GroupLens Research team, led by Brent Dahlen and Jon

=== Studying online communities ===
In 2002, GroupLens expanded into [[social computing]] and [[virtual community|online communities]] with the addition of [[Loren Terveen]], who was known for his research of ''social'' recommender systems such as PHOAKS.&lt;ref&gt;

In order to broaden the set of research ideas and tools they used,
Riedl, Konstan, and Terveen invited colleagues in [[social psychology]]
([[Robert E. Kraut|Robert Kraut]] and [[Sara Kiesler]], of the
[[Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute]]), and
economic and social analysis ([[Paul Resnick]] and
[[Yan Chen (academic)|Yan Chen]] of the
[[University of Michigan School of Information]]) to collaborate.  The
new, larger team adopted the name [[CommunityLab]], and looked
generally at the effects of technological interventions on the
performance of online communities. For instance, some of their
research explored technology for enriching conversation systems,&lt;ref&gt;

* '''MovieLens ratings datasets:''' In the early days of recommender systems, research was slowed down by the lack of publicly available datasets.  In response to requests from other researchers, GroupLens released three datasets:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grouplens.org/node/73&lt;/ref&gt; the MovieLens 100,000 rating dataset, the MovieLens 1,000,000 rating dataset, and the MovieLens 10,000,000 rating dataset.  These datasets became the standard datasets for recommender research, and have been used in over 300 papers by researchers around the world.  The dataset is also being used for teaching about recommender technology.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''[[Information leakage]] from recommender datasets:'''  a paper in the [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|information retrieval]] conference analyzed the privacy risks to users of having large recommender datasets released.  The basic risk discovered is that an anonymized dataset might be combined with public information to identify a user. For instance, a user who has written about his preference for movies on [[internet forum|online forums]] could be associated with a specific row in the MovieLens datasets.  In some cases, these associations might leak information the user would prefer to keep private.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">[[NATO]] has defined the concept of an '''Information Exchange Gateway''' (IEG) to facilitate secure communication between different security and management domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO IEG|url=http://www.afcea.org/europe/events/tne/08/documents/03_InteroperableStandardsProfiles-EWells.pdf|publisher=AFCEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEG is designed to provide a standard and [[secure communication|secure method of communication]] between NATO, NATO nations, non-NATO nations, [[coalition force]]s, [[Non Government Organisation]]s (NGOs), and other International Organisations (IOs).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cso.nato.int/ACTIVITY_META.asp?ACT=2226&lt;/ref&gt;

An Information Exchange Gateway provides '''Information Exchange Services''' (IES) to facilitate the exchange of information between networks, including data and protocol translation where necessary, and '''Information Protection Services''' (IPS) that ensure only intended information is exchanged. In addition, '''Node Protection Services''' (NPS) ensure information is exchanged in a safe and secure way and that only intended information which has been validated by the IPS can be exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO CIS and External CIS, AC/322-D(2005)0054-REV2, NATO, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO has defined five main IEG scenarios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= https://www.nexor.com/information-exchange-gateways/ |publisher=Nexor}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with scenario variants for transferring [[Classified information|classified information]]. The scenarios take account of the security classifications of the domains that they connect, as well as the security policy, the owners and the administrators of those domains.

In some scenarios, an IEG must include a [[Guard (information security)|guard]] to provide the IPS and NPS functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= http://www.deep-secure.com/information-exchange-gateway |publisher=Deep-Secure}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with a guard, the IEG's [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]] is split into two.

The '''Inland Waterways Commission''' was created by Congress in March 1907, at the request of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], to investigate the transportation crisis that recently had affected nation's ability to move its produce and industrial production efficiently.  The immediate crisis centered on insufficient railroad capacity developed by the private sector, and competing but neglected inland shipping, the navigation of which had been deemed under federal purview since 1824. The temporary commission lasted until the end of Roosevelt's presidency, but his conservationist [[Progressive Era|progressive]] interest was focused more than on transportation alone. The president wanted water projects to be considered for their multiple uses and in relation to other natural resources and asked for a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States.

Based on long-established legislative structure and more recent bureaucratic additions, the appointed members of the commission included, elected Representative [[Theodore E. Burton]] (R OH), as chairman, being also chair of the [[United States House Committee on Rivers and Harbors|House Committee on Rivers and Harbors]]; Senator [[Francis G. Newlands]] (D NV), as vice-chair; Senator [[William Warner (Missouri)|William Warner]] (R MO), and Senator [[John H. Bankhead]] (D AL).   Non-elected commissioners included government technocrats with experience in related fields, including [[Alexander Mackenzie (engineer)|Alexander Mackenzie]],  [[List of USACE Chiefs of Engineers|Chiefs of Engineers]], US Army, and the entity involved in federal navigation improvements since the beginning; [[William John McGee]], as secretary and from the [[United States Geological Survey]]; [[Frederick Haynes Newell]], the first Director of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|United States Reclamation Service]]; [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], and Herbert Knox Smith, from the Bureau of Corporations and predecessor to the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

By the end of that year, after the commission had looked at shipping on the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]], a minority of its members concluded that the nation needed a comprehensive water resources policy along with an autonomous commission of experts to plan and construct water projects that embraced entire river basins. At the end of 1907, and before Roosevelt presented the commission's preliminary report to Congress in late February, Senator Newlands introduced the first bill to create a permanent commission.  Over the next decade the subject of [[hydroelectricity]] would be closely studied, while Newlands drafted several more bills, with only an emasculated version becoming law in 1917.   While supportive of the commission's report generally, most members of Congress considered Newlands's plan either impractical or unconstitutional. Three years later, Congress all but eliminated the hope of centralized water planning when it replaced the Inland Waterways Commission with the Federal Power Commission, following passage of the [[Federal Power Act|Federal Water Power Act of 1920]].&lt;ref name="PisIWCre"&gt;Donald J. Pisani, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v018/18.4pisani.html Water Planning in the Progressive Era: The Inland Waterways Commission Reconsidered], Journal of Policy History 18.4 (2006) pp.389-418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential charge==
On  March 14, 1907, President Roosevelt appointed the Inland Waterway Commissioners and charged them to prepare and report "a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-2-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Instrument of the President, March 14, 1907.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced he said, by broad considerations of national policy, and the corresponding responsibilities and obligations, since the control of navigable waterways lies within the federal purview. He noted that while private sector energies had been directed largely toward industrial development in connection with field and forest, coal and iron, some of these material and power resources may already be largely depleted or abused. At the same time, the government's inland waterways have received scant attention as a whole, and it was becoming clear that the nation's streams should be considered and conserved as great natural resources. So far, works designed to control the waterways have usually been undertaken for a single purpose in mind, such as the improvement of navigation, the development of power, the irrigation of arid lands, the protection of lowlands from floods, or to supply water for domestic and manufacturing purposes. While the people's rights to these and similar water uses must be respected, the time had come he said, for local projects and uses of the inland waters to be viewed in a more comprehensive plan, designed for the benefit of the entire country; such a plan should consider and include all the uses to which streams may be put, and should bring together and coordinate the points of view of all water users.  While the task involved in the full and orderly development and control of the nation's river systems is a great one, it is certainly not too great for the government to approach, especially with results which seem to promise even greater returns.

The Commission's appointment followed numerous petitions from commercial organizations in the Mississippi Valley asking for such study, and he said, "the common knowledge that the railroads of the United States are no longer able to move crops and manufactures rapidly enough to secure the prompt transaction of the business of the nation, and there is small prospect of immediate relief." During the previous ten years, while the production of the northern interior States had doubled, the railroad facilities to transport it had increased only about 12%; there was reason to doubt railroad development could keep transportation abreast of production in the near-term.  "There appears to be but one complete remedy — the development of a complementary system of transportation by water. The present congestion affects chiefly the people of the Mississippi Valley, and they demand relief. When the congestion of which they complain is relieved, the whole Nation will share the good results."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"/&gt;

Roosevelt noted that while the nation's rivers are natural resources of first rank, they are also liable to become destructive agencies, endangering life and property; and that some of our most notable engineering enterprises have grown from the effort to control them. The vast quantity of annual suspended sediment and an enormous but unmeasured amount of earth-salts and soil-matter carried in solution not only causes the Mississippi channels to clog and flood the lowlands of the lower river, but also renders the flow variable and difficult to control.  Furthermore, he noted, the sediment and soil-matter is composed of the most fertile material of the fields and pastures drained by the tributaries. "Any plan for utilizing our inland waterways should consider floods and their control by forests and other means; the protection of bottom-lands from injury by overflow, and up-lands from loss by soil-wash; the physics of sediment-charged waters and the physical or other ways of purifying them; the construction of dams and locks, not only to facilitate navigation but to control the character and movement of the waters; and should look to the full use and control of our running waters and the complete "artificialization" of our waterways for the benefit of citizens as a whole." Not being possible to properly frame so large a plan for the control of rivers without taking account of the orderly development of other natural resources, Roosevelt asked that the Inland Waterways Commission consider the relations of the streams to the use of all the great permanent natural resources and their conservation to make and maintain prosperous homes.

Roosevelt noted that any feasible plan for utilizing inland waterways should recognize both the existing federal means, including the Departments of War, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor, and those in the States and their subdivisions.  Also it must not involve unduly burdensome expenditures from the national Treasury.  The cost necessarily will be large and proportional to the magnitude of potential benefits to the people, but it will be small in comparison to the $17 billion in current capital investments for steam railways nationally. That amount would have seemed enormous and incredible a half a century earlier, yet that investment was a continuous source of profit to the people. Without it, the nation's industrial progress would have been impossible.  In closing the President said that, the questions before the Inland Waterways Commission must necessarily relate to every part of the United States and affect every interest within its borders. Its plans should be considered in light of the widest modern knowledge of the country and its people, and from the most diverse points of view. As the committee's work sufficiently advanced, he would add more consulting members to the Commission, and ask that its recommendations be fully discussed with him, before they were submitted. The Commission's report should include both a general statement of the problems, as well as recommendations concerning the manner and means of attacking the problems perceived by them.

==Proceedings==
After initial conference and correspondence the organizational meeting was held in Washington DC from April 29 to May 3, 1907. A second meeting and inspection trip on the Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Passes was held May 13 to May 23. A third meeting and inspection trip took place from September 21 to October 13, which traveled on the Great Lakes from Cleveland to Duluth, on the Mississippi from St. Paul to Memphis, and on the Missouri River from Kansas City to St. Louis. A fourth meeting was held in the capitol beginning on November 25, for the purpose of preparing a preliminary report; the commission ended February 3, 1908.

During the organizational and inspecting meetings, thirty formal sessions were held in addition to informal meetings and conferences. At several of these sessions the entire Commission were present; at no session were there fewer than five Commissioners; the average attendance was over seven. During the meetings for report preparation there were 27 sessions, with an average attendance of seven.  Experts on matters entrusted to the Commission were present by invitation at 24 sessions; of these experts there were 24, several of whom attended two or more sessions, with most being former or current attaches of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].  Outside formal sessions, the Commissioners devoted much time to the consideration of the waterways and related matters. Two or three Commissioners jointly inspected the upper Missouri, the Columbia and Snake, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, and major tributaries; several Commissioners employed agencies under their direction in collating and digesting data relating to canals, water transportation, etc. Most of the Commissioners attended conventions and other meetings connected with the development of waterways and related interests.

At the 18th session a special committee of one, Gen. Alexander MacKenzie, was appointed to prepare a list of statutes and considerations relating to [[water power]], especially generation of [[hydroelectricity]]. Following action at the 23rd session, with the President presiding, a letter requesting a conference on the conservation of natural resources was framed and presented to the President on October 4, 1907; this later resulted in the first [[Conference of Governors]].  At the twenty-fifth session a committee of three was appointed to communicate further with the President on this matter, and to prepare a preliminary draft of their report; both committees reported at the fourth meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-3-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission], Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission report==
The investigations and discussions of the Inland Waterways Commission resulted in a series of 'Findings', containing their statements of fact connected with navigation and other uses of the inland waterways nationally, 'Recommendations', containing their conclusions on those findings, 'Inquiries in progress', containing certain matters still under discussion and an extensive 'Appendix'.

The '''Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences''' ('''IPM'''; {{lang-fa|پژوهشگاه دانشهای بنیادی}}), previously '''Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics''', is an advanced public research institute in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. IPM is directed by [[Mohammad Javad Larijani]], its original founder. The institute was the first Iranian organization to connect to the [[Internet]]. It is the [[domain name registry]] of [[.ir]] domain names.

The Institute’s activities are directed along several routes:
* The Institute conducts research along the lines that led to its inception, both independently and in cooperation with other research institutes inside the country and abroad.
* The Institute carries out conferences as well as joint research projects, and exchanges researchers to establish links with other research institutes and scientific communities within and outside Iran.
* The Institute provides facilities as well as financial support and opportunity for sabbaticals for researchers belonging to other institutes and universities.
* The Institute tries to provide the atmosphere necessary for attracting Iranian researchers and scientists from around the world.
* The Institute conducts graduate study programs to train researchers in areas where the Institute is interested to increase the number of manpower.
* The Institute publicizes its scientific findings of IPM through books, journals, and scientific gatherings.
* The Institute provides scientific and cultural services that fit within the framework of its activities.
* The Institute seeks to recognize the basic needs of the country in fundamental sciences.
* The Institute has established an electronic network in order to connect all scientific and research centers and to develop the corresponding technologies in Iran.

The pillars of the Institute are its Board of Governors, the Director of the Institute, and the Institute’s Scientific Council. The institute has four main campuses, all north of Tehran in the [[Farmanieh]] district, immediately south of [[Niavaran]]. It offers advanced PhD degrees in areas such as [[Mathematical Logic]] and [[Plasma Physics]] among others. At present the Institute comprises nine schools:

* School of Astronomy
* School of Biological Sciences
* School of Cognitive Sciences
* School of Computer Science
* School of Mathematics

The '''Institute of Astronomy''' ('''IoA''') is the largest of the three [[Astronomy departments in the University of Cambridge|astronomy departments]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], and one of the largest astronomy sites in the [[UK]]. Around 180 academics, postdocs, visitors and assistant staff work at the department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/history/ The Institute of Astronomy: Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031130/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/history/ |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the department is made in a number of scientific areas, including [[exoplanets]], [[star]]s, star clusters, [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[gravitational-wave astronomy]], the high-[[redshift]] universe, [[Active Galactic Nucleus|AGN]], [[galaxies]] and [[galaxy clusters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/research The Institute of Astronomy: Research]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mixture of observational astronomy, over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, computational theoretical astronomy, and analytic theoretical research.

The [[Kavli Institute for Cosmology]] is also located on the department site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/kavli/ The Institute of Astronomy: Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925074243/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/kavli/ |date=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Institute has an emphasis on ''The Universe at High Redshifts''. The [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]] are based in the Battcock Centre, a building in the same grounds.

== History ==

[[Image:IoA-Cambridge-Hoyle-Evening.jpg|thumb|right|Institute of Astronomy Hoyle Building in the evening]]

The Institute was formed in 1972 from the amalgamation of earlier institutions:
* The University Observatory, founded in 1823. Its [[Cambridge Observatory]] building now houses offices and the department library.
* The Solar Physics Observatory, which started in Cambridge in 1912. The building was partly demolished in 2008 to make way for the [[Fred_Kavli#Kavli_Institutes|Kavli Institute]] for Cosmology.
* The Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, which was created by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1967. Its building is the main departmental site (the Hoyle Building), with a lecture theatre added in 1999, and a second two-storey wing built in 2002.

== Teaching ==
The department teaches 3rd and 4th year undergraduates as part of the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]] or [[Mathematical Tripos]]. In addition, there are around 12 to 18 graduate [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and [[Master's degree|masters]] students at the department per year, mainly funded by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]]. The graduate programme is particularly unusual in the UK as the students are free to choose their own PhD supervisor or adviser from the staff at the department, and this choice is often made as late as the end of their first term.

== Telescopes ==
[[Image:Cambridge_University_Institute_of_Astronomy_observatories.jpg|thumb|Observatory buildings containing the Northumberland Telescope (left) and Thorrowgood Telescope (right) at the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge. Covered structures in the foreground are mounts for portable telescopes.]]
The Institute houses several telescopes on its site. Although some scientific work is done with the telescopes, they are mostly used for public observing and astronomical societies. The poor weather and light-pollution in Cambridge makes most modern astronomy difficult. The telescopes on the site include:
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/northumberland.telescope Northumberland Telescope] donated by the Duke of Northumberland in 1833. This is a {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} diameter refractor on an English mount.
* The smaller [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/thorrowgood.telescope Thorrowgood Telescope], on extended loan from the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. The telescope is an {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} refractor.
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/36-inch.telescope 36-inch Telescope], built in 1951.
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/three-mirror.telescope Three-Mirror Telescope], which is a prototype telescope with a unique design to have wide field of view, sharp images and all-reflection optics.

The Institute's former 24" Schmidt Camera was donated to the Spaceguard Centre in June 2009.

The Cambridge University Astronomical Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srcf.ucam.org/astronomy/ Cambridge University Astronomical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (CUAS) and Cambridge Astronomical Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caa-cya.org/ CAA Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (CAA) both regularly observe. The Institute holds public observing evenings on Wednesdays from October to March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public activities ==
[[Image:Cambridge_University_Institute_of_Astronomy_36_in_telescope.jpg|thumb|The 36-inch telescope being used for the 2011 Cambridge Astronomy Association ''Introduction to Astronomy'' course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomylog.co.uk/2008/05/19/introduction-to-astronomy-week-4/ Introduction to Astronomy – Week 4]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The department holds a number of events involving the general public in astronomy. These include/ have included:
* Open evenings on Wednesdays during the winter, from October to March, with a talk given by a member of the Institute followed by observing in clear weather &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/public_observing/ Institute of Astronomy » Public Activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Annual open day during the [[Cambridge Science Festival]]
* A monthly podcast, the '[[Astropod]]',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/astropod/ The Astropod - Institute of Astronomy Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at the general public (last published episode July 2011)
* Extra observing nights for special events such as [http://www.astronomy2009.co.uk/index.php/moonwatch-projectsmenu-53 IYA Moonwatch] and [https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/stargazing/ BBC stargazing live]

== Library ==
The Institute library is housed in the old [[Cambridge Observatory]] building.  It is a specialist library concentrating on the subjects of astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.  The collection has approximately 17,000 books and subscribes to about 80 current journals.  The Library also has a collection of rare astronomical books, many of which belonged to [[John Couch Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurn, M. "An English Astronomical Library: the case of the Cambridge Observatory" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Obs...124...37H  The Observatory, Vol. 124, No. 1178, pp. 37-46 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Among the significant contributions to astronomy made by the institute, the now decommissioned Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) machine was used to create a major catalogue of astronomical objects in the northern sky. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irwin|first=Mike|title=Overview of the APM Facility|url=http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~mike/casu/apm/apm_intro.html|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neural oscillation|synchronisation]] of [[motor unit]]s of a single muscle in animals and humans are known for decades.

'''James P. Carse''' is [[Professor Emeritus]] of history and literature of religion at [[New York University]]. His book ''[[Finite and Infinite Games]]'' was widely influential.  Although Dr. Carse may not believe in God, he describes himself as religious "in the sense that I am endlessly fascinated with the unknowability of what it means to be human, to exist at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Paulson |authorlink= |title=Religion is poetry |url=http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |agency= |work= |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=23 December 2008 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818182051/http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |archivedate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carse's recent work on religion and belief provides a foil to [[New Atheism]].  His ideas about religion and belief were featured on the May 4, 2012 [[CBC Radio]] series [[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]] titled [http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2012/05/03/after-atheism-new-perspectives-on-god-and-religion-part-4/ After Atheism: New Perspectives on God and Religion, Part 4].

He was a member of the doctoral faculty at the Graduate School and University Center of the [[City University of New York]] (GSUC).

He is the author of ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' (1978) and ''The Ordeal of Civility: Freud, Marx, Lévi-Strauss and the Jewish Struggle with Modernity'' (1974), two books in the [[sociology of religion]]. Cuddihy has been described as a "Catholic atheist,", and "a brilliant yet eccentric critic of contemporary American Jewry".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Berenbaum, ''After Tragedy and Triumph: Essays in Modern Jewish Thought and the American Experience'' (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Cuddihy received his bachelor's degree from St. John's College ([[Annapolis]]), three M.A.s: two from [[Columbia University]] and a third from the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/socio/faculty/cuddi.html Biography] at the [[Hunter College]] Department of Sociology website.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a Ph.D. in Sociology at [[Rutgers University]].

He taught courses in sociological theory, sociology of religion, and the sociology of diaspora Jewry.

== Works ==
His doctoral dissertation was later published, in 1974, as ''The Ordeal of Civility''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moma.org/research/archives/EAD/Motherwellb.html Robert Motherwell Scrapbooks in The Museum of Modern Art Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' was published in 1978.

In ''The Ordeal of Civility'', Cuddihy explicates the wrenching process of adjusting to [[modernity]] experienced by the [[shtetl]] [[Jews]] of the [[Pale of Settlement|Pale]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who had to adapt quickly from a [[tribal]] culture to a modern [[Protestant]] civil culture rather than slowly adjusting over the centuries. It is in this context that he locates the efforts of Jewish intellectuals, such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to facilitate the transition by providing a cohesive narrative that attempts to universalize the experience and thus provide an apologia to both the in-group of Jews and the out-group of [[gentiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917261,00.html Review by Richard Bernstein NYT 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cuddihy's "The Ordeal of Civility" |author=Sander L.

In ''No Offense'', a critique of American [[civil religion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/civilrel.htm Content Pages of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Social Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901214226/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/civilrel.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuddihy argues that Catholic and Jewish intellectuals in America gave up the distinctive religious claims of [[Catholicism]] and Judaism, respectively, in the interests of not offending the Protestant majority. Cuddihy views various intellectual critiques of modernity - both [[conservative]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] - as the product of [[resentment]] against the more successful, enlightened, Protestant majority.

It is based in [[Yeongdang-dong]], [[Nam-gu (Busan)|Nam-gu]], [[Busan]], with an auxiliary campus on [[Yeongdo]] island near [[Busan Port]].  Each campus includes a dormitory for trainees.

The Institute was formed in 1998 from the merger of the Korea Fishing Training Center with the Korea Maritime Training and Research Institute.  The first was established in 1965 as the Korea Deep-sea Training Institute.  In 1978, it became an independent corporation.  The research institute was founded in 1983, attached to [[Pukyong National University]].  The two were merged by an act of the [[National Assembly of South Korea]] passed in 1997.

In addition to its research work, KIMFT offers a range of professional certifications.  These include a certification in [[fish medicine]].

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''  Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

This is a list of notable [[codex|codices]]. 

For the purposes of this compilation, as in [[philology]], a "[[codex]]" is a [[manuscript]] book published from the [[late Antiquity]] period through the [[Middle Ages]]. (The majority of the books in both the [[list of manuscripts]] and [[list of illuminated manuscripts]] are codices.) More modern works that include "codex" as part of their name are not listed here. The following codices are usually named for their most famous resting-places, such as a city or library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29260">[[Engineering]] is the discipline and profession that applies [[scientific]] theories, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to design, create, and analyze technological solutions cognizant of safety, human factors, physical laws, regulations, practicality, and cost. In the [[contemporary era]], engineering is generally considered to consist of the major primary branches of [[chemical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Thompson Klein, Robert Frodeman, Carl Mitcham. ''The Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinary''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2010. (pp. 149–150)&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other engineering subdisciplines and interdisciplinary subjects that may or may not be part of these major engineering branches.

==Chemical engineering==

| [[Environmental engineering]]
| The application of engineering to the improvement and protection of the environment.
|
* [[Ecological engineering]], the design, monitoring and construction of ecosystems
* [[Fire protection engineering]], the application of engineering to protect people and environments from fire and smoke
*[[Sanitary engineering]], the application of engineering methods to improve sanitation of human communities
*[[Wastewater engineering]], Wastewater engineering is a type of engineering that comes from civil engineering and environmental engineering. A wastewater engineer determines the best way to transport or collect rainwater for human populations. Wastewater engineering also deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]] and [[irrigation]] water. Wastewater treatment and water reclamation are areas of concern in this field. Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection. They use sonar scanning in wells to determine volumes of water that can be used for human consumption. Using these types of data they are able to provide a means of collecting water. After collecting the water, it is their job to transport it to where it can be made available for use.
* [[Municipal or urban engineering]], civil engineering applied to municipal issues such as water and waste management, transportation networks, subdivisions, communications, hydrology, hydraulics, etc.

* [[Architectural engineering]], application of engineering principles to building design and construction
* [[Offshore construction|Ocean engineering]], the design of offshore structures
|-
| [[Mining engineering]]
| An engineering discipline that involves the science, technology and practice of extracting and processing minerals from a naturally occurring environment. Mining engineering is closely related to many other disciplines like mineral processing and metallurgy, geotechnical engineering and surveying. A mining engineer manages all phases of mining operations – from exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through feasibility studies, mine design, development of plans, production and operations, to mine closure.

With the process of mineral extraction some amount of waste material and other byproducts are generated which are the primary source of pollution in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the natural environment in and around which the minerals are located. Mining engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral commodities, but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

|[[Project engineering]]
|Project engineering includes all parts of the design of manufacturing or processing facilities, either new or modifications to and expansions of existing facilities. A "project" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers and designers.  A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a project manager or management team.  Project tasks typically consist of such things as  performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and developing and maintaining various lists (equipment and materials lists) and drawings (electrical, instrument and piping schematics, physical layouts and other drawings used in construction).  Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to project engineering companies.  Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed.

'''Logical positivism''' and '''logical empiricism''', which together formed '''neopositivism''', was a movement in [[Western philosophy]] whose central thesis was [[verificationism]], a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] which asserted that only statements verifiable through [[empirical]] observation are cognitively meaningful.  The movement flourished in the 1920s and 1930s in several European centers.  

Efforts to convert philosophy to this new "scientific philosophy", shared with [[empirical sciences]]' best examples, such as [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt; 

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]]—groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in Berlin and Vienna—propounded logical [[positivism]], starting in the late 1920s.

==Influences==
Logical positivists culled from [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language]] the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness.  As in [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]], whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience,&lt;ref name="dictcc"&gt;{{cite quote|url=www11.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=sensory%20experience|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; verificationists took all sciences' basic content to be only sensory experience.  And some influence came from [[Percy Bridgman]]'s musings that others proclaimed as [[operationalism]], whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions.  In verificationism, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific, and thus meaningful (or ''cognitively meaningful''), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, were meaningless "pseudostatements" (just ''emotively meaningful'').  Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.

==Definitions==
Logical positivism is sometimes stereotyped as forbidding talk of [[unobservable]]s, such as microscopic entities or such notions as causality and general principles,{{fact|date=January 2018}} but that is an exaggeration.  Rather, most neopositivists viewed talk of unobservables as [[metaphor]]ical or elliptical: direct observations phrased abstractly or indirectly.  So ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules'', and thereby ''theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws''.  Via [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[logicism]], reducing mathematics to logic, physics' mathematical formulas would be converted to [[symbolic logic]].  Via Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[natural language|ordinary language]] would break into discrete units of meaning.  [[Rational reconstruction]], then, would convert ordinary statements into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could [[deductive inference|verify]] its [[truth-value|falsity or truth]].

==Development==
In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and the United States.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], whereby science's content is not actual or potential sensations, but instead is entities publicly observable. [[Rudolf Carnap]], who had sparked logical positivism in the Vienna Circle, had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation.  Logical positivism became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated philosophy in the [[English-speaking world]], including [[philosophy of science]], while influencing sciences, but especially social sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804713016 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. In light of this dilemma, many folk—especially following Popper's "last-ditch" effort to "save" empiricism/positivism/realism with the falsifiability criterion—have agreed that positivism is a dead-end. |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its doctrines were increasingly criticized, most trenchantly by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].

==Roots==

===Language===

''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', by the young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], introduced the view of philosophy as "critique of language", offering the possibility of a theoretically principled distinction of intelligible versus nonsensical discourse.  ''Tractatus'' adhered to a [[correspondence theory of truth]] (versus a [[coherence theory of truth]]).  Wittgenstein's influence also shows in some versions of the [[verifiability principle]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, compare "Proposition 4.024" of ''Tractatus'', asserting that we understand a proposition when we know the outcome if it is true, with Schlick's asserting, "To state the circumstances under which a proposition is true is the same as stating its meaning".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Positivismus und realismus", ''Erkenntnis'' '''3''':1–31, English trans in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed, ''Logical Empiricism at its Peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1996), p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In tractarian doctrine, truths of logic are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], a view widely accepted by logical positivists who were also influenced by Wittgenstein's interpretation of [[probability]] although, according to Neurath, some logical positivists found ''Tractatus'' to contain too much metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;For summary of the effect of Tractatus on logical positivists, see the [http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/images/doc4-full.jpg Entwicklung der Thesen des "Wiener Kreises"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logicism===

[[Gottlob Frege]] began the program of reducing mathematics to logic, continued it with [[Bertrand Russell]], but lost interest in this [[logicism]], and Russell continued it with [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', inspiring some of the more mathematical logical posivists, such as [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  (Carnap's early anti-metaphysical works employed Russell's [[type theory|theory of types]].)&lt;ref&gt;See Rudolf Carnap, "The elimination Of metaphysics through logical analysis of language", ''Erkenntnis'', 1932;'''2''', reprinted in ''Logical Positivism'', Alfred Jules Ayer, ed, (New York: Free Press, 1959), pp 60–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnap envisioned a universal language that could reconstruct mathematics and thereby encode physics.&lt;ref name=Hintikka&gt;Jaako Hintikka, "Logicism", in Andrew D Irvine, ed, ''Philosophy of Mathematics'' (Burlington MA: North Holland, 2009),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=Logical+positivism+logicism pp 283–84].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]] showed this impossible except in trivial cases, and [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[undefinability theorem]] shattered all hopes of reducing mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Thus, a universal language failed to stem from Carnap's 1934 work ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'' (''Logical Syntax of Language'').&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Still, some logical positivists, including [[Carl Hempel]], continued support of logicism.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;

===Empiricism===

In Germany, [[Hegelian metaphysics]] was a dominant movement, and Hegelian successors such as [[F H Bradley]] explained reality by postulating metaphysical entities lacking empirical basis, drawing reaction in the form of positivism.&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"&gt;Frederick Suppe, "The positivist model of scientific theories", in ''Scientific Inquiry'', Robert Klee, ed, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the late 19th century, there was a "back to Kant" movement.  [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism and [[phenomenalism]] were a major influence.

==Origins==

===Vienna===

The [[Vienna Circle]], gathering around [[University of Vienna]] and [[Café Central]], was led principally by [[Moritz Schlick]].  Schlick had held a [[neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] position, but later converted, via Carnap's 1928 book ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'', that is, ''The Logical Structure of the World''.  A 1929 pamphlet written by [[Otto Neurath]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the Vienna Circle's positions.  Another member of Vienna Circle to later prove very influential was [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].  A friendly but tenacious critic of the Circle was [[Karl Popper]], whom [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] nicknamed the "Official Opposition".

[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and other [[Vienna Circle]] members, including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]], saw need for a weaker criterion of meaningfulness than verifiability.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A radical "left" wing—led by Neurath and Carnap—began the program of "liberalization of empiricism", and they also emphasized [[fallibilism]] and [[pragmatics]], which latter Carnap even suggested as empiricism's basis.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A conservative "right" wing—led by [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann|Waismann]]—rejected both the liberalization of empiricism and the epistemological nonfoundationalism of a move from [[phenomenalism]] to [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  As Neurath and somewhat Carnap posed science toward social reform, the split in Vienna Circle also reflected political views.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Berlin===

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] was led principally by [[Hans Reichenbach]].

===Rivals===

Both [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had been influenced by and sought to define logical positivism versus the neo-Kantianism of [[Ernst Cassirer]]—the then leading figure of [[Marburg school]], so called—and against [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].  Logical positivists especially opposed [[Martin Heidegger]]'s obscure metaphysics, the epitome of what logical positivism rejected.  In the early 1930s, Carnap debated Heidegger over "metaphysical pseudosentences".&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Despite its revolutionary aims, logical positivism was but one view among many vying within Europe, and logical positivists initially spoke their language.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

===Export===

As the movement's first emissary to the [[New World]], [[Moritz Schlick]] visited [[Stanford University]] in 1929, yet otherwise remained in Vienna and was murdered at the [[University of Vienna|University]], reportedly by a deranged student, in 1936.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  That year, a British attendee at some Vienna Circle meetings since 1933, [[A. J. Ayer]] saw his ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', written in English, import logical positivism to the [[English-speaking world]].  By then, the [[Nazi Party]]'s 1933 rise to power in Germany had triggered flight of intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt; In exile in England, [[Otto Neurath]] died in 1945.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], and [[Carl Hempel]]—Carnap's [[protégé]] who had studied in [[Berlin]] with Reichenbach—settled permanently in America.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Upon Germany's [[annexation of Austria]] in 1938, remaining logical positivists, many of whom were also Jewish, were targeted and continued flight.  Logical positivism thus became dominant in the English-speaking world.

==Principles==

===Analytic/synthetic gap===

Concerning [[metaphysics|reality]], the [[logical truth|necessary]] is a state true in all [[possible worlds]]—mere [[logical validity]]—whereas the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] hinges on the way the particular world is.  Concerning [[epistemology|knowledge]], the ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''[[a posteriori]]'' is knowable only after or through, relevant experience.  Concerning [[propositions|statements]], the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]]'' is true via terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]], thus a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—true by logical necessity but uninformative about the world—whereas the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]'' adds reference to a state of facts, a [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]].

In 1739, [[David Hume]] cast a [[Hume's fork|fork]] aggressively dividing "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence", such that all truths are of one type or the other.&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork "Hume's fork"], p 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen B Mitchell, ''Roots of Wisdom: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions'', 6th edn (Boston: Wadsworth, 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P6o0OUzwmSAC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=logical+positivism+Hume's+fork "Hume's fork and logical positivism"], pp 249-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By Hume's fork, truths by relations among ideas (abstract) all align on one side (analytic, necessary, ''a priori''), whereas truths by states of actualities (concrete) always align on the other side (synthetic, contingent, ''a posteriori'').&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;  At any treatises containing neither, Hume orders, "Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion".&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

Thus awakened from "dogmatic slumber", [[Immanuel Kant]] quested to answer Hume's challenge—but by explaining how [[metaphysics]] is possible.  Eventually, in his [[Critique of Pure Reason|1781 work]], Kant crossed the tines of Hume's fork to identify another range of truths by necessity—[[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']], statements claiming states of facts but known true before experience—by arriving at [[transcendental idealism]], attributing the mind a constructive role in [[phenomena]] by arranging [[sense data]] into the very experience ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance''.  Thus, Kant saved [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] from Hume's [[problem of induction]] by finding uniformity of nature to be ''a priori'' knowledge.  Logical positivists rejected Kant's [[synthetic a priori|synthethic ''a priori'']], and staked [[Hume's fork]], whereby a statement is either analytic and ''a priori'' (thus [[logical truth|necessary]] and verifiable logically) or synthetic and ''[[a posteriori]]'' (thus [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and verifiable empirically).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

===Observation/theory gap===

Early, most logical positivists proposed that all knowledge is based on logical inference from simple "protocol sentences" grounded in observable facts.  In the 1936 and 1937 papers "Testability and meaning", individual terms replace sentences as the units of meaning.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Further, theoretical terms no longer need to acquire meaning by explicit definition from observational terms: the connection may be indirect, through a system of implicit definitions.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  (Carnap also provides an important, pioneering discussion of [[disposition predicate]]s.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Cognitive meaningfulness===

====Verification====

The logical positivists' initial stance was that a statement is "cognitively meaningful" only if some finite procedure conclusively determines its truth.&lt;ref&gt;For a classic survey of other versions of verificationism, see Carl G Hempel, "Problems and changes in the empiricist criterion of meaning", ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'', 1950;'''41''':41-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this [[verifiability principle]], only statements verifiable either by their [[analytic proposition|analyticity]] or by empiricism were ''cognitively meaningful''.  [[Metaphysics]], [[ontology]], as well as much of [[ethics]] failed this criterion, and so were found ''cognitively meaningless''.  Moritz Schlick, however, did not view ethical or aesthetic statements as [[meaning (philosophy of language)|cognitively meaningless]].&lt;ref&gt;See Moritz Schlick, "The future Of philosophy", in ''The Linguistic Turn'', Richard Rorty, ed, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cognitive meaningfulness'' was variously defined: having a [[truth value]]; corresponding to a possible state of affairs; intelligible or understandable as are scientific statements.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of these different views can be found in Scheffler's ''Anatomy of Inquiry'', Ayer's ''Language, Truth, and Logic'', Schlick's "Positivism and realism" (reprinted in Sarkar 1996 and Ayer 1959), and Carnap's ''Philosophy and Logical Syntax''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] were subjective preferences, while [[theology]] and other [[metaphysics]] contained "pseudostatements", neither true nor false.  This meaningfulness was cognitive, although other types of meaningfulness—for instance, emotive, expressive, or figurative—occurred in metaphysical discourse, dismissed from further review.  Thus, logical positivism indirectly asserted [[Hume's law]], the principle that ''is'' statements cannot justify ''ought'' statements, but are separated by an unbridgeable gap.  [[A. J. Ayer]]'s 1936 book asserted an extreme variant—the [[emotivism|boo/hooray doctrine]]—whereby all evaluative judgments are but emotional reactions.

====Confirmation====

In an important pair of papers in 1936 and 1937, "Testability and meaning", Carnap replaced ''verification'' with ''confirmation'', on the view that although universal laws cannot be verified they can be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Later, Carnap employed abundant logical and mathematical methods in researching inductive logic while seeking to provide an account of probability as "degree of confirmation", but was never able to formulate a model.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap&gt;Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891—1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Carnap's inductive logic, every universal law's degree of confirmation is always zero.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap/&gt;  In any event, the precise formulation of what came to be called the "criterion of cognitive significance" took three decades (Hempel 1950, Carnap 1956, Carnap 1961).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

[[Carl Hempel]] became a major critic within the logical positivism movement.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Fetzer |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2012 |title=Carl Hempel |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2012 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hempel/#SciRea |quote=It would fall to Hempel to become perhaps the most astute critic of that movement and to contribute to its refinement as logical empiricism... Hempel himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement... The analytic/synthetic distinction and the observational/theoretical distinction were tied together by the ''verifiability criterion of meaningfulness''... By this standard, sentences that are non-analytic but also non-verifiable, including various theological or metaphysical assertions concerning God or The Absolute, qualify as cognitively meaningless. This was viewed as a desirable result. But, as Hempel would demonstrate, its scope was far too sweeping, since it also rendered meaningless the distinctively scientific assertions made by laws and theories... The analytic/synthetic distinction took a decided hit when the noted logician, Willard van Orman Quine, published "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1953), challenging its adequacy... While the analytic/synthetic distinction appears to be justifiable in modeling important properties of languages, the observational/theoretical distinction does not fare equally well. Within logical positivism, observation language was assumed to consist of names and predicates whose applicability or not can be ascertained, under suitable conditions, by means of direct observation...  Karl Popper (1965, 1968), however, would carry the argument in a different direction by looking at the ontic nature of properties... Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained. Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables. In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not. The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable... Both theoretical and dispositional predicates, which refer to non-observables, posed serious problems for the positivist position, since the verifiability criterion implies they must be reducible to observables or are empirically meaningless... The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position. At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit. Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure. Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of cognitive significance... Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the cognitive significance of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree... The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of cognitive significance and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement. Precisely what remained, however, was in doubt. Presumably, anyone who rejected one or more of the three principles defining positivism—the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of significance—was not a logical positivist. The precise outlines of its philosophical successor, which would be known as "logical empiricism", were not entirely evident. Perhaps this study came the closest to defining its intellectual core. Those who accepted Hempel's four criteria and viewed cognitive significance as a matter of degree were members, at least in spirit. But some new problems were beginning to surface with respect to Hempel's covering-law explication of explanation and old problems remained from his studies of induction, the most remarkable of which was known as "the paradox of confirmation".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hempel elucidated the [[paradox of the ravens|paradox of confirmation]].

====Weak verification====

The second edition of [[A. J. Ayer]]'s book arrived in 1946, and discerned ''strong'' versus ''weak'' forms of verification.  Ayer concluded, "A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established by experience", but is verifiable in the weak sense "if it is possible for experience to render it probable".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50&gt;Ayer, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', 1946, p 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet, "no proposition, other than a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], can possibly be anything more than a probable [[hypothesis]]".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50/&gt;  Thus, all are open to weak verification.

==Philosophy of science==

Upon the global defeat of [[Nazism]], and the removal from philosophy of rivals for radical reform—[[Marburg school|Marburg]] neo-Kantianism, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserlian]] phenomenology, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s "existential hermeneutics"—and while hosted in the climate of American [[pragmatism]] and commonsense empiricism, the neopositivists shed much of their earlier, revolutionary zeal.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt;  No longer crusading to revise traditional philosophy into a new ''scientific philosophy'', they became respectable members of a new philosophy subdiscipline, ''[[philosophy of science]]''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving support from [[Ernest Nagel]], logical empiricists were especially influential in the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Novick-p546&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA546&amp;dq=Carnap+Hempel+Nagel+social+sciences+natural+fact+value p 546].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation===

[[positivism|Comtean positivism]] had viewed science as ''description'', whereas the [[logical positivists]] posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better realize the envisioned [[unity of science]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but the [[special science]]s, too, for instance [[biology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—sec 1 "Background and introduction", in Zalta EN, ed,''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely accepted concept of scientific explanation, held even by neopositivist critic [[Karl Popper]], was the [[deductive-nomological model]] (DN model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—Article overview, Zalta EN, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet DN model received its greatest explication by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;

In the DN model, the stated phenomenon to be explained is the ''explanandum''—which can be an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas premises stated to explain it are the ''explanans''.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, ''Structure of Scientific Theories'' (U Illinois P, 1977), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619&amp;dq= pp 619–21].&lt;/ref&gt;  Explanans must be true or highly confirmed, contain at least one law, and entail the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;   Thus, given initial conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', event ''E'' is a deductive consequence and scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In the DN model, a law is an unrestricted generalization by conditional proposition—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora  Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (London &amp; New York: Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Differing from a merely true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—a law suggests what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and is consequent of a [[scientific theory]]'s [[axiom]]atic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), pp 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;)

By the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequences of events, (not cause and effect, as causality and causal mechanisms are unobservable), the DN model neglects causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]], first event ''A'' and then always event ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;  Hempel's explication of the DN model held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory and, if formulated realistically, approximating causal explanation.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended the DN model and proposed a probabilistic explanation, [[inductive-statistical model]] (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  the DN and IS models together form the ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to [[deductive-statistical model]] (DS model).)&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276], in Sarkar S &amp; Pfeifer J, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A–M (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named it ''subsumption theory'',&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4], in Manninen J &amp; Tuomela R, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding: Studies in the Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences'' (Dordrecht: D Reidel Publishing, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; fitting the ambition of theory reduction.

===Unity of science===

Logical positivists were generally committed to "[[Unified Science]]", and sought a common language or, in Neurath's phrase, a "universal slang" whereby all scientific propositions could be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of "unity of science" to, see Gregory Frost-Arnold, [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002005/01/PSA2004Short.rtf "The large-scale structure of logical empiricism: Unity of science and the rejection of metaphysics"].&lt;/ref&gt; The adequacy of proposals or fragments of proposals for such a language was often asserted on the basis of various "reductions" or "explications" of the terms of one [[special science]] to the terms of another, putatively more fundamental. Sometimes these reductions consisted of set-theoretic manipulations of a few logically primitive concepts (as in Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' (1928)).  Sometimes, these reductions consisted of allegedly analytic or ''a priori'' deductive relationships (as in Carnap's "Testability and meaning"). A number of publications over a period of thirty years would attempt to elucidate this concept.

===Theory reduction===

As in [[positivism|Comtean positivism]]'s envisioned [[unity of science]], neopositivists aimed to network all [[special science]]s through the [[covering law model|covering law model of scientific explanation]].  And ultimately, by supplying [[boundary condition]]s and supplying bridge laws within the covering law model, all the special sciences' laws would reduce to [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], the [[fundamental science]].

==Critics==

After [[World War II]], key tenets of logical positivism, including its atomistic philosophy of science, the verifiability principle, and the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], drew escalated criticism.  It was clear that empirical claims cannot be verified to be universally true.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005&gt;{{cite book |first=S |last=Sarkar |first2=J |last2=Pfeifer |year=2005 |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia |volume=1 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415939270 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as initially stated, the verifiability criterion made [[universal proposition|universal statement]]s meaningless, and even made statements beyond empiricism for technological but not conceptual reasons meaningless, which would pose significant problems for science.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-problem-of-induction"&gt;{{cite web |author=John Vicker |editor=Edward N Zalta |year=2011 |title=The problem of induction |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/induction-problem/#VerCon |quote=This initial formulation of the criterion was soon seen to be too strong; it counted as meaningless not only metaphysical statements but also statements that are clearly empirically meaningful, such as that all copper conducts electricity and, indeed, any universally quantified statement of infinite scope, as well as statements that were at the time beyond the reach of experience for technical, and not conceptual, reasons, such as that there are mountains on the back side of the moon. These difficulties led to modification of the criterion: The latter to allow empirical verification if not in fact then at least in principle, the former to soften verification to empirical confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-vienna-circle"&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Uebel |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Vienna Circle |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/vienna-circle/ |quote=What Carnap later called the "liberalization of empiricism" was underway and different camps became discernible within the Circle... In the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of universally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to salient aspects of Carnap's 1928 conception. Everybody had noted that the Wittgensteinian verificationist criterion rendered universally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus followed Wittgenstein's own suggestion to treat them instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular statements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated only in Schlick 1936a.) A second element that began to do so soon was the recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms to observation terms... A third element was that disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability or support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only, Carnap (1936-37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation of disconfirmation.&lt;br&gt;Many of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in 1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous criterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of science. While Carnap's focus on the reduction of descriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some statements, his criterion also allowed universally quantified statements to be meaningful, provided they were syntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, §2). It was not until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially declared the meaning criterion to be mere confirmability. Carnap's new criterion required neither verification nor falsification but only partial testability so as now to include not only universal statements but also the disposition statements of science... Though plausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms in this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the supposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters and analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951). Independently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all theoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base by such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for the formulation of a meaning criterion: how was one to rule out unwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly abstract scientific claims?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These problems were recognized within the movement, which hosted attempted solutions—Carnap's move to ''confirmation'', Ayer's acceptance of ''weak verification''—but the program drew sustained criticism from a number of directions by the 1950s.  Even philosophers disagreeing among themselves on which direction general [[epistemology]] ought to take, as well as on [[philosophy of science]], agreed that the logical empiricist program was untenable, and it became viewed as self-contradictory.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985&gt;{{cite book |author=Hilary Putnam |year=1985 |title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason |series=Philosophical Papers |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521313940 |lccn=lc82012903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC&amp;pg=PA184 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verifiability criterion of meaning was itself unverified.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985/&gt;  Notable critics included [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], [[J. L. Austin|J L Austin]], [[Peter Strawson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Richard Rorty]].

===Quine===

Although quite empiricist, American logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]",&lt;ref&gt;W V O Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism", ''Philosophical Review'' 1951;'''60''':20-43, collected in Quine, ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; which challenged conventional empiricist presumptions.  Quine attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]], which the verificationist program had been hinged upon in order to entail, by consequence of [[Hume's fork]], both [[logical truth|necessity]] and apriocity.  Quine's [[ontological relativity]] explained that every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  Quine later proposed [[naturalized epistemology]].

===Hanson===

In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]]'s ''Patterns of Discovery'' undermined the division of [[observation]] versus [[theory]],&lt;ref name=Novick-p527&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA527&amp;dq=Hanson p 527].&lt;/ref&gt; as one can predict, collect, prioritize, and assess data only via some horizon of expectation set by a theory.  Thus, any [[dataset]]—the direct observations, the scientific facts—is [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].

===Popper===
An early, tenacious critic was [[Karl Popper]] whose 1934 book ''Logik der Forschung'', arriving in English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', directly answered verificationism.  Popper heeded the [[problem of induction]] as rendering empirical verification logically impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Popper then denies that science requires [[inductive inference]] or that it actually exists, although most philosophers believe it exists and that science requires it [Samir Okasha, ''The Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (NY: [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2002), p 23],&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[deductive fallacy]] of [[affirming the consequent]] reveals any phenomenon's capacity to host more than one logically possible explanation.  Accepting [[scientific method]] as [[hypothetico-deductive model|hypotheticodeduction]], whose [[argument form|inference form]] is [[denying the consequent]], Popper finds scientific method unable to proceed without  [[falsifiable]] predictions.  Popper thus identifies [[falsifiability]] to [[problem of demarcation|demarcate]] not ''meaningful'' from ''[[meaningless statement|meaningless]]'' but simply ''scientific'' from  ''unscientific''—a label not in itself unfavorable.

Popper finds virtue in [[metaphysics]], required to develop new scientific theories.  And an unfalsifiable—thus unscientific, perhaps metaphysical—concept in one era can later, through evolving knowledge or technology, become falsifiable, thus scientific.  Popper also found science's quest for truth to rest on values.  Popper disparages the ''[[pseudoscientific]]'', which occurs when an unscientific theory is proclaimed true and coupled with seemingly scientific method by "testing" the unfalsifiable theory—whose predictions are confirmed by necessity—or when a scientific theory's falsifiable predictions are strongly falsified but the theory is persistently protected by "immunizing stratagems", such as the appendage of ''[[ad hoc]]'' clauses saving the theory or the recourse to increasingly speculative hypotheses shielding the theory.

Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology is [[falsificationism]], which finds that no number, degree, and variety of empirical successes can either verify or confirm scientific theory.  Falsificationism finds science's aim as ''corroboration'' of scientific theory, which strives for [[scientific realism]] but accepts the maximal status of strongly corroborated [[verisimilitude]] ("truthlikeness").  Explicitly denying the positivist view that all knowledge is scientific, Popper developed the ''general'' epistemology [[critical rationalism]], which finds human knowledge to evolve by ''conjectures and refutations''.  Popper thus acknowledged the value of the positivist movement, driving evolution of human understanding, but claimed that he had "killed positivism".

===Kuhn===

With his landmark, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] critically destabilized the verificationist program, which was presumed to call for [[foundationalism]].  (Actually, even in the 1930s, [[Otto Neurath]] had argued for nonfoundationalism via [[coherentism]] by likening science to a boat ([[Neurathian bootstrap|Neurath's boat]]) that scientists must rebuild at sea.&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Although Kuhn's thesis itself was attacked even by opponents of neopositivism, in the 1970 postscript to ''Structure'', Kuhn asserted, at least, that there was no [[algorithm]] to science—and, on that, even most of Kuhn's critics agreed.

Powerful and persuasive, Kuhn's book, unlike the vocabulary and symbols of logic's [[formal language]], was written in [[natural language]] open to the layperson.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Ironically, Kuhn's book was first published in a volume of ''Encyclopedia of Unified Science''—a project begun by logical positivists—and some sense unified science, indeed, but by bringing it into the realm of historical and social assessment, rather than fitting it to the model of physics.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Kuhn's ideas were rapidly adopted by scholars in disciplines well outside natural sciences,&lt;ref name=Novick-p526&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=Kuhn's+logical+Unified pp 526-27].&lt;/ref&gt; and, as logical empiricists were extremely influential in the [[social science]]s,&lt;ref name=Novick-p546/&gt; ushered academia into [[postpositivism]] or postempiricism.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;

===Putnam===

The "[[Received view of theories|received view]]" operates on the ''correspondence rule'' that states, "The observational terms are taken as referring to specified phenomena or phenomenal properties, and the only interpretation given to the theoretical terms is their explicit definition provided by the correspondence rules".&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"/&gt;  According to [[Hilary Putnam]], a former student of [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] and of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], the dichotomy of observational terms versus theoretical terms introduced a problem within scientific discussion that was nonexistent until this dichotomy was stated by logical positivists.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "Problems with the observational/theoretical distinction", in ''Scientific Inquiry,'' Robert Klee, ed (New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam's four objections:

# Something is referred to as "observational" if it is observable directly with our senses. Then an observation term cannot be applied to something unobservable. If this is the case, there are no observation terms.
# With Carnap's classification, some unobservable terms are not even theoretical and belong to neither observation terms nor theoretical terms. Some theoretical terms refer primarily to observation terms.
# Reports of observation terms frequently contain theoretical terms.
# A scientific theory may not contain any theoretical terms (an example of this is Darwin's original theory of evolution).

Putnam also alleged that positivism was actually a form of [[idealism|metaphysical idealism]] by its rejecting scientific theory's ability to garner knowledge about nature's unobservable aspects.  With his "no miracles" argument, posed in 1974, Putnam asserted [[scientific realism]], the stance that science achieves true—or approximately true—knowledge of the world as it exists independently of humans' sensory experience.  In this, Putnam opposed not only the positivism but other [[instrumentalism]]—whereby scientific theory is but a human tool to predict human observations—filling the void left by positivism's decline.

==Retrospect==

By the late 1960s, logical positivism had become exhausted.&lt;ref name="Fotionarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas G Fotion |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=508 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviewed in the late 1970s, [[A. J. Ayer]] supposed that "the most important" defect "was that nearly all of it was false".&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cnRJGs08hE |title=Ayer on Logical Positivism: Section 4 |at=6:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some laughter, he says that "it was true in spirit."  Although logical positivism tends to be recalled as a pillar of [[scientism]],&lt;ref name=Stahl-etal-p180&gt;Stahl ''et al'', ''Webs of Reality'' (Rutgers U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6i84rSKMcC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=metaphysical+naturalism+logical+positivism+materialism+scientific+scientism p 180].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Hempel]] was key in establishing the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]]&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper]] brought in the era of [[postpositivism]].&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  [[John Passmore]] found logical positivism to be "dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes".&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical positivism's fall reopened debate over the metaphysical merit of scientific theory, whether it can offer knowledge of the world beyond human experience ([[scientific realism]]) versus whether it is but a human tool to predict human experience ([[instrumentalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "What is realism?", in Jarrett Leplin, ed, ''Scientific Realism'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zhBeVFm8WuAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Realism+realists+positivism+opera-tionalism p 140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lane, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692896008003003 "Positivism, scientific realism and political science: Recent developments in the philosophy of science"], ''Journal of Theoretical Politics'', 1996 Jul'''8'''(3):361-82, abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, it became popular among philosophers to rehash the faults and failures of logical positivism without investigation of it.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p1&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=half+centry+bogeyman+faults+failings+dispassionate p 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereby, logical positivism has been generally misrepresented, sometimes severely.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2/&gt;  Arguing for their own views, often framed versus logical positivism, many philosophers have reduced logical positivism to simplisms and stereotypes, especially the notion of logical positivism as a type of [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=clear+critics+agendas+foundationalism p 2].&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, the movement helped anchor [[analytic philosophy]] in the [[English-speaking world]], and returned Britain to [[empiricism]].  Without the logical positivists, who have been tremendously influential outside philosophy, especially in [[psychology]] and social [[sciences]], intellectual life of the 20th century would be unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

{{Software development process}}
'''Model-driven engineering''' ('''MDE''') is a [[software development methodology]] that focuses on creating and exploiting [[domain model]]s, which are conceptual models of all the topics related to a specific problem. Hence, it highlights and aims at [[Representation (mathematics)|abstract representations]] of the [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] and activities that govern a particular [[problem domain|application domain]], rather than the computing (i.e. algorithmic) concepts.

== Overview ==
The MDE approach is meant to increase productivity by maximizing compatibility between systems (via reuse of standardized models), simplifying the process of design (via models of recurring [[design patterns]] in the application domain), and promoting communication between individuals and teams working on the system (via a standardization of the terminology and the [[best practice]]s used in the application domain).

A modeling paradigm for MDE is considered effective if its models make sense from the point of view of a user that is familiar with the domain, and if they can serve as a basis for implementing systems. The models are developed through extensive communication among product managers, designers, developers and users of the application domain. As the models approach completion, they enable the development of software and systems.

Some of the better known MDE initiatives are:
* The [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) initiative [[Model-Driven Architecture]] (MDA) which is leveraged by several of their standards such as [[Meta-Object Facility]], [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]], [[Common Warehouse Metamodel|CWM]], [[CORBA]], [[Unified Modeling Language]] (to be more precise, the OMG currently promotes the use of a subset of UML called [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|fUML]] together with its action language, [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|ALF]], for model-driven architecture; a former approach relied on Executable UML and [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]], instead), and [[QVT]].&lt;ref name="omgtm"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Object Management Group]]|title=OMG Trademarks|url=http://www.omg.org/legal/tm_list.htm|accessdate=2008-02-26|date=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] "eco-system" of programming and modelling tools represented in general terms by the ([[Eclipse Modeling Framework]]). This framework allows the creation of tools implementing the MDA standards of the OMG; but, it is also possible to use it to implement other modeling-related tools.

== History ==
The first tools to support MDE were the Computer-Aided Software Engineering ([[Computer Aided Software Engineering|CASE]]) tools developed in the 1980s. Companies like Integrated Development Environments (IDE - StP), Higher Order Software (now Hamilton Technologies, Inc., HTI), Cadre Technologies, [[Charles Bachman#Bachman Information Systems|Bachman Information Systems]], and [[Logic Works]] (BP-Win and ER-Win) were pioneers in the field.

The US government got involved in the modeling definitions creating the [[IDEF]] specifications. With several variations of the modeling definitions (see [[Booch method|Booch]], [[Object-modeling technique|Rumbaugh]], [[Object-oriented software engineering|Jacobson]], Gane and Sarson, [[State diagram#Harel statechart|Harel]], [[Shlaer-Mellor|Shlaer and Mellor]], and others) they were eventually joined creating the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML). [[Rational Rose]], a product for UML implementation, was done by Rational Corporation (Booch) responding automation yield higher levels of abstraction in software development. This abstraction promotes simpler models with a greater focus on problem space. Combined with executable semantics this elevates the total level of automation possible. The [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) has developed a set of standards called [[model-driven architecture]] (MDA), building a foundation for this advanced architecture-focused approach.

According to [[Douglas C. Schmidt]], model-driven engineering technologies offer a promising approach to address the inability of third-generation languages to alleviate the complexity of platforms and express domain concepts effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=D.C.|title=Model-Driven Engineering|journal=[[IEEE Computer]]|volume=39|issue=2|date=February 2006|url=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/GEI.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-16}}, ''"A promising approach to address platform complexity&amp;mdash;and the inability of third-generation languages to alleviate this complexity and express domain concepts effectively&amp;mdash;is to develop Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS)''', often known as the '''Social Science Association''', was a British reformist group founded in 1857 by [[Lord Brougham]]. It pursued issues in [[public health]], [[industrial relations]], [[penal reform]], and [[female education]]. It was dissolved in 1886.&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=39463|title=Hastings, George Woodyatt|first=Lawrence|last=Goldman|authorlink=Lawrence Goldman|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Social Science Congress 1879.jpg|thumb|The Social Science Congress 1879, illustration from ''[[The Graphic]]'']]
The efforts of [[George Hastings (MP for East Worcestershire)|George Hastings]] brought together three groups of the 1850s to form the NAPSS: the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the National Reformatory Union, and the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (the Langham Place Group).&lt;ref name="Hastings"/&gt; It took as model the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], holding an itinerant annual meeting, which provided a forum for social reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Martineau|author2=Fanny Wedgewood|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgewood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1146-3|page=171 note 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Association was defined as "to coordinate the efforts of the experts and the politicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Griffin|title=The Politics of Gender in Victorian Britain: Masculinity, Political Culture and the Struggle for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnnyrckKqQC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01507-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in the eventual decline of the NSPSS was that the objectives of medical reformers changed. Legislation and the efforts of central government to improve public health became less important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Goldman|title=Science, Reform, and Politics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=io2nB6RcaIwC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43301-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)''' is located on the campus of [[Michigan State University]] and is the leading [[isotope|rare isotope]] research facility in the United States.&lt;ref name=Bruns&gt;Bruns, Adam (January 2009).[http://www.siteselection.com/features/2009/jan/Michigan/ How Are You Helping Companies Grow?].''Site Selection Magazine''.Retrieved on December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1963, the [[cyclotron]] laboratory is the nation’s largest nuclear science facility on a university campus.&lt;ref name="The National Science Foundation"&gt;[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/oct2606/nsclFunds.html The National Science Foundation (NSF)] 4/10/2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128154747/http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/oct2606/nsclFunds.html |date=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and MSU, the NSCL operates two superconducting cyclotrons. The lab’s scientists investigate the properties of rare isotopes and [[nuclear reactions]]. In nature, these reactions would take place in [[star]]s and exploding stellar environments such as [[nova]]e and [[supernovae]]. The K1200 cyclotron is the highest-energy continuous beam accelerator in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2007/pdf/fy2007.pdf |title=FY 2007 Budget Request to Congress |accessdate=2008-07-21 |author=National Science Foundation |date=2006-02-06 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the laboratory's primary goal is to understand the mysteries that reside at the center of [[atoms]], in [[atomic nuclei]]. Atomic nuclei are ten thousand times smaller than the atoms they reside in, but they contain nearly all the atom’s mass (more than 99.9 percent).&lt;ref name="The National Science Foundation" /&gt;
Many of the atomic nuclei found on earth are stable atomically. But there are many unstable and rare isotopes that exist in the universe, sometimes only for a fleeting moment inside "cosmic cauldrons." Scientists at the NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research. They make and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on earth—where they have long decayed into the known, stable or long-lived isotopes.
Rare isotope research is essential for understanding how the elements—and ultimately the universe—were formed.

Today, approximately 10 percent of U.S. nuclear science Ph.D.s are educated at NSCL. The nuclear physics graduate program at MSU is ranked best in America by the

==Laboratory  upgrades==

The upgrade plans are in close alignment with a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081130140534/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/RISAC.html report] issued December 2006 by the National Academies, "Scientific Opportunities with a Rare-Isotope Facility in the United States," which defines a scientific agenda for a U.S.-based rare-isotope facility and addresses the need for such a facility in context of international efforts in this area. Now, NSCL is planning for a significant capability upgrade that will keep the laboratory – and nuclear science – at the cutting edge well into the 21st century.

The proposed upgrade of NSCL – the $550 million [[Facility for Rare Isotope Beams]] (FRIB) – will boost intensities and varieties of rare isotope beams produced at MSU by replacing the K500 and K1200 cyclotrons with a powerful linear accelerator to be built beneath the ground. Such beams will allow researchers and students to continue to address a host of questions at the intellectual frontier of nuclear science: How does the behavior of novel and short-lived nuclei differ from more stable nuclei? What is the nature of nuclear processes in explosive stellar environments? What is the structure of hot nuclear matter at abnormal densities?

[[File:MSU Cyclotron.jpg|left|thumb|300 px|The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.]]

Beyond basic research, FRIB may lead to cross-disciplinary benefits. Experiments there will help astronomers better interpret data from ground- and space-based observatories. Scientists at the Isotope Science Facility will contribute to research on self-organization and complexity arising from elementary interactions, a topic relevant to the life sciences and quantum computing. Additionally, the facility's capabilities may lead to advances in fields as diverse as biomedicine, materials science, national and international security, and nuclear energy.

==Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics==
The [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics]] (JINA) is a collaboration between Michigan State University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Chicago to address a broad range of experimental, theoretical, and observational questions in nuclear astrophysics.  A portion of the Michigan State collaboration is housed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, directly involving roughly 30 nuclear physicists and astrophysicists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jinaweb.org/ JINA-CEE, Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">In the mathematical field of [[computability theory]], a '''PA degree''' is a [[Turing degree]] that computes a complete extension of [[Peano arithmetic]]&amp;nbsp;(Jockusch&amp;nbsp;1987). These degrees are closely related to fixed-point-free (DNR) functions, and have been thoroughly investigated in recursion theory.

== Background ==

In recursion theory, &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[computable function]] with index (program) ''e'' in some standard numbering of computable functions, and &lt;math&gt;\phi^B_e&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''e''th computable function using a set ''B'' of natural numbers as an oracle.

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is [[Turing reducibility|Turing reducible]] to a set ''B'' if there is a [[computable function]] that, given an oracle for set ''B'', computes the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of the set ''A''. That is,  there is an ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;\chi_A = \phi^B_e&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship is denoted ''A'' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''B''; the relation &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[preorder]].

Two sets of natural numbers are [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] if each is Turing reducible to the other. The notation ''A'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''B'' indicates ''A'' and ''B'' are Turing equivalent. The relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is an equivalence relation known as Turing equivalence. A [[Turing degree]] is a collection of sets of natural numbers, such that any two sets in the collection are Turing equivalent. Equivalently, a Turing degree is an equivalence class of the relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Turing degrees are [[partial order|partially ordered]] by Turing reducibility. The notation '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' indicates there is a set in degree '''b''' that computes a set in degree '''a'''. Equivalently, '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' holds if and only if every set in '''b''' computes every set in '''a'''.

A function ''f'' from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is said to be diagonally nonrecursive (DNR) if, for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;f(n) \not = \phi_n(n)&lt;/math&gt; (here inequality holds by definition if &lt;math&gt;\phi_n(n)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined).  If the range of ''f'' is the set {0,1} then ''f'' is a DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function. It is known that there are DNR functions that do not compute any DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function.

== Completions of Peano arithmetic ==

A completion of [[Peano arithmetic]] is a set of formulas in the language of Peano arithmetic, such that the set is consistent in first-order logic and such that, for each formula, either that formula or its negation is included in the set. Once a Gödel numbering of the formulas in the language of PA has been fixed, it is possible to identify completions of PA with sets of natural numbers, and thus to speak about the computability of these completions.

A Turing degree is defined to be a '''PA degree''' if there is a set of natural numbers in the degree that computes a completion of Peano Arithmetic. (This is equivalent to the proposition that every set in the degree computes a completion of PA.) Because there are no computable completions of PA, the degree '''0''' consisting of the computable sets of natural numbers is not a PA degree.

Because PA is an effective first-order theory, the completions of PA can be characterized as the infinite paths through a particular computable subtree of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the PA degrees are exactly the degrees that compute an infinite path through this tree.

== Properties ==

The PA degrees are upward closed in the Turing degrees: if '''a''' is a PA degree and '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' then '''b''' is a PA degree.

The Turing degree '''0'''‘, which is the degree of the [[halting problem]], is a PA degree. There are also PA degrees that are not above '''0'''‘. For example, the [[low basis theorem]] implies that there is a low PA degree.  On the other hand, [[Antonín Kučera]] has proved that there is a degree less than '''0'''‘ that computes a DNR function but is not a PA degree (Jockusch&amp;nbsp;1989:197).

[[Carl Jockusch]] and [[Robert Soare]]&amp;nbsp;(1972) proved that the PA degrees are exactly the degrees of DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions.

By definition, a degree is PA if and only if it computes a path through the tree of completions of Peano arithmetic. A stronger property holds: a degree '''a''' is a PA degree if and only if '''a''' computes a path through ''every'' infinite computable subtree of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Simpson&amp;nbsp;1977).

Participatory sensing can be used to retrieve information about the environment, weather, urban mobility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Xiao-Feng Xie |author2=Zun-Jing Wang.  |last-author-amp=yes | title=[http://www.wiomax.com/team/xie/paper/TRB15LBSN.pdf An empirical study of combining participatory and physical sensing to better understand and improve urban mobility networks]. |booktitle= Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting | location= Washington, DC, USA |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] as well as any other sensory information that collectively forms knowledge.

Such open communication systems could pose challenges to the veracity of transmitted information.  Individual sensors may require a trusted platform &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Towards trustworthy participatory sensing | accessdate=May 29, 2012 |author1=Akshay Dua |author2=Nirupama Bulusu |author3=Wu-Chang Feng |author4=Wen Hu.  |last-author-amp=yes | booktitle=In Proceedings of the 4th USENIX conference on Hot topics in security | year=2009 | conference=HotSec'09 | location=USENIX Association, Berkeley, CA, USA, | pages=8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hierarchical trust structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=oolView: stream privacy for grassroots participatory sensing |author1=Raghu K.

'''Patient education''' is the process by which [[health professional]]s and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|title=iv. Patient Education and Counseling for Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064558/http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training.

[[Health education]] is also a tool used by [[managed care]] plans, and may include both general [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] education or [[health promotion]] and disease or condition specific education.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved.It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. 

The value of patient education can be summarized as follows:
*Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability.
*Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition.
*Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them.
*Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply.
*Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications.
*Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need.
*Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits.
*Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krames.com Krames Patient Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient-education.com/?p=editorial&amp;s=xplainresearch&amp;ver=~2 Patient Education Institute, Research evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competencies of a [[health educator]] include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastable|first=Susan B.|title=Health Professionals as Educator|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Learning, LLC|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others.
*Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care.
*Practice preventative health care.
*Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families.
*Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care.
*Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society.
*Use technology appropriately and effectively.
*Be current in the field and continue to advance education.
There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment.
* For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantera|first=E.|last2=Pourtier-Piotte|first2=C.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=L.|last4=Coudeyre|first4=E.|title=Patient education after amputation: Systematic review and experts’ opinions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877065714000165|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=143–158|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving  overall patient health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zangi|first=Heidi A.|last2=Ndosi|first2=Mwidimi|last3=Adams|first3=Jo|last4=Andersen|first4=Lena|last5=Bode|first5=Christina|last6=Boström|first6=Carina|last7=Eijk-Hustings|first7=Yvonne van|last8=Gossec|first8=Laure|last9=Korandová|first9=Jana|date=2015-06-01|title=EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/954|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=954–962|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206807|issn=1468-2060|pmid=25735643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies in primate cognition==

===Theory of mind===
Premack and Woodruff's 1978 article "Does the chimpanzee have a [[theory of mind]]?" sparked a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]], of the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], or of particular thoughts.

Non-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species which we do not yet describe as "minded" at all, and about whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities.

For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.

There has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from which to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the "knower." By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | pmid = 11170704 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.

Tomasello and like-minded colleagues who originally argued that great apes did not have theory of mind have since reversed their position. Povinelli and his colleagues, however, maintain that Tomasello's group has misinterpreted the results of their experiments. They point out that most evidence in support of great ape theory of mind involves naturalistic settings to which the apes may have already adapted through past learning. Their "reinterpretation hypothesis" explains away all current evidence supporting attribution of mental states to others in chimpanzees as merely evidence of risk-based learning; that is, the chimpanzees learn through experience that certain behaviors in other chimpanzees have a probability of leading to certain responses, without necessarily attributing knowledge or other intentional states to those other chimpanzees. They therefore propose testing theory of mind abilities in great apes in novel, and not naturalistic settings. Kristin Andrews takes the reinterpretation hypothesis one step further, arguing that it implies that even the well-known [[Sally–Anne test|false-belief test]] used to test children's theory of mind is susceptible to being interpreted as a result of learning.

===Language===
The modelling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research. There have been many examples of modelling of human language through entrainment in primates. Most notably are [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee; [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla and [[Kanzi]], a bonobo.  Cognitive abilities are also demonstrated through the natural communication through vocalizations performed by non-human primates in the wild, with sophisticated systems of alarm calls and emotional vocalizations as well as adaptive behavioural responses to other animal's calls. 

==== '''Modeling of Human Language'''[edit] ====
The experiment called Project Nim was one of the first experiments that aimed to show nonhuman primates could be taught a human form of language. The experiment conducted on the chimpanzee dubbed "[[Nim Chimpsky]]" took place in the 1970's and was the idea of [[Herbert S. Terrace|Herbet S. Terrace]], to try to disprove the notion put forth by [[Noam Chomsky|Naom Chomsky]], for whom the chimp was named, stating that language is an exclusively human ability. Nim was taught 125 signs in his life, and constantly impressed those he met with his ability to seemingly understand human nature and his mischievous behaviours. Similar experiments took place on two other primates, Koko and Kanzi. Koko was able to learn many signs, as well as some novel vocalizations to indicate emotional state.  Kanzi learned to model human language in an entirely different way. He was able to learn 348 geometrical symbols that represented different words, and to combine symbols in a type of proto-grammar to convey meaning and understanding. His keepers also claim that he understands the meaning of up to 3000 human words.  These examples of stunning cognition demonstrate the near-human ability of some trained primates to learn and retain the ability to communicate with humans.

==== '''Communication in the Wild'''[edit] ====
Communication of animals in the wild has been studied extensively. Calls with specific intent, such as alarm calls or mating calls has been observed in many orders of animals, including primates.  A study done on East African [[Vervet monkey|Vervet monkeys]] showed that in the wild this species was able to produce at least 5 acoustically different alarm calls in response to danger, and that other monkeys responded differently according to which alarm had been sounded. This indicated a clear communication that there is a predator nearby and what kind of predator it is, eliciting a specific response.  A different species of monkeys, the wild Campbell's monkeys have also been known to produce a sequence of vocalization that require a specific order to elicit a specific behaviour in other monkeys. Changing the order of the sounds changes the resulting behaviour, or meaning, of the call.  [[Diana monkey|Diana monkeys]] were studied in a habituation-dishabituation experiment that demonstrated the ability to attend to the semantic content of calls rather than simply to acoustic nature.  Primates have also been observed responding to alarm calls of other species. [[Crested guineafowl|Crested Guinea fowl]], a ground-dwelling fowl, produce a single type of alarm call for all predators it detects. Diana monkeys have been observed to respond to the most likely reason for the call, typically a human or leopard, based on the situation and respond according to that. If they deem a leopard is the more likely predator in the vicinity they will produce their own leopard-specific alarm call but if they think it is a human, they will remain silent and hidden. 

===Tool use===
{{further|Tool use by animals#Primates}}
[[File:Gorrila tool use-Efi.jpg|thumb|Tool use by a gorilla]]
There are many reports of primates making or using tools, both in the wild or when captive. [[Chimpanzees]], [[orangutans]], [[gorillas]], [[capuchin monkeys]], [[baboons]], and [[mandrills]] have all been reported as using tools. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7922109.stm Chimpanzee making and using a termite "fishing rod"]&lt;/ref&gt; fish), collecting honey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7949335.stm Chimpanzee using tool to break into beehive to get honey]&lt;/ref&gt; processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.

Tool making is much rarer, but has been documented in orangutans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Schaik | first1 = C. | last2 = Fox | first2 = E. | last3 = Sitompul | first3 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 186–188 | doi=10.1007/s001140050271}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonobo|bonobos]] and [[bearded capuchin]] monkeys. Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the [[Fongoli]] [[savannah]] sharpen sticks to use as [[spear]]s when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070223/NEWS/702230385/-1/NEWS04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070222-chimps-spears.html Chimps Use "Spears" to Hunt Mammals, Study Says&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Captive gorillas have made a variety of tools.&lt;ref name="Vancatova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/therevealed/comments/_zprava/488947|author=Vancatova, M.|title=Gorillas and Tools - Part I|year=2008|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, mandrills have been observed to clean their ears with modified tools.  Scientists filmed a large male mandrill at [[Chester Zoo]] (UK) stripping down a twig, apparently to make it narrower, and then using the modified stick to scrape dirt from underneath its toenails.&lt;ref name="Gill2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14227783 | title = Mandrill monkey makes 'pedicuring' tool | first = Victoria | last = Gill | publisher = BBC | date = 22 July 2011 | accessdate = 11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14227783 Mandrill using a tool to clean under its nails]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some controversy over whether tool use represents a higher level of physical cognition. Some studies suggest primates could use tools due to environmental or motivational clues, rather than an understanding of [[folk physics]] or a capacity for future planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Tool use and physical cognition in birds and mammals | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 27–33 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
In 1913, [[Wolfgang Köhler]] started writing a book on problem solving titled ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917). In this research, Köhler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.

Köhler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through [[trial-and-error]] (which American psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his [[law of effect]]), but rather that they had experienced an [[insight]] (sometimes known as the [[Eureka effect]] or an "aha" experience), in which, having realized the answer, they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in Köhler's words, "unwaveringly purposeful."

===Asking questions and giving negative answers===
In the 1970s and the 1980s there had been suggestions that apes are unable to ask questions and to give negative answers.  According to numerous published studies, apes are able to answer human questions, and the vocabulary of the acculturated apes contains question words.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace, H. S. 1980. ''Nim''. London: Eyre Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R. A. and B.  T. Gardner. (1998) ''The structure of learning: From sign stimuli to sign language''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David. (1976) ''Language and intelligence in ape and man''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rumbaugh, D. M., and T. V. Gill. (1977) "Use of 'Stock' sentences for other than the originally intended purpose." In ''Language learning by a chimpanzee. The Lana project''. Edited by Duane M. Rumbaugh, pp. 172-192. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, F., and E. Linden. (1981) ''The education of Koko''. New York: Holt, Renchart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these abilities, according to the published research literature, apes are not able to ask questions themselves, and in human-primate conversations questions are asked by the humans only. Ann and David Premacks designed a potentially promising methodology to teach apes to ask questions in the 1970s: "In principle interrogation can be taught either by removing an element from a familiar situation in the animal's world or by removing the element from a language that maps the animal's world. It is probable that one can induce questions by purposefully removing key elements from a familiar situation. Suppose a chimpanzee received its daily ration of food at a specific time and place, and then one day the food was not there. A chimpanzee trained in the interrogative might inquire "Where is my food?" or, in Sarah's case, "My food is?" Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce such interrogation because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions".&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1972) "[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/terrace/w1001/readings/premack.pdf Teaching language to an ape]."  ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 227, No. 4.  W. H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later Premacks wrote: "Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions—unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else".&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1983) ''The mind of an ape''. New York, London: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. Pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all their achievements, Kanzi and Panbanisha also have not demonstrated the ability to ask questions so far. [[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the ability to ask [[question]]s could be the crucial cognitive threshold between [[human]] and other [[ape]] mental abilities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jordania, ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]'', Logos, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania suggested that asking questions is not a matter of the ability of using syntactic structures, that it is primarily a matter of cognitive ability.

==''g'' factor of intelligence in primates==

{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}

The general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual’s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reader | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Hager | first2 = Y. | last3 = Laland | first3 = K. N. | year = 2011 | title = The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 366 | issue = 1567| pages = 1017–1027 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0342| pmc = 3049098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primates]] in particular have been the focus of ''g'' research due to their close [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] links to humans. A [[Principal Components Analysis]] run in a [[meta-analysis]] of 4000 primate behaviour papers including 62 species found that 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability tests was accounted for by a single  factor, controlling for socio-ecological variables.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; This value fits within the accepted range of the influence of ''g'' on [[IQ]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamphaus, R. W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate as to the influence of ''g'' on all primates equally. A 2012 study identifying individual chimpanzees that consistently performed highly on cognitive tasks found clusters of abilities instead of a general factor of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herrmann | first1 = E. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | year = 2012 | title = Are there geniuses among the apes? | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 367 | issue = 1603| pages = 2753–2761 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2012.0191| pmc = 3427546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study used individual-based data and claim that their results are not directly comparable to previous studies using group data that have found evidence for ''g''. Further research is required to identify the exact nature of ''g'' in primates.

The '''sea surface microlayer''' (SML) is the top 1000 micrometers (or 1 millimeter) of the ocean surface.  It is the boundary layer where all exchange occurs between the [[atmosphere]] and the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name="liss"&gt;Liss, P.S., Duce, R.A., 1997. The Sea Surface and Global Change. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical, physical, and biological properties of the SML differ greatly from the sub-surface water just a few centimeters beneath.&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;Zhang, Zhengbin et al. (2003). Studies on the sea surface microlayer II. The layer of sudden change of physical and chemical properties. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 264, 148-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of Properties ==
Organic compounds such as [[amino acids]], [[carbohydrates]], [[fatty acids]], and [[phenols]] are highly enriched in the SML interface.  Most of these come from [[biota (ecology)|biota]] in the sub-surface waters, which decay and become transported to the surface,&lt;ref name="aller"&gt;Aller, J., Kuznetsova, M., Jahns, C., Kemp, P.

Dissolved Organic Materials in Surface Microlayers: Temporal and Spatial Variability and Relation to Sea State. Limnology and Oceanography, 28.3. 415-431&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources exist also such as [[atmospheric deposition]], coastal [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and anthropogenic nutrification.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;  The relative concentration of these compounds is dependent on the nutrient sources as well as [[climate]] conditions such as [[wind speed]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref name="carlson-1983"/&gt; These [[organic compounds]] on the surface create a "film," referred to as a "slick" when visible,&lt;ref name="zhang"/&gt; which affects the physical and optical properties of the interface. These films occur because of the [[hydrophobic]] tendencies of many organic compounds, which causes them to protrude into the air-interface.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson-1982"&gt;Carlson, David J. (1982). Surface microlayer phenolic enrichments indicate sea surface slicks. Nature. 296.1. 426-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of organic [[surfactants]] on the ocean surface impedes wave formation for low wind speeds.  For increasing concentrations of surfactant there is an increasing critical wind speed necessary to create ocean waves.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zhang"/&gt;  Increased levels of organic compounds at the surface also hinders air-sea gas exchange at low wind speeds.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;Woodcock, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23746">'''Sensory stimulation therapy''' ('''SST''') is an experimental therapy that aims to utilize [[Brain plasticity|neural plasticity mechanisms]] to aid in the recovery of [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] function after [[stroke]] or [[Aging brain|cognitive ageing]]. [[Stroke]] and [[Aging brain|cognitive ageing]] are well known sources of cognitive loss, the former by [[Programmed cell death|neuronal death]], the later by weakening of [[Synaptogenesis|neural connections]]. As SS implies a patient will have a desired sense stimulated in a predetermined fashion at a known frequency. It has been found that this technique can be used to reduce as much as 30 years of cognitive ageing, and can both improve [[Two-point discrimination|two point discrimination thresholds]] and also impair them.

==History and motivation==
By 2025, it is estimated that 34 million people in the United States will have dementia. It is extremely important, then, that we establish an effective treatment for people with such symptoms to either reduce, or diminish dementia altogether. In modern-day treatment not involving pharmacological treatment, psychosocial therapies are a great intervention. With psychosocial therapies such as massage, aromatherapy, multi-sensory stimulation, music therapy, and reality orientation, treatment of dementia and dementia related diseases has become possible in a less traditional yet non-pharmacological form.&lt;ref name="Boote Lewin 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Boote| first1=Jonathan| last2=Lewin| first2=Vincent| last3=Beverley| first3=Catherine| last4=Bates|first4=Jane|title=Psychosocial interventions for people with moderate to severe dementia: A systematic review|journal=Clinical Effectiveness in Nursing| volume=9| year=2006| pages=e1–e15| issn=1361-9004| doi=10.1016/j.cein.2006.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once believed that the brain was largely unchanging and that its function was decided at a young age.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Norman Doidge |title=The brain that changes itself: stories of personal triumph from the frontiers of brain science |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-670-03830-X |oclc=71189897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along this train of thought, cognitive loss from strokes and ageing were viewed as unrecoverable. [[Functional specialization (brain)|Functional Localization]] is a theory which suggests that each section of the brain has a specific function, and that loss of a section equates to permanent loss of function. [[Lateralization of brain function|Traditional models]] even specialize between hemispheres of the brain and describe "artistic and logical sections of the brain." This fatalistic outlook has been dramatically challenged by the recent paradigm of [[Neuroplasticity|Brain Plasticity]].

Brain plasticity refers to the ability of the brain to restructure itself, form new connections, or adjust the strength of existing connections.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhang X |author2=Poo MM |title=Progress in neural plasticity |journal=Science China Life Sciences |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=322–9 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20596926 |doi=10.1007/s11427-010-0062-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current paradigm allow for conceptualization of brain that is capable of change. Various researchers are using this concept to develop new therapies for conditions that were previously viewed as permanent; for example [[Paul Bach-y-Rita]] has worked on devices to give sight to blind individuals, and alleviate a feeling of falling in a patient that has lost function of the [[Vestibular system|vestibular apparatus]].

It has been found that many senses have some plastic nature about them. Even auditory cognition has been shown to have some potential for recovery after stroke. A recent study by Sarkamo ''et al.'' has shown that listening to music and audio books during early recovery from stroke can result in improved cognition.&lt;ref name="Särkämö 2010"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Särkämö T, Pihko E, Laitinen S, etal |title=Music and speech listening enhance the recovery of early sensory processing after stroke |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=2716–27 |date=December 2010 |pmid=19925203 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21376 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This paradigm has opened doors into the previously believed to be impossible; recovery from strokes, reduced cognitive ageing.

==Stroke==
{{Main|Stroke}}
[[File:INFARCT.jpg|thumb|Right|[[CT scan]] slice of the brain showing a right-[[brain hemisphere|hemispheric]] [[ischemic]] stroke (left side of image).]]
A [[stroke]] can be caused by a few different situations, but the basic result is the same. Blood flow to a section of the brain is stopped, which results in rapid depletion of oxygen and other nutrients in the starved section. The starved section of brain tissue quickly begins to die, and results in a [[lesion]] in the brain. The resulting lesion can be traced loss of various cognitive functions depending on the location and area of damage.&lt;ref name="Hallett 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hallett M |title=Plasticity of the human motor cortex and recovery from stroke |journal=Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. |volume=36 |issue=2-3 |pages=169–74 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11690613 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(01)00092-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for stroke patients to suffer from [[Hemiparesis|muscle weakness and loss of muscle function]]. Some natural recovery has been observed, however training based in advances in neuroscience have shown the most dramatic improvements. These investigational therapies focus on repetition of basic tasks with limited appendages. It is generally found that more intensive remedial function therapies result in the greater restoration to function.&lt;ref name="Nelles 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nelles G |title=Cortical reorganization--effects of intensive therapy |journal=Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. |volume=22 |issue=3-5 |pages=239–44 |year=2004 |pmid=15502268 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan studies have shown that after as little as 3 weeks of the intensive training programs there are statistical differences between the experimental group and controls, with observable improvements in muscle control.&lt;ref name="Langhammer 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Langhammer B |author2=Stanghelle JK |title=Bobath or motor relearning programme?

It would be a powerful tool if one could find a system that does not have massive attention requirements.

==Cognitive aging==
{{Main|Aging brain}}
During [[ageing]] many brain functions decline and some are lost, this is referred to as cognitive aging. In the most extreme cases one might think about the catastrophic results of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s Disease]]. Age is the largest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. However, due to lack of knowledge and successful research in this field, little is known about the rates of clinical decline and brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Boote Lewin 2006"/&gt;  This disease is associated with neuronal death. However more general ageing considers loss of synaptic strength over neuronal death.&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hof PR |author2=Morrison JH |title=The aging brain: morphomolecular senescence of cortical circuits |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=607–13 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15374672 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.07.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When considering this situation the machinery for proper functioning of the brain is still present, but is in disarray. It has been shown that as much as a 46% decrease in [[Dendrite|dendrite spine]] number and density can occur in humans over 50 years old when compared to older participants.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs B |author2=Driscoll L |author3=Schall M |title=Life-span dendritic and spine changes in areas 10 and 18 of human cortex: a quantitative Golgi study |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=386 |issue=4 |pages=661–80 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9378859 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19971006)386:4&lt;661::AID-CNE11&gt;3.0.CO;2-N |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory system==
[[File:Sensory Homunculus.png|thumb|right|The cortical homunculus, or the visual representation of how your brain sees your body, was discovered by Wilder Penfield]]The cortical homunculus, or the visual representation of how your brain sees your body, was discovered by [[Wilder Penfield]]. a world-famous brain surgeon. Upon ending his career as part of the McGill medical faculty, he served as the director of Neurological Institute.

The [[Somatosensory system]]is the part of our [[sensory system]] that deals with touch. We wouldn’t be able to feel things like temperatures, pain, pressure, vibration, and skin rash without the unwavering help of our somatosensory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleveckas-Martens|first=N|title=Somatosensory system anatomy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948621-overview#aw2aab6b3|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system has the ability to understand touch, [[pressure]], [[vibration]], [[Proprioception|limb position]], [[heat]], [[Cold]], and [[Pain]]. This information is sent through the [[peripheral nervous system]], to the [[spinal cord]] where it is finally processed by the [[brain]]. One of the key structures in processing this information is the [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], which is located in the [[parietal lobe]]. The primary somatosensory cortex is known to have subsections that process information from different sections, and the area of the cortex for each section is related to its acuity. This observation is often shown symbolically through a [[Cortical homunculus|Homunculus]].&lt;ref name="Purves 2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dale, Ed Purves |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-695-5 |oclc=794367770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory stimulation therapies==
Sensory Stimulation utilizes rapid stimulation of nerves in a section of skin to drive neuronal changes in the participant. The nerves are electrically stimulated in a fashion referred to as coactivation.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dinse HR |author2=Kleibel N |author3=Kalisch T |author4=Ragert P |author5=Wilimzig C |author6=Tegenthoff M |title=Tactile coactivation resets age-related decline of human tactile discrimination |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=88–94 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16685697 |doi=10.1002/ana.20862 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2009"/&gt; In both cases the participant's limb, often hand, is constrained in a device that has a section that applies the stimulation. The participant is allowed to go about their daily activities, and many do not mind the presence of the device.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; These degree of reorganization is often measured through [[Two-point discrimination|two point discrimination thresholds]], which measure the smallest distance between two points that can be felt by the subject.

It has been shown that the use of this technique can rest as much as 30 years of sensory loss.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt;  In the study by Dinse ''et al.'', 28 patients between the ages of 66 to 86 tested similarly to participants 30 years younger than themselves after treatment. These participants had the device attached for 3 hours while undergoing stimulation. Other studies have used shorter periods of stimulation and achieved similar results.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sawaki L |author2=Wu CW |author3=Kaelin-Lang A |author4=Cohen LG |title=Effects of somatosensory stimulation on use-dependent plasticity in chronic stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=246–7 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16322491 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000195130.16843.ac |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coactivation===
A recent study published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation followed four patients recovering from strokes while undergoing electrical sensory stimulation therapy. Their progress was followed through several different tests; Touch Threshold, Tactile Acuity, [[Haptic perception|Haptic Object Recognition]], Pegs placed in peg board and motor tapping tests. It was found that all patients increased their performance during the study. Although this study utilizes a small sample group, and had no control group it is a first step study that suggests future studies.&lt;ref name="Smith 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith PS |author2=Dinse HR |author3=Kalisch T |author4=Johnson M |author5=Walker-Batson D |title=Effects of repetitive electrical stimulation to treat sensory loss in persons poststroke |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=90 |issue=12 |pages=2108–11 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19969176 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2009.07.017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future studies were developed around this study, in which participant's skin was electrically stimulated to induce signals sent to the brain.

===Frequency studies===
In January 2008 Ragert ''et al.'' explored the impact of [[frequency]] of stimulation on sensory stimulation techniques to induce plastic changes. The study investigated if varying the frequency could be used to induce either [[Long-Term Potentiation]] (LTP) or [[Long-term Depression]] (LTD). LTP refers to the processes by which neuronal connections are formed and strengthened through stimulation and activity. Conversely LTD is a process by which a neuronal pathway is decreased by low levels of stimulation or by disuse.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ragert P |author2=Kalisch T |author3=Bliem B |author4=Franzkowiak S |author5=Dinse HR |title=Differential effects of tactile high- and low-frequency stimulation on tactile discrimination in human subjects |journal=BMC Neurosci |volume=9 |issue= |pages=9 |year=2008 |pmid=18215277 |pmc=2244613 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-9-9 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study Ragert ''et al.'' divided their participants into two groups, both of which underwent the SS therapy, but the frequency of stimulation was varied between the two groups. Their analysis showed a statistical improvement in two point discrimination tests for the high frequency group, and a statistical impairment of the same test on the low frequency group.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"/&gt;  This result brings an interesting possibility to light for the future of this technique; SS could be used to both recover lost sensory function, but also to dull [[chronic pain]].

===Activity-dependent plasticity and sensory stimulation therapy===
[[Activity-dependent plasticity]] refers the phenomenon by which neuronal connections changes via repetitive use. This form of plasticity has been utilized by neuro-rehabilitation clinics to help those recovering from strokes; for example The Taub Therapy Clinic uses a constraint induced therapy.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007"/&gt; This therapy focuses on stroke patients with limited function in a limb. The patient's good limb is constrained and the patient is directed through physical tasks of increasing difficulty to induce recovery of neural networks.

The [[American Heart Association|American Stroke Association]] published an article in 2005 by Sawaki ''et al.'' on the possible use of SS to supplement UDP therapies. They suspected that because of the importance of somatosensory information in movement, that enhancing [[sensory processing]] through SS could also improve UDP. Their experiment had two experimental groups; both groups were directed to complete voluntary movements with their thumb, and one group underwent 20 minutes of SS before the directed thumb movements. It was found that the paired participants had greater recovery of function.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"/&gt;

===Impact on cortical maps===
Cortical maps are the maps in which parts of our brain, such as the somatosensory system, are described. The cortical maps in our brains don’t so much relate to our senses so much as it relates to our sense of physical touch. It has been found that the use of intensive training methods can be used to enlarge [[cortical map]]s for patients recovering from a stroke. Studies with that utilize fMRI and PET scans have shown that the degree of activation increases in the motor cortex of patients undergoing intensive therapies.&lt;ref name="Tegenthoff 2005"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tegenthoff M, Ragert P, Pleger B, etal |title=Improvement of tactile discrimination performance and enlargement of cortical somatosensory maps after 5 Hz rTMS |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e362 |date=November 2005 | pmid=16218766 |pmc=1255742 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030362 |url=}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a strong support to the idea that plastic changes in the brain are a mechanism by which recovery can occur.

===Acupuncture and physiotherapy improving postural control===
Patients suffering from hemiparetic stroke&lt;ref name="Takahashi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takahashi CD |author2=Reinkensmeyer DJ |title=Hemiparetic stroke impairs anticipatory control of arm movement |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=149 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12610680 |doi=10.1007/s00221-002-1340-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often lose their ability to stand upright and hold their posture on their own.. Without the ability to control our posture, we lose the ability to move freely and voluntarily, which is necessary for [[activities of daily living|activities of daily living (ADL)]]. Studies have been conducted to see if sensory stimulation could improve functionality after a stroke occurs.  The study compared two groups; a group undergoing standard physical therapy (group 1), and a group that was given sensory stimulation with [[acupuncture]], [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]], and ADL training (group 2). Both groups began the study within ten days of the initial stroke. Group 2 achieved stimulation via traditional Chinese acupuncture (10 needles), placed according to traditional Chinese acupuncture points and kept in place for 30 minutes. Alongside the manual stimulation, electric stimulation (2 to 5&amp;nbsp;Hz) was also given to four of the ten needles. The treatment continued for four to ten days, with an average of six and a half days. The twenty-one patients in group 2 had a mean age of 74.2 and the mean age of group 1 was 74.8. From the patients in group 2 which postural recordings could be made, 7 patients suffered from hemiparetic lesion on the left side and 10 had lesions on the right. Of the patients in group 1, 4 had lesion to the left side and 3 on the right. Upon testing, the subjects stood on a platform with their heels together and their arms crossed over their chests. The subjects were exposed to perturbations via vibratory stimulus on their calf muscles, which caused anteroposterior movement, or galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerves, causing lateral movement. Three different tests were done, with patients eyes both open and closed.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Magnusson M |author2=Johansson K |author3=Johansson BB |title=Sensory stimulation promotes normalization of postural control after stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=1176–80 |date=June 1994 |pmid=8202976 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.25.6.1176 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/25/6/1176.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the study found that there were major differences in group 1, the control group, and group 2, the treatment group. More patients of the treatment group than the control group were able to maintain a healthy stance during perturbations. As both groups were being treated for post stroke symptoms, it was thought that these perturbations would enhance their posture and motor movements naturally. Among the subjects who survived 2 or more years after hemiparetic stroke, the treatment group (group 2), withheld better postural control. Furthermore, patients who had any additional sensory stimulation were comparable acquired values approaching the normal for age-matched healthy subjects when postural control was measured. The sensory stimulation tests enhanced at least partial recovery of postural function for up to 2 years after the stroke and treatment. After testing, it was deduced that improved recovery after sensory stimulation can be accomplished by patients regaining near normal dynamics of human postural control. Postural control is one of the most important issues in rehabilitation of stroke, thus concluding that sensory stimulation obtained from this study may enhance the functional plasticity of the brain.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 1994"/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Sensory Stimulation Therapy is a developing technique aimed at recovering sensory loss after strokes and restoring losses from ageing. It has not been proven that sensory stimulation therapy can actually improve brain plasticity, nor cognitive function. The paradigm of brain plasticity marked a fundamental change in the way that the brain is understood, and considered for future therapies.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007" /&gt; SS takes advantage of this paradigm and the senses are presented with simple stimulation to cause changes inside the brain. In this particular situation a section of skin is stimulated either through electrical or physical means. Signals are sent through the peripheral nervous system to the somatosensory cortex.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2009" /&gt; These signals are then the impetus for changes inside the brain. It has been shown that the adjustment of frequency in this technique can be used to induce either Long Term Potentiation or Long Term Depression.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"/&gt; In the case of LTP as much as 30 years of sensory loss has been shown to be recoverable in relatively short time periods.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; SS has been paired with Use Dependant Plasticity training systems and it has been shown that enhanced recovery is produced from the combination.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"/&gt; One of the striking advantages of this technique is that it is not necessary for the participant to pay attention to the stimulus in order to gain benefit from the therapy.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; This technique opens many interesting doors for future therapies. A potential challenge for this technique is that there is little transfer of gains from one section of skin to another.

Many studies have been conducted, most with some kind of positive conclusion however, further studies need to be conducted sensory stimulation in dementia in order to prove or disprove any theories.&lt;ref name="Collier 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collier L |author2=McPherson K |author3=Ellis-Hill C |author4=Staal J |author5=Bucks R |title=Multisensory stimulation to improve functional performance in moderate to severe dementia--interim results |journal=Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=698–703 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21131677 |doi=10.1177/1533317510387582 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supra''''' (Latin for "above") is an [[academic]] and [[legal citation]] signal used when a writer desires to refer a reader to an earlier-cited authority. For example, an author wanting to refer to a source in his or her third footnote would cite: ''See '''supra''''' note 3.  Or for text in that note: ''See '''supra''''' text accompanying note 3.

Supra can also be used to provide a short form citation to an earlier (but not immediately preceding) authority. For example:
* 1. Stephen J. Legatzke, Note, The Equitable Recoupment Doctrine in United States v. Dalm: Where's the Equity, 10 Va. Tax Rev. 861 (1991).
* 2. Legatzke, ''supra'' note 1, at 862.
In this example, the second citation refers the reader to page 862 in the journal in which the article by Legatzke appears.
The use of supra should be done with care and only when the user fully understands its usage as it could be very confusing to readers if not used appropriately.

More generally, the phrase ''[[List_of_Latin_phrases_(V)#vide_supra|vide supra]]'' or ''v.s.'', often enclosed in parentheses, is used simply to refer the reader to preceding text.

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

==Definition==
Theory of mind is a [[theory]] insofar as the mind is the only thing being directly observed.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in [[joint attention]],&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = B.

S. (1981). Intention in the structure of action and interaction. In L. P. Lipsitt &amp; C. K. Rovee-Collier (Eds.), Advances in infancy research. Vol. 1 (pp. 41-56).

Smith, Eds. Theories of theories of mind. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a "generator of representations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | year = 2000 | title = The impact of sign language on the cognitive development of deaf children: The case of theories of mind | url = | journal = Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education | volume = 5| issue =3| pages = 266–276 | doi = 10.1093/deafed/5.3.266 | pmid=15454505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | last2 = Melot | first2 = A.-M. | year = 2005 | title = Metacognitive development of deaf children: Lessons from the appearance-reality and false belief tasks | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 16–25 | pmid = 15647063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00389.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person does not have a complete theory of mind, it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.

Theory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience over many years for its full development. Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G. (2010). The development of mental processing. Nesselroade, J. R. (2010). Methods in the study of life-span human development: Issues and answers. In W. F. Overton (Ed.), Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] is a related concept, meaning the recognition and understanding of the states of mind of others, including their beliefs, desires and particularly emotions. This is often characterized as the ability to "put oneself into another's shoes". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Franz B.M. (2007), "Commiserating Mice" ''Scientific American'', 24 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While empathy is known as emotional perspective-taking, theory of mind is defined as cognitive perspective-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Catherine A.|last2=Baird|first2=Abigail A.|last3=Grafton|first3=Scott T.|title=Differential role of the orbital frontal lobe in emotional versus cognitive perspective-taking|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=3|pages=374–383|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.011|pmid=16112148|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on theory of mind, in humans and animals, adults and children, normally and atypically developing, has grown rapidly in the 35 years since [[David Premack|Premack]] and Guy Woodruff's paper, "Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?".&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978" /&gt; The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.

An alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[Relational frame theory|relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S. C., Barnes-Holmes, D., &amp; Roche, B. (2001). Relational frame theory:  A post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition.

==Philosophical and psychological roots==
Contemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate—most broadly, from the time of Descartes' ''Second Meditation'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory—"folk psychology"—used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers &amp; P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from social psychology.

The intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an "[[intentional stance]]" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an important distinction between taking an "intentional stance" toward something and entering a "shared world" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.

The philosophical roots of the relational frame theory (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. In studies with non-human animals and pre-verbal humans, in particular, researchers look to these behaviors preferentially in making inferences about mind.                                                                                    
                                                                                         
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] identified the infant's understanding of attention in others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a "critical precursor" to the development of theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251" /&gt; Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as "of interest", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest ("protodeclarative pointing") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt;

Understanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or "aboutness", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The "intentional stance" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343–390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires. Both 2- and 3-year-old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally vs. accidentally marked a box with stickers as baited.&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = J. | last2 = Tomasello | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing intentional from accidental actions in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human children (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 192–206 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.112.2.192 | pmid = 9642787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in ontogeny, [[Andrew N. Meltzoff]] found that 18-month-old infants could perform target manipulations that adult experimenters attempted and failed, suggesting the infants could represent the object-manipulating behavior of adults as involving goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 838–850 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838 | pmid = 25147406 | pmc = 4137788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While attribution of intention (the box-marking) and knowledge (false-belief tasks) is investigated in young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind, Gagliardi et al. have pointed out that even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliardi | first1 = J. L. | year = 1995 | title = Seeing and knowing: Knowledge attribution versus stimulus control in adult humans (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 109 | issue = 2| pages = 107–114 |name-list-format=vanc| display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.109.2.107 | pmid = 7758287 | last2 = Kirkpatrick-Steger | first2 = KK | last3 = Thomas | first3 = J | last4 = Allen | first4 = GJ | last5 = Blumberg | first5 = MS }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, adult human subjects made choices about baited containers when guided by confederates who could not see (and therefore, not know) which container was baited.

Recent research in developmental psychology suggests that the infant's ability to imitate others lies at the origins of both theory of mind and other social-cognitive achievements like perspective-taking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Meltzoff | first = Andrew N. | contribution = Imitation as a mechanism of social cognition: Origins of empathy, theory of mind, and the representation of action | editor-last = Goswami | editor-first = Usha | title = Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development | pages = 6&amp;ndash;25 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631218401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meltzoff, the infant's innate understanding that others are "like me" allows it to recognize the equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self. For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horowitz | first1 = Alexandra C. | year = 2003 | title = Do humans ape? or Do apes human? Imitation and intention in humans and other animals | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 325–336 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.117.3.325 | pmid = 14498809 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.3721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than children did. Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.

While much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"&gt;{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519–529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
There is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&amp;ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March–April 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.

Pragmatic theories of communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt; assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.

Carol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Miller child"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&amp;ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1508793985&amp;Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&amp;ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as "''think''" and "''believe''". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.&lt;ref name="Miller child" /&gt; Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&amp;ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence ("Jimmy thinks the world is flat") from its embedded complement ("the world is flat") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&amp;ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January–March 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together. Moreover, studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ when patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples' beliefs but not while observing information about physical control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saxe|first=R|author2=Kanwisher, N |title=People thinking about thinking people.

=== Aging ===
In older age, theory of mind capacities decline, irrespective of how exactly they are tested (e.g. stories, eyes, videos, false belief-video, false belief-other, faux pas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Julie D.|last2=Phillips|first2=Louise H.|last3=Ruffman|first3=Ted|last4=Bailey|first4=Phoebe E.|title=A meta-analytic review of age differences in theory of mind.|journal=Psychology and Aging|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=826–839|doi=10.1037/a0030677|pmid=23276217|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decline in other cognitive functions is even stronger, suggesting that social cognition is somewhat preserved. In contrast to theory of mind, empathy shows no impairments in aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Andrea M. F.|last2=Kanske|first2=Philipp|last3=Eppinger|first3=Ben|last4=Li|first4=Shu-Chen|date=2017-09-08|title=The Aging of the Social Mind - Differential Effects on Components of Social Understanding|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10669-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=11046|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-10669-4|pmid=28887491|pmc=5591220|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...711046R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two kinds of theory of mind representations: cognitive (concerning the mental states, beliefs, thoughts, and intentions of others) and affective (concerning the emotions of others). Cognitive theory of mind is further separated into first order (e.g., I think she thinks that…) and second order (e.g., he thinks that she thinks that…). There is evidence that cognitive and affective theory of mind processes are functionally independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Kalbe |first= Elke |year= 2010 |title= Dissociating Cognitive from Affective Theory of Mind: A TMS Study |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945209002184 |journal= Cortex |volume= 46 |issue=6 |pages= 769–780 |doi= 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.010 |pmid= 19709653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies of Alzheimer’s disease, which typically occurs in older adults, the patients display impairment with second order cognitive theory of mind, but usually not with first order cognitive or affective theory of mind. However, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to age. There have been many discrepancies in the data collected thus far, likely due to small sample sizes and the use of different tasks that only explore one aspect of theory of mind. Many researchers suggest that the theory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duval | first = Céline | year = 2011 | title = Age Effects on Different Components of Theory of Mind | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381001000245X | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–642 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.10.025  | pmid = 21111637 | last2 = Piolino | first2 = Pascale | last3 = Benjanin | first3 = Alexandre | last4 = Eustache | first4 = Francis | last5 = Desgranges | first5 = Béatrice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural variations ===
Researchers have proposed that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between the ages of three to five.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Henry M.|last2=Liu|first2=David|date=2004-03-01|title=Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Tasks|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=523–541|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00691.x|pmid=15056204|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-step theory of mind scale consists of the development of diverse desires (DD), diverse beliefs (DB), knowledge access (KA), false beliefs (FB), and hidden emotions (HE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Australian, American and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahaeian|first=Ameneh|last2=Peterson|first2=Candida C.|last3=Slaughter|first3=Virginia|last4=Wellman|first4=Henry M.|title=Culture and the sequence of steps in theory of mind development.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1239–1247|doi=10.1037/a0023899|pmid=21639620|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies with children in Canada, India, Peru, Samoa, and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false belief task at around the same time, suggesting that the children develop theory of mind consistently around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, T., Rochat, P., Lillard, A., Claux, M. L., Odden, H., Itakura, S., ... &amp; Singh, S. (2005). Synchrony in the onset of mental-state reasoning: Evidence from five cultures. ''Psychological Science'', ''16''(5), 378-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, children from [[Iran]] and [[China]] develop theory of mind in a slightly different order. Although they begin the development of theory of mind around the same time, toddlers from these countries understand knowledge access (KA) before Western children but take longer to understand false beliefs (FB).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Fang, F., Liu, D., Zhu, L., &amp; Liu, G. (2006). Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Understandings in Chinese Children. ''Psychological Science'', ''17''(12), 1075–1081. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01830.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe this swap in the developmental order is related to the culture of [[collectivism]] in Iran and China, which emphasizes interdependence and shared knowledge as opposed to the culture of [[individualism]] in Western countries, which promotes individuality and conflicting opinions. Because of these different cultural values, Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have different, sometimes false, beliefs. This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and solely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Empirical investigation==
Whether children younger than 3 or 4 years old may have any theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers. It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''—(the German word ''Umwelt'' means "environment" or "surrounding world")—of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

=== False-belief task ===
One of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute ''false belief'': that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task done by Wimmer and Perner (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally–Anne test|"'Sally-Anne' test"]] or "'Sally-Anne' task"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
Another example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.&lt;ref name = Mitchell&gt;{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

The results of research using false-belief tasks have been fairly consistent: most normally developing children are able to pass the tasks from around age four.&lt;ref name="Roessler, Johannes "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roessler, Johannes |title=When the Wrong Answer Makes Perfect Sense - How the Beliefs of Children Interact With Their Understanding of Competition, Goals and the Intention of Others |journal=University of Warwick Knowledge Centre |volume=August 2014 |year=2013 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/culture/when-the-wrong-answer-makes-perfect-sense-how-the-beliefs-of-children-interact-with-their-understanding-of-competition-goals-and-the-intention-of-others | accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, while most children, including those with [[Down syndrome]], are able to pass this test, in one study, 80% of children diagnosed with [[autism]] were ''unable'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | ref = harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also adults can experience problems with false beliefs. For instance, when they show [[hindsight bias]], defined as: "the inclination to see events that have already happened as being more predictable than they were before they took place."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, P. (2011). Acquiring a Theory of Mind. In Alan Slater, &amp; Gavin Bremner (eds.) An Introduction to Developmental Psychology: Second Edition, BPS Blackwell. page 371&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment by Fischhoff in 1975, adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard information on actual outcome. Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others' thinking, adults can be unable to disregard certain information that they have been given.&lt;ref name = Mitchell/&gt;

===Unexpected contents===
Other tasks have been developed to try to solve the problems inherent in the false-belief task. In the "Unexpected contents", or "Smarties" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called "[[Smarties]]". After the child guesses (usually) "Smarties", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that "Smarties" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils. Gopnik &amp; Astington (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Child Development |year=1988 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.2307/1130386 |pmid=3342716 |vauthors=Gopnik A, Aslington JW |title=Children's understanding of representational change and its relation to the understanding of false belief and the appearance-reality distinction. }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children pass this test at age four or five years.

===Other tasks===
The "false-photograph" task&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaitchik | first1 = D. | year = 1990 | title = When representations conflict with reality: the preschooler's problem with false beliefs and "false" photographs | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 41–68 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(90)90036-J | pmid = 2340712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Thaiss | first2 = L. | year = 1992 | title = Domain specificity in conceptual development | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 225–51 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(92)90013-8 | pmid = 1643814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another task that serves as a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, children must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs.  Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sabbagh | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Moses | first2 = L.J. | year = 2006 | title = Executive functioning and preschoolers' understanding of false beliefs, false photographs, and false signs | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1034–1049 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00917.x | pmid = 16942504 | last3 = Shiverick | first3 = S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (''e.g.'', chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene.  While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (''e.g.'', a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action.  The examiner asks the child two control questions: "When we first took the picture, where was the object?" and "Where is the object now?".  The subject is also asked a "false-photograph" question: "Where is the object in the picture?" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

To make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach, Cognition (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts,&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"/&gt; and rates of pretend play.&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"&gt;Leslie, A. M. (1991). Theory of mind impairment in autism. In A.

===Early precursors===
Recent research on the early precursors of theory of mind has looked at innovative ways at capturing preverbal infants' understanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of experimental procedures, studies have shown that infants from their first year of life have an implicit understanding of what other people see&lt;ref name="Poulin-Dubois, D., Sodian, B., Tilden, J., Metz, U., &amp; Schoepper, B. 2007 pp 401-425"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15248370701612951 |title=Out of Sight is Not Out of Mind: Developmental Changes in Infants' Understanding of Visual Perception During the Second Year |year=2007 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Sodian |first2=Beate |last3=Metz |first3=Ulrike |last4=Tilden |first4=Joanne |last5=Schoeppner |first5=Barbara |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=401–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what they know.&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H., &amp; Baillargeon, R. 2005 pp. 255-258"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1107621 |title=Do 15-Month-Old Infants Understand False Beliefs? |year=2005 |last1=Onishi |first1=K.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being "reliable", compared to someone whose visual perception was "unreliable". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016715 |title=The effect of a looker's past reliability on infants' reasoning about beliefs |year=2009 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Chow |first2=Virginia |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1576–82 |pmid=19899915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficits==
The theory of mind impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective-taking. This is also sometimes referred to as ''[[mind-blindness]]''. This means that individuals with a theory of mind impairment would have a difficult time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moore, S.| year = 2002 | title = Asperger Syndrome and the Elementary School Experience | publisher = Shawnee Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Baker, J.| year = 2003 | title = Social Skills Training: for children and adolescents with Asperger Syndrome and Social-Communication Problems | publisher = Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Mind deficits have been observed in people with [[autism spectrum]] disorders, people with [[schizophrenia]], people with [[nonverbal learning disorder]], people with [[attention deficit disorder]],&lt;ref name="pmid21289541"/&gt; persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain. Theory of mind deficits have also been observed in deaf children who are late signers (i.e., are born to hearing parents), but the deficit is due to the delay in language learning, not any cognitive deficit, and therefore disappears once the child learns sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Peterson | first = Candida | year = 2016 | title = Peer Social Skills and Theory of Mind in Children with Autism, Deafness, or Typical Development | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=b9cdfd9c-d261-4e85-97bb-bd48f2a9b7bd%40sessionmgr4007 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–57 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/a0039833 | pmid = 26524383 | last2 = Slaughter | first2 = Virginia | last3 = Moore | first3 = Chris | last4 = Wellman | first4 = Henry }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
In 1985 [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Alan M. Leslie]] and [[Uta Frith]] suggested that children with [[autism]] do not employ theory of mind&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"/&gt; and suggested that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person's beliefs. These difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of age and verbal ability in the theory of mind task performance of subjects with autism | author=Happe, FG | journal=Child Development | year=1995 | volume=66 | issue=3 | pages=843–55 | doi=10.2307/1131954 | pmid=7789204| jstor=1131954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been taken as a key feature of autism.

Many individuals classified as autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others, and they seem to lack theory of mind capabilities.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who study the relationship between autism and theory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways. One account assumes that theory of mind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play.&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;{{citation | last = Leslie | first = Alan M. | contribution = Theory of mind impairment in autism | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leslie,&lt;ref name=Leslie/&gt; theory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts, beliefs, and desires, regardless of whether or not the circumstances involved are real. This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective justification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = R.P. | title = Autism and the development of mind | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, N.J. | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780863772399}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that with an autistic person, deficits in theory of mind result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions.  He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings.  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"/&gt;

It has been speculated&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"/&gt; that Theory of Mind exists on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] as opposed to the traditional view of a discrete presence or absence. While some research has suggested that some autistic populations are unable to attribute mental states to others,&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt; recent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms that facilitate a spectrum of mindful behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dapretto | first1 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–30 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nn1611 | pmid = 16327784 | last2 = Davies | first2 = MS | last3 = Pfeifer | first3 = JH | last4 = Scott | first4 = AA | last5 = Sigman | first5 = M | last6 = Bookheimer | first6 = SY | last7 = Iacoboni | first7 = M | pmc = 3713227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tine et al. suggest that [[autistic]] children score substantially lower on measures of social theory of mind in comparison to  children diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/505393 |pmid=22934174 |pmc=3420603 |title=Unique Theory of Mind Differentiation in Children with Autism and Asperger Syndrome |year=2012 |last1=Tine |first1=Michele |last2=Lucariello |first2=Joan |journal=Autism Research and Treatment |volume=2012 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, children with more advanced theory of mind abilities display more advanced social skills, greater adaptability to new situations, and greater cooperation with others. As a result, these children are typically well-liked. However, “children may use their mind-reading abilities to manipulate, outwit, tease, or trick their peers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Astington | first = J. W. | year = 2003 | title = Sometimes necessary, never sufficient: False-belief understanding and social competence | journal = Individual Differences in Theory of Mind: Implications for Typical and Atypical Development | pages = 13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals possessing inferior theory of mind skills, such as children with autism spectrum disorder, may be socially rejected by their peers since they are unable communicate effectively. Social rejection has been proven to negatively impact a child’s development and can put the child at greater risk of developing depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chung | first = K. | year = 2007 | title = Peer-mediated social skills training program for young children with high-functioning autism | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 423–436 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.05.002 | pmid = 16901676 | last2 = Reavis | first2 = S. | last3 = Mosconi | first3 = M. | last4 = Drewry | first4 = J. | last5 = Matthews | first5 = T. | last6 = Tassé | first6 = M. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-mediated interventions (PMI) are a school-based treatment approach for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder in which peers are trained to be role models in order to promote social behavior. Laghi et al. studied if analysis of prosocial (nice) and antisocial (nasty) theory of mind behaviors could be used, in addition to teacher recommendations, to select appropriate candidates for PMI programs. Selecting children with advanced theory of mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically make the program more effective. While the results indicated that analyzing the social uses of theory of mind of possible candidates for a PMI program is invaluable, it may not be a good predictor of a candidate's performance as a role model.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"/&gt;

The autistic deficit in Theory of Mind has been challenged by some, who cite both insufficient evidence and contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=F|title=Illusions of Explanation: A Critical Review of the "Theory of Mind" Account of Autism|url=https://www.academia.edu/11175559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariane-zurcher/autism-theory_b_1594706.html|title=Debunking the Theory of Mind|last=Zurcher|first=Ariane|date=2012-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate theory of apparent Theory of Mind deficits comes out of the [[social model of disability]], and posits that such deficits are a result of autistic individuals' status as a neurological minority, and the challenges that result from having to model the typical (non-spectrum) mind against their own, resulting in deficits compared with a typical mind modeling another typical mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://semioticspectrumite.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/the-belief-in-theory-of-mind-is-a-disability/|title=The belief in a theory of mind is a disability|date=2018-01-26|work=Semiotic Spectrumite|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
Individuals with the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] can show deficits in theory of mind. Mirjam Sprong and colleagues investigated the impairment by examining 29 different studies, with a total of over 1500 participants.&lt;ref name=Sprong&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprong | first1 = M. | last2 = Schothorst | first2 = P. | last3 = Vos | first3 = E. | last4 = Hox | first4 = J. | last5 = Van Engeland | first5 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 191 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.035899 | pmid = 17602119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[meta-analysis]] showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with schizophrenia. They performed poorly on false-belief tasks, which test the ability to understand that others can hold false beliefs about events in the world, and also on intention-inference tasks, which assess the ability to infer a character's intention from reading a short story. Schizophrenia patients with [[negative symptoms]], such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions. The meta-analysis additionally showed that IQ, gender, and age of the participants does not significantly affect the performance of theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Current research suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight, the patient's awareness of their mental illness.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = R. | last2 = Fish | first2 = S. | last3 = Granholm | first3 = E. | year = 2015 | title = Insight and theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 225 | issue = 1–2| pages = 169–174 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.11.010 | pmid = 25467703 | pmc=4269286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insight requires theory of mind—a patient must be able to adopt a third-person perspective and see the self as others do.&lt;ref name=Konstan&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Konstantakopoulos | first1 = G. | last2 = Ploumpidis | first2 = D. | last3 = Oulis | first3 = P. | last4 = Patrikelis | first4 = P. | last5 = Nikitopoulou | first5 = S. | last6 = Papadimitriou | first6 = G.

S. | year = 2014 | title = The relationship between insight and theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 152 | issue = 1| pages = 217–222 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2013.11.022 | pmid = 24321712 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A patient with good insight would be able to accurately self-represent, by comparing oneself with others and by viewing oneself from the perspective of others.&lt;ref name=Ng /&gt; Insight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms; however, a patient who lacks insight would not realize that he has a mental illness, because of his inability to accurately self-represent. Therapies that teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person.&lt;ref name=Ng /&gt;

The majority of the current literature supports the argument that the theory of mind deficit is a stable trait-characteristic rather than a state-characteristic of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Cassetta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassetta | first1 = B. | last2 = Goghari | first2 = V. | year = 2014 | title = Theory of mind reasoning in schizophrenia patients and non-psychotic relatives | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 218 | issue = 1–2| pages = 12–19 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.03.043 | pmid = 24745472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis conducted by Sprong et al. showed that patients in remission still had impairment in theory of mind. The results indicate that the deficit is not merely a consequence of the active phase of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Schizophrenic patients' deficit in theory of mind impairs their daily interactions with others. An example of a disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who must understand the thoughts and behaviors of their children and react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehta | first1 = U.

===Alcohol use disorders===
Impairments in theory of mind, as well as other social-cognitive deficits are commonly found in people suffering from [[alcoholism]], due to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of alcohol on the brain, particularly the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"/&gt;

===Depression and dysphoria===

===Developmental language disorder===
Children diagnosed with [[Developmental language disorder]] (DLD) exhibit much lower scores on reading and writing sections of standardized tests, yet have a normal nonverbal IQ.  These language deficits can be any specific deficits in lexical semantics, syntax, or pragmatics, or a combination of multiple problems. They often exhibit poorer social skills than normally developing children, and seem to have problems decoding beliefs in others. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that children with DLD have substantially lower scores on theory of mind tasks compared to typically developing children.

==Brain mechanisms==

=== In typically developing humans ===
Research on theory of mind in [[autism]] led to the view that mentalizing abilities are subserved by dedicated mechanisms that can -in some cases- be impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact.

[[Neuroimaging]] research has supported this view, demonstrating specific brain regions consistently engaged during theory of mind tasks. [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] research on theory of mind, using verbal and pictorial story comprehension tasks, has identified a set of brain regions including the [[prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC), and area around posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (pSTS), and sometimes [[precuneus]] and [[amygdala]]/[[Brodmann area 38|temporopolar cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 |title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' |year=2003 |last1=Gallagher |first1=Helen L. |last2=Frith |first2=Christopher D. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=77–83 |pmid=12584026|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, research on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified, with separate lines of research focused on the understanding of beliefs, intentions, and more complex properties of [[minds]] such as psychological traits.

Studies from [[Rebecca Saxe]]'s lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task contrast aimed at isolating the mentalizing component of the false-belief task, have very consistently found activation in mPFC, precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00230-1 |title=People thinking about thinking peopleThe role of the temporo-parietal junction in "theory of mind" |year=2003 |last1=Saxe |first1=R |last2=Kanwisher |first2=N |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1835–42 |pmid=12948738|title-link=Temporoparietal junction }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470910601000446 |title=Reading minds versus following rules: Dissociating theory of mind and executive control in the brain |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=Rebecca |last2=Schulz |first2=Laura E. |last3=Jiang |first3=Yuhong V. |journal=Social Neuroscience |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=284–98 |pmid=18633794|citeseerx=10.1.1.392.1433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it has been proposed that the right TPJ ([[rTPJ]]) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01768.x |title=It's the Thought That Counts: Specific Brain Regions for One Component of Theory of Mind |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=R. |last2=Powell |first2=L. J. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=692–9 |pmid=16913952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some debate exists, as some scientists have noted that the same rTPJ region has been consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention;&lt;ref name=DecLamm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1073858407304654 |title=The Role of the Right Temporoparietal Junction in Social Interaction: How Low-Level Computational Processes Contribute to Meta-Cognition |year=2007 |last1=Decety |first1=J. |last2=Lamm |first2=C. |journal=The Neuroscientist |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=580–93 |pmid=17911216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm051 |title=Activity in Right Temporo-Parietal Junction is Not Selective for Theory-of-Mind |year=2007 |last1=Mitchell |first1=J. P. |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=262–71 |pmid=17551089}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Decety]] from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard have thus proposed that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and attentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, it is possible that the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process, they found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004869 |title=Distinct Regions of Right Temporo-Parietal Junction Are Selective for Theory of Mind and Exogenous Attention |year=2009 |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |last1=Scholz |first1=Jonathan |last2=Triantafyllou |first2=Christina |last3=Whitfield-Gabrieli |first3=Susan |last4=Brown |first4=Emery N. |last5=Saxe |first5=Rebecca |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4869 |pmid=19290043 |pmc=2653721|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4869S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional imaging has also been used to study the detection of mental state information in Heider-Simmel-esque animations of moving geometric shapes, which typical humans automatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion.  Three studies found remarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or deterministic motion control: mPFC, pSTS, [[fusiform face area]] (FFA), and amygdala were selectively engaged during the Theory of Mind condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0612 |title=Movement and Mind: A Functional Imaging Study of Perception and Interpretation of Complex Intentional Movement Patterns |year=2000 |last1=Castelli |first1=Fulvia |last2=Happé |first2=Francesca |last3=Frith |first3=Uta |last4=Frith |first4=Chris |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=314–25 |pmid=10944414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02643290342000005 |title=Neural Foundations for Understanding Social and Mechanical Concepts |year=2003 |last1=Martin |first1=Alex |last2=Weisberg |first2=Jill |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology |volume=20 |issue=3–6 |pages=575–87 |pmid=16648880 |pmc=1450338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1208 |title=The role of the fusiform face area in social cognition: Implications for the pathobiology of autism |year=2003 |last1=Schultz |first1=R.

A separate body of research has implicated the posterior superior temporal sulcus in the perception of intentionality in human action; this area is also involved in perceiving biological motion, including body, eye, mouth, and point-light display motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01501-1 |title=Social perception from visual cues: Role of the STS region |year=2000 |last1=Allison |first1=Truett |last2=Puce |first2=Aina |last3=McCarthy |first3=Gregory |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=267–278 |pmid=10859571}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found increased pSTS activation while watching a human lift his hand versus having his hand pushed up by a piston (intentional versus unintentional action).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470910701476686 |title=Perceived causality influences brain activity evoked by biological motion |year=2008 |last1=Morris |first1=James P. |last2=Pelphrey |first2=Kevin A. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Gregory |journal=Social Neuroscience |volume=3 |pages=16–25 |pmid=18633843 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have found increased pSTS activation when subjects perceive a human action that is incongruent with the action expected from the actor's context and inferred intention.

The incongruent actions, on the other hand, require further explanation (why would someone twist empty space next to a gear?), and then apparently would demand more processing in the STS.  Note that this region is distinct from the temporo-parietal area activated during false belief tasks.&lt;ref name=Saxe4/&gt;  Also note that pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-lateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also right-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and the FFA response to faces.

[[neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] evidence has provided support for neuroimaging results regarding the neural basis of theory of mind.  Studies with patients suffering from a lesion of the [[frontal lobes]] and the [[temporoparietal junction]] of the brain (between the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]]) reported that they have difficulty with some theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=Andrea D|last2=Bullock|first2=Peter R|last3=Polkey|first3=Charles E|last4=Morris|first4=Robin G|title='Theory of mind' impairments and their relationship to executive functioning following frontal lobe excisions|journal=Brain|date=2001|volume=124|issue=3|pages=600–616|doi=10.1093/brain/124.3.600|pmid=11222459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn1223 |title=Left temporoparietal junction is necessary for representing someone else's belief |year=2004 |last1=Samson |first1=Dana |last2=Apperly |first2=Ian A |last3=Chiavarino |first3=Claudia |last4=Humphreys |first4=Glyn W |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=499–500 |pmid=15077111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows that theory of mind abilities are associated with specific parts of the human brain.

Research by [[Vittorio Gallese]], Luciano Fadiga and [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] (reviewed in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |title=The Mirror-Neuron System |year=2004 |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=Giacomo |last2=Craighero |first2=Laila |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=27 |pages=169–92 |pmid=15217330 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has shown that some sensorimotor [[neuron]]s, which are referred to as [[mirror neuron]]s, first discovered in the [[premotor cortex]] of [[rhesus monkey]]s, may be involved in action understanding.  Single-electrode recording revealed that these neurons fired when a monkey performed an action, as well as when the monkey viewed another agent carrying out the same task.  Similarly, [[fMRI]] studies with human participants have shown brain regions (assumed to contain mirror neurons) that are active when one person sees another person's goal-directed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079 |title=Grasping the Intentions of Others with One's Own Mirror Neuron System |year=2005 |last1=Iacoboni |first1=Marco |last2=Molnar-Szakacs |first2=Istvan |last3=Gallese |first3=Vittorio |last4=Buccino |first4=Giovanni |last5=Mazziotta |first5=John C. |last6=Rizzolatti |first6=Giacomo |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e79 |pmid=15736981 |pmc=1044835}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data have led some authors to suggest that mirror neurons may provide the basis for theory of mind in the brain, and to support simulation theory of mind reading (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 |title=Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading |year=1998 |last1=Gallese |first1=V |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=493–501 |pmid=21227300 |last2=Goldman |first2=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence against the link between mirror neurons and theory of mind.  First, [[macaque|macaque monkeys]] have mirror neurons but do not seem to have a 'human-like' capacity to understand theory of mind and belief.  Second, [[fMRI]] studies of theory of mind typically report activation in the mPFC, temporal poles and TPJ or STS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1218 |title=Development and neurophysiology of mentalizing |year=2003 |last1=Frith |first1=U. |last2=Frith |first2=C.

In a recent paper, [[Keren Haroush]] and [[Ziv Williams]] outlined the case for a group of [[neuron]]s in primates' brains that uniquely predicted the choice selection of their interacting partner. These primates' neurons, located in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] of rhesus monkeys, were observed using single-unit recording while the monkeys played a variant of the iterative [[prisoner's dilemma]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haroush K, Williams Z |year=2015 |title=Neuronal Prediction of Opponent's Behavior during Cooperative Social Interchange in Primates |journal=Cell |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=1233–1245 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.045 |pmid=25728667 |pmc=4364450}}&lt;/ref&gt; By identifying cells that represent the yet unknown intentions of a game partner, Haroush &amp; Williams' study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a fundamental and generalized process, and suggests that ''[[anterior cingulate cortex]]'' neurons may potentially act to complement the function of mirror neurons during [[social interchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanfey AG, Civai C, Vavra P |year=2015 |title=Predicting the other in cooperative interactions |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661315001217 |journal=Trends Cogn.

===In autism===
Several neuroimaging studies have looked at the neural basis theory of mind impairment in subjects with [[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA).  The first PET study of theory of mind in autism (also the first neuroimaging study using a task-induced activation paradigm in autism) replicated a prior study in normal individuals, which employed a story-comprehension task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Happe  | year = 1996 | title = 'Theory of mind' in the brain.

However, because the study used only six subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results should be considered preliminary.

A subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a "reading the mind in the eyes" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = et al | title = Social intelligence in the normal and autistic brain: an fMRI study | journal = [[European Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891&amp;ndash;1898 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00621.x | pmid = 10336657 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors found activity in [[orbitofrontal cortex]], STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found no amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.

A more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castelli  | year = 2002 | title = Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 8| pages = 1839–1849 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awf189 | pmid = 12135974 | first1 = F | last2 = Frith | first2 = C | last3 = Happé | first3 = F | last4 = Frith | first4 = U }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation.  Activity in [[extrastriate cortex|extrastriate regions]] V3 and LO was identical across the two groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism.  The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.

A subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in high-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelphrey  | year = 2005 | title = Neural basis of eye gaze processing deficits in autism | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 1038–1048 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh404 | pmid = 15758039 | first1 = KA | last2 = Morris | first2 = JP | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of additional STS processing in the incongruent state may suggest that these subjects fail to form an expectation of what the actor should do given contextual information, or that feedback about the violation of this expectation doesn't reach STS. Both explanations involve an impairment in the ability to link eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations.  This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.

In 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832–1838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}&lt;/ref&gt;  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive [[mind-blindness]] difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=325 |issue=5942 |pages=883–885 |doi=10.1126/science.1176170 |pmid=19608858 |vauthors=Senju A, Southgate V, White S, Frith U |title=Mindblind eyes: an absence of spontaneous theory of mind in Asperger syndrome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

The evolutionary origin of theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–66}}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.

==Non-human==
{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}

An open question is if other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of Theory of Mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.

Non-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"/&gt; that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using [[plover]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ristau |first1=Carolyn A. |year=1991 |chapter=Aspects of the cognitive ethology of an injury-feigning bird, the piping plovers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKzhZYiQfZEC&amp;pg=PA91 |editor1-first=Carolyn A. |editor1-last=Ristau |title=Cognitive Ethology: Essays in Honor of Donald R. Griffin |pages=91–126 |location=Hillsdale, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=978-1-134-99085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y |title=Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play |year=2008 |last1=Horowitz |first1=Alexandra |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |pages=107–18 |pmid=18679727 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.

There has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00053-6 |title=Chimpanzee minds: Suspiciously human? |year=2003 |last1=Povinelli |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Vonk |first2=Jennifer |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=157–160 |pmid=12691763|citeseerx=10.1.1.494.1478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the "knower". By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 | pmid=11170704}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached. William Field and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] have no doubt that bonobos have developed Theory of Mind and cite their communications with a well known captive bonobo, [[Kanzi]], as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Jon|title=A Voluble Visit with Two Talking Apes|url=https://www.npr.org/2006/07/08/5503685/a-voluble-visit-with-two-talking-apes|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 experiment, ravens ''[[Corvus corax]]'' were shown to take into account visual access of unseen conspecifics. It is suspected that "ravens can generalize from their own perceptual experience to infer the possibility of being seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html | title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors | author1=Thomas Bugnyar|author2=Stephan A.

A 2016 study published by evolutionary anthropologist Christopher Krupenye brings new light to the existence of Theory of Mind, and particularly false beliefs, in non-human primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6308/110 | title=Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs | author1=Christopher Krupenye|author2=Fumihiro Kano|author3=Satoshi Hirata|author4=Josep Call|author5=Michael Tomasello | journal=Science | year=2016 | volume=354 | issue=6308 | pages=110–114 | doi=10.1126/science.aaf8110 | pmid=27846501|bibcode=2016Sci...354..110K| hdl=10161/13632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dichroic filters.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dichroic filter]]s are created using optically transparent materials.]]

In the field of [[optics]], '''transparency''' (also called '''pellucidity''' or '''diaphaneity''') is the [[physical property]] of allowing light to pass through the material without being scattered. On a macroscopic scale (one where the dimensions investigated are much larger than the wavelength of the [[photon]]s in question), the photons can be said to follow [[Snell's Law]]. '''Translucency''' (also called '''translucence''' or '''translucidity''') is a superset of transparency: it allows light to pass through, but does not necessarily (again, on the macroscopic scale) follow Snell's law; the photons can be scattered at either of the two interfaces, or internally, where there is a change in index of [[refraction]]. In other words, a translucent medium allows the transport of light while a transparent medium not only allows the transport of light but allows for image formation. Transparent materials appear clear, with the overall appearance of one color, or any combination leading up to a brilliant [[spectrum]] of every color. The opposite property of translucency is [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].

When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different ways. These interactions depend on the [[wavelength]] of the light and the nature of the material. Photons interact with an object by some combination of reflection, absorption and transmission.
Some materials, such as [[plate glass]] and clean [[water]], transmit much of the light that falls on them and reflect little of it; such materials are called optically transparent. Many liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are mostly responsible for excellent optical transmission.

Materials which do not [[Transmittance|transmit]] light are called [[opacity (optics)|opaque]]. Many such substances have a [[chemical composition]] which includes what are referred to as [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] centers. Many substances are selective in their absorption of [[Solar Light|white light]] [[frequencies]]. They absorb certain portions of the [[visible spectrum]] while reflecting others. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected or transmitted for our physical observation. This is what gives rise to [[color]]. The attenuation of light of all frequencies and wavelengths is due to the combined mechanisms of absorption and [[Light scattering in liquids and solids|scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fox, M.|title=Optical Properties of Solids|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency can provide almost perfect [[camouflage]] for animals &lt;!--or possibly military equipment?--&gt; able to achieve it. This is easier in dimly-lit or turbid [[sea]]water than in good illumination. Many [[marine biology|marine animals]] such as [[jellyfish]] are highly transparent.

==  Introduction ==

With regard to the absorption of light, primary material considerations include:
*At the electronic level, absorption in the [[ultraviolet]] and visible (UV-Vis) portions of the spectrum depends on whether the [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a [[quantum]] of light (or [[photon]]) of a specific [[frequency]], and does not violate [[selection rules]]. For example, in most glasses, electrons have no available energy levels above them in range of that associated with visible light, or if they do, they violate selection rules, meaning there is no appreciable absorption in pure (undoped) glasses, making them ideal transparent materials for windows in buildings.
*At the atomic or molecular level, physical absorption in the infrared portion of the spectrum depends on the [[frequencies]] of atomic or [[molecular vibrations]] or [[chemical bonds]], and on [[selection rule]]s. Nitrogen and oxygen are not greenhouse gases because there is no absorption because there is no [[molecular dipole moment]].

With regard to the [[light scattering in liquids and solids|scattering of light]], the most critical factor is the length scale of any or all of these structural features relative to the wavelength of the light being scattered. Primary material considerations include:

*Crystalline structure: whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit the 'long-range order' evidenced in crystalline solids.
*Glassy structure: scattering centers include fluctuations in density or composition.
*Microstructure: scattering centers include internal surfaces such as grain boundaries, [[crystallographic defect]]s and microscopic pores.
*Organic materials: scattering centers include fiber and cell structures and boundaries.

== Light scattering in solids ==

{{Main article|Light scattering}}

[[File:Diffuse refl.gif|thumb|right|250px|General mechanism of '''diffuse reflection''']]

[[Diffuse reflection]] - Generally, when light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic and non-glassy) solid material, it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities ''inside'' the material (e.g., the [[grain boundaries]] of a [[polycrystalline]] material, or the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[fiber]] boundaries of an organic material), and by its surface, if it is rough. Diffuse reflection is typically characterized by omni-directional reflection angles. Most of the objects visible to the naked eye are identified via diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is "light scattering". Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerker, M.|title=The Scattering of Light|publisher=Academic, New York|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Mandelstam, L.I.|title=Light Scattering by Inhomogeneous Media
|journal=Zh. Russ. Fiz-Khim. Ova.
|volume=58 |page=381
|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light scattering in liquids and solids depends on the wavelength of the light being scattered. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical [[dimension]] (or spatial scale) of the scattering center. Visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of a half a [[micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter). Scattering centers (or particles) as small as one micrometer have been observed directly in the light [[microscope]] (e.g., [[Brownian motion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=van de Hulst, H.C.|title=Light scattering by small particles|location=New York|publisher= Dover|year= 1981|isbn=0-486-64228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bohren, C.F.  |author2=Huffmann, D.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Absorption and scattering of light by small particles|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparent ceramics===
Optical transparency in polycrystalline materials is limited by the amount of light which is scattered by their microstructural features. Light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical dimension of the scattering center. For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of a micrometer, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale. Primary scattering centers in polycrystalline materials include microstructural defects such as pores and grain boundaries. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.

In the formation of polycrystalline materials (metals and ceramics) the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the grain boundaries scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (about 1/15 of the light wavelength or roughly 600/15 = 40&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer]]s) eliminates much of light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.

Computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina has shown that microscopic pores trapped near grain boundaries act as primary scattering centers. The volume fraction of porosity had to be reduced below 1% for high-quality optical transmission (99.99 percent of theoretical density). This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of [[sol-gel]] chemistry and [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamashita, I.|title=Transparent Ceramics|journal=J. Am. Ceram. Soc.|volume=91|issue=3|page=813|year=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02202.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Backlit mushroom.jpg|thumb|Translucency of a material being used to highlight the structure of a photographic subject]]
[[Transparent ceramic]]s have created interest in their applications for high energy lasers, transparent armor windows, nose cones for heat seeking missiles, radiation detectors for non-destructive testing, high energy physics, space exploration, security and medical imaging applications. Large [[laser]] elements made from transparent ceramics can be produced at a relatively low cost. These components are free of internal [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] or intrinsic [[birefringence]], and allow relatively large doping levels or optimized custom-designed doping profiles. This makes ceramic laser elements particularly important for high-energy lasers.

The development of transparent panel products will have other potential advanced applications including high strength, impact-resistant materials that can be used for domestic windows and skylights. Perhaps more important is that walls and other applications will have improved overall strength, especially for high-shear conditions found in high seismic and wind exposures. If the expected improvements in mechanical properties bear out, the traditional limits seen on glazing areas in today's building codes could quickly become outdated if the window area actually contributes to the shear resistance of the wall.

Currently available infrared transparent materials typically exhibit a trade-off between optical performance, mechanical strength and price. For example, [[sapphire]] (crystalline [[alumina]]) is very strong, but it is expensive and lacks full transparency throughout the 3–5 micrometer mid-infrared range. [[Yttria]] is fully transparent from 3–5 micrometers, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shock resistance for high-performance aerospace applications. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two materials in the form of the [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (YAG) is one of the top performers in the field.

==Absorption of light in solids==
When light strikes an object, it usually has not just a single frequency (or wavelength) but many. Objects have a tendency to selectively absorb, reflect or transmit light of certain frequencies. That is, one object might reflect green light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. Another object might selectively transmit blue light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. The manner in which visible light interacts with an object is dependent upon the frequency of the light, the nature of the atoms in the object, and often the nature of the [[electron]]s in the [[atom]]s of the object.

Some materials allow much of the light that falls on them to be transmitted through the material without being reflected. Materials that allow the transmission of light waves through them are called optically transparent. Chemically pure (undoped) window glass and clean river or spring water are prime examples of this.

Materials which do not allow the transmission of any light wave frequencies are called [[opacity (optics)|opaque]]. Such substances may have a chemical composition which includes what are referred to as absorption centers. Most materials are composed of materials which are selective in their absorption of light frequencies. Thus they absorb only certain portions of the visible spectrum. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected back or transmitted for our physical observation. In the visible portion of the spectrum, this is what gives rise to color.&lt;ref name="bbbb"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simmons, J.  |author2=Potter, K.S. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optical Materials|publisher=Academic Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaaa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uhlmann, D.R.|title=Optical Properties of Glass|publisher=Amer. Ceram. Soc.|year=1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption centers are largely responsible for the appearance of specific wavelengths of visible light all around us. Moving from longer (0.7 micrometer) to shorter (0.4 micrometer) wavelengths: red, orange, yellow, green and blue (ROYGB) can all be identified by our senses in the appearance of color by the selective absorption of specific light wave frequencies (or wavelengths). Mechanisms of selective light wave absorption include:

*Electronic: Transitions in electron [[energy levels]] within the atom (e.g., [[pigments]]). These transitions are typically in the ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible portions of the spectrum.
*Vibrational: [[Resonance]] in atomic/molecular [[vibrational modes]]. These transitions are typically in the infrared portion of the spectrum.

===UV-Vis: Electronic transitions===
In electronic absorption, the frequency of the incoming light wave is at or near the energy levels of the electrons within the atoms which compose the substance. In this case, the electrons will absorb the energy of the light wave and increase their energy state, often moving outward from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the atom into an outer shell or [[Atomic orbital|orbital]].

The atoms that bind together to make the molecules of any particular substance contain a number of electrons (given by the [[atomic number]] Z in the [[periodic chart]]). Recall that all light waves are electromagnetic in origin. Thus they are affected strongly when coming into contact with [[negatively charged]] electrons in matter. When [[photons]] (individual packets of light energy) come in contact with the [[valence electrons]] of atom, one of several things can and will occur:

*A molecule absorbs the photon, some of the energy may be lost via [[luminescence]], [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]].
*A molecule absorbs the photon which results in reflection or scattering.
*A molecule cannot absorb the energy of the photon and the photon continues on its path. This results in transmission (provided no other absorption mechanisms are active).

Most of the time, it is a combination of the above that happens to the light that hits an object. The states in different materials vary in the range of energy that they can absorb. Most glasses, for example, block ultraviolet (UV) light. What happens is the electrons in the glass absorb the energy of the photons in the UV range while ignoring the weaker energy of photons in the visible light spectrum. But there are also existing special [[glass]] types, like special types of [[borosilicate glass]] or quartz that are UV-permeable and thus allow a high transmission of ultra violet light.

Thus, when a material is illuminated, individual photons of light can make the [[valence electrons]] of an atom transition to a higher electronic [[energy level]]. The photon is destroyed in the process and the absorbed radiant energy is transformed to electric potential energy. Several things can happen then to the absorbed energy: it may be re-emitted by the electron as [[radiant energy]] (in this case the overall effect is in fact a scattering of light), dissipated to the rest of the material (i.e. transformed into [[heat]]), or the electron can be freed from the atom (as in the [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and [[Compton effect|Compton]] effects).

===Infrared: Bond stretching===
[[Image:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|250px|Normal modes of vibration in a crystalline solid]]
The primary physical mechanism for storing mechanical energy of motion in condensed matter is through [[heat]], or [[thermal energy]]. Thermal energy manifests itself as energy of motion. Thus, heat is motion at the atomic and molecular levels. The primary mode of motion in [[crystalline]] substances is [[vibration]]. Any given atom will vibrate around some [[mean]] or average [[position (vector)|position]] within a crystalline structure, surrounded by its nearest neighbors. This vibration in two dimensions is equivalent to the [[oscillation]] of a clock’s pendulum. It swings back and forth [[symmetrical]]ly about some mean or average (vertical) position. Atomic and molecular vibrational frequencies may average on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[cycles per second]] ([[Terahertz radiation#Natural|Terahertz radiation]]).

When a light wave of a given frequency strikes a material with particles having the same or (resonant) vibrational frequencies, then those particles will absorb the energy of the light wave and transform it into thermal energy of vibrational motion. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared light. Reflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When infrared light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is reflected or transmitted.

If the object is transparent, then the light waves are passed on to neighboring atoms through the bulk of the material and re-emitted on the opposite side of the object. Such frequencies of light waves are said to be [[transmit]]ted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunzler, H.  |author2=Gremlich, H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=IR Spectroscopy: An Introduction|publisher=Wiley|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart, B.|title=Infrared Spectroscopy: Fundamentals and Applications|publisher=Wiley|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency in insulators===
An object may be not transparent either because it reflects the incoming light or because it absorbs the incoming light. Almost all solids reflect a part and absorb a part of the incoming light.

When light falls onto a block of [[metal]], it encounters atoms that are tightly packed in a regular [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]] and a "[[sea of electrons]]" moving randomly between the atoms.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mott, N.F.  |author2=Jones, H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys |publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford (1936) Dover Publications (1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In metals, most of these are non-bonding electrons (or free electrons) as opposed to the bonding electrons typically found in covalently bonded or ionically bonded non-metallic (insulating) solids. In a metallic bond, any potential bonding electrons can easily be lost by the atoms in a crystalline structure. The effect of this delocalization is simply to exaggerate the effect of the "sea of electrons". As a result of these electrons, most of the incoming light in metals is reflected back, which is why we see a [[Reflection (physics)|shiny]] metal surface.

Most [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] (or [[dielectric]] materials) are held together by [[ionic bond]]s. Thus, these materials do not have free [[conduction electrons]], and the bonding electrons reflect only a small fraction of the incident wave. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to propagate (or be transmitted). This class of materials includes all [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and [[glass]]es.

If a dielectric material does not include light-absorbent additive molecules (pigments, dyes, colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light. [[Colour centre (disambiguation)|Color center]]s (or dye molecules, or "dopants") in a dielectric absorb a portion of the incoming light. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to be reflected or transmitted. This is how colored glass is produced.

Most liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. For example, water, cooking oil, rubbing alcohol, air, and natural gas are all clear. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are chiefly responsible for their excellent optical transmission. The ability of liquids to "heal" internal defects via viscous flow is one of the reasons why some fibrous materials (e.g., paper or fabric) increase their apparent transparency when wetted. The liquid fills up numerous voids making the material more structurally homogeneous.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Light scattering in an ideal defect-free [[crystalline]] (non-metallic) solid which provides ''no scattering centers'' for incoming light will be due primarily to any effects of anharmonicity within the ordered lattice. Light [[transmission coefficient#Optics|transmission]] will be highly [[direction (geometry)|directional]] due to the typical [[anisotropy]] of crystalline substances, which includes their [[symmetry group]] and [[Bravais lattice]]. For example, the seven different [[crystalline]] forms of [[quartz]] silica ([[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are all clear, [[transparent materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Griffin, A.|title=Brillouin Light Scattering from Crystals in the Hydrodynamic Region|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.40.167|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys.|volume= 40|issue=1|page=167|year=1968|bibcode=1968RvMP...40..167G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical waveguides==
[[Image:Optical-fibre.svg|thumb|right|Propagation of light through a multi-mode optical fiber]]
[[Image:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|right|A laser beam bouncing down an [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multimode optical fiber]]

Optically transparent materials focus on the response of a material to incoming light waves of a range of wavelengths. Guided light wave transmission via frequency selective waveguides involves the emerging field of [[fiber optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions to act as a [[optical medium|transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing wavelengths or frequencies. This resonant mode of energy and data transmission via electromagnetic (light) wave propagation is relatively lossless.

An optical fiber is a [[cylindrical]] dielectric waveguide that transmits light along its axis by the process of [[total internal reflection]]. The fiber consists of a [[core (optical fiber)|core]] surrounded by a [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] layer. To confine the optical signal in the core, the [[refractive index]] of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The refractive index is the parameter reflecting the [[speed of light]] in a material. (Refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a given medium. The refractive index of vacuum is therefore 1.) The larger the refractive index, the more slowly light travels in that medium. Typical values for core and cladding of an optical fiber are 1.48 and 1.46, respectively.

When light traveling in a dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle, the light will be completely reflected. This effect, called [[total internal reflection]], is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels along the fiber bouncing back and forth off of the boundary. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the [[total internal reflection|critical angle]], only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles will be propagated. This range of angles is called the [[acceptance cone]] of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding. [[Optical]] [[waveguides]] are used as components in integrated optical circuits (e.g. combined with lasers or [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems.

===Mechanisms of attenuation===
{{See also|Light scattering}}
[[Image:Zblan transmit.jpg|thumb|Light attenuation by ZBLAN and silica fibers]]

[[Attenuation]] in [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]], also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance traveled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the very high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a signal across large distances. In optical fibers the main attenuation source is scattering from molecular level irregularities ([[Rayleigh scattering]])&lt;ref&gt;I. P. Kaminow, T. Li (2002), Optical fiber telecommunications IV, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlxnCiQlNwEC&amp;q&amp;f=false&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol.1, p. 223] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527231335/http://books.google.com/books?id=GlxnCiQlNwEC&amp;q&amp;f=false&amp;pg=PA223 |date=2013-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to structural disorder and compositional fluctuations of the [[Amorphous solid|glass structure]]. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of infrared missile domes{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Further attenuation is caused by light absorbed by residual materials, such as metals or water ions, within the fiber core and inner cladding. Light leakage due to bending, splices, connectors, or other outside forces are other factors resulting in attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, R.G.|title=Optical power handling capacity of low loss optical fibers as determined by stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering|journal=Appl.

==As camouflage==

[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

{{further information|List of camouflage methods}}

Many [[Sea|marine]] animals that float near the surface are highly transparent, giving them almost perfect [[camouflage]].&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency&gt;Herring, Peter (2002). ''The Biology of the Deep Ocean''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-854956-7}}. pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick [[Mesoglea|mesogloea]] is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility.&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency/&gt; Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for [[invisibility]] in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency/&gt; For the same reason, transparency in air is even harder to achieve, but a partial example is found in the 
[[glass frog]]s of the South American rain forest, which have translucent skin and pale greenish limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naish|first=D.|title=Green-boned glass frogs, monkey frogs, toothless toads|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/11/09/green-boned-glass-frogs/|work=Tetrapod zoology|publisher=scienceblogs.com|accessdate=14 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111125205/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/11/09/green-boned-glass-frogs/|archivedate=11 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Central American species of clearwing ([[Ithomiini|ithomiine]]) butterflies and many [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] and allied [[insect]]s also have wings which are mostly transparent, a form of [[crypsis]] that provides some protection from predators.

'''Urban informatics''' refers to the study of people creating, applying and using [[information and communication technology]] and [[data]] in the context of [[cities]] and [[urban environments]]. Various definitions are available, some provided in the [[#Definitions|Definitions]] section. Urban informatics is a trans-disciplinary field of research and practice that draws on three broad domains: people, place and technology.&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt;

* People can refer to city residents, [[citizens]], [[community groups]], from various socio-cultural backgrounds, as well as the social dimensions of non-profit organisations and businesses. The social research domains that urban informatics draws from include [[urban sociology]], [[media studies]], [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[city planning]] and others.
* Place can refer to distinct urban sites, [[Locale (geographic)|locales]] and [[habitats]], as well as to larger scale geographic entities such as [[neighbourhoods]], [[public space]], [[suburbs]], [[regions]], or peri-urban areas. The place or spatial research domains entail [[urban studies]], [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[geography]], and others.
* Technology can refer to various types of [[information and communication technology]] and [[ubiquitous computing]] / [[urban computing]] technology such as [[mobile phones]], [[wearable devices]], urban screens, media façades, [[sensors]], and other [[Internet of Things]] devices. The technology research domains span [[informatics]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], and others.

In addition to [[geographic data]] / [[spatial data]], most common sources of data relevant to urban informatics can be divided into three broad categories: government data ([[census]] data, [[open data]], etc.); personal data ([[social media]], [[quantified self]] data, etc.), and; sensor data ([[transport]], [[surveillance]], [[CCTV]], Internet of Things devices, etc.).&lt;ref name="kitchin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Street Computing 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Ricky|last2=Rittenbruch|first2=Markus|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Filonik|first4=Daniel|last5=Viller|first5=Stephen|title=Street Computing: Towards an Integrated Open Data Application Programming Interface (API) for Cities|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|date=April 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/10630732.2012.698064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although first mentions of the term date back as early as 1987, urban informatics did not emerge as a notable field of research and practice until 2006 (see [[#History|History]] section). Since then, the emergence and growing popularity of ubiquitous computing, open data and [[big data analytics]], as well as [[smart cities]] contributed to a surge in interest in urban informatics, not just from academics but also from industry and city governments seeking to explore and apply the possibilities and opportunities of urban informatics.

== Definitions ==

Many definitions of urban informatics have been published and can be found online. The descriptions provided by Townsend in his foreword and by Foth in his preface to the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics"&lt;ref name="foth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|title=Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics: The Practice and Promise of the Real-Time City|date=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-60566-152-0|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/13308/}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize two key aspects: (1) the new possibilities (including real-time data) for both citizens and city administrations afforded by [[ubiquitous computing]], and (2) the convergence of physical and digital aspects of the city.

{{Quotation|"Urban informatics is the study, design, and practice of urban experiences across different urban contexts that are created by new opportunities of real-time, ubiquitous technology and the augmentation that mediates the physical and digital layers of people networks and urban infrastructures."|Foth, Choi, Satchell, 2011|Urban Informatics&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Marcus|last1=Foth|first2=Jaz Hee-jeong|last2=Choi|first3=Christine|last3=Satchell|title=Urban Informatics|conference=Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|pages=1–8|date=2011|location=Hangzhou, China|doi=10.1145/1958824.1958826}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although closely related, Foth differentiates urban informatics from the field of [[urban computing]] by suggesting that the former focusses more on the social and human implications of technology in cities (similar to the community and social emphases of how [[community informatics]] and [[social informatics]] are defined), and the latter focusses more on technology and computing.&lt;ref name="foth2009" /&gt; Urban informatics emphasises the relationship between urbanity, as expressed through the many dimensions of urban life, and technology.

Later, with the increasing popularity of commercial opportunities under the label of [[smart city]] and [[big data]], subsequent definitions became narrow and limited in defining urban informatics mainly as [[big data analytics]] for efficiency and productivity gains in city contexts – unless the arts and social sciences are added to the interdisciplinary mix.&lt;ref name="thrift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrift|first1=Nigel|title=The Promise of Urban Informatics: Some Speculations|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2014|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1263–1266|doi=10.1068/a472c}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialisation within urban informatics is sometimes referred to as 'data-driven, [[Urbanism#Network-based theories|networked urbanism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=Data-Driven, Networked Urbanism|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2015|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2641802|ssrn=2641802}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[urban science]].&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batty|first1=Michael|title=The New Science of Cities|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262019521|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-science-cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first occurrences of the term can be found in Mark E. Hepworth's 1987 article "The Information City",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepworth|first1=Mark E.|title=The Information City|journal=Cities|date=August 1987|volume=4|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/0264-2751(87)90033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the term "urban informatics" on page 261, however, Hepworth's overall discussion is more concerned with the broader notion of "informatics planning." Considering the article pre-dates the advent of ubiquitous computing and urban computing, it does contain some visionary thoughts about major changes on the horizon brought about by [[information and communication technology]] and the impact on cities.

The Urban Informatics Research Lab was founded at [[Queensland University of Technology]] in 2006, the first research group explicitly named to reflect its dedication to the study of urban informatics.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first edited book on the topic, the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics", published in 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, brought together researchers and scholars from three broad domains: people, place, and technology, or; the social, the spatial, and the technical.

There were many precursors to this [[transdisciplinarity]] of "people, place, and technology."&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt; From an [[architecture]], [[planning]] and [[design]] background, there is the work of the late [[William J. Mitchell]], Dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning]], and author of the 1995 book "City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=William J.|title=City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-13309-8|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/city-bits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was influential in suggesting a profound relationship between place and technology at a time when mainstream interest was focused on the promise of the [[Information Superhighway]] and what [[Frances Cairncross]] called the "Death of Distance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cairncross|first1=Frances|title=The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution will Change our Lives|date=1997|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87584-806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a decline in the significance of place through services such as [[telecommuting]], [[distance education]], [[e-commerce]], the physical / tangible layers of the city started to mix with the digital layers of the internet and online communications. Aspects of this trend have been studied under the terms community informatics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurstein|first1=Michael|title=Community Informatics: Enabling Communities with Information and Communications Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Idea Group Publishing|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-878289-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[community network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Community Networks: New Community Networks: Wired for Change|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=978-0-201-59553-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first texts that systematically examined the impact of information technologies on the spatial and social evolution of cities is Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|last2=Marvin|first2=Simon|title=Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places.|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin. The relationship between cities and the internet was further expanded upon in a volume edited by Stephen Graham entitled "Cybercities Reader"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=The Cybercities Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-27956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by various authors in the 2006 book "Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Patrick|title=Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-84628-267-6|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846282676}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Patrick Purcell. Additionally, contributions from architecture, design and planning scholars are contained in the 2007 journal special issue on "Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dave|first1=Bharat|title=Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|date=2007|volume=34|issue=3|pages=381–382|doi=10.1068/b3403ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 34(3), guest edited by the late Bharat Dave, as well as in the 2008 book "Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City"&lt;ref name="aurigi2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aurigi|first1=Alessandro|last2=De Cindio|first2=Fiorella|title=Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=978-0-7546-7149-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Alessandro Aurigi and Fiorella De Cindio, based on contributions to the Digital Cities 4 workshop held in conjunction with the Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T) conference 2005 in Milan, Italy.

The first prominent and explicit use of the term urban informatics in the [[sociology]] and [[media studies]] literature appears in the 2007 special issue "Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellison|first1=Nick|last2=Burrows|first2=Roger|last3=Parker|first3=Simon|title=Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=December 2007|volume=10|issue=6|pages=785–788|doi=10.1080/13691180701750975}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Information, Communication &amp; Society, 10(6), guest edited by Ellison, Burrows, &amp; Parker. Later on, in 2013, Burrows and Beer argued that the socio-technical transformations described by research studies conducted in the field of urban informatics give reason for sociologists more broadly to not only question epistemological and methodological norms and practices but also to rethink spatial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Roger|last2=Beer|first2=David|editor1-last=Orton-Johnson|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Prior|editor2-first=Nick|title=Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives|chapter=Rethinking Space: Urban Informatics and the Sociological Imagination|date=2013| pages=61–78|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-230-22283-0|doi=10.1057/9781137297792_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], the sub-domains of [[human-computer interaction]], ubiquitous computing, and urban computing, provided early contributions that influenced the emerging field of urban informatics. Examples include the Digital Cities workshop series (see below), Greenfield’s 2006 book "Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing|last=Greenfield|first=Adam|publisher=New Riders|year=2006|isbn=0321384016|location=San Francisco, US|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2006 special issue "Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shklovski|first1=Irina|last2=Chang|first2=M. F.|title=Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context|journal=Computer|date=September 2006|volume=39|issue=9|pages=36–37|doi=10.1109/MC.2006.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Computer, 39(9), guest edited by Shklovski &amp; Chang, and the 2007 special issue "Urban Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kindberg|first1=Tim|last2=Chalmers|first2=Matthew|last3=Paulos|first3=Eric|title=Urban Computing|journal=IEEE Pervasive Computing|date=July 2007|volume=6|issue=3|pages=18–20|doi=10.1109/MPRV.2007.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Pervasive Computing, 6(3), guest edited by Kindberg, Chalmers, &amp; Paulos.

== Digital Cities Workshop Series ==

The Digital Cities Workshop Series started in 1999&lt;ref name="dc1" /&gt; and is the longest running academic workshop series that has focused on, and profoundly influenced the field of urban informatics.&lt;ref name="foth2015" /&gt; The first two workshops in 1999 and 2001 were both held in Kyoto, Japan, with subsequent workshops since 2003 held in conjunction with the biennial International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T).

Each Digital Cities workshop proceedings have become the basis for key anthologies listed below, which in turn have also been formative to a diverse set of emerging fields, including urban informatics, urban computing, smart cities, [[pervasive computing]], [[internet of things]], media architecture, urban [[interaction design]], and urban science.

== Methods ==

The diverse range of people, groups and organisations involved in urban informatics is reflective of the diversity of methods being used in its pursuit and practice. As a result, urban informatics borrows from a wide range of methodologies across the [[social sciences]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[planning]] (including [[geographic information systems]]), and [[technology]] (in particular [[computer science]], pervasive computing, and ubiquitous computing), and applies those to the urban domain. Examples include:

* [[action research]] and [[participatory action research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearn|first1=Greg|last2=Tacchi|first2=Jo|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Lennie|first4=June|title=Action Research and New Media: Concepts, Methods, and Cases|date=2009|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1-57273-866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|editor1-last=Gordon|editor1-first=Eric|editor2-last=Mihailidis|editor2-first=Paul|title=Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice|chapter=Participatory Action Research for Civic Engagement|date=2016|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03427-2|pages=563–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[big data analytics]] and [[urban science]]&lt;ref name="batty" /&gt;
* [[critical theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Satchell|first1=Christine|title=Cultural Theory and Design: Identifying Trends by Looking at the Action in the Periphery|journal=ACM interactions|date=1 November 2008|volume=15|issue=6|pages=23|doi=10.1145/1409040.1409046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
