The Philippine attempt also doubled as a charity event since it was also held as part of the "Bounce Back Phl" project which aimed to raise funds to construct a Basketball Marathon (BM) Village in an area in Negros Occidental which was left devastated following the aftermath of [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)]]. The funds raised will be transferred to the "Operation Walang Iwanan" ({{literal translation|Operation No One Is Left Behind}}) project of [[Gawad Kalinga]] for this purpose. The BM Village will contain 24 houses, a basketball court and a community hall where the beneficiaries of the project may participate in livelihood programs of the charity organization. Construction of the village was scheduled in mid-2014. Gawad Kalinga also partnered with Asian Cable Enterprises, Inc. to organize the match.&lt;ref name=access/&gt;

Similarly, the Missouri match was a fundraiser for the recovery process following the aftermath of the [[2011 Joplin tornado]]. More than $100,000 was raised which was distributed by the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=joplin/&gt;

==Preparation==

===Roster selection===
In 2013, 300,000 online applicants vied to be included in the two teams of the 2014 Philippine Basketball Marathon. From these, 100 were shortlisted. The 100 were evaluated by coaches on their basketball playing skills and overall fitness and 30 players were selected for another shortlist of 30 players. 24 players were then selected for the final 24.&lt;ref name=nonpro&gt;{{cite news|title=A league of non-pros readies for attempt at longest basketball game world record|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/353823/sports/basketball/a-league-of-non-pros-readies-for-attempt-at-longest-basketball-game-world-record|accessdate=19 March 2016|publisher=GMA News|date=23 March 2014|language=English, Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All in all the selection process included two try outs, extensive medical test and a panel interview held within two days.&lt;ref name=twist&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giongco|first1=Mark|title=But with a twist.

Head coach Johnedel Cardel who leads the basketball team of the [[Rizal Technological University]] remarked that a mix of young and more mature teams for the final 24 was deliberate and said that the basketball match was less than physical endurance and more on mental toughness and perseverance.&lt;ref name=nonpro/&gt;

The selected players passed a series of medical tests and doctor consultations at [[The Medical City]] to ensure that they have the capability to play basketball for more than 112 hours.&lt;ref name=nonpro/&gt;

===Training===
The players involved in the match underwent training and physical conditioning at the [[Rizal Technological University]]. The focus of the training was to enhance the players' stamina by developing their legs and lower back. To build the players' endurance, the coaches introduced cardio workouts, plyometics, and physical conditioning exercises and routines from [[association football|football]]. The players also had a high-protein diet.&lt;ref name=nonpro/&gt;

===Match day===
Doctors and three ambulances were deployed in standby as a precautionary measure during the game.&lt;ref name=twist/&gt;

==Format==

==Aftermath==
The game that began around 09:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] in March 24 ended around the same time in March 29. By around 1:00 am in March 29, the world record set at the Missouri Athletics Club was broken. The whole game's duration was 120 hours, one minute and 7.8 seconds.&lt;ref name=philstar/&gt;

===Verification by Guinness===
Following the end of the game, Guinness didn't immediately recognize the world record accomplished by the basketball match and underwent a review by a Guinness adjudicator if there were violations to the provisions laid by the world record organization.&lt;ref name="won'tbeofficial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giongco|first1=Mark|title=PH sets record but won’t be official until Guinness approves|url=http://sports.inquirer.net/148866/ph-sets-record-but-wont-be-official-until-guinness-approves|accessdate=19 March 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access Discovery Channel was concerned that Guinness won't recognize the feat due to technicality reasons. Jacque Ruby, chief operating officer of organization is cited two guidelines which states that participants “have to play within the spirit of the rules of the sport” and the other is  the prohibition of players from leaving the court. Ruby noted that during the "graveyard shift" players are "not running anymore, stays at the other end and just waits for the ball" which he says that "it's not an actual game anymore. He also noted that players also occasionally went to the toilet which is located outside the court.&lt;ref name="won'tbeofficial"/&gt;

The guidelines set for Guinness were reportedly strict compared to when it verified the Missouri Athletic Club match. Were a smaller board was used and there was no 24-second shot clock. The Missouri Athletic Club attempt was not recorded in videotape in whole and players were allowed to play barefoot.&lt;ref name="won'tbeofficial"/&gt;

In March 30, 2014, radio station [[DZBB-AM]] reported that Guinness has officially recognized the new world record set by the Philippine Basketball Marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now it's official: PHL new world record holder in marathon basketball|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/354740/sports/basketball/now-it-s-official-phl-new-world-record-holder-in-marathon-basketball|accessdate=19 March 2016|publisher=GMA News|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
House Resolution 01487 was adopted in the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] in September 10, 2014 to congratulate and commend the two teams, along with the Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas organizing committee for the world record feat. The resolution was authored by Eric Olivares and Anthony Del Rosario of the Committee on Youth and Sports Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olivares|first1=Eric|last2=Del Rosario|first2=Anthony|title=House Resolution 01487|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/basic_16/HR01487.pdf|publisher=House of Representatives (Philippines)|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Basketball Marathon received a citation at the [[2015 PSA Annual Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PSA honors 2014’s best athletes|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/sports/170717/psa-honors-2014-s-best-athletes.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|work=The Standard Sports|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==News==

===January===
[[File:Kisenosato Yutaka1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kisenosato]]'s first public ''yokozuna'' duties at the [[Meiji Shrine]] on January 27]]
*6: The three Mongolian ''[[yokozuna]]'' [[Hakuhō]], [[Kakuryū Rikisaburō|Kakuryū]] and [[Harumafuji]] attend a New Year ceremony at the [[Meiji Shrine]], and perform the ''[[dohyo-iri]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/hakuho-leads-traditional-new-year-stomping-ceremony-in-tokyo/3419180.html|title=Hakuho leads traditional new year stomping ceremony in Tokyo|date=6 January 2017|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*21: ''[[Ōzeki]]'' [[Kisenosato]] wins his first ''[[yūshō]]'' or top division championship, after seeing Hakuhō fall to ''[[maegashira]]'' [[Takanoiwa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyodonews.net/news/2017/01/21/97227|title=Sumo: Kisenosato finally meets championship expectations|date=21 January 2017|publisher=Kyodo News|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kisenosato, at 13–1, is two wins ahead of Hakuhō who drops to 11–3, with only one day to go.  Kisenosato had been a runner-up on twelve previous occasions.
*22: On the final day of the Hatsu basho, Kisenosato wraps up his first championship by defeating Hakuhō in the last bout of the day to finish with a 14–1 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170123/p2a/00m/0na/011000c|title=After years of persistence, Kisenosato ready to rise to sumo's pinnacle|date=23 January 2017|publisher=The Mainichi|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hakuho, on 11–4, has gone four tournaments without winning a championship for the first time in his ten-year ''yokozuna'' career. The runner-up is rank-and-file ''maegashira'' [[Sokokurai]] on 12–3, who wins his first [[sansho (sumo)|special prize]] (for Technique) at the age of 33. He shares the award with [[Mitakeumi]], whose 11–4 record gives him a strong case for promotion back to the ''[[sanyaku]]'' ranks. The Outstanding Performance Award goes to Takanoiwa (11–4) for his win over Hakuhō. [[Takayasu Akira|Takayasu]] wins his fourth Fighting Spirit prize. ''Ōzeki'' [[Terunofuji]] and [[Kotoshōgiku]] both finish with poor 5–10 records. It is Kotoshōgiku's second [[make-koshi|losing score]] in a row and he will be demoted to ''[[sekiwake]]'' for the following tournament. The ''[[jūryō]]'' division championship is won by [[Daieishō Hayato|Daieishō]].
*22: The process to promote Kisenosato to ''yokozuna'' begins as the [[judge (sumo)|judge]]s division of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] asks chairman [[Hokutoumi Nobuyoshi|Hakkaku Oyakata]] to hold an extraordinary meeting of its directors, and he agrees.&lt;ref name="drought"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701230040.html|title=SUMO/ Kisenosato to end long drought of Japan-born yokozuna|date=23 January 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*23: Hakkaku asks the [[Yokozuna Deliberation Council]] about whether Kisenosato is deserving of promotion to ''yokozuna''. The council decide that he is suitable.&lt;ref name="drought"/&gt; Speaking at a press conference, Kisenosato recalls the words of his late stablemaster [[Takanosato]] who was also a ''yokozuna''. "He said that 'being a yokozuna is lonely'. I don’t know its meaning yet. But I will make efforts so that I will be able to understand the meaning."&lt;ref name="drought"/&gt;
*25: Kisenosato's ''yokozuna'' promotion is confirmed by the Sumo Association's board of directors in a unanimous decision. [[Tochinowaka Kiyotaka|Kasugano]] and [[Akinoshima|Takadagawa]] convey the message to Kisenosato and his stablemaster [[Takanotsuru Shinichi|Tagonoura]] at a hotel in Tokyo's [[Chiyoda ward]]. Kisenosato says "I am honoured to accept the decision. I will do my best not to tarnish the title of yokozuna."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701250074.html|title=SUMO/ Kisenosato ends barren spell for Japan-born yokozuna|date=25 January 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*27: Kisenosato performs the ''yokozuna'' ring-entering ceremony ''([[dohyo-iri]])'' for the first time in public in front of a crowd of 18000 at the [[Meiji Shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2017/01/27/sumo/yokozuna-kisenosato-carries-first-ring-entry-ceremony/#.WIugCk0zUy8|title=Yokozuna Kisenosato carries out first ring-entry ceremony|date=27 January 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*31: Magaki Oyakata, former ''[[komusubi]]'' [[Tokitenkū Yoshiaki|Tokitenkū]], dies of [[malignant lymphoma]] at the age of 37. He had retired only last August. His fellow Mongolian Hakuhō pays tribute by saying "I’m in my 30s too, it came too early. He was full of fight when I first faced him, I struggled to see eye to eye. I always had to be careful about his good footwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2017/01/31/sumo/ex-komusubi-tokitenku-dies-37/#.WJCUd2czWUk|title=Ex-komusubi Tokitenku dies at 37|date=31 January 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February===
*3: Kisenosato and Hakuho throw soy beans at the [[Narita-san]] temple in [[Narita, Chiba]] Prefecture as part of the annual festival to celebrate [[Setsubun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702030049.html|title=Crowd-pleasing Kisenosato chucks soybeans for good luck|date=3 February 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*5: The 41st [[Fuji TV]] Grand Sumo Tournament takes place at the [[Ryogoku Kokugikan]].  Yokozuna Kisenosato performs his ''dohyo-iri'' in the Kokugikan for the first time. The event is a knock-out format. In the ''makuuchi'' competition, the top eight men on the Hatsu tournament ''banzuke'' are seeded (except for Harumafuji and [[Goeido]] who are injured and do not take part) – Kakuryu (1), Hakuho (2), Kisenosato (3), Terunofuji (4), Kotoshogiku (5), Tamawashi (6), [[Shōdai Naoya|Shodai]] (7) and Takayasu (8). Kisenosato wins the tournament, defeating Takanoiwa in the final. The ''juryo'' tournament is won by [[Kyokutaisei]] who defeats [[Seirō Takeshi|Seiro]].
*11:The 50th [[NHK]] Charity Sumo Tournament takes place, also at the Kokugikan. This time Harumafuji attends along with the other three ''yokozuna''. Several wrestlers take part in a [[enka|singing]] competition with partners or groups: Hakuho with [[Rimi Natsukawa]], Harumafuji with [[Natsuko Godai]], Kakuryu with [[Midori Oka]], Terunofuji with [[Team Syachihoko]], Takayasu with [[Ai Nishida]] and [[Ikioi Shōta|Ikioi]] with [[Yoshimi Tendo]].
*27: The ''banzuke'' for the March tournament is released. Kisenosato is listed on the west side at ''yokozuna'' rank, the first Japanese born wrestler since Takanohana in 2003 to be yokozuna on the ''banzuke''. There are three ''sekiwake'' following Kotoshogiku's demotion from ''ozeki''. It is the first time since 1949 that there has been a promotion of a yokozuna and a demotion of an ozeki in the same tournament.&lt;ref name="topics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopics/banzuke_topics |title=2017 March Grand Sumo Tournament Banzuke Topics |date=February 2017 |publisher=Japan Sumo Association |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227172115/http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopics/banzuke_topics |archivedate=27 February 2017 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only newcomer to the top division is [[Ura Kazuki|Ura]]. He is the first former student of [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] to reach the top division.&lt;ref name="topics"/&gt; Making his ''juryo'' debut is [[Takasago stable]]'s [[Asanoyama Hideki|Asanoyama]], the first ''[[sekitori]]'' from [[Toyama Prefecture]] since [[Kotogaume]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="topics"/&gt; His promotion means Takasago stable has a ''sekitori'' again after they had none in the previous tournament for the first time in their history.

===March===
*12: The Osaka tournament begins with four ''yokozuna'' competing in a ''[[honbasho]]'' for the first time in 17 years.&lt;ref name="hakuho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170316/p2g/00m/0sp/058000c|title=Sumo: Kisenosato keeps winning run going at Spring sumo|date=16 March 2017|publisher=The Mainichi|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317143105/http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170316/p2g/00m/0sp/058000c|archive-date=2017-03-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*17: Hakuho withdraws from the tournament because of toe and thigh injuries.&lt;ref name="hakuho"/&gt;
*24: Having compiled a perfect 12–0 record thus far, Kisenosato loses for the first time as a ''yokozuna'' on Day 13, defeated by Harumafuji. He is injured during the match and leaves the arena with his arm in a sling, but does not withdraw from the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170325/p2g/00m/0sp/041000c|title=Sumo: Yokozuna Kisenosato to fight in Spring tourney despite injury|date=25 March 2017|publisher=The Mainichi|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326050535/http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170325/p2g/00m/0sp/041000c|archive-date=2017-03-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*26: In a remarkable final day's action, Kisenosato comes from behind to win the tournament by defeating Terunofuji twice – once in their regulation match and again in a playoff.&lt;ref name="kisenosato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170326/p2g/00m/0sp/039000c|title=Sumo: Yokozuna Kisenosato denies Terunofuji to win Spring title|date=26 March 2017|publisher=The Mainichi|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finishes on 13–2, his only two defeats in the tournament being to his fellow ''yokozuna'' Harumafuji and Kakuryu (who both finish with mediocre 10–5 records). He is the first ''yokozuna'' to win his debut tournament since [[Takanohana]] in January 1995.&lt;ref name="kisenosato"/&gt; Terunofuji, seemingly recovered from the knee problems that dogged him throughout 2016, not only saves his ''ozeki'' rank but has his first runner-up performance since September 2015.&lt;ref name="kisenosato"/&gt; Kisenosato's stablemate Takayasu was the only other wrestler to defeat Terunofuji and finishes with a fine 12–3 record and his third Outstanding Performance Award.&lt;ref name="kisenosato"/&gt; [[Takakeisho]] receives the Fighting Spirit Prize after winning eleven in only his second top division tournament.&lt;ref name="kisenosato"/&gt; ''Sekiwake'' Kotoshogiku fails in his bid to return immediately to the ''ozeki'' rank, finishing on 9–6, one win short of his minimum target of ten. His sixth defeat on Day 14 saw the crowd boo his opponent, Terunofuji, after Kotoshogiku fell victim to the ''[[henka]]'' manoeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2017/03/25/sumo/basho-reports/leader-terunofuji-bolsters-title-hopes/#.WNvCCk0zXoo|title=Leader Terunofuji bolsters title hopes|date=25 March 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''juryo'' division championship is won by veteran [[Toyohibiki]] for the third time after a three-way playoff. Down in the ''[[jonokuchi]]'' division the 46 year-old Hokutoryu announces his retirement after 31 years and 186 tournaments in sumo, leaving [[Hanakaze Daisaku|Hanakaze]] (who made his debut alongside Hokutoryu in March 1986) as the last active wrestler from the [[Shōwa era]].

===April===

*27: Former ''yokozuna'' [[Sadanoyama]], who served as the head of the Japan Sumo Association from 1992 to 1998, dies of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former yokozuna Sadanoyama dies at 79|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2017/05/01/sumo/former-yokozuna-sadanoyama-dies-79/#.WQnK1ly7XBV|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves [[Tochinoumi]] as the oldest living former ''yokozuna''.

===May===
*1: The ''banzuke'' for the May tournament is released. Two wrestlers make their top division debut: [[Ōnoshō Fumiya|Ōnoshō]] from [[Onomatsu stable]], and [[Yutakayama Ryōta|Yutakayama]] from [[Tokitsukaze stable]]. Onosho is the fifth wrestler to reach ''makuuchi'' from Onomatsu stable since it was founded in 1994.&lt;ref name="may topics"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 May Grand Sumo Tournament Banzuke Topics|url=http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopics/banzuke_topics|website=Japan Sumo Association|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yutakayama debuts in ''makuuchi'' a year after his stablemate [[Shodai]]. Both are former students of the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

*27: Takanohana, whose decision to report Harumafuji's alleged assault to police and refusal to co-operate with investigators has attracted criticism, reportedly tells supporters at a post-''basho'' party that as head of the regional tour department he had a "responsibility to seek justice" no matter who the wrestler was, and that Takanoiwa's injuries are serious. Meanwhile, Hakuhō says that he wants to see both Harumafuji and Takanoiwa back on the ''dohyo'' as soon as possible, and that he will tell police exactly what he saw in order to rid the sumo world of "the pus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/27/national/hakuho-says-will-tell-truth-fellow-wrestlers-assault-takanoiwa-rid-sumo-world-pus/#.Wh2Kz--nGUk|title=Signs of strife within sumo association emerge ahead police probe of alleged assault|date=27 November 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*27: The [[Yokozuna Deliberation Council]] calls for "extremely harsh punishment" of Harumafuji, which could entail suspension from tournaments, a recommendation to retire, or dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/28/national/crime-legal/sumo-advisory-council-recommends-extremely-harsh-punishment-harumafuji/#.Wh2He02Wzoo|title=Sumo advisory council recommends ‘extremely harsh punishment’ for Harumafuji|date=28 November 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*29: Harumafuji announces his retirement at a press conference. He does not go into details about the alleged assault on Takanoiwa, but says, "I had heard that he was lacking in manners and civility and thought it was my duty as a senior wrestler to correct and teach him. But I went too far."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/29/sumo-grand-champion-harumafuji-felled-by-assault-allegations|title=Sumo grand champion Harumafuji felled by assault allegations|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=29 November 2017|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stablemaster says that Harumafuji has "caused great trouble" for the Sumo Association and sumo fans, and as a ''yokozuna'' he must take responsibility.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
*30: An interim report issued by the Sumo Association's investigative committee says that the October 25 incident occurred at a party to celebrate graduates of [[Tottori Johoku High School]], which include [[Terunofuji]] and [[Takanoiwa]]. The three Mongolian ''yokozuna'', [[Harumafuji]], [[Kakuryu]] and [[Hakuho]] were all present. Hakuho criticized Takanoiwa for previous disrespectful behavior at a restaurant in September. After the group moved on to another bar to continue drinking, Hakuho lectured Takanoiwa and Terunofuji on how they must never forget what they learned in their school days. Harumafuji told Takanoiwa to pay attention, at which point Takanoiwa, who was looking at his mobile phone, grinned and said he had just received an e-mail from his girlfriend. Infuriated, Harumafuji slapped Takanoiwa several times around the face to get him to apologize to Hakuho and when Takanoiwa refused to do so, grabbed a karaoke machine remote control and hit Takanoiwa over the head with it several times, which eventually required stitches. The report says that the beer bottle widely cited in early media reports was in fact a champagne bottle which slipped out of Harumafuji's hands before he could use it to hit Takanoiwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201712010023.html|title=JSA: Harumafuji beat Takanoiwa to force apology to Hakuho|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December===
*1: Hakuhō and his stablemaster [[Chikubayama|Miyagino]] are severely reprimanded by the Sumo Association for Hakuhō's inappropriate behavior during his ''yūshō'' interview, when he called for Harumafuji and Takanoiwa to return to the ring and led the crowd in "[[ten thousand years|banzai]]" cheers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/01/national/takanohana-cooperate-sumo-associations-probe-harumafuji-assault-case/#.WiGTSU2Wzoo|title=Takanohana to cooperate with sumo association’s probe into Harumafuji assault case|date=1 December 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*11: Tottori police conclude their investigation and turn the case over to prosecutors. Harumafuji's lawyers respond to criticism that he did not directly apologize to Takanoiwa during his retirement press conference by saying that Harumafuji was nervous, and "wholeheartedly offer an apology to all on (our client's) behalf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201712110035.html|title=Harumafuji's next bout likely to be in court rather than ring|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*20: Hakuhō and Kakuryū are docked one and half month's and one month's salary respectively by the Sumo Association and criticized for not doing enough to prevent the beating incident at which both were present. The Sumo Association also accepts the resignation of Isegahama as a director, and reveals that Takanoiwa finally spoke to the crisis committee investigating the affair on December 19, but the wrestler said that he did nothing discourteous that would cause Harumafuji to attack him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201712200044.html|title=Yokozuna Hakuho, Kakuryu docked pay over beating|date=20 December 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Hakkaku is also foregoing his salary for the last three months of his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/20/national/harumafuji-stablemaster-quits-jsa-board-while-hakuho-and-kakuryu-get-pay-cuts/#.WjqQ502Wzoo|title=Harumafuji’s stablemaster quits JSA board while Hakuho and Kakuryu slapped with pay cuts|date=20 December 2017|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendation must be formalized at another meeting on January 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201712280045.html|title=JSA to oust Takanohana as director over beating scandal|date=28 December 2017|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audax Club Sportivo Italiano''' ({{IPA-es|ˈauðaks itaˈljano}}) is a Chilean [[Association football|football]] club based in [[La Florida, Chile|La Florida]]. Founded in 1910, it plays in the [[Primera División de Chile|Campeonato Nacional]] and has spent most of its history in the top tier of Chilean football. Audax has been national champions four times, joint sixth alongside [[C.D. Magallanes|Magallanes]]. The club also achieved two [[Copa Chile]] runners-up in 1981 and 1988.

The club had their first major success in 1936, when they won the league tournament. During the 1940s, Audax won two leagues in 1946 and 1948, reaching a fourth in 1957.

==History==
The club was founded by Italian residents in Santiago, on November 30, 1910 as '''Audax Club Ciclista Italiano''' in the Alberto Caffi's hat store, and was originally focused in [[cycling]]. As [[Association football|football]] developed quickly in Santiago, in 1917 the club begun participating in that sport, and in 1922, when the popularity of football increased within Audax's supporters, the club changed its name to '''Audax Club Sportivo Italiano'''.

In January 2007, the club was transformed into a limited liability corporation, and changed its name to '''Audax Italiano La Florida''', adding the name of the ''comuna'' in which it's always been located.

The club has always been a regular protagonist in Chilean football, but had never been able to participate in any major international competition until 2007, when they played in the [[Copa Libertadores]]. As a club founded by immigrants, it has a special rivalry with the other immigrant clubs [[Unión Española]] (founded by Spaniards) and [[Palestino]] (founded by Palestinian Arabs).

'''Billy Hebert Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Stockton, California]].  It is primarily used for [[baseball]] and was the home field of the [[Stockton Ports]] until they moved to [[Banner Island Ballpark]] in 2005. The stadium continues to be used as a venue for high school baseball playoffs. It also has been used as a practice facility for the [[Stockton Lightning]] [[af2|minor Arena League football]] team.  The ballpark has a capacity of 6,000 people and opened in 1953.  Prior to 1953, the land upon which the field is built was used for baseball since the late 19th century.  In 1927, Oak Park Field was constructed.  After the field's grandstand was destroyed by fire for a second time, the modern-day grandstand was built in 1953.  The field is named for Billy Hebert, the first professional baseball player to die in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.littleballparks.com/Stadium/2004/Stockton/Stockton.htm Billy Hebert Field at littleballparks.com, URL accessed June 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dominican Summer League Giants''' or '''DSL Giants''' are a [[minor league baseball]] team in the [[Dominican Summer League]]. The team plays in the Boca Chica South division and is affiliated with the [[San Francisco Giants]].

==History==
The team first came into existence in 1989, as one of the DSL's original American minor league teams.  They shared an affiliation with the [[Detroit Tigers]] and were known as the DSL Tigers/Giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id%3D7fef6ea8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313152449/http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=7fef6ea8 |archivedate=2014-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were independently affiliated with the Giants from 1990 to 1992, before gaining an affiliation with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[Houston Astros]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=e97491e3&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1994, they shared an affiliation with the [[Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=f2a421eb&lt;/ref&gt;

The team became independently affiliated with the Giants again in 1995 and have been so ever since.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?code=DOSL&amp;class=FRk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dominican Summer Pirates 2''' or '''DSL Pirates 2''' was briefly the second [[Dominican Summer League]] team affiliated with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and were based in [[Boca Chica]], [[Dominican Republic]] from 2012 to 2013.

However the team was previously known as the '''Venezuelan Summer Pirates''' or '''VSL Pirates''' and were a part of the [[Venezuelan Summer League]], from 2004 until 2011. During that time, team was affiliated with the Pirates and based in [[San Joaquín, Carabobo]], [[Venezuela]]. The team has won 5 straight league regular season titles over the span of 2006 to 2010.  They have also won league championship titles in 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.piratesprospects.com/2010/08/vsl-season-wrap-up-part-one-the-position-players.html|title=VSL Season Wrap-up Part One: The Position Players|last=Dreker |first=John|publisher= Pirates Prospects|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.piratesprospects.com/2010/08/vsl-pirates-win-the-vsl-championship-in-21-2-victory.html|title=VSL Pirates Win the VSL Championship In 21-2 Victory|last=Williams |first=Tim|publisher= Pirates Prospects|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2011, the Pirates announced that the organization would be terminating its lease and no longer participating in the six-team Venezuelan Summer League. The instability and political climate in Venezuela is thought to have played a large role in the organization's decision to pull out of the league. The decision led to the Pirates fielding two teams in the Dominican Summer League, with the remnants of the VSL Pirates forming the Dominican Summer Pirates 2. Both clubs will accommodate 35 players, meaning that the closure of the Venezuelan academy will not impact the number of players the Pirates can develop in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110912&amp;content_id=24588650&amp;notebook_id=24588654&amp;vkey=notebook_pit&amp;c_id=pit|title=Pirates end relationship in Venezuela|last=Langosch |first=Jenifer|work=Pittsburgh Pirates.com|publisher=MLB|accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSL Pirates 2 posted a 34-34 record in their first season. During their 2013 season the team posted a 46-26 record, but were eliminated in the first round of the playoff by the [[DSL Tigers]]. They Pirates returned to one DSL team in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/DSL_Pirates_2|title=DSL Pirates 2|last=|first=|work=Baseball Reference Bullpen|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stride-q210c.jpg|thumb|right|An elliptical machine, a type of exercise machine]]
An '''exercise machine''' is any [[machine]] used for physical [[exercise]]. These range from simple spring-like devices to computerized electromechanical rides to recirculating-stream swimming pools. Most exercise machines incorporate an ergometer. An '''ergometer''' is an apparatus for measuring the [[mechanical work|work]] a person exerts while exercising as used in training or [[cardiac stress tests]] or other medical tests.

==Resistance machines==
=== Weight machines ===
{{Main|Weight machine}}
Weight machines use gravity as the primary source of resistance, and a combination of [[simple machine]]s to convey that resistance, to the person using the machine. Each of the simple machines (pulley, lever, wheel, incline) changes the [[mechanical advantage]] of the overall machine relative to the weight.

===Other kinds of resistance machines===
*kBox
* [[Friction]] machines
* [[Spring (device)|Spring]]-loaded machines (such as [[Bowflex]])
* Fan-loaded machines
* Fluid-loaded machines
* [[Bullworker]]
* Hydraulic equipment
* [[Whole body vibration]]
* [[Outdoor gym]]
* [[Pneumatic exercise equipment]]
* [[Soloflex]]
* [[Precor StretchTrainer|StretchTrainer]]

==Endless-path machines==
[[File:Gymnasticon.png|thumb|The [[Gymnasticon]], an early exercise machine resembling a stationary bicycle]]

===Stationary bicycles===
* [[Exercise bicycle]]

===Running/walking machines===
*[[Treadmill]]
*[[Elliptical trainer]]

===Elliptical machines===
Ellipticals (elliptical machines) are a combination of stair-climbing and a treadmill. Generally it contains two tracks upon which the user stands; when he or she moves his or her legs, they describe an elliptical motion (hence the machine name). Some ellipticals have magnetic resistance controls that add difficulty to doing the motion.

===Glider machines===
This machine allows the user to stand on two separate foot pedals and use their own muscles to create the movement. The stabilized movement can be likened to that of a "swing set" for each leg.

===Climbing machines===
Also named stair-climbing machines, they work the user's legs as he/she pumps pedals up and down, much like climbing stairs. Some climbing machines have handles to push and pull to exercise the whole body.
&lt;!--===Skiing machines===---&gt;

===Rowing machines===
[[Indoor rower|Rowing machines]], also named rowers, simulate the body movements of using a rowing boat.

===Skiing machines===
[[NordicTrack]]

'''Glenn Davis''' is an American [[sportscaster]]. He is best known as the lead play-by-play announcer for local TV broadcasts of the [[Houston Dynamo]] and his weekly radio show titled "Soccer Matters with Glenn Davis" on [[KFNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SoccerMatters/|title=Soccer Matters|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis has called World Cup matches for ESPN,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstondynamo.com/post/2015/06/07/dynamo-broadcaster-glenn-davis-broadcast-six-games-womens-world-cup|title=Dynamo broadcaster Glenn Davis to broadcast six games at Women's World Cup|date=2015-06-07|work=Houston Dynamo|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympic soccer for NBC, and MLS matches on several national and local channels. Additionally, he has called professional women's soccer matches and men and women's collegiate soccer.

A professional soccer player in the 1980s, Davis has also coached youth soccer and works as a consultant and spokesperson. His charitable work includes a youth soccer camp titled "Kick Cancer" that features former and current soccer players as coaches to raise money for pediatric cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cccfund.org/about-us/board-of-directors/|title=» Board of Directors|website=cccfund.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer career==
Davis grew up playing youth soccer in New Jersey under the tutelage of Scottish coach Tom MacDonald, whom he credits for instilling the passion and excitement of the sport of soccer into his blood.&lt;ref name=aboutgd&gt;{{cite web|title=About Glenn Davis|url=http://www.glenndavissoccer.com/about/|website=GlennDavisSoccer.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence was Davis' older brother Conn who was an All-American goalkeeper at Davis' alma-mater, Davis &amp; Elkins College in West Virginia.

Davis played collegiate soccer at [[Boston University]] and later at [[Davis &amp; Elkins College]],&lt;ref name=aboutgd /&gt; where he was a two-time All-[[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference|WVIAC]] selection&lt;ref name=deawards&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards Spotlight|url=http://de.dev.longsight.com/alumni-giving/alumni/alumni-groups/friends-senators-soccer-foss/awards-spotlight|website=Davis &amp; Elkins College|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] All-American.

Davis began his professional career as a central defender for the [[Pennsylvania Stoners]] of the [[American Soccer League (1988–89)|American Soccer League]], with whom he reached the 1983 American Soccer League Final in his rookie season. The Stoners finished runner-up to the [[Jacksonville Tea Men]], coached at the time by former [[Manchester United F.C.]] striker [[Dennis Viollet]], after falling 1-0 in a decisive game three. Davis scored and was named 'Defensive Player of the Game' in game 1.&lt;ref name=aboutgd /&gt;

The following year Davis played with the [[United Soccer League (1984–85)|United Soccer League]]'s [[Houston Dynamos]]. The Dynamos advanced to the 1984 league championship game but fell in the penalty shootout to the [[Fort Lauderdale Sun]], whose squad featured former England captain [[Dave Watson]], Scottish international [[Asa Hartford]], and former [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] star [[Keith Weller]]. Davis earned All-League honors for the 1984 season. The following season Davis captained the team and played against well-known international clubs like [[Sheffield United F.C.]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.]], [[Linfield F.C.]] , [[Glentoran F.C.]], [[C.D. FAS]], [[Olympiakos F.C.]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]], whom the Dynamos defeated 1-0.&lt;ref name=aboutgd /&gt;

Davis would go on to play for the [[Columbus Capitals (indoor soccer)|Columbus Capitals]] indoor soccer team and then returned to outdoor soccer with the [[Albany Capitals]]. He also played for the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1988–94)|Ft. Lauderdale Strikers]] against [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM Pumas]] and [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza of El Salvador]] in the 1988 [[Marlboro Cup (soccer)|Marlboro Cup]] where his team finished third.&lt;ref name=aboutgd /&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Davis began his broadcasting career in 1994 on [[Home Sports Entertainment]] (HSE) as an analyst for the Houston Hotshots indoor soccer team. He now is a nationally recognized soccer broadcaster having been a part of ESPN's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] coverage in 2002, 2006, 2010 and NBC Olympic coverage during the [[Beijing 2008]] and [[London 2012]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2010/01/23/soccer-matters-glenn-davis-premiere-july-18|title='Soccer Matters With Glenn Davis' to premiere July 18|date=2010-01-23|work=MLSsoccer.com|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career he has called games in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Germany. At the start of [[Fox Soccer|Fox Sports World]] (now Fox Soccer Channel) he was a regular calling twice weekly Serie A games from Italy. He has called [[CONCACAF Champions League]], [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] and various tournaments internationally. Davis is a rarity in that he is a former professional soccer player that transitioned from the role of analyst to play by play which he believes gave him a different perspective.

Davis hosts Dynamo All Access on Yahoo Sports 1560 and Soccer Matters on ESPN 97.5 FM. He originally started his radio show on 90.1 KPFT public radio in Houston.
Davis used the platform to promote the sport and the return of professional soccer to Houston, which ultimately occurred with the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] being re-located to Houston in December 2005. He also created a Dynamo post-game radio show, modeled after other pro sports teams' show, which takes place live outside BBVA Compass Stadium after games.

==Writing==
Davis was a twice weekly columnist for the [[Houston Chronicle]] for seven years helping to create awareness for the game.  He maintains the website GlennDavisSoccer.com which provides fresh content daily. He has also written columns for Fox Sports Houston and ESPN online.

==Coaching==
Davis helped form the Hurricanes soccer club with former teammate Tony Johnson. He helped run the club over 12 years as a director with numerous players moving to the college and professional ranks. Davis established relationships with Mexican Clubs Atlas and Monterrey while utilizing local men's leagues to play his best players.  Numerous Mexican clubs would come to Houston to compete including Atlas, UNAM, Monterrey and more. Five players were members of the Uconn National Championship team of 2000. Davis had an  USSF "A" coaching license.

==Personal life==
Davis is committed to the fight against Children's Cancer creating "Kick Cancer" soccer camps that take place in December each year with all proceeds going to cancer research and benefitting the Texas Children's Hospital through the 501 C Charity Curing Children's Cancer Fund (cccfund.org).
Davis credits the entire soccer community for providing their expertise, time and experience to growing KICK CANCER yearly.
Davis sits on the board of Curing Children's Cancer Fund and was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Davis and Elkins College in 2006.
His brother Conn was a college All American goalkeeper who was drafted by the [[Washington Diplomats]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] but had his career cut short due to knee injury. His niece is Ralph Lauren and ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'' cover model [[Hannah Davis (model)|Hannah Davis]], who is also the wife of [[Derek Jeter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12254">[[Image:Hit by pitch joe crede.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Joe Crede]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] after being hit by a pitch]]
In [[baseball]], '''hit by pitch''' ('''HBP''') is a situation in which a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the [[pitcher]]; the batter is called a '''hit batsman''' ('''HB'''). A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or "crowding", home plate.

==Official rule==
Per baseball official rule 5.05(b), a batter becomes a [[baserunning|baserunner]] and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat):
*is touched by a pitched ball outside the [[strike zone]],
*''and'' he attempts to avoid it (or had no opportunity to avoid it),
*''and'' he did not swing at the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If all these conditions are met, the ball is dead, and other baserunners advance if they are forced to vacate their base by the batter taking first. Rule 5.09(a) further clarifies that a hit by pitch is also called when a pitch touches a batter's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/ball_in_play_5.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is [[dead ball#Baseball|dead]] and a [[strike zone|strike]] is called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled either a strike if in the strike zone or a ball if out of the strike zone. Umpires rarely make this call. A famous instance of a non-hit by pitch was on May 31, 1968, when [[Don Drysdale]] hit [[Dick Dietz]] with a pitch that would have forced in a run and ended Drysdale's scoreless innings streak at 44. Umpire [[Harry Wendelstedt]] ruled that Dietz made no effort to avoid the pitch; Dietz proceeded to [[fly out]], and Drysdale's scoreless streak continued to a then-record 58{{fraction|2|3}} innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050629&amp;content_id=1108528&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl|title=Former All-Star catcher Dick Dietz dies|work=Atlanta Braves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hit-by-pitch can also be called on a pitch that has first touched the ground before hitting the batter. Such a bouncing pitch is like any other, and if a batter is hit by such a pitch, he will be awarded first unless he made no attempt to avoid it (and he had an opportunity to avoid it).

A batter hit by a pitch is not credited with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] or [[at bat]], but is credited with a [[times on base|time on base]] and a [[plate appearance]]; therefore, being hit by a pitch does not increase or decrease a player's [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] but does increase his [[on-base percentage]]. A batter hit by a pitch with the [[bases loaded]] is also credited with an [[Run batted in|RBI]] per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf Divisions Of The Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's [[pitch count]], since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.

The rule awarding first base to a batter hit by a pitch was instituted in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm Baseball Rules Chronology: 1845–1899 | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829014513/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm |date=2014-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactical use==
[[Inside pitching]] is a common and legal tactic in [[baseball]], and many players make use of [[brushback pitch]]es, or pitches aimed underneath the chin, commonly referred to as "chin music", to keep players away from the [[home plate|plate]]. "Headhunter" is a common term for pitchers who have a reputation for throwing these kinds of pitches. However, throwing at a batter intentionally is illegal, and can be very dangerous. When an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] suspects that a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, but is not certain, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the [[manager (baseball)|managers]] of both teams. From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game. Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a [[beanball]]) can result in the immediate ejection of the pitcher, and the manager if he ordered the beanball, even without a warning. If the umpire is certain that the pitcher intentionally hit the batter with the pitch, the pitcher is ejected from the game with no warning.

Often, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control. Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a "plunking"). These pitches are often aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else. The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act. The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter [[charging the mound]], [[bench-clearing brawl]]s, and several ejections. The strategy in these games can vary by the circumstances the teams are playing in within major league games, as [[American League]] pitchers are prevented from facing the opposing pitcher in intra-league games due to the [[designated hitter]] rule outside rare circumstances. In [[National League]] games and [[Interleague play|interleague games]] at National League home parks, pitchers must always bat for themselves and open themselves up to direct retaliation, though one of baseball's unsaid rules makes hitting a fellow pitcher a serious breach of baseball etiquette.

==Records==
{{See also|List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders}}
The all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch is held by [[Hughie Jennings]], who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-era record is held by [[Craig Biggio]] of the [[Houston Astros]], who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired. Prior to Biggio, the modern-era record belonged to [[Don Baylor]], who was hit 267 times.

The all-time single-season record also belongs to Jennings, who was hit 51 times during the 1896 season. [[Ron Hunt]] of the 1971 [[Montreal Expos]] was hit 50 times during that year, the modern-era record. The single-game record is three, held by numerous players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp2.shtml|title=Hit by a Pitch Records by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-time record for pitchers is held by [[Gus Weyhing]] with 277 (1887–1901). The modern-era career pitching record for most hit batsmen is 205 by Hall-of-Famer [[Walter Johnson]]. The season record is 54 by [[Phil Knell]] in 1891, and the game record is six, held by Ed Knouff and John Grimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp.shtml|title=Hit Batsmen Records by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Brady Anderson]] was the first player to be hit by a pitch two times in the same inning in an [[American League]] game. On April 25, 2014, [[Brandon Moss]] became the second when he was hit twice in the top of the 9th inning by [[Houston Astros]] pitchers. Five players have been hit by a pitch twice in the same inning in the [[National League]].

Twice has a perfect game been busted by the 27th batter being hit by pitch. [[Hooks Wiltse]] and [[Max Scherzer]] hold this rare feat. Both finished with no-hitters after the hit by pitch. Scherzer's team was leading 6-0 when he pitched his no-hitter, but Wiltse's team was scoreless through 9; he pitched a 10-inning 1–0 no-hitter. The record for most hit batters in a no-hitter is three, held by [[Chris Heston]] of the San Francisco Giants for his 2015 effort against the New York Mets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Casella|title=The Most Unconventional No-Hitters|url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/129863414/edwin-jackson-aj-burnett-unusual-no-hitters-chris-heston|publisher=Sports on Earth|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postseason career records are held by Greg Maddux and Tim Wakefield—each of whom hit 9 batters—and Shane Victorino, who was hit by pitch 11 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/InigA|title=Postseason Pitching Event Finder: From 1903 to 2017, All Teams, Hit By Pitches|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
One major league player died as a result of being struck by a pitch: [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] was hit in the head by [[Carl Mays]] on August 16, 1920, and died the next morning.

Serious injuries may result from being hit by a pitch, even when wearing a helmet. On August 18, 1967, [[Red Sox]] batter [[Tony Conigliaro]] was hit almost directly in the left eye by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[California Angels]]. His cheekbone was shattered; he nearly lost the sight of the eye, was unable to play for over a year, and never regained his earlier batting ability. Batting helmets at the time were not required to have an "ear flap"; it was not until 2002 that all Major League batters were required to wear helmets with side-protection. On September 28, 1995, [[Kirby Puckett]], of the [[Minnesota Twins]], was struck in the cheek by a [[Dennis Martínez]] fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last regular-season game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career. Most recently, [[Mike Piazza]], then of the [[New York Mets]], was hit in the head by a pitch from [[Julián Tavárez]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] on September 10, 2005. His helmet shattered, and he suffered a [[concussion]]. Other relatively minor injuries that are possible include broken fingers or hands, broken feet, broken ribs, injuries to the knee, or [[groin]] injuries.

==Legal consequences==

Since inside pitching is a legitimate tactic in baseball, courts have recognized that being hit by a pitch is an inherent risk of the game, so that players cannot sue for any resulting injuries. On April 6, 2006, in a case arising from a game involving [[community college]] baseball teams, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that baseball players in California [[Assumption of risk|assume the risk]] of being hit by baseballs ''even if'' the balls were intentionally thrown so as to cause injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Avila v. Citrus Community College Dist.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/38C4t148.htm 38 Cal. 4th 148] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the court's words: "For better or worse, being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball. It is not the function of [[tort law]] to police such conduct."

'''Holme Park''' is a sports ground in [[Sonning]] (occasionally called Sonning-on-Thames), a village and [[civil parish]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]], a few miles east of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. It is used for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home of [[Reading R.F.C.|Reading Rugby Football Club]].

Reading RFC had a nomadic existence until, shortly before the [[World War II|Second World War]], the land at Holme Park was purchased and the pitches laid. After the war a new clubhouse and stand were erected, the stand later being moved to its present position on the far side of the ground. The current clubhouse was built through the efforts of Gordon Richens in 1968 and was expanded, with squash courts added, by Colin Barrett in 1975.

The club had been struggling with income over expenditure since the mid-1990s and with debts and loans spiralling the club found it increasing difficult to service the arrears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2005-01-20 | url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/11/11210/crisis_club_reading_plan_for_a_brave_new_world | title=Crisis club Reading plan for a brave new world | work=[[Reading Evening Post]] | accessdate=2008-01-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempted buy-out of the club and assets by former coach Phil Hall was quashed at the club’s [[annual general meeting]] in 2007.  [[Alastair McHarg]], capped 44&amp;nbsp;times by Scotland, was a vociferous opponent of the Hall buy-out.  He said "The good thing about the Phil Hall deal is that at least it has shaken up some people to get their act together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2007-05-11 | url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/s/2010625_rugby_hall_fails_in_his_bid_to_take_over_club | title=Hall fails in his bid to take over club | work=Reading Evening Post | accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2007-08-03 | url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/2013/2013429/rugby_mchargs_60000_budget_to_survive_in_south_west_1 | title=McHarg’s £60,000 budget to survive in South West 1 | work=Reading Evening Post | accessdate=2008-01-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Natatorium was completed in 1982. Counsilman-Hunsaker served as design consultant for the project. The architects were Browning, Day, Pollack &amp; Mullins, Inc. and Edward Larabee Barnes, Architects. This premier competition pool has been recognized as one of the fastest pools in the world with world and American records set by athletes from many countries.

The facility hosted the 2008 Olympic Diving Trials. It was the fifth time since 1984 that the city of Indianapolis had hosted the swimming and/or diving trials, and the city of Indianapolis has recently announced that the Natatorium will again host Olympic Trials for diving in 2016. The Natatorium was used as the trials site every four years from 1984 to 2000. In addition, the Natatorium building houses the IUPUI Recreation Program in the basement of the facility, including the state of the art Polaris weight room which was built in 1996.

Popularly known as IUPUI, this facility has been host to numerous other swim events including the 1982 [[U.S. Olympic Festival|National Sports Festival]], the [[1987 Pan American Games]], the 2001 [[World Police and Fire Games]], NCAA Championships, [[USA Swimming]] National Championships, and the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Championships. Additionally, in July 2009, IUPUI hosted one of USA Swimming's most elite competitions, the 2009 ConocoPhillips National Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chh2o.com/projects/IndianapolisNatatorium-IndianaUniversityPurdueUniversity.aspx |accessdate=October 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724032317/http://www.chh2o.com/projects/IndianapolisNatatorium-IndianaUniversityPurdueUniversity.aspx |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the agreement for being selected to host the 2016 [[USA Diving]] Olympic Trials, the Natatorium underwent roughly $18 million in renovation and repairs before 2016. The project will include a new roof and improved climate control. According to local television station [[WTHR]], "the venue cost $21 million to build in 1982, and would cost nearly $75 million to replace."&lt;ref name=Tiernon&gt;{{cite news|last=Tiernon|first=Anne Marie|title=Indianapolis to host 2016 US Olympic diving trials|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/24074120/2013/11/26/indianapolis-to-host-2016-us-olympic-diving-trials|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=wthr|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kupittaan jäähalli''' is an [[arena]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]. It is primarily used for [[ice hockey]], and is the home arena of [[TuTo]]. It was originally opened in 1973 and held 5,500 [[people]].

==History==
The first [[artificial ice]] field in Kupittaan jäähalli was [[Construction|constructed]] in 1962; this, however, was an [[outdoor]] field where players were at the mercy of the [[weather]]. However, since the field was [[Artificiality|artificially]] frozen, the opening [[Season (sports)|season]] was much longer that with [[Natural environment|natural]] [[ice]]. The actual [[arena]] was constructed in 1973, allowing [[team]]s to play [[indoors]]. The new arena with a [[Fan (person)|spectator]] capacity of 3,000 was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] on November 2006.

==Teams==
Ice hockey teams [[TPS (ice hockey)|TPS]], [[TuTo]], and several other teams have played in this venue. When the new [[Elysée Arena]] was constructed in 1990, TPS moved there. Since then, Kupittaan jäähalli has been known as the [[home arena]] for [[TuTo]].

==New arena==
The last games in the old arena were played in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] of 2005. The new arena with spectator capacity of 3,000 was inaugurated on November 2006.

'''Mewata Stadium''', was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It was the home stadium of the [[Calgary Stampeders]], both before and after the formation of the [[Canadian Football League]] in 1958, until they moved to [[McMahon Stadium]] for the 1960 season, where the team still plays to this day.

The land for Mewata Park was a gift from the Government of Canada.&lt;ref name=Yearbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Wark|first=S. Arnold|title=City of Calgary year book|year=1919|location=Calgary|page=29|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3571229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mewata Stadium opened in 1906, and by 1919 (if not earlier) had bleachers with a seating capacity of 10,000.&lt;ref name=Yearbook/&gt;

The stadium was razed in 1999 and replaced with [[Millennium Park (Calgary)|Shaw Millennium Park]], including a [[urban open space|greenspace]] and [[skateboard park]].

In [[vertebrate]]s, [[skeletal muscle]] contractions are neurogenic as they require [[Synapse|synaptic input]] from [[motor neurons]] to produce muscle contractions. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, which is explained by the [[sliding filament theory]]. The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of [[action potentials]]. In skeletal muscles, muscle tension is at its greatest when the muscle is stretched to an intermediate length as described by the length-tension relationship.

Unlike skeletal muscle, the contractions of [[smooth muscle|smooth]] and [[cardiac muscle]]s are [[Myogenic contraction|myogenic]] (meaning that they are initiated by the smooth or heart muscle cells themselves instead of being stimulated by an outside event such as nerve stimulation), although they can be modulated by stimuli from the [[autonomic nervous system]]. The mechanisms of contraction in these [[muscle tissue]]s are similar to those in skeletal muscle tissues.

==Types==
[[File:1015_Types_of_Contraction_new.jpg|thumb|right | 300px | Types of muscle contractions]]
Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: force and length. Force itself can be differentiated as either tension or load. Muscle tension is the force exerted by the muscle on an object whereas a load is the force exerted by an object on the muscle.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt; When muscle tension changes without any corresponding changes in muscle length, the muscle contraction is described as isometric.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Aidley 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sircar 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bullock et al 2001" /&gt; If the muscle length changes while muscle tension remains the same, then the muscle contraction is isotonic.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Aidley 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sircar 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bullock et al 2001" /&gt; In an isotonic contraction, the muscle length can either shorten to produce a concentric contraction or lengthen to produce an eccentric contraction.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kumar 2004" /&gt; In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner.&lt;ref name = "Biewener 1998" /&gt; Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain constant when the muscle is active during locomotor activity.

=== Isometric contraction ===
{{Main|Isometric exercise}}
An isometric contraction of a muscle generates tension without changing length.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Aidley 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sircar 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bullock et al 2001" /&gt; An example can be found when the muscles of the [[hand]] and [[forearm]] grip an object; the [[joint]]s of the hand do not move, but muscles generate sufficient force to prevent the object from being dropped.

=== Isotonic contraction ===
In [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic contraction]], the tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in muscle length.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Aidley 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sircar 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bullock et al 2001" /&gt; This occurs when a muscle's force of contraction matches the total load on the muscle.

==== Concentric contraction ====
In [[#Concentric contraction|concentric contraction]], muscle tension is sufficient to overcome the load, and the muscle shortens as it contracts.&lt;ref name="Faulkner2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Faulkner JA|year=2003|title=Terminology for contractions of muscles during shortening, while isometric, and during lengthening|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=95|issue=2|pages=455–459|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00280.2003|pmc=|pmid=12851415}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when the force generated by the muscle exceeds the load opposing its contraction.

During a concentric contraction, a muscle is stimulated to contract according to the [[sliding filament theory]]. This occurs throughout the length of the muscle, generating a force at the origin and insertion, causing the muscle to shorten and changing the angle of the joint. In relation to the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]], a concentric contraction of the [[biceps]] would cause the [[arm]] to bend at the elbow as the hand moved from the leg to the shoulder (a [[biceps curl]]). A concentric contraction of the [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] would change the angle of the joint in the opposite direction, straightening the arm and moving the hand towards the leg.

==== Eccentric contraction ====
{{see also|Eccentric training}}
In ''eccentric contraction'', the tension generated while isometric is insufficient to overcome the external load on the muscle and the muscle fibers lengthen as they contract.&lt;ref name = Ucal&gt;{{cite web | url = http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/contractions.shtml | title = Types of contractions | accessdate = 2007-10-02 | date = 2006-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than working to pull a joint in the direction of the muscle contraction, the muscle acts to [[Acceleration|decelerate]] the joint at the end of a movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load. This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is 'smoothing out' a movement or resisting gravity such as during downhill walking). Over the short-term, [[strength training]] involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase [[muscular strength]] more than training with concentric contractions alone.&lt;ref name="Colliander"/&gt; However, exercise-induced muscle damage is also greater during lengthening contractions.&lt;ref name="pmid22539728"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Redox biology of exercise: an integrative and comparative consideration of some overlooked issues|journal=J. Exp. Biol.|volume=215|issue=Pt 10|pages=1615–25|doi=10.1242/jeb.067470|pmid=22539728|vauthors=Nikolaidis MG, Kyparos A, Spanou C, Paschalis V, Theodorou AA, Vrabas IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an eccentric contraction of the [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps muscle]], the [[elbow]] starts the movement while bent and then straightens as the hand moves away from the [[shoulder]]. During an eccentric contraction of the [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps muscle]], the elbow starts the movement straight and then bends as the hand moves towards the shoulder. [[Desmin]], [[titin]], and other z-line [[protein]]s are involved in eccentric contractions, but their mechanism is poorly understood in comparison to crossbridge cycling in concentric contractions.&lt;ref name = Ucal/&gt;

Though the muscle is doing a negative amount of [[mechanical work]], (work is being done ''on'' the muscle), chemical energy (in [[fat]], [[glucose]] or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) is nevertheless consumed, although less than would be consumed during a concentric contraction of the same force. For example, one expends more energy going up a flight of stairs than going down the same flight.

Muscles undergoing heavy eccentric loading suffer greater damage when overloaded (such as during [[Muscle hypertrophy|muscle building]] or [[strength training]] exercise) as compared to concentric loading. When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called ''negatives''. During a concentric contraction, muscle [[myofilament]]s slide past each other, pulling the Z-lines together. During an eccentric contraction, the [[myofilament]]s slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known. Exercise featuring a heavy eccentric load can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] one to two days after training. Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone.&lt;ref name="Colliander"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|title=Effects of eccentric and concentric muscle actions in resistance training|journal=Acta Physiol. Scand.|volume=140|issue=1|pages=31–9|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1990.tb08973.x|pmid=2275403|vauthors=Colliander EB, Tesch PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = G.A |author2=Fahey, T.D. |author3=White, T.P. |year = 1996| title = Exercise Physiology: Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications. (2nd ed.). | publisher = Mayfield Publishing Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to [[overtraining]], moderate training may confer protection against injury.&lt;ref name = Colliander/&gt;

===== Eccentric contractions in movement =====
Eccentric contractions normally occur as a braking force in opposition to a concentric contraction to protect joints from damage. During virtually any routine movement, eccentric contractions assist in keeping motions smooth, but can also slow rapid movements such as a punch or throw. Part of training for rapid movements such as [[pitcher|pitching]] during baseball involves reducing eccentric braking allowing a greater power to be developed throughout the movement.

Eccentric contractions are being researched for their ability to speed rehabilitation of weak or injured tendons. [[Achilles tendinitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alfredson|first1=H|last2=Pietilä|first2=T|last3=Jonsson|first3=P|last4=Lorentzon|first4=R|year=1998|title=Heavy-load eccentric calf muscle training for the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinosis|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=26|issue=3|pages=360–6|pmid=9617396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Effectiveness of physical therapy for Achilles tendinopathy: An evidence based review of eccentric exercises|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0959-3020&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=71|journal=Isokinetics and Exercise Science|volume=14|issue=1|pages=71–80|vauthors=Satyendra L, Byl N}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[patellar tendonitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=A randomised clinical trial of the efficacy of drop squats or leg extension/leg curl exercises to treat clinically diagnosed jumper's knee in athletes: pilot study|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=35|issue=1|pages=60–4|doi=10.1136/bjsm.35.1.60|pmc=1724276|pmid=11157465|vauthors=annell LJ, Taunton JE, Clement DB, Smith C, Khan KM}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as jumper's knee or patellar tendonosis) have been shown to benefit from high-load eccentric contractions.

==Vertebrates==
{{Main|Muscle tissue}}
[[File:Muscle Tissue (1).svg|right|thumb|In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: 1) skeletal, 2) smooth, and 3) cardiac]]
In [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]], there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. [[Skeletal muscle]] constitutes the majority of muscle mass in the body and is responsible for locomotor activity. [[Smooth muscle]] forms [[blood vessels]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and other areas in the body that produce sustained contractions. [[Cardiac muscle]] make up the heart, which pumps blood. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are called [[striated muscle]] because of their striped appearance under a microscope, which is due to the highly organized alternating pattern of A bands and I bands.

===Skeletal muscle===
{{Main|Skeletal muscle}}
[[File:1022_Muscle_Fibers_(small).jpg|right|thumb|Organization of skeletal muscle]]
Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscles contractions occur as a result of conscious effort originating in the [[brain]]. The brain sends electrochemical signals through the [[nervous system]] to the [[motor neuron]] that [[nerve|innervates]] several muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tassinary |last2=Cacioppo |year=2000 |chapter=The Skeletomotor system: surface electromyography |title=Handbook of Psychophysiology |edition=Second |editor1-first=John T. |editor1-last=Cacioppo |editor2-first=Luois G. |editor2-last=Tassinary |editor3-first=Gary G. |editor3-last=Berntson |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-62634-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of some [[reflexes]], the signal to contract can originate in the [[spinal cord]] through a feedback loop with the grey matter. Other actions such as locomotion, breathing, and chewing have a reflex aspect to them: the contractions can be initiated both consciously or unconsciously.

====Neuromuscular junction====
{{Main|Neuromuscular junction}}
[[File:1009 Motor End Plate and Innervation.jpg|right|thumb|Structure of neuromuscular junction.]]
A neuromuscular junction is a [[chemical synapse]] formed by the contact between a [[motor neuron]] and a [[muscle fiber]].&lt;ref name="Levitan 2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Neuron: Cell and Molecular Biology|last1=Levitan|first1=Irwin|last2=Kaczmarek|first2=Leonard|date=August 19, 2015|publisher=Oxford Univerty Press|isbn=0199773890|edition=4th|location=New York, NY|pages=153–328|language=|chapter=Intercellular communication|doi=|jfm=|mr=|zbl=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the site in which a motor neuron transmits a signal to a muscle fiber to initiate muscle contraction. The sequence of events that results in the depolarization of the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential is initiated in the cell body of a motor neuron, which is then propagated by [[saltatory conduction]] along its axon toward the neuromuscular junction. Once it reaches the [[Chemical synapse|terminal bouton]], the action potential causes a {{chem|Ca|2+}} ion influx into the terminal by way of the [[Calcium channel|voltage-gated calcium channels]]. The {{chem|Ca|2+}} influx causes [[synaptic vesicles]] containing the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing acetylcholine into the [[synaptic cleft]] between the motor neuron terminal and the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscle fiber. Acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to and activates [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] on the neuromuscular junction. Activation of the nicotinic receptor opens its intrinsic [[sodium]]/[[potassium]] channel, causing sodium to rush in and potassium to trickle out. As a result, the sarcolemma reverses polarity and its voltage quickly jumps from the resting membrane potential of -90mV to as high as +75mV as sodium enters. The membrane potential then becomes hyperpolarized when potassium exits and is then adjusted back to the resting membrane potential. This rapid fluctuation is called the end-plate potential&lt;ref name="Saladin, Kenneth S. 2015"&gt;Saladin, Kenneth S., Stephen J. Sullivan, and Christina A. Gan. Anatomy &amp; Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage-gated ion channels of the sarcolemma next to the end plate open in response to the end plate potential. These voltage-gated channels are sodium and potassium specific and only allow one through. This wave of ion movements creates the action potential that spreads from the motor end plate in all directions.&lt;ref name="Saladin, Kenneth S. 2015"/&gt; If action potentials stop arriving, then acetylcholine ceases to be released from the terminal bouton. The remaining acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is either degraded by active [[acetylcholine esterase]] or reabsorbed by the synaptic knob and none is left to replace the degraded acetylcholine.

====Excitation-contraction coupling====
Excitation–contraction coupling is the process by which a [[Action potential#Muscular action potentials|muscular action potential]] in the muscle fiber causes the [[myofibril]]s to contract.&lt;ref name="Sandow A 1952 176–201"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sandow A|year=1952|title=Excitation-Contraction Coupling in Muscular Response|journal=Yale J Biol Med|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–201|pmc=2599245|pmid=13015950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In skeletal muscle, excitation–contraction coupling relies on a direct coupling between key proteins, the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR) calcium release channel (identified as the [[ryanodine receptor]], RyR) and [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage-gated L-type calcium channels]] (identified as dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs). DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma (which includes the surface sarcolemma and the [[transverse tubules]]), while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane. The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation–contraction coupling takes place. Excitation–contraction coupling occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscle cell results in a muscle action potential, which spreads across the cell surface and into the muscle fiber's network of [[T-tubule]]s, thereby depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber. Depolarization of the inner portions activates dihydropyridine receptors in the terminal cisternae, which are in close proximity to ryanodine receptors in the adjacent [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes (involving conformational changes that allosterically activates the ryanodine receptors). As the ryanodine receptors open, {{chem|Ca|2+}} is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the local junctional space, which then diffuses into the bulk cytoplasm to cause a [[calcium spark]]. Note that the sarcoplasmic reticulum has a large [[calcium buffering]] capacity partially due to a [[calcium-binding protein]] called [[calsequestrin]]. The near synchronous activation of thousands of [[calcium sparks]] by the action potential causes a cell-wide increase in calcium giving rise to the upstroke of the [[calcium transient]]. The {{chem|Ca|2+}} released into the cytosol binds to [[Troponin C]] by the [[actin filaments]], to allow crossbridge cycling, producing force and, in some situations, motion. The [[SERCA|sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase]] (SERCA) actively pumps {{chem|Ca|2+}} back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As {{chem|Ca|2+}} declines back to resting levels, the force declines and relaxation occurs.

====Sliding filament theory====
{{Main|Sliding filament theory}}
[[File:Sarcomere.svg|right|thumb|Sliding filament theory: A sarcomere in relaxed (above) and contracted (below) positions]]
The [[sliding filament theory]] describes a process used by [[muscle]]s to contract. It is a cycle of repetitive events that cause a thin filament to slide over a thick filament and generate tension in the muscle.&lt;ref name="Saladin 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was independently developed by [[Andrew F. Huxley|Andrew Huxley]] and [[Rolf Niedergerke]] and by [[Hugh Huxley]] and [[Jean Hanson]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Huxley AF, Niedergerke R 1954 971–973"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1954|title=Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction: Interference Microscopy of Living Muscle Fibres|journal=Nature|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=971–973|bibcode=1954Natur.173..971H|doi=10.1038/173971a0|pmid=13165697|vauthors=Huxley AF, Niedergerke R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huxley H, Hanson J 1954 973–976"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1954|title=Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation|journal=Nature|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=973–976|bibcode=1954Natur.173..973H|doi=10.1038/173973a0|pmid=13165698|vauthors=Huxley H, Hanson J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiologically, this contraction is not uniform across the sarcomere; the central position of the thick filaments becomes unstable and can shift during contraction. However the actions of elastic proteins such as [[titin]] are hypothesised to maintain uniform tension across the sarcomere and pull the thick filament into a central position.&lt;ref name="pmid3680378"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1987|title=The positional stability of thick filaments in activated skeletal muscle depends on sarcomere length: evidence for the role of titin filaments.|url=http://jcb.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/105/5/2217|journal=J.

=====Crossbridge cycling=====
[[File:1008_Skeletal_Muscle_Contraction.jpg|right|thumb|Crossbridge cycling]]
Crossbridge cycling is a sequence of molecular events that underlies the sliding filament theory. A crossbridge is a myosin projection, consisting of two myosin heads, that extends from the thick filaments.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008"/&gt; Each myosin head has two binding sites: one for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and another for actin. The binding of ATP to a myosin head detaches myosin from [[actin]], thereby allowing myosin to bind to another actin molecule. Once attached, the ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, which uses the released energy to move into the "cocked position" whereby it binds weakly to a part of the actin binding site. The remainder of the actin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin.&lt;ref name="Enoka 2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Principles of Neural Science|last1=Enoka|first1=Roger M.|last2=Pearson|first2=Keir G.|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|isbn=0-071-39011-1|editor1=Eric R. Kandel|edition=5th|location=New York, NY|pages=768–789|language=|chapter=The motor unit and muscle action|doi=|jfm=|mr=|id=|editor2=James H. Schwartz|editor3=Thomas M. Jessell|editor4=Steven A. Siegelbaum|editor5=A. J. Hudspeth|bbl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the ATP hydrolyzed, the cocked myosin head now contains ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Two {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions bind to [[troponin C]] on the actin filaments. The troponin-{{chem|Ca|2+}} complex causes [[tropomyosin]] to slide over and unblock the remainder of the actin binding site. Unblocking the rest of the actin binding sites allows the two myosin heads to close and myosin to bind strongly to actin.&lt;ref name = "Enoka 2013"/&gt; The myosin head then releases the inorganic phosphate and initiates a ''power stroke,'' which generates a force of 2 pN. The power stroke moves the actin filament inwards, thereby shortening the [[sarcomere]]. Myosin then releases ADP but still remains tightly bound to actin. At the end of the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, leaving myosin attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin. A lack of ATP would result in the rigor state characteristic of [[rigor mortis]]. Once another ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head will again detach from actin and another crossbridges cycle occurs.

Crossbridge cycling is able to continue as long as there are sufficient amounts of ATP and {{chem|Ca|2+}} in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name = "Enoka 2013"/&gt; Termination of crossbridge cycling can occur when {{chem|Ca|2+}} is [[Active transport|actively pumped]] back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When {{chem|Ca|2+}} is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the muscle relaxes. The {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the {{chem|Ca|2+}} ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions from the troponin. Thus, the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin filaments and contraction ceases.

====Gradation of skeletal muscle contractions====
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 219 | footer = Three types of skeletal muscle contractions | image1 = 1012_Muscle_Twitch_Myogram.jpg | alt1 = Twitch | caption1 = Twitch | image2 = 1013_Summation_Tetanus.jpg | alt2 = Summation and tetanus | caption2 = Summation and tetanus }}
The strength of skeletal muscle contractions can be broadly separated into twitch, summation, and [[tetanic contractions|tetanus]]. A twitch is a single contraction and relaxation cycle produced by an action potential within the muscle fiber itself.&lt;ref name="Feher 2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Quantitative Human Physiology: An Introduction|last1=Feher|first1=Joseph|date=2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-123-82163-0|edition=1st|series=Academic Press Series in Biomedical Engineering|volume=|location=New York, NY|pages=239–248|language=|chapter=Chapter 3.4: Skeletal muscle mechanics|doi=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time between a stimulus to the motor nerve and the subsequent contraction of the innervated muscle is called the '''latent period''', which usually takes about 10 ms and is caused by the time taken for nerve action potential to propagate, the time for chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction, then the subsequent steps in excitation-contraction coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Textbook Of Medical Physiology|last1=Khurana|first1=Indu|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|edition=1st|pages=101–2|chapter=Characteristics of muscle excitability and contractility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If another muscle action potential were to be produced before the complete relaxation of a muscle twitch, then the next twitch will simply sum onto the previous twitch, thereby producing a ''summation''. Summation can be achieved in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shwedyk|first=E.|last2=Balasubramanian|first2=R.|last3=Scott|first3=R. N.|year=1977|title=A nonstationary model for the Electromyogram|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=24|issue=5|pages=417–424|doi=10.1109/TBME.1977.326175}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''frequency summation'' and ''multiple fiber summation''. In '''frequency summation''', the force exerted by the skeletal muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which [[action potential]]s are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when a human is exerting a muscle as hard as he/she is consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in that muscle will be firing at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including [[Golgi tendon organ]]s and [[Renshaw cell]]s). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent [[avulsion fracture|avulsion]] of the tendon&amp;mdash;the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body. In '''multiple fiber summation''', if the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the [[Summation (neurophysiology)|strength of the signal]] increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones. As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger. A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required.

Finally, if the frequency of muscle action potentials increases such that the muscle contraction reaches its peak force and plateaus at this level, then the contraction is a ''tetanus''.

====Length-tension relationship====
{{Details|Hill's muscle model}}

[[File:Lengthtension.jpg|thumb|left|Muscle length versus isometric force]]
Length-tension relationship relates the strength of an isometric contraction to the length of the muscle at which the contraction occurs. Muscles operate with greatest active tension when close to an ideal length (often their resting length). When stretched or shortened beyond this (whether due to the action of the muscle itself or by an outside force), the maximum active tension generated decreases.&lt;ref name="1stLT"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1966|title=The variation in isometric tension with sarcomere length in vertebrate muscle fibres|journal=J. Physiol.|volume=184|issue=1|pages=170–92|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1966.sp007909|pmc=1357553|pmid=5921536|vauthors=Gordon AM, Huxley AF, Julian FJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease is minimal for small deviations, but the tension drops off rapidly as the length deviates further from the ideal. Due to the presence of elastic proteins within a muscle cell (such as titin) and extracellular matrix, as the muscle is stretched beyond a given length, there is an entirely passive tension, which opposes lengthening. Combined together, there is a strong resistance to lengthening an active muscle far beyond the peak of active tension.

====Force-velocity relationships====

[[Image:Muscle Force Velocity relationship.png|thumb|right|300px|Force–velocity relationship of muscle contraction|Force–velocity relationship: right of the vertical axis concentric contractions (the muscle is shortening), left of the axis eccentric contractions (the muscle is lengthened under load); power developed by the muscle in red. Since power is equal to force times velocity, the muscle generates no power at either isometric force (due to zero velocity) or maximal velocity (due to zero force). The optimal shortening velocity for power generation is approximately one-third of maximum shortening velocity.]]
Force–velocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched – force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum. This intrinsic property of active muscle tissue plays a role in the active damping of joints which are actuated by simultaneously-active opposing muscles. In such cases, the force-velocity profile enhances the force produced by the lengthening muscle at the expense of the shortening muscle. This favoring of whichever muscle returns the joint to equilibrium effectively increases the damping of the joint. Moreover, the strength of the damping increases with muscle force. The motor system can thus actively control joint damping via the simultaneous contraction (co-contraction) of opposing muscle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heitmann|first=Stewart|last2=Ferns|first2=Norm|last3=Breakpsear|first3=Michael|date=2011|title=Muscle co-contraction modulates damping and joint stability in a three-link biomechanical limb|journal=Frontiers in Neurorobotics|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnbot.2011.00005|issn=1662-5218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smooth muscle===
{{Main|Smooth muscle}}
[[File:1029 Smooth Muscle Motor Units.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Swellings called varicosities belonging to an autonomic neuron innervate the smooth muscle cells.]]
[[Smooth muscle]]s can be divided into two subgroups: [[single-unit smooth muscle|single-unit]] (unitary) and multi-unit. Single-unit smooth muscle cells can be found in the gut and blood vessels. Because these cells are linked together by gap junctions, they are able to contract as a [[syncytium]]. Single-unit smooth muscle cells contract myogenically, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.

Unlike single-unit smooth muscle cells, multi-unit smooth muscle cells are found in the muscle of the eye and in the base of hair follicles. Multi-unit smooth muscle cells contract by being separately stimulated by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. As such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle. 
 
====Mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction====
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 300 | footer = | image1 = 1028_Smooth_Muscle_Contraction.jpg | alt1 = Smooth muscle contractions | caption1 = Smooth muscle contractions | image2 = Actin myosin filaments.png | alt2 = Frog jumping | caption2 = Sliding filaments in contracted and uncontracted states}}

The contractile activity of smooth muscle cells is influenced by multiple inputs such as spontaneous electrical activity, neural and hormonal inputs, local changes in chemical composition, and stretch.&lt;ref name = "Widmaier et al 2008"/&gt; This is in contrast to the contractile activity of skeletal muscle cells, which relies on a single neural input. Some types of smooth muscle cells are able to generate their own action potentials spontaneously, which usually occur following a [[pacemaker potential]] or a [[slow wave potential]]. These action potentials are generated by the influx of extracellular {{chem|Ca|2+}}, and not {{chem|Na|+}}. Like skeletal muscles, cytosolic {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions are also required for crossbridge cycling in smooth muscle cells.

The two sources for cytosolic {{chem|Ca|2+}} in smooth muscle cells are the extracellular {{chem|Ca|2+}} entering through calcium channels and the {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions that are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The elevation of cytosolic {{chem|Ca|2+}} results in more {{chem|Ca|2+}} binding to [[calmodulin]], which then binds and activates [[myosin light-chain kinase]]. The calcium-calmodulin-myosin light-chain kinase complex phosphorylates myosin on the 20 [[Atomic mass unit|kilodalton]] (kDa) myosin light chains on amino acid residue-serine 19, initiating contraction and activating the [[myosin ATPase]]. Unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells lack troponin, even though they contain the thin filament protein tropomyosin and other notable proteins – caldesmon and calponin.  Thus, smooth muscle contractions are initiated by the {{chem|Ca|2+}}-activated phosphorylation of myosin rather than {{chem|Ca|2+}} binding to the troponin complex that regulates myosin binding sites on actin like in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Termination of crossbridge cycling (and leaving the muscle in latch-state) occurs when myosin light chain phosphatase removes the phosphate groups from the myosin heads. Phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle. During this period, there is a rapid burst of energy utilization as measured by oxygen consumption. Within a few minutes of initiation, the calcium level markedly decreases, the 20 kDa myosin light chains' phosphorylation decreases, and energy utilization decreases; however, force in tonic smooth muscle is maintained. During contraction of muscle, rapidly cycling crossbridges form between activated actin and phosphorylated myosin, generating force. It is hypothesized that the maintenance of force results from dephosphorylated "latch-bridges" that slowly cycle and maintain force. A number of kinases such as [[rho kinase]], [[ZIP kinase]], and [[protein kinase C]] are believed to participate in the sustained phase of contraction, and {{chem|Ca|2+}} flux may be significant.

====Neuromodulation====
Although smooth muscle contractions are myogenic, the rate and strength of their contractions can be modulated by the [[autonomic nervous system]]. [[Postganglionic nerve fibers]] of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] (mAChRs) on smooth muscle cells. These receptors are [[Metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]], or G-protein coupled receptors that initiate a second messenger cascade. Conversely, postganglionic nerve fibers of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] release the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine, which bind to adrenergic receptors that are also metabotropic. The exact effects on the smooth muscle depend on the specific characteristics of the receptor activated—both parasympathetic input and sympathetic input can be either excitatory (contractile) or inhibitory (relaxing).

===Cardiac muscle===
{{Main|Cardiac muscle}}
[[File:Cardiac_Muscle.png|right|thumb|Cardiac muscle]]
There are two types of cardiac muscle cells: autorhythmic and contractile. Autorhythmic cells do not contract, but instead set the pace of contraction for other cardiac muscle cells, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. In contrast, contractile muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) constitute the majority of the heart muscle and are able to contract.

====Excitation-contraction coupling====
Unlike skeletal muscle, excitation–contraction coupling in cardiac muscle is thought to depend primarily on a mechanism called [[calcium-induced calcium release]].&lt;ref name="Fabiato"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fabiato, A.|year=1983|title=Calcium-induced calcium release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum|journal=American Journal of Physiology|volume=245|issue=1|pages=C1–14|pmid=6346892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the proteins involved are similar, the L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are not physically coupled. Instead, RyRs are activated by a calcium trigger, which is brought about by the flow of {{chem|Ca|2+}}through the L-type calcium channels. Furthermore, cardiac muscle tend to exhibit [[diad]] (or dyad) structures, rather than [[triad (anatomy)|triad]]s.

Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells occurs when an action potential is initiated by pacemaker cells in the [[sinoatrial node]] or [[Atrioventricular node]] and conducted to all cells in the heart via [[gap junctions]]. The action potential travels along the surface membrane into [[Cardiac striated muscle#T-tubules|T-tubules]] (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes extracellular {{chem|Ca|2+}} to enter the cell via [[L-type calcium channel]]s and possibly [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] (NCX) during the early part of the [[cardiac action potential#Phase 2|plateau phase]]. This {{chem|Ca|2+}} influx causes a small local increase in intracellular {{chem|Ca|2+}}. The increase in {{chem|Ca|2+}} is detected by [[ryanodine receptor]]s in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases {{chem|Ca|2+}} in a [[positive feedback]] physiological response. This positive feedback is known as [[calcium-induced calcium release]]&lt;ref name="Fabiato" /&gt; and gives rise to [[calcium sparks]] ({{chem|Ca|2+}} sparks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 1993|title=Calcium sparks: elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8235594|journal=Science|volume=262|issue=5134|pages=740–4|bibcode=1993Sci...262..740C|doi=10.1126/science.8235594|pmid=8235594|vauthors=Cheng H, Lederer WJ, Cannell MB}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 {{chem|Ca|2+}} sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1994|title=Spatial non-uniformities in {{chem|Ca|2+}}i during excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3495(94)80677-0|journal=Biophys. J.|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1942–56|bibcode=1994BpJ....67.1942C|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80677-0|pmc=1225569|pmid=7858131|vauthors=Cannell MB, Cheng H, Lederer WJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in cytosolic calcium following the flow of calcium through the cell membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum is moderated by [[Calcium buffering|calcium buffers]] which bind a large proportion of intracellular calcium.  As a result, a large increase in total calcium leads to a relatively small rise in free {{chem|Ca|2+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47659382|title=Excitation-contraction coupling and cardiac contractile force|last=M.|first=Bers, D.|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=9780792371571|edition=2nd|location=Dordrecht|oclc=47659382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above). Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament toward the centre of the sarcomere.
[[File:Cardiac calcium cycling and excitation-contraction coupling.png|thumb|Key proteins involved in cardiac calcium cycling and excitation-contraction coupling]]
Following systole, intracellular calcium is taken up by the [[SERCA|sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase]] (SERCA) pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin. Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] (NCX) and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane [[calcium ATPase]].  Some calcium is also taken up by the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1990|title=Kinetics, stoichiometry and role of the Na-Ca exchange mechanism in isolated cardiac myocytes|journal=Nature|volume=345|issue=6276|pages=618–21|bibcode=1990Natur.345..618C|doi=10.1038/345618a0|pmid=2348872|vauthors=Crespo LM, Grantham CJ, Cannell MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enzyme, [[phospholamban]], serves as a brake for SERCA. At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that {{chem|Ca|2+}} does not have to leave the cell entirely. At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus taking most {{chem|Ca|2+}} from the cytoplasm back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Once again, [[Calcium buffering|calcium buffers]] moderate this fall in {{chem|Ca|2+}}concentration, permitting a relatively small decrease in free {{chem|Ca|2+}}concentration in response to a large change in total calcium. The falling {{chem|Ca|2+}}concentration allows the troponin complex to dissociate from the actin filament thereby ending contraction.  The heart relaxes, allowing the ventricles to fill with blood and begin the cardiac cycle again.

In [[annelids]] such as [[earthworms]] and [[leeches]], circular and longitudinal muscles cells form the body wall of these animals and are responsible for their movement.&lt;ref name="Hillis 2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Principles of Life|last1=Hillis|first1=David M.|last2=Sadava|first2=David E.|last3=Price|first3=Mary V.|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=1-464-10947-8|edition=2nd|series=|volume=|location=Sunderland, MA|pages=681–698|language=|chapter=Muscle and movement|doi=|jfm=|mr=|id=|bbl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earthworm that is moving through a soil, for example, contractions of circular and longitudinal muscles occur reciprocally while the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] serves as a [[Hydrostatic skeleton|hydroskeleton]] by maintaining turgidity of the earthworm.&lt;ref name="Gardner 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=C.R.|date=1976|title=The neuronal control of locomotion in the earthworm|journal=Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=51|issue=1|pages=25–52|pmid=766843}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the circular muscles in the anterior segments contract, the anterior portion of animal's body begins to constrict radially, which pushes the incompressible coelomic fluid forward and increasing the length of the animal. As a result, the front end of the animal moves forward. As the front end of the earthworm becomes anchored and the circular muscles in the anterior segments become relaxed, a wave of longitudinal muscle contractions passes backwards, which pulls the rest of animal's trailing body forward.&lt;ref name = "Hillis 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gardner 1976"/&gt; These alternating waves of circular and longitudinal contractions is called [[peristalsis]], which underlies the creeping movement of earthworms.

===Obliquely striated muscles===

Invertebrates such as annelids, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], and [[nematode]]s, possess obliquely striated muscles, which contain bands of thick and thin filaments that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Principles of Animal Locomotion|last1=Alexander|first1=R. McNeill|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12634-8|edition=2nd|series=|volume=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=15–37|language=|chapter=Muscle, the motor|doi=|jfm=|mr=|id=|bbl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], the obliquely striated muscles can maintain tension over long periods without using too much energy. Bivalves use these muscles to keep their shells closed.

===Asynchronous muscles===

{{Main | Asynchronous muscles}}
{{Further| Insect wing#Muscles}}
Advanced [[insect]]s such as [[wasp]]s, [[Fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, and [[beetle]]s possess [[asynchronous muscles]] that constitute the flight muscles in these animals.&lt;ref name = "Alexander 2003"/&gt; These flight muscles are often called ''fibrillar muscles'' because they contain myofibrils that are thick and conspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Josephson|first=R. K.|last2=Malamud|first2=J. G.|last3=Stokes|first3=D. R.|date=2000-09-15|title=Asynchronous muscle: a primer|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2713|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=203|issue=18|pages=2713–2722|issn=0022-0949|pmid=10952872}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remarkable feature of these muscles is that they do not require stimulation for each muscle contraction. Hence, they are called ''asynchronous muscles'' because the number of contractions in these muscles do not correspond (or synchronize) with the number of action potentials. For example, a wing muscle of a tethered fly may receive action potentials at a frequency of 3&amp;nbsp;Hz but it is able to beat at a frequency of 120&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name = "Alexander 2003"/&gt; The high frequency beating is made possible because the muscles are connected to a [[Resonance|resonant]] system, which is driven to a natural frequency of vibration.

==History==
[[Image:galvani-frogs-legs-electricity.jpg|thumb|right|Electrodes touch a frog, and the legs twitch into the upward position&lt;ref&gt;David Ames Wells, ''The science of common things: a familiar explanation of the first, 323 pages ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ajQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Galvani%20frog%20leg&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q=Galvani%20frog%20leg&amp;f=false page 290])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1780, [[Luigi Galvani]] discovered that the muscles of dead frogs' legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark.&lt;ref name=Whittaker&gt;{{citation|last=Whittaker|first= E. T.|title=A history of the theories of aether and electricity. Vol 1| publisher=Nelson, London |year=1951|url =https://archive.org/details/historyoftheorie00whitrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first forays into the study of [[bioelectricity]], a field that still studies the electrical patterns and signals in tissues such as nerves and muscles.

In 1952, the term excitation–contraction coupling was coined to describe the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response.&lt;ref name="Sandow A 1952 176–201"/&gt; This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, whereby the electrical stimulus is usually an action potential and the mechanical response is contraction. Excitation–contraction coupling can be dysregulated in many diseases.Though excitation–contraction coupling has been known for over half a century, it is still an active area of biomedical research. The general scheme is that an action potential arrives to depolarize the cell membrane. By mechanisms specific to the muscle type, this depolarization results in an increase in cytosolic [[calcium]] that is called a calcium transient. This increase in calcium activates calcium-sensitive contractile proteins that then use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to cause cell shortening.

The mechanism for muscle contraction evaded scientists for years and requires continued research and updating.&lt;ref name="Huxley 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=H. E.|date=April 2000|title=Past, Present and Future Experiments on Muscle|journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences|volume=355|issue=1396|pages=539–543|doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0595|jstor=3066716 .|pmc=1692762}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sliding filament theory was independently developed by [[Andrew F. Huxley]] and [[Rolf Niedergerke]] and by [[Hugh Huxley]] and [[Jean Hanson]]. Their findings were published as two consecutive papers published in the 22 May 1954 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' under the common theme "Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction".&lt;ref name="Huxley AF, Niedergerke R 1954 971–973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huxley H, Hanson J 1954 973–976"/&gt;

'''Nivia Sports''' is an Indian [[sports equipment]] manufacturer based in [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]], under the banner of FreeWill Sports Pvt Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Nivia Sports |url=http://www.niviasports.com/#/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm makes athletic equipment such as footwear, apparel, and accessories for [[Association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[badminton]], [[basketball]], and [[tennis]]. It has partnered with many national sports events in India.

==History==
===Early days===
FreeWill Sports Pvt Ltd was incorporated in 1934 in Sialkot by Nihal Chand Kharbanda. In 1962, Vijay Kharbanda joined his father in business and set up Nivia Sports. The 1947 partition of the country saw the company shift its base from Sialkot to Mumbai, and from Mumbai to Meerut, finally settling in Jalandhar. In 1962, Vijay Kharbanda joined as the Chief Managing Director (CMD) of the company with his father and started manufacturing a full range of leather hand stitched balls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-06-12/news/50536569_1_sports-industry-fifa-world-cup-jalandhar | title=Hand Stitched Nivia Balls}}&lt;/ref&gt; for soccer, volleyball, handball, and basketball under Nivia Sports.

===Name===
The name "Nivia" was derived from the combination of the initials of the name of Nihal Chand Kharbanda, founder of Nivia Sports, and Vijay Kharbanda: "NI" from "Nihal" and "VI" from "Vijay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aakanksha N | last=Bhardwaj | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/man-who-blazed-a-trail-gave-sports-industry-a-firm-foothold/424973.html|title=Man who blazed a trail, gave sports industry a firm foothold|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=22 March 2018 | newspaper=The Tribune | location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vijay Kharbanda provided priority to local people and talents who were less educated and unemployed. He empowered thousands of people by providing them employment along with encouraging them to improve and develop their skills.

===Recognition===
The initiatives of Nivia Sports to shape the sports segment of the world are appreciable. Former President of India, [[Zail Singh|Gyani Zail Singh]], awarded the Udhyog Pattar to Vijay Kharbanda, the Managing Director of Nivia Sports, in the 1980s for his outstanding contribution to the sports industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewill.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=27#h1980|title=Gyani Zial Singh awarded Vijay Kharbanda|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
Since 1991, Rajesh Kharbanda has been the Managing Director and CEO of Nivia Sports. As a board member of the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry, he initiated, introduced and engaged Nivia Sports with national and international bodies like FIFA, All India Basketball Federation, [[All India Football Federation]], [[Volleyball Federation of India]], and [[Handball Federation of India]]. He is an associate member and office bearer at various trade and business associations including the Sports Goods Foundation of India, and the Sports Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajesh-kharabanda-54843614/|title=Rajesh Kharbanda Nivia Sports|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2017, Vijay Kharbanda died. He was 77 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aakanksha N Bhardwaj | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/man-who-blazed-a-trail-gave-sports-industry-a-firm-foothold/424973.html|title=Man who blazed a trail, gave sports industry a firm foothold|date=19 June 2017|accessdate=15 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Nivia Sports produces sports products in India which have been sponsored and used in national and international tournaments, leagues and championships. It includes the categories of [[sports equipment]], apparel, footwear, and accessories.

===Football===
[[File:1950s Nivia Football.png|thumb|Nivia Sports hand-stitched football in 1960s]]
Nivia Sports is the first Indian sports equipment manufacturer to produce hand stitched balls, including [[football]]s. In the 1950s, under Freewill Sports Pvt Ltd, Nivia Sports started manufacturing hand stitched leather footballs, [[basketball]]s, and [[volleyball]]s. They had an opportunity to export balls to international markets and exported their first consignment of 30 balls to [[Indonesia]]. In the 1960s the Nivia football received the approval of National Institute of Sports, Patiala, Punjab, India. Its football became the official ball for the National Football Championship and for the [[All India Football Federation]] (AIFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewill.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=27#h1960|title=Nivia Production History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, Nivia was selected as the official ball for the International Football Tournament Jawaharlal Nehru Gold Cup and South Asian Federation (SAF) Games. Nivia earned the FIFA certification for the football in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewill.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=27#h1990|title=FIFA Certified|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antrix====
[[File:Nivia-Antrix-raavimohantydelhi.jpg|thumb|Nivia's Antrix football was the official match ball for the Goa Super Cup 2017]]
Nivia Antrix football is made from high quality organic and synthetic rubber. The material used for this has been originated from India. Antrix is certified as a 'FIFA Quality PRO' ball by FIFA. This is a hand-stitched football with 32 panels covered by four layers of polyester fabric. The quality and standard of materials and functionality of Antrix is verified by FIFA to include it in the list of FIFA Quality PRO certification. This has been the official match football for Goa Super League 2017. Since the Goa super cup league is known as youth football tournament, this ball is also called as youth football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-in/news/youth-football-goa-super-cup-announces-nivia-antrix-as/lmztguwnvhys1mqkrlo1bs06j|title=Youth football: Goa Super Cup Announces Nivia Antrix as official match-ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing director of Nivia Rajesh Kharabanda, and President of Mizoram Football Association Lal Thanzara, have signed an agreement to use Antrix as the Mizoram state football. The Antrix football has also been declared as the official match ball for Mizoram Premier League and other Mizoram football associations' tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/mizoram-fa-to-partner-with-nivia-1|title=Mizoram FA to partner with Nivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ashtang====
[[File:Nivia Ashtang Football.jpg|thumb|Nivia Ashtang football is the official ball for Hero Super League 2018-19.]]
Nivia Ashtang football is also certified as a FIFA Quality PRO match ball. This is another hand-stitched football by Nivia which has passed through quality parameters by FIFA. The fitness of the football was tested at a FIFA-designated laboratory in Switzerland to receive certification. This ball is different from others, as it is made with 23% reduced seam length and contains eight panels instead of 32. Due to having less panels, the ball provide ease of shooting and kicking for players.

Ashtang also has been the official match ball for Hero Indian Super League 2018-19. This will be used for ten clubs throughout the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mumbailive.com/en/football/fifa-pro-certified-nivia-ashtang-is-the-official-football-for-hero-indian-super-league-27316|title=fifa pro certified nivia Ashtang is the official football for hero indian super league}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nivia Sports has also produced and sponsored other accessories related to football, such as shoes, team wear, goal keeper gloves, goal nets, training gear, shin guards, ball pumps, and stockings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niviasports.com/#!/Football/Footballs/1|title=Football Accessories|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volleyball===
[[File:Official-Volleyball-Pre-Olympic-Volleyball-Championship.png|thumb|Official ball for Pre-Olympic Volleyball Championship in 1963]]
With extensive research and technology, Nivia Sports brought a change to the sporting age. In 1960, the [[University of Leipzig]] in Germany declared the Nivia volleyball as one of the best in the world. In 1963, the Nivia volleyball was selected to be used as the official ball in the Pre-Olympic Volleyball Championship organised in New Delhi, India by a panel of international referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewill.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=27#h1960|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nivia has also sponsored volleyball accessories like shoes, team wear, antennae, nets and other sportswear and bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niviasports.com/#!/Volleyball/Volleyballs/7|title=Volleyball Accessories|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
[[File:Nivia Basketball, Top Grip, BB-195, Jan2017.jpg|thumb|Nivia basketball]]
Nivia makes handmade balls. A [[basketball]] starts as a blob of rubber and is squeezed through a machine over and over to flatten it to 0.5 - 1mm. Then it is cut and molded into a round shape. This is the bladder that holds air. The bladder is inflated and woven around with nylon thread. This strengthens the balls and helps them stay round. When the mummy-looking balls get their skins they finally start looking like basketballs. Their rough edges are smoothed and lines are drawn by hand, using one careful stroke at a time. Before the balls are ready for the courts, they are checked for air leaks for 24 hours. A sample goes through a shooting test. The ball is shot at a speed of 25&amp;nbsp;mph at an iron plate of thickness of 1 inch, 2000 times. Then its diameter is measured in several spots to see if the ball has kept its round shape. Finally, after quality checks, the balls are deflated for dispatching to tournaments. Covering the entire process, every three seconds, Nivia makes one ball. [[CNNMoney]] showed the making of basketballs in Nivia's factory at [[Jalandhar]] ([[Punjab]]), India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/cnnmoney/2017/04/27/in-the-making-blob-of-rubber-turn-into-basketball-orig.cnnmoney | title=In the making of Nivia's Basketball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports footwear===
[[File:Nivia-Started-Manufacturing-Footwear-in-the-1980s.png|thumb|Nivia started manufacturing sports footwear in the 1980s.]] 
During the 1980s, Nivia Sports started manufacturing sports footwear in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewill.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=27#h1980|title=Started Manufacturing Footwear 1980|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being awarded appreciation certificate by the IX Asian Games Organizing Committee for the contribution in the success of the games and for providing support and products, Nivia added all ranges of sports footwear for use in games such as cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, lawn tennis, kabaddi, wrestling, and track &amp; field. They also produced shoelaces and gel insoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niviasports.com/#!/Footwear/Track%20&amp;%20Field/27|title=Footwear for Games|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports shoes for sports are as important as other pieces of equipment to play the game. Since 1980, Nivia manufactures sports shoes for national &amp; international tournaments and leagues. Being an official partner, it has been providing high-quality sports shoes for football, basketball, badminton, tennis, squash, track &amp; field, running, cricket, flip flops, kabbadi, wrestling, and boxing. 

====Football shoes====

'''Palam A Stadium''', also known as '''Air Force Station''' or '''Model Sports Complex''', is a cricket ground in Dwarka Road, [[Palam]], [[New Delhi]]. The ground was established in 1958, and since then it has been regular venue for cricket for [[Services cricket team]]. The ground has also hosted few matches for the [[Delhi cricket team|Delhi]] and [[Railways cricket team]]s. As of mid-2018 it has held 126 [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] and 69 [[List A cricket|List A matches]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/14/985_f.html First-Class Matches]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/14/985_a.html List A matches]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/14/985_tt.html T20 Matches]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[International Cricket Council]] approved the ground for use as a practice venue for the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]]; 19 practice sessions took place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/world-cup-2011/story/world-cup-kotla-palam-grounds-to-host-43-practice-sessions-for-six-teams-127876-2011-02-04 | title=Kotla and Palam grounds to host 43 practice sessions | date=4 February 2011 | first=Qaiser Mohammad | last=Ali | publisher=India Today | accessdate=17 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground is very close to [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]], and planes approaching the airport fly low about 100 metres south of the ground before coming in to land on the other side of Dwarka Road. Although the ground is used for [[Ranji Trophy]] matches, public entry is restricted, as the land belongs to the [[Indian Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Iyer |first1=Aditya |title=Ranji Trophy: Game Over |url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/cricket/ranji-trophy-game-over |website=openthemagazine |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] suffers from a number of hindrances, such as lack of good transport networks, general infrastructure, political instability and war, and also the extreme poverty of the country, which means it is difficult for it to maintain a proper national league structure. The DRC is a particularly large country, at 2,344,858 km2 (the 12th largest in the world), but without the necessary economy to maintain it.

The sport is centred on the national capital, [[Kinshasa]].

Like many African countries, the historical connection with [[France]] is a mixed blessing. For a number of years, Congolese rugby players would leave to play in France, which deprived the sport of any real competition in the DRC.

'''The O2 Arena''' is a multi-purpose indoor [[arena]] located in the centre of [[The O2]] entertainment complex on the [[Greenwich Peninsula]] in south east London. 

The arena was built under the former [[Millennium Dome]], a large dome shaped building built to house an exhibition celebrating the turn of the third millennium; as the dome shaped structure still stands over the arena, ''The Dome'' remains a name in common usage for the venue.  The arena, as well as the total O2 complex, is named after its primary sponsor, the telecommunications company [[O2 (UK)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

The O2 Arena has the second highest [[seating capacity]] of any indoor venue in the United Kingdom, behind the [[Manchester Arena]], but took the crown of the world's busiest music arena from New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/2788214/The-lemon-Dome-that-was-transformed-into-O2s-concert-crown.html |title=The Lemon Dome That was Transformed into O2's Concert Crown |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |first=Dominic |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest underground station to the venue is the [[North Greenwich station]] on the [[Jubilee line]].

==History==
[[File:The O2 Arena, Prince.jpg|left|thumb|[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]’s stage for his sold out performance of 2007]]
Following the closure of the [[Millennium Experience]] at the end of 2000, the [[Millennium Dome]] was leased to Meridian Delta Ltd. in December 2001, for redevelopment as an entertainment complex. This included plans for an indoor arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1717280.stm|title=New life for Millennium Dome|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|date=18 December 2001|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:O2 Arena Cutaway Image.jpg|left|thumb|Cut away image of [[The O2 (London)|The O2]] showing The O2 Arena within. {{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 9 July 2013}}]] --&gt;
Construction of the arena started in 2003, and finished in 2007. After the interior of the dome had been largely cleared and before building work inside began, in December 2004, the dome was used as the main venue for the annual Crisis Open Christmas organised by the London based homelessness charity [[Crisis (charity)|Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4129855.stm | publisher = BBC News | title=Dome sleeps 700 over festive week | date=28 December 2004 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the impossibility of using cranes inside the dome structure, the arena's roof was constructed on the ground within the dome and then lifted; the arena building's structure was then built around the roof.&lt;ref name="architect" /&gt; The arena building, which houses the arena and the arena concourse, is independent from all other buildings in the O2 and houses all the arena's facilities. The arena building itself takes up 40% of the total dome structure.

The seating arrangement throughout the whole arena can be modified, similar to the [[Manchester Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiencesystems.net/admin/presscentre/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=15 |title=wins contract at O2 Arena |publisher=Audience Systems |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground surface can also be changed between ice rink, basketball court, exhibition space, conference venue, private hire venue and concert venue.

The arena was built to reduce echoing, a common problem among London music venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6225452.stm | publisher = BBC News | title=Dome's hi-tech refit for The O2 | date=21 June 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
{{Main article|List of events at the O2 Arena}}

On 21 July 2007, British rock band [[Keane (band)| Keane]] played the arena as part of their [[Under the Iron Sea Tour]], and the performance was later released as their ''[[Keane Live]]'' DVD.

From 2008, the O2 Arena has hosted [[Capital (radio network)|Capital's]] [[Jingle Bell Ball]] which is an annual minifestival held over two nights usually in early December.

Since 2009, the arena has hosted the prestigious [[ATP World Tour Finals]], the season ending finale of men's professional tennis, featuring the top eight players in the world. In 2015 it was announced that the tournament would extend its deal to hold the tournament until 2018. The venue has hosted the event for the second longest tenure, behind only Madison Square Garden (1977–89).

During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], the venue was referred as the '''North Greenwich Arena''' due to Olympics regulations regarding corporate sponsorship of event sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/article/941349/o2-arena-forced-olympic-rebrand-following-sponsor-clash|title=O2 Arena forced into Olympic rebrand following sponsor clash|work=brandrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ariana Grande]] was scheduled to perform on 25 and 26 May 2017 as part of her [[Dangerous Woman Tour]], but the event was cancelled after the [[Manchester Arena bombing]] on 22 May. The event was not rescheduled.

Since March 2013, the arena has hosted [[C2C: Country to Country]], Europe's largest [[country music]] festival, which annually attracts over 20,000 fans. UK and Irish acts as well as up-and-coming American acts perform sets several times across various pop-up stages in and around the arena, with the main stage accessible only to ticket holders. The seventh C2C will be held on 8–10 March 2019.

==Ticket sales records==
Despite being open for only 200 days per year (the equivalent of seven months), the venue sold over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million tickets in 2007, making it the third most popular venue in the world for concerts and family shows, narrowly behind the [[Manchester Arena]] (1.25&amp;nbsp;million) and [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City (1.23&amp;nbsp;million). 

As of 2018, the O2 Arena was still the busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pollstar.com/News/2017-year-end-special-features-top-tours-promoters-venues-grosses-134154&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11375">'''Trampolining terms''' are used to describe various positions and types of skill performed in the sport of trampolining.

==Basic skills==
* Straight Jump &amp;ndash; A vertical jump with the body held straight and arms in a straight line above the body at take-off.
* Tuck Jump &amp;ndash; From a straight jump start, the knees are pulled up to the chest and the hands must at least briefly grasp the legs between the knees and ankle. 
* Pike Jump &amp;ndash; Again from a straight jump start, the legs are straight, held together and lifted parallel to the trampoline and the arms and body reach forwards towards the pointed toes.
* Straddle Jump &amp;ndash; Similar to the pike jump except that the legs are spread sideways approximately 90° apart and the arms reach forward towards the pointed toes.
* Seat Drop or Seat Landing &amp;ndash; Landing in a seated position with the legs straight. The hands support the body one either side and very slightly behind the posterior, palms down with fingers pointed towards the pointed toes.
* Seat Landing Half Twist to Seat Landing or Swivel Hips &amp;ndash; Performing a seat landing, bounce up to a straight position (without landing) and then perform a half twist and land in the second seat landing facing in the opposite direction. 
* Half Twist and Full Twist &amp;ndash; While in a straight jump position rotating the body until facing the opposite direction for a half twist or a complete 360° rotation for a full twist.
* Stomach Drop or Front Landing &amp;ndash; Landing horizontally on the bed, face down, with the arms bent to form a diamond shape with the hands overlapping slightly in front of the face. The legs should be bent slightly at the knee keeping the feet off the trampoline bed.  But otherwise held in tension for a good landing.
* Back Drop or Back Landing &amp;ndash; Landing on the bed on the back. The legs are bent up at about 90° on landing with legs held straight and the head is held in line with the body flat on the bed (to avoid whiplash injury).
* Hands and Knees 3/4 turnover &amp;ndash; Bouncing on hands and knees then making a forward rotation to land in either Back Drop, to your feet or Seat Drop.

==Intermediate skills==
* Front [[Somersault]] &amp;ndash; One complete forward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight (rarely seen other than to develop straight barani) positions. 
* Back Somersault &amp;ndash; One complete backward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight positions.
* Side Somersault &amp;ndash; One complete left or right rotation; this is usually performed tucked, but advanced variations include piked: straight legs (bent body). The straight position is impossible as the asymmetry will develop severe twisting and transform the side somersault into a back somersault.

==Advanced skills==
* [[Berani flip|Barani]] &amp;ndash; A front somersault with a half twist before landing; also known as a front-half.
* 3/4 front (Crash Dive) &amp;ndash; Three quarter straight front somersault that lands in the back drop position. 
* 1 and 3/4 front (1 and 3, 217) &amp;ndash; One and three quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the back drop position.
* 2 and 3/4 front (2 and 3, 317) &amp;ndash; Two and three quarter front somersault that lands in the back drop position.
* 1 and 1/4 front &amp;ndash; One and one quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the front drop position.
* 2 and 1/4 front &amp;ndash; Two and one quarter front somersault that lands in the front drop position.
* 3/4 back (Lazy Back, Easy Back) &amp;ndash;  Three quarter straight back somersault that lands in front drop position.
* 1 and 3/4 back (Suicide) &amp;ndash;  One and three quarter back somersault that lands in front drop position.
* 1 and 1/4 back &amp;ndash; One and one quarter back somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the back drop position.
* 2 and 1/4 back &amp;ndash; Two and one quarter back somersault that lands in the back drop position.
* Pullover &amp;ndash; Three quarter back somersault from back drop position that lands on feet. 
* Ballout &amp;ndash; One and one quarter front somersault from back drop position that lands on feet. Usually performed after Crash Dive.
* Cody &amp;ndash; One and one quarter back somersault from front drop position that lands on feet. Usually performed after Lazy Back.
* Kaboom &amp;ndash; Three quarter back somersault from back drop position that lands on feet following the heels being bounced off the canvas.
* Zack &amp;ndash; Three quarter front somersault from front drop position that lands on feet following a 'kaboom'.
* Arabian &amp;ndash;  Early ½ twist into back somersault with initial take-off being consistent with forward rotation.
* Front Full &amp;ndash; A full-twisting straight front somersault
* Rudolph (or Rudy) &amp;ndash; A single straight front somersault with one and a half twists.
* Back Full (or Full) &amp;ndash; A full-twisting straight back somersault.
* Full in or Full out &amp;ndash; A double back somersault with a full twist in the first or second somersault respectively.
* Full in triff &amp;ndash; A triple back somersault with a full twist in the first somersault. 
* Full in quadriff &amp;ndash; A quadruple back somersault with a full twist in the first somersault. 
* Full out in &amp;ndash; A triple back somersault with a full twist in the second somersault. 
* Full out triff &amp;ndash; A triple back somersault with a full twist in the third somersault. 
* Front Full in &amp;ndash; A double front somersault with a full twist in the first somersault.
* Full in full out &amp;ndash; A double back somersault with a full twist in each somersault.

* Frydolph &amp;ndash; A single front somersault with four and a half twists.
* Frydolph Plus/ Robodolph &amp;ndash; A single front somersault with five and a half twists.
* A note about twisting somersaults - although it is not impossible to associate different amount of twist with either front or back somersaults it is universal practice that front twisting somersaults will always have an odd half twist while back twisting somersaults will always have a round number of twists. This is to make it easier for the performer to 'spot' the bed prior to landing.
* Somersaults may be performed in one of four positions: tuck, pike, straight (or layout), and puck. The tuck position is considered the least difficult. Somersaults done in pike or straight position are more difficult, and each complete rotation is awarded a 0.1 bonus to Degree of Difficulty. Puck position is a body position intermediate between tuck and pike, and is used in multiple twisting somersaults.
* Gtramp &amp;ndash; Gtramp (short for garden trampoline and also known as freestyle trampoline) is a less technical and  non-competitive version of trampolining. It is a growing sport with tens of thousands of participants and whose athletes usually consist of teenage boys, however there are a few athletes who are younger or older and there is a small amount of girls involved in it as well. It’s usually practiced at home on a backyard trampoline as the athletes perform and use almost all of the terms listed above and link them together to form combos (short for combinations). The athletes take creative approaches to their tricks as well and do many stomach open ups (tricks landing in the front drop position to perform any variant of the skill ‘cody’). Less commonly seen are over-rotations (tricks landing in the back drop position to perform any variant of the skill ‘kaboom’). There is little to no form of instruction or specific techniques to perform skills with in this sport. The athletes connect and bond over the social media platform Instagram, where they have thousands of followers and post their own flips and support others as they do the same. They also set up informal ‘meet ups’ where they get together and ‘tramp’. I partake in this kind of trampolining and it’s a very fun thing to do and I encourage anyone who’s interested to join the community.

==Competition Terms==
* [[Degree of Difficulty]] (DD) or Tariff &amp;ndash; A score added to the execution score which reflects the difficulty of the skills included in the routine.
* Voluntary or Optional Routine (Vol) &amp;ndash; A routine comprising skills chosen by the athlete or coach to reflect their best performance. Usually the routine must have a minimum (and sometimes at lower skill levels, a maximum) degree of difficulty.
* Compulsory Routine (Set) &amp;ndash; A routine which has a set list of skills and a set order which must be followed by all athletes in a competition. No degree of difficulty marks are given for this routine; the marks are purely for execution.
* Time of flight (ToF) &amp;ndash; A score added to the execution score which reflects the time the gymnast spends in the air when performing the routine.
* Horizontal Displacement (HD score) &amp;ndash; A score added to the total score. The score is calculated by how much the athlete is out of the "box" during the routine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The '''Vierde Klasse''' ({{lang-en|Fourth Class}}) is the ninth tier of [[football in the Netherlands]] and the seventh tier of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Amateur sports|amateur football]]. This is the lowest league in the West II region. The league is divided into 67 divisions, 27 played on Saturday and 40 on Sunday.

Each division consists of 12 to 14 teams. The champions are promoted to the [[Derde Klasse]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voetbalrotterdam.nl/2011/08/knvb-verandert-promotiedegradatieregeling-in-vierde-klasse-alleen-kampioen-promoveert/&lt;/ref&gt; the bottom two teams are relegated to the [[Vijfde Klasse]] (only in districts where a Vijfde Klasse exists). Each season is divided into a number of periods ({{lang-nl|periodes}}). The winner of these periods qualify for promotion playoffs, provided they finish in the top nine overall in the season. The teams finishing third from bottom in the final rankings play relegation playoffs.
