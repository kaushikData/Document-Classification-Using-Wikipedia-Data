{{RomanMilitary}}

The '''Antonine Wall''', known to the Romans as ''Vallum Antonini'', was a [[sod|turf]] [[fortification]] on stone foundations, built by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] across what is now the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]], between the [[Firth of Forth]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Representing the northernmost frontier barrier of the [[Roman Empire]], it spanned approximately {{convert|63|km|0|abbr=off}} and was about {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|5|m|0|abbr=off}} wide. [[Lidar]] scans have been carried out to establish the length of the wall and the Roman distance units used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krakowka|first1=Kathryn|title=Meticulous metric survey of the Antonine Wall|url=https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/meticulous-metric-survey-of-the-antonine-wall.htm|website=Current Archaeology|accessdate=28 April 2018|date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security was bolstered by a deep [[ditch]] on the northern side. It is thought that there was a wooden [[palisade]] on top of the turf. The barrier was the second of two "great walls" created by the Romans in what the English once called [[Northern Britain]]. Its ruins are less evident than the better-known [[Hadrian's Wall]] to the south, primarily because the turf and wood wall has largely weathered away, unlike its stone-built southern predecessor.

Construction began in AD 142 at the order of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], and took about 12 years to complete. Antoninus Pius never visited Britain, whereas his predecessor [[Hadrian]] did. Pressure from the [[Caledonians]] may have led Antoninus to send the empire's troops further north. The Antonine Wall was protected by 16 forts with small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the Caledonians in decorative slabs, twenty of which survive. The wall was abandoned only eight years after completion, and the garrisons relocated back to Hadrian's Wall. In 208 Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] re-established legions at the wall and ordered repairs; this has led to the wall being referred to as the [[Wall of Severus|Severan Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Simon|last2=Hughes|first2=Tristan|title=The Scottish Campaigns of Septimius Severus|url=http://turningpointsoftheancientworld.com/index.php/2018/03/18/scottish-campaigns-septimius-severus/|accessdate=21 May 2018|agency=Turning Points Of The Ancient World|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation ended a few years later, and the wall was never fortified again. Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time, but some remains are visible. Many of these have come under the care of [[Historic Scotland]] and the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Antonine Wall Management Plan 2014-19|url=http://www.antoninewall.org/system/files/documents/494733_283836_Antonine_Wall_MP_WEB_20131125134011.pdf#page=7|website=Antonine Wall|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and construction==
[[File:Antonine Wall - geograph.org.uk - 49196.jpg|thumb|300px|Stone foundation of the Wall in Bearsden]]

[[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]] ordered the construction of the Antonine Wall around 142.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Anne S. (1960) ''The Antonine Wall''. Glasgow Archaeological Society. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]], governor of [[Roman Britain]] at the time, initially supervised the effort, which took about twelve years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, David J. (2006) ''The Antonine Wall''. Edinburgh. John Donald. {{ISBN|0-85976-655-1}} p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The wall stretches {{convert|63|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[Old Kilpatrick]] in [[West Dunbartonshire]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] to [[Carriden House|Carriden]] near [[Bo'ness]] on the [[Firth of Forth]]. The wall was intended to extend Roman territory and dominance by replacing [[Hadrian's Wall]] {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south, as the frontier of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]''. But while the Romans did establish many forts and temporary camps further north of the Antonine Wall in order to protect their routes to the north of Scotland, they did not conquer the [[Caledonians]], and the Antonine Wall suffered many attacks. The Romans called the land north of the wall ''[[Caledonia (Roman)|Caledonia]]'', though in some contexts the term may refer to the whole area north of Hadrian's Wall.

The Antonine Wall was shorter than Hadrian's Wall and built of [[Sod|turf]] on a stone foundation, but it was still an impressive achievement. The stone foundations and wing walls of the original forts demonstrate that the original plan was to build a stone wall similar to Hadrian's Wall, but this was quickly amended. As built, the wall was typically a bank, about four metres (13&amp;nbsp;feet) high, made of layered turves and occasionally earth with a wide [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] on the north side, and a [[Roman road|military way]] on the south. The Romans initially planned to build forts every {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}}, but this was soon revised to every {{convert|3.3|km|0|abbr=off}}, resulting in a total of nineteen forts along the wall. The best preserved but also one of the smallest forts is [[Rough Castle Fort]]. In addition to the forts, there are at least 9 smaller fortlets, very likely on Roman mile spacings, which formed part of the original scheme, some of which were later replaced by forts.&lt;ref name="L.Keppie, Scotland's Roman Remains 1986"&gt;L.Keppie, Scotland's Roman Remains. Edinburgh 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The most visible fortlet is Kinneil, at the eastern end of the Wall, near Bo'ness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/antoninewall.htm Historic Scotland - Looking after our heritage - The Antonine Wall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was once a remarkable Roman structure within sight of the Antonine Wall at [[Stenhousemuir]]. This was [[Arthur's O'on]], a circular stone domed monument or [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], which may have been a temple, or a [[Tropaion|''tropaeum'']], a victory monument. It was demolished for its stone in 1743, though a replica exists at [[Penicuik House]].

In addition to the line of the Wall itself there are a number of coastal forts both in the East (e.g. [[Inveresk]]) and West (Outerwards and Lurg Moor), which should be considered as outposts and/or supply bases to the Wall itself. In addition a number of forts farther north were brought back into service in the [[Gask Ridge]] area, including [[Ardoch fort|Ardoch]], [[Strageath]], [[Bertha (Perth)]]&lt;ref name="L.Keppie, Scotland's Roman Remains 1986"/&gt; and probably Dalginross and Cargill.&lt;ref&gt;D.J.Woolliscroft &amp; B.Hoffmann, Romes First Frontier.

Recent research by Glasgow University has shown that the distance stones, stone sculptures unique to the Antonine Wall which were embedded in the wall to mark the lengths built by each legion, were brightly painted unlike their present bare appearance.&lt;ref&gt;University News: https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_579010_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; These stones are preserved in the University's [[Hunterian Collection|museum]] and are said to be the best-preserved examples of statuary from any Roman frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brock |first1=John F. |title=THE DISTANCE SLABS OF THE ANTONINE WALL : The Surveyors' Record Carved in Stone! |url=https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2018/papers/fig09a/FIG09A_brock_9217.pdf#page=17 |website=International Federation of Surveyors |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the slabs have been analysed by various techniques including portable [[X-ray fluorescence]] (pXRF).

[[File:Antonine wall.JPG|thumb|alt=swale with wall foundation|The Antonine Wall, looking east, from [[Bar Hill Fort|Bar Hill]] between [[Twechar]] and [[Croy, North Lanarkshire|Croy]]]]

==Abandonment==
The wall was abandoned only eight years after completion{{citation needed|reason=Some materials claims either abandoned Antonine Wall was after Antonines' death in 161 (https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/wall-antoninus) and others says that was in 162 (http://www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk/central_west_scotland/bearsden_roman_fort.html) or even 163 (http://roman-britain.co.uk/frontier/antonine_wall.htm)|date=November 2018}}, when the [[Roman legion]]s withdrew to [[Hadrian's Wall]] in 162, and over time may have reached an accommodation with the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] tribes of the area, whom they may have fostered as possible [[buffer state]]s which would later become [[Hen Ogledd|"The Old North"]]. After a series of attacks in 197, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] arrived in Scotland in 208 to secure the frontier, and repaired parts of the wall. Although this re-occupation only lasted a few years, the wall is sometimes referred to by later Roman historians as the '''[[Wall of Severus|Severan Wall]]'''. This led to later scholars like [[Bede]] mistaking references to the Antonine Wall for ones to [[Hadrian's Wall#After Hadrian|Hadrian's Wall]].

==Post-Roman history==
In the centuries since the Antonine Wall lay abandoned it had an influence over culture between the Forth and the Clyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maldonado |first1=Adrián |title=The Early Medieval Antonine Wall |journal=Britannia |date=November 2015 |volume=46 |pages=225 – 245 |doi=10.1017/S0068113X15000124 |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39051785/Maldonado_2015_-_Early_Medieval_Antonine_Wall.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1531157578&amp;Signature=3Ld1chp3LO7qu327sHMhDEP0sjE%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Early_Medieval_Antonine_Wall.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2018|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gildas and Bede===

Writing in AD 730, [[Bede]] following Gildas mistakenly ascribes the construction of the Antonine Wall to the Britons in [[s:Ecclesiastical History of the English People/Book 1#5|''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.12]]:

{{quote|text=The islanders built the wall which they had been told to raise, not of stone, since they had no workmen capable of such a work, but of sods, made it of no use. Nevertheless, they carried it for many miles between the two bays or inlets of the sea of which we have spoken; to the end that where the protection of the water was wanting, they might use the rampart to defend their borders from the irruptions of the enemies. Of the work there erected, that is, of a rampart of great breadth and height, there are evident remains to be seen at this day [AD 730]. It begins at about two miles distance from the monastery of Aebbercurnig [Abercorn], west of it, at a place called in the Pictish language Peanfahel, but in the English tongue, Penneltun [Kinneil], and running westward, ends near the city of Aicluith [Dumbarton].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bede ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book I Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bede associated Gildas' turf wall with the Antonine Wall. As for Hadrian's Wall, Bede again follows Gildas:
{{quote|text= [the departing Romans] thinking that it might be some help to the allies [Britons], whom they were forced to abandon, constructed a strong stone wall from sea to sea, in a straight line between the towns that had been there built for fear of the enemy, where Severus also had formerly built a rampart.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bede ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book I Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bede obviously identified Gildas' stone wall as Hadrian's Wall, but he sets its construction in the 5th century rather than the 120s, and does not mention Hadrian. And he would appear to have deduced that the ditch-and-mound barrier known as the Vallum (just to the south of, and contemporary with, Hadrian's Wall) was the rampart constructed by Severus. Many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/s_wall.htm], From Dot to Domesday website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grim's Dyke===
In [[medieval]] histories, such as the chronicles of [[John of Fordun]], the wall is called ''Gryme's dyke''. Fordun says that the name came from the grandfather of the imaginary king Eugenius son of Farquahar. This evolved over time into Graham's dyke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Additional DESCRIPTION OF THE ROMAN WALL, IN SCOTLAND|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/camden/william/britannia-gibson-1722/part159.html|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camden|first1=William|title=Britannia, or, A chorographical description of Great Britain and Ireland, together with the adjacent islands|date=1722|publisher=Printed by Mary Matthews, for Awnsham Churchill, and sold by William Taylor ...|location=London|pages=1283–1292|edition=vol 2|url=https://archive.org/stream/gri_britanniaora02camd#page/n375/mode/2up|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a name still found in [[Bo'ness]] at the wall's eastern end – and then linked with [[Clan Graham]]. Of note is that Graeme in some parts of Scotland is a nickname for the devil, and Gryme's Dyke would thus be the Devil's Dyke, mirroring the name of the Roman [[Limes]] in Southern Germany often called 'Teufelsmauer'. Grímr and Grim are bynames for [[Odin]] or [[Wodan]], who might be credited with the wish to build earthworks in unreasonably short periods of time. This name is the same one found as ''Grim's Ditch'' several times in England in connection with early ramparts: for example, near [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], Oxfordshire or between [[Berkhamsted]] (Herts) and [[Bradenham, Buckinghamshire|Bradenham]] (Bucks). Other names used by antiquarians include the Wall of Pius and the Antonine Vallum, after Antoninus Pius.&lt;ref&gt;Earthwork of England: prehistoric, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman and mediæval - Page 496, by Arthur Hadrian Allcroft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club - Page 255, by Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, Hereford, England, G. H. Jack, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hector Boece]] in his 1527 ''History of Scotland'' called it the "wall of [[Abercorn]]", repeating the story that it had been destroyed by Graham.&lt;ref&gt;Boece, Hector, ''Historia Gentis Scotorum'', (1527), book 7, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided accurate and detailed drawings of its remains, and where the wall has been destroyed by later development, his maps and drawings are now the only reliable record of it.

== In fiction ==
The Antonine Wall is mentioned in [[Max Brooks]]' novel ''[[World War Z]]: An Oral History of the Zombie War'' (2006) as the last line of defense in Great Britain against the [[zombies]].

The Northern Wall is also depicted in some of [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s historical fiction novels: as a fully functioning outpost of Roman power in ''[[The Mark of the Horse Lord]]'' (1965) and as an abandoned ruin in ''Frontier Wolf'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1980|author=Sutcliff, Rosemary|title=Frontier Wolf|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1195090.Frontier_Wolf}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Arch Street Theatre''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] was during the 19th century one of the three main Philadelphia theaters for plays; the other two were the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] and the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]]. The Arch Street Theatre opened on 1 October 1828 under the management of [[William B. Wood (actor)|William B. Wood]]. The building's architect was [[John Haviland]].&lt;ref name=FreeLibrary&gt;[https://libwww.freelibrary.org/digital/item/39189 Arch Street Theatre, Free Library of Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building which housed the Arch Street Theatre was located between 6th and 7th Streets at 819 [[Arch Street (Philadelphia)|Arch Street]]. Famous performers, such as [[Fanny Davenport]], [[Joseph Jefferson]], and [[Charlotte Cushman]], played at what was popularly called "The Arch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pawlak, Debra Ann|title=The Lady in Charge|journal=Pennsylvania Heritage Magazine|volume=XL|number=3|date=Summer 2014|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/pa-heritage/louisa-lane-drew-lady-in-charge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wilkes Booth]] joined the theatre's stock company in 1857 and played for a full season. He appeared occasionally at the Arch during the 1850s and early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/5117 Arch Street Theatre, Historical Society of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s [[Edwin Forrest]] played many successful roles at the Arch, and several original plays written at his request debuted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hornblow, Arthur|title=A History of the Theatre in America|page=309|volume=vol. 2|year=1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 the Arch Street Theatre had an entire company of American actors, which was a first for American theater companies.&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp40&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b113925;view=1up;seq=60|title=Autobiographical sketch of Mrs. John Drew|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The managers were William Forrest, William Duffy, and William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludlow, Noah Miller|title=Dramatic life as I found it|year=1880|pages=314–315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYkVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company included [[James Edward Murdoch|James E. Murdoch]].&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp40/&gt;

In 1860 the stockholders of the Arch suggested that [[Louisa Lane Drew]] should assume the management, and in 1861 the theatre was opened under the name "Mrs. John Drew's Arch Street Theatre".  Louisa Lane Drew was the grandmother of Lionel, Ethel and John Barrymore.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Barrymores, Margot Peters&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|For the next thirty-one years the theatre-going public was treated to one of the greatest of all American stock companies. After Drew's tenure ended in 1892 the theatre's stature went into a slow decline until the building itself was demolished in 1936.&lt;ref name=FreeLibrary/&gt;}}

During the third season under Louisa Lane Drew's management, [[Lester Wallack]], [[Edward Loomis Davenport|E. L. Davenport]], and [[Edwin Booth]] acted at the Arch.&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp110&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b113925;view=1up;seq=128|title=Autobiographical sketch of Mrs. John Drew|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1863 the theatre was pulled down and rebuilt (with red plush seats and crystal chandeliers) from the stage to the façade;&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp110/&gt; the seating capacity was one thousand, nine-hundred eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/pj_display.cfm/16554 Arch Street Theatre, philadelphiabuildings.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 [[Moishe Finkel|Morris Finkel]] rented the Arch Street Theatre and presented Yiddish theater for several months, including one week of performances by [[Keni Liptzin]]; however Finkel soon abandoned the project and the Arch returned to vaudeville. In 1909 Mike (Mordechai) Thomashefsky took over the Arch and presented both vaudeville and Yiddish theatre until his death in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/jqp-archstreet.htm The Arch Street Theatre, The Jewish Quarter of Philadelphia, The Museum of Family History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-mike.htm Mike (Mordechai) Thomashefsky, LIves in the Yiddish Theatre, Museum of Family History]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20855">The '''Architecture of Macau''' is the architecture that is found in [[Macau]]. Macau has diverse architecture from the casinos in its casino region to its tallest building, [[Grand Lisboa]] (which stands at 258 metres). Macau is influenced by both [[Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] cultures.

== Background ==
[[Macau]] is a large city located off the south coast of [[Mainland China]], with a population of approximately 630,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/macau-population/|title=Macau Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official native languages being [[Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Macau is classified as a special administrative region (SAR), meaning it has separate executive, legislative and judicial systems to China. Macau was previously a Portuguese dependency, which ended in 1999 when it became autonomous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/special-administrative-region.asp|title=Special Administrative Region - SAR|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2013-01-06|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[architecture]] of Macau encompasses a mixture of [[World Heritage site|world heritage]] listed and modern buildings, as well as multiple [[Bridge|bridges]] and [[Tunnel|tunnels]]. 

== Casinos in Macau ==
[[File:Casinos, Macao, 2013-08-08, DD 01.jpg|thumb|Cluster of casinos in Macau.]]
Within the region of Macau, there is a total of 50 [[Casino|Casinos]] spread across the cities of Macau, [[Cotai]] and [[Taipa]]. Being known as the ‘[[Las Vegas]] of China’, Macau has a substantial amount of casinos compared to other regions, with 30 in the city of Macau, 14 in Cotai and 6 in Taipa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcasinodirectory.com/macau/casino-list|title=Macau Casino List|website=www.worldcasinodirectory.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An example of a famous Casino in Macau is the ‘[[MGM Macau|MGM MACAU]]’, which stands at 154 metres tall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgm.mo/en/macau/about-us/property-overview|title=Property Overview {{!}} MGM MACAU|website=www.mgm.mo|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is located near the southern coast of the northern region of Macau&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/MGM+Macau/@22.1771959,113.5362327,12.75z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x7bb2ff131ed87a29!5m1!1s2018-10-28!8m2!3d22.1860312!4d113.5478016|title=MGM Macau|website=MGM Macau|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other casinos in Macau include the [[Grand Lisboa]] Casino &amp; Hotel, [[Wynn Macau|Wynn Casino Macau]] and [[Sands Macao|Sands Macao Hotel]], all of which are clustered around each other and near the MGM MACAU. This architectural cluster centralises the casinos near the southern coast of Macau, creating a ‘hub’ for [[gambling]] and accommodation.

== Tall buildings in Macau ==
Within the [[region]] of Macau, there are 20 completed buildings and 2 under construction that are above 150 metres tall, which ranks Macau as #48 in the world by number of buildings over 150 metres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/city/macau|title=Macau - The Skyscraper Center|website=www.skyscrapercenter.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Macau's first building over 150m was the [[Bank of China Building, Macau|Bank of China]], which is located in the City of Macau and currently stands at 163m (535 feet) tall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/bank-of-china/3179|title=Bank of China - The Skyscraper Center|website=www.skyscrapercenter.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Artists and repertoire''' ('''A&amp;R''') is the division of a [[record label]] or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of [[recording artist]]s and songwriters.&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&amp;R.

==Responsibilities==

===Finding talent===
The A&amp;R division of a record label is responsible for finding new [[recording artist]]s and bringing those artists to the record company. Personnel in the A&amp;R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&amp;R people are often young and many are musicians, [[music journalists]] or [[record producers]].{{sfn|Albini|1993}}

An A&amp;R executive is authorized to offer a [[record contract]], often in the form of a "deal memo": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company.{{sfn|Albini|1993}} The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival [[entertainment lawyer]]s hired by the musician's [[artist manager|manager]] and the record company.{{sfn|Krasilovsky|Shemel|Gross|Feinstein|2007}}

A&amp;R executives rely mostly on the [[word of mouth]] of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}} They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}}

===Overseeing the recording process===
The A&amp;R division of a record label oversees the [[sound recording|recording]] and format process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e.[[Wiktionary:repertoire|repertoire]]) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&amp;R person will assist in finding songs and songwriters. A&amp;R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing companies]] to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.

As the record nears completion, the A&amp;R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to [[marketing|market]] the record on radio.

===Assisting with marketing and promotion===
Once the record is completed, the A&amp;R department consults with marketing, [[radio promotion|promotion]], the [[recording artist|artist]] and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.

==History and influence==
The tastes of particular A&amp;R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond]] discovered [[Billie Holiday]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating "commercial" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records.{{sfn|Prial|2006}} [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as [[The Tubes]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] during his career. [[David Geffen Company|Geffen Records]]' Gary Gersh signed the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] at a time when [[alternative rock]] music was not considered commercial.{{sfn|Shoemer|1992}} Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings.{{sfn|Goldberg|2009|p=179-180}} In cases like these, A&amp;R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.

This kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&amp;R executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, [[Columbia Records]]' A&amp;R man in the 1950s, [[Mitch Miller]], favored traditional pop singers like [[Guy Mitchell]] and [[Patti Page]], and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]].

This "trend following" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including [[teen pop]] (1998–2001), [[alternative rock]] (1993–1996), [[glam metal]] (1986–1991) and [[disco]] (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Disco boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=15–35}}. Teen pop boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=}}. Knopper discusses the way the industry has overreacted to these waves throughout his book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but business people. Traditionally A&amp;R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – [[Atlantic Records]]'s heads [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] were producers and composers respectively – but an A&amp;R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] being notable recent exceptions.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Richard_Niles_Interview.html |title=Interview with Richard Niles |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=23 Apr 2007 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer and arranger [[Richard Niles]] has said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&amp;R staff are businessmen. They’re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, "Go out and get me anything that's popular now."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hip hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&amp;R executive in their single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", metaphorically likening them to "mountain climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan: 10 of the best|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/wu-tang-clan-10-of-the-best|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan Still Sting|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/wu-tang-clan-still-sting-2151230|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
According to [[Rhythm King Records]] and [[Lizard King Records]] founder Martin Heath, the A&amp;R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MartinHeath.html |title=Interview With Martin Heath |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=12 December 2005 |accessdate=20 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If scouts are chasing a band, you’ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well," he said in an interview with [[HitQuarters]].&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&amp;R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

==Recent changes==
{{See also|2000s in the music industry}}

New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&amp;R.{{sfn|Kusek|Leonhard|2005}} In the wake of [[Music industry in the 21st century|declining record sales]], a large number of A&amp;R staffers have been terminated.{{sfn|Knopper|2009|pp=220–221}} It is unclear whether A&amp;R executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.

The '''Arts in Australia''' refers to the art produced in the area of, on the subject of, or by the people of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and its preceding [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] and colonial societies. [[Indigenous Australian art]], [[Indigenous Australian music|music]] and story telling attaches to a 40–60,000-year heritage and continues to affect the broader arts and [[culture of Australia]]. During its early [[Western civilisation|western]] history, Australia was a collection of British colonies, therefore, its [[Australian literature|literary]], [[Visual arts of Australia|visual]] and [[Theatre of Australia|theatrical]] traditions began with strong links to the broader traditions of [[English literature|English]] and [[Irish literature]], [[Art of the United Kingdom|British art]] and [[Music of the United Kingdom|English]] and [[Celtic music]]. However, the works of Australian artists – including Indigenous as well as [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] and [[multicultural]] migrant Australians – has, since 1788, introduced the character of a new continent to the global arts scene – exploring such themes as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]], Australian landscape, migrant and national identity, distance from other Western nations and proximity to Asia, the complexities of urban living and the "beauty and the terror" of life in the [[Australian bush]].

Notable Australian writers have included the Nobel laureate [[Patrick White]], the novelists [[Colleen McCullough]] and [[Henry Handel Richardson]] and the bush poets [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Leading Australian performing artists have included [[Robert Helpmann]] of the [[Australian Ballet]], [[Joan Sutherland]] of [[Opera Australia]] and the humourist [[Barry Humphries]]. Prominent Australian musical artists have included the [[Australian country music]] singer [[Slim Dusty]], rising star [[Cody Simpson]], folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], "pop princess" [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[rock n roll]] bands the [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]] and [[Powderfinger]]. Quintessentially Australian art styles include the [[Heidelberg School]] the [[Hermannsburg School]] and the [[Western Desert Art Movement]]. [[Australian cinema]] has a long tradition with a body of work producing popular classics such as ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' and ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'', and [[arthouse]] successes such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[Ten Canoes]]''. Prominent Australian trained filmed artists include [[Errol Flynn]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Cate Blanchett]].

Notable institutions for the arts include the [[UNESCO]] listed [[Sydney Opera House]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in [[Canberra]] and the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] in Sydney.

The arts in Australia, including the fields of [[cinema of Australia|cinema]], [[music of Australia|music]], [[art of Australia|visual arts]], [[theatre of Australia|theatre]], [[dance in Australia|dance]] and crafts often reflect general trends in Western arts. However, the arts as practiced by [[indigenous Australians]] represent a unique Australian cultural tradition, and Australia's landscape and history have contributed to some unique variations in the styles inherited by Australia's various migrant communities.&lt;ref name="painters"&gt;{{cite web

At the close of the 19th century, the painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] began to capture the unique colours of the [[Australian bush]], famed writers [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] presented conflicting views of the harshness and romance of life in Australia, and performing artists like opera singer Dame [[Nellie Melba]] made a mark internationally in classical European culture. During the 20th century, writers and performers like [[C J Dennis]], [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Paul Hogan]] both mocked and celebrated Australian cultural stereotypes, while shifting demographics saw a diversification of artistic output, with writers like feminist [[Germaine Greer]] challenging traditional cultural norms.

Australia's capital cities each support traditional  "[[high culture]]" institutions in the form of major art galleries, ballet troupes, theaters, symphony orchestras, opera houses and dance companies. Leading Australian performers in these fields have included the opera Dames [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], dancers [[Edouard Borovansky]] and [[Robert Helpmann|Sir Robert Helpmann]], and choreographer/dancers such as [[Graeme Murphy]] and [[Meryl Tankard]]. [[Opera Australia]] is based in Sydney at the world-renowned [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/opera/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120192723/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/opera/ |archivedate=20 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Ballet]], [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra|Sydney]] symphony orchestras are also well regarded cultural institutions.

Organisations such as the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] and [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] have fostered students of theatre, film, and television several of whom have continued to international success, with actors like [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]] having been associated with both institutions.

Independent culture thrives in all capital cities and exists in most large regional towns. The independent arts of [[music of Australia|music]], [[cinema of Australia|film]], [[art of Australia|art]] and [[street art]] are the most extensive. [[Melbourne]]'s independent music scene, is one of the largest in the world, whilst another can be found in the multitude of international street artists visiting Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, other major cities, to work for a period of time. As of February 2015, Arts and recreation services was the strongest industry in Australia by total number of employed persons growing by 20.59% since the same time in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finder.com.au/press-release-careers-in-australia finder's Careers In Australia Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual arts have a long history in Australia, dating back around 30,000 years, and examples of ancient Aboriginal rock art can be found throughout the continent, notably in national parks such as the [[UNESCO]]-listed sites at [[Uluru]] and [[Kakadu National Park]] in the Northern Territory, and also within protected parks in urban areas such as [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name="rockart"&gt;[http://www.media.australia.com/en-au/factsheets/3321_9177.aspx Aboriginal Australia - Rock Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531014320/http://www.media.australia.com/en-au/factsheets/3321_9177.aspx |date=31 May 2013 }}, [[Tourism Australia]].

Following the arrival of permanent European settlement in Australia in 1788, the story of early Australian painting has been described{{By whom|date=September 2010}} as requiring of artists a shift from a "European sense of light" to an "Australian sense of light". The origins of distinctly Australian painting is often associated with the [[Heidelberg School]] of the 1880s–1890s. Artists such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] applied themselves to recreating in their art a truer sense of light and colour as seen in the Australian landscape. Like the European Impressionists, they painted in the open air. These artists found inspiration in the unique light and colour which characterises the [[Australian bush]].

Among the first Australian artists to gain a reputation overseas was the impressionist [[John Peter Russell]] during the 1880s. Another notable expatriate artist of the era was [[Rupert Bunny]], a painter of landscape, allegory and sensual and intimate portraits. [[Ernst William Christmas]] also made a name internationally.

Among the principal Australian artists of the 20th century are the [[surrealist]]s [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Russell Drysdale]], the [[avant-garde]] [[Brett Whiteley]], the painter/sculptors [[William Dobell]] and [[Norman Lindsay]], the landscapists Albert Namatjira and [[Lloyd Rees]], the [[modernist]] photographer [[Max Dupain]], and the Aboriginal artist Emily Kngwarreye. Each has helped to define the unique character of the visual arts in Australia.&lt;ref name="painters"/&gt;

Modernism arrived in Australia early in the 20th century. Among the earliest exponents were [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Margaret Preston]]. Humorist [[Barry Humphries]] has been a provocative exponent of [[dadaism]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes; ''The Art of Australia''; Penguin; Revised Edition 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular with the general community have been [[Ken Done]], best known for his design work, [[Pro Hart]] and [[Rolf Harris]], a British/Australian living in the UK who is popular as a musician, composer, painter and television host. [[Ricky Swallow]], [[Patricia Piccinini]], [[Susan Norrie]], [[Callum Morton]], [[Rover Thomas]] and Emily Kngwarreye have all represented Australians at the [[Venice Biennale]] using the traditional mediums of sculpture, photography and painting while instilling them with a renewed vigour. A new generation of Aboriginal artists, while not rejecting the culture of the past, endeavour to move the artistic dialog forward, including [[Gordon Bennett (artist)|Gordon Bennett]], [[Rosella Namok]], [[Richard Bell (artist)|Richard Bell]] and [[Julie Dowling (artist)|Julie Dowling]].

In recent years the art market has been democratised and art is judged on its merits rather than snobbery. A cohort of male artists aged under fifty ([[Dane Lovett]], [[Adam Cullen]], [[Ben Quilty]], [[Anthony Bennett (Australian artist)|Anthony Bennett]], [[Simon Cuthbert]], [[Rhys Lee]], [[Ben Frost (artist)|Ben Frost]] and [[Alasdair McIntyre]]) have an expressive style and use humour in their work.

In addition [[street art]] is also a prominent feature in major cities such as [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. Though there is some debate over the legality, some councils have expressed greater recognition of the urban art movement.

Australia has a number of notable museums and galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]], [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery of Australia]] and [[National Museum of Australia]] in Canberra, and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney.

Australia has a long history of film production. Australia's first dedicated film studio, the [[Limelight Department]], was created by [[The Salvation Army]] in Melbourne in 1898, and is believed to have been the world's first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_60860.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030184703/http://salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_60860.html |archivedate=30 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first feature-length film was the Australian production ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang&lt;/ref&gt; After such early successes, Australian cinema suffered from the rise of [[Hollywood]].

[[File:GeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Geoffrey Rush]], star of ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'']]

In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' was directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]], who cast Tasmanian-born [[Errol Flynn]] as the leading actor.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, the last being 1955's ''[[Jedda]]'', which was notable for being the first Australian film to be shot in colour, and the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to be entered at the Cannes Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2006 and [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' that a major feature-length drama was shot in an indigenous language.

The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s and 1970s an influx of government funding saw the development of a new generation of filmmakers telling distinctively Australian stories, including directors [[Peter Weir]], [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] and [[Bruce Beresford]]. Films such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' (1975) had an immediate international impact. The 1980s is often regarded{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as a golden age of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the historical drama of [[Gallipoli (1981 film)|''Gallipoli'']] (1981) to the dark science fiction of the ''[[Mad Max]]'' sequels (1981–85), the romantic adventure of ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' (1982) or the comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A number of thrillers and horror films dubbed "outback gothic" have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971), ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' (1974) and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975), ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' (1984) and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' (1988) in the 1980s, and ''[[Japanese Story]]'' (2003), ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) and the world-renowned ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' (2006) in the 21st century. These films depict the Australian outback and its wilderness and creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths disconnected to modern urban Australia. These are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the ''Mad Max'' series.

The 1990s saw a run of successful comedies such as ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992), ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' (1996), which helped launch the careers of [[Toni Collette]], [[P. J. Hogan]], [[Eric Bana]] and [[Baz Luhrmann]]. This group was joined in Hollywood by actors including [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] who also rose to international prominence.

The domestic film industry continues to produce a reasonable{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} number of films each year. The industry is also supported by US producers who produce in Australia following the decision by Fox head [[Rupert Murdoch]] to utilise new studios in Melbourne and Sydney where filming could be completed well below US costs. Notable productions include ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' episodes [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|II]] and [[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|III]], and ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]].

Among the important authors of classic Australian works are the poets [[Henry Lawson]], [[Banjo Paterson]], [[C J Dennis]] and [[Dorothea McKellar]]. Dennis wrote in the Australian vernacular, while McKellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem'' [[My Country]]''. At one point, Lawson and Paterson contributed a series of verses to ''[[The Bulletin]]'' magazine in which they engaged in a literary debate about the nature of life in Australia. Lawson said Paterson was a romantic and Paterson said Lawson was full of doom and gloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408180527/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |archivedate=8 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawson is widely regarded as one of Australia's greatest writers of short stories, while Paterson's poems [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man From Snowy River]] and [[Clancy of the Overflow]] remain amongst the most popular Australian bush poems. Significant political poets of the 20th century included Dame [[Mary Gilmore]] and [[Judith Wright]]. Among the best known contemporary poets are [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] and [[Bruce Dawe]].

Novelists of classic Australian works include [[Marcus Clarke]] (''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]''), [[Henry Handel Richardson]] (''[[The Fortunes of Richard Mahony]]''), [[Joseph Furphy]] (''[[Such Is Life (novel)|Such Is Life]]''), [[Miles Franklin]] (''[[My Brilliant Career]]'') and [[Ruth Park]] (''[[The Harp in the South]]''). In terms of children's literature, [[Norman Lindsay]] (''[[The Magic Pudding]]'') and [[May Gibbs]] (''[[Snugglepot and Cuddlepie]]'') are among the Australian classics, while eminent Australian playwrights have included [[Steele Rudd]], [[David Williamson]], [[Alan Seymour]] and [[Nick Enright]].

Although historically only a small proportion of Australia's population have lived outside the major cities, many of Australia's most distinctive stories and legends originate in the [[outback]], in the [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]s and squatters and people of the barren, dusty plains.&lt;ref name="Seal 1989 50"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seal|first=Graham|title=The Hidden Culture: Folklore in Australian Society|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-19-554919-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary works dealing with the migrant experience include [[Melina Marchetta]]'s ''[[Looking for Alibrandi (novel)|Looking for Alibrandi]]'' and [[Anh Do]]'s memoir ''[[The Happiest Refugee]]'', which won the Indie Book of the Year Award for 2011 and tells the story of his experience as a Vietnamese refugee travelling to and growing up in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/15/3164087.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Indigenous Australian]] dance was closely associated with song and was understood and experienced as making present the reality of the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. In some instances, they would imitate the actions of a particular animal in the process of telling a story. For the people in their own country it defined to roles, responsibilities and the place itself. These ritual performances gave them an understanding of themselves in the interplay of social, geographical and environmental forces. The performances were associated with specific places and dance grounds were often sacred places. Body decoration and specific gestures related to kin and other relationships (such as to Dreamtime beings with which individuals and groups). For a number of Indigenous Australian groups, their dances were secret and or sacred, gender could also be an important factor in some ceremonies with men and women having separate ceremonial traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dance in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]], Volume 1'' pp. 255–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Corroboree]] is commonly used in general Australian culture to refer to Australian Aboriginal dances, however, this term has its origins among the people of the Sydney region. In a number of places Australian Aboriginal people will perform "corroborees" for tourists.

In the latter part of the 20th century the influence of Indigenous Australian dance traditions has been seen with the development of concert dance, particularly in contemporary dance with the [[National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association]] providing training to Indigenous Australians in dance and the Bangarra Dance Theatre.

[[Bush dance]] has developed in Australia as a form of traditional dance, drawing from English, Irish, Scottish and other European dance. Favourite dances in the community include such as the Irish [[Céilidh]] "Pride of Erin" and the [[quadrille]] "The Lancers". Locally originated dances include the "Waves of Bondi", the [[Melbourne Shuffle]] and [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]].

[[The Australian Ballet]] is the foremost [[classical ballet]] company in Australia.  It was founded by the English ballerina Dame [[Peggy van Praagh]] in 1962 and is today recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in Melbourne and performs works from the classical repertoire as well as contemporary works by major Australian and international choreographers. As of 2010, it was presenting approximately 200 performances in cities and regional areas around Australia each year as well as international tours. Regular venues include: the [[Melbourne Arts Centre]], [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Sydney Theatre]], [[Adelaide Festival Centre]]
and [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Helpmann]] is among Australia's best known ballerinos.

Many immigrant communities continue their own dance traditions on a professional or amateur basis. Traditional dances from a large number of ethnic backgrounds are danced in Australia, helped by the presence of enthusiastic immigrants and their Australian-born families. It is quite common to see dances from the Baltic region, as well as Scottish, Irish, Indian, Indonesian or African dance being taught at community centres and dance schools in Australia.

[[Baz Luhrmann]]'s popular 1992 film ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', starring [[Paul Mercurio]] contributed to an increased interest in dance competition in Australia, and a number of popular dance shows including ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' have featured on television in recent years.

===Music===

====Indigenous music====
[[File:Gurrumul.jpg|thumb|left|[[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] is a contemporary indigenous performer who sings in the [[Yolŋu Matha languages]].]]

{{Main|Indigenous Australian music}}

Aboriginal song was an integral part of Aboriginal culture. The most famous feature of their music is the [[didgeridoo]]. This wooden instrument, used amongst the Aboriginal tribes of northern Australia, makes a distinctive droning sound and its use has been adopted by a wide variety of non-Aboriginal performers.

Aboriginal musicians have turned their hand to Western popular musical forms, often to considerable commercial success. Pioneers included [[Lionel Rose]], and [[Jimmy Little]], while notable contemporary examples include [[Archie Roach]], the [[Warumpi Band]], [[NoKTuRNL]] and [[Yothu Yindi]]. [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] (formerly of Yothu Yindi) has attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the [[Yolngu]].

====Folk music and national songs====
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover to Paterson's seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''Old Bush Songs'']]

The early [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries introduced folk ballad traditions which were adapted to Australian themes: "[[Botany Bay (song)|Bound for Botany Bay]]" tells of the voyage of British convicts to Sydney, "[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]" evokes the spirit of the [[bushranger]]s, and "[[Click Go the Shears]]" speaks of the life of Australian shearers. The lyrics of Australia's best-known folk song, "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", were written by the bush poet [[Banjo Paterson]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/05/2235263.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted by Australian soldiers during World War I, this song remains popular and is often sung at sporting events, including the closure of the [[Sydney Olympics]] in 2000, by [[Australian country music]] singer [[Slim Dusty]].

Other well-known singers of Australian folk music include [[Rolf Harris]] (who wrote "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport]]"), [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], and [[Eric Bogle]] whose 1972 song "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]" is a sorrowful lament to the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. [[Bush dance]] is a traditional style of dance from Australia with strong Celtic roots, and influenced [[country music]]. It is generally accompanied by such instruments as the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[concertina]] and [[percussion instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/Australia/bushdance.html&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known Bush band is [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebushwackers.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national anthem]] of Australia is "[[Advance Australia Fair]]":

&lt;div style="font-style:italic;"&gt;
:Australians all let us rejoice,
:For we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
:Our home is girt by sea;
:Our land abounds in Nature's gifts
:Of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage
:Advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing,
:Advance Australia fair!
&lt;/div&gt;

Unofficial pop music anthems of Australia include [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]'s "[[I Still Call Australia Home]]" and [[Men at Work]]'s "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]".

====Classical music====
[[File:Nellie Melba by Henry Walter Barnett.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Dame [[Nellie Melba]] (1861–1931)]]

The earliest Western musical influences in Australia can be traced back to two distinct sources: the first free settlers who brought with them the European classical music tradition, and the large body of convicts and sailors, who brought the traditional folk music of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The practicalities of building a colony mean that there is very little music extant from this early period although there are samples of music originating from [[Hobart]] and Sydney that date back to the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Oxford, A Dictionary of Australian Music, Edited by Warren Bebbington, Copyright 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dame Joan Sutherland colour Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|140px|''La Stupenda'' - Dame [[Joan Sutherland]] in 1975]]

[[Nellie Melba]] (1861–1931) travelled to Europe in 1886 to commence her international career as an opera singer. She became among the best known Australians of the period and participated in early gramophone recording and radio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100464b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of choral societies (c. 1850) and symphony orchestras (c. 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although many Australian classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models. A lot of works leading up to the first part of the 20th century were heavily influenced by the folk music of other countries ([[Percy Grainger]]'s ''[[Country Gardens]]'' of 1918 being a good example of this) and a very conservative British orchestral tradition.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

In the war and post-war eras, as pressure built to assert a national identity in the face of the looming superpower of the United States and the "[[Metropole|motherland]]" Britain, composers looked to their surroundings for inspiration. John Antill&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/antill-john&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sculthorpe]] began to incorporate elements of Aboriginal music, and [[Richard Meale]] drew influence from [[south-east Asia]] (notably using the harmonic properties of the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Gamelan]], as had Percy Grainger in an earlier generation).&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

By the beginning of the 1960s, Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, to American [[jazz]] and [[blues]], to the belated discovery of European atonality and the [[avant-garde]]. Composers like [[Don Banks]], [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], [[Malcolm Williamson]] and [[Colin Brumby]] epitomise this period.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In recent times composers including [[Liza Lim]], [[Carl Vine]], [[Georges Lentz]], [[Matthew Hindson]], [[Nigel Westlake]], [[Ross Edwards]], [[Graeme Koehne]], [[Elena Kats-Chernin]], [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]] and [[Brett Dean]] have embodied the pinnacle of established [[List of Australian composers|Australian composers]].

Well-known Australian classical performers include: sopranos [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]], Dame [[Joan Hammond]], [[Joan Carden]], [[Yvonne Kenny]], [[Sara Macliver]] and [[Emma Matthews]]; pianists [[Roger Woodward]], [[Eileen Joyce]], [[Michael Kieran Harvey]], [[Geoffrey Tozer]], [[Geoffrey Douglas Madge]], [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Ian Munro (pianist)|Ian Munro]]; guitarists [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] and [[Slava Grigoryan]]; horn player [[Barry Tuckwell]]; oboist [[Diana Doherty]]; violinists [[Richard Tognetti]] and [[Elizabeth Wallfisch]]; cellists [[John Addison (cellist)|John Addison]] and [[David Pereira]]; organist [[Christopher Wrench]]; orchestras like the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]]; and conductors Sir [[Bernard Heinze]], Sir [[Charles Mackerras]], [[Richard Bonynge]], [[Simone Young]] and [[Geoffrey Simon]]. Indigenous performers like [[didgeridoo]] player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]] and immigrant musicians like Egyptian-born [[oud]] virtuoso [[Joseph Tawadros]] have stimulated interest in their own music traditions and have also collaborated with other musicians and ensembles both in Australia and internationally.

====Pop and rock====

{{Main|Australian rock}}

Australia has produced a large variety of popular music from the internationally renowned work of the [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Cody Simpson]] or [[Kylie Minogue]] to the popular local content of [[John Farnham]] or [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/pop/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the brightest stars of early Australian [[rock and roll]] was [[Johnny O'Keefe]], who formed a band in 1956; his hit ''Wild One'' made him the first Australian rock'n'roller to reach the national charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150610b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While US and British content dominated airwaves and record sales into the 1960s, local successes began to emerge – notably [[The Easybeats]] and the folk-pop group [[The Seekers]] had significant local success and some international recognition, while the bands the [[Bee Gees]] and [[AC/DC]] had their first hits in Australia before going on to international success.

The arrival of the 1961 underground movement into the mainstream in the early 1970s changed Australian music permanently. [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] were far from the first people to write songs in Australia by Australians about Australia, but they were the first ones to make good money doing it. The two best-selling Australian albums made up to that time put Australian music on the map. Within a few years, the novelty had worn off and it became commonplace to hear distinctively Australian lyrics and sounds side-by-side with imports.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Australian performers continued to do well on the local and international music scenes, for example [[Cold Chisel]], [[INXS]], [[Men at Work]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Savage Garden]] and [[Silverchair]]. In the early 21st century, bands such as [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Wolfmother]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[Grinspoon]], [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]], [[The Living End]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Delta Goodrem]] and others were enjoying success internationally.

Domestically, [[John Farnham]] has remained one of Australia's best-known performers, with a career spanning over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182540/http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriter [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] whose music style straddles folk, rock, and country has been described{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as the ''poet laureate'' of Australian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/default.asp?id%3D15390 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWGgEmZH?url=http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/default.asp?id=15390 |archivedate=8 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national expansion of [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] youth radio station [[Triple J]] during the 1990s has increased the profile and availability of home-grown talent to listeners nationwide. Since the mid-1990s a string of successful alternative Australian acts have emerged; artists to achieve both underground (critical) and mainstream (commercial) success include [[You Am I]], [[Grinspoon]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[Jet (band)|Jet]].

====Country music====
{{Main|Australian country music}}
[[File:Melinda Schneider Paul Kelly 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Country yodeller, [[Melinda Schneider]] with folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]]]]

Australia has a long tradition of [[country music]], which has developed a style quite distinct from its US counterpart, influenced by Celtic folk ballads and the traditions of Australian bush balladeers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Pioneers of popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] in the 1930s and [[Smoky Dawson]] from the 1940s onward.

[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Olivia Newton-John]].]]

[[Slim Dusty]] (1927–2003) was known as the ''King of Australian Country Music''. His successful career spanned almost six decades and his 1957 hit "[[A Pub With No Beer]]" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.&lt;ref&gt;Dave" Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Dusty's wife [[Joy McKean]] penned several of his most popular songs.

Other popular performers of Australian country music include: [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (who wrote the iconic song "[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]"), [[Lee Kernaghan]], [[Kasey Chambers]] and [[Sara Storer]]. In the United States, Australian country music stars including [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Keith Urban]] have attained great success.

Country music has also been a particularly popular form of musical expression among the Australian [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] is among Australia's successful indigenous performers.

The [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] is an annual country music festival held in [[Tamworth, New South Wales]]. It celebrates the culture and heritage of [[Australian country music]]. During the festival the [[Country Music Association of Australia]] holds the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] ceremony awarding the [[Golden Guitar]] trophies.

===Theatre===

The ceremonial dances of [[indigenous Australians]] which recount the stories of the [[Dreamtime]], comprise theatrical aspects and have been performed since time immemorial during the 40–60,000 year Aboriginal occupation of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/ceremony/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120165318/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/ceremony/ |archivedate=20 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; European traditions came to Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts.&lt;ref name="olioweb.me.uk"&gt;http://www.olioweb.me.uk/plays/&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in ''Our Country's Good'' by [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]]: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty.&lt;ref name="olioweb.me.uk"/&gt;

A theatre was built on the present site of Melbourne's [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]] in 1854. The present building now hosts major international productions as well as live performance events such as the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marrinertheatres.com.au/venue_princess.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330184333/http://www.marrinertheatres.com.au/venue_princess.jsp |archivedate=30 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] was built during this period and later became Australia's first cinema, screening ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', the world's first feature film in 1906.

After Federation in 1901, theatre productions evidenced the new sense of national identity. ''On Our Selection'' (1912) by [[Steele Rudd]], told of the adventures of a pioneer farming family and became immensely popular. Sydney's grand [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] opened in 1928 and after restoration remains one of the nation's finest auditoriums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitoltheatre.com.au/explore.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210113100/http://www.capitoltheatre.com.au/explore.htm |archivedate=10 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' by [[Ray Lawler]] portrayed resolutely Australian characters and went on to international acclaim. That same year, young Melbourne artist [[Barry Humphries]] performed as [[Edna Everage]] for the first time at [[Melbourne University]]'s Union Theatre. Humphries left for London in his early 20s and enjoyed success on stage, including in [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical, [[Oliver!]]. His satirical stage creations – notably Dame Edna and later [[Les Patterson]] –– became Australian cultural icons. Humphries also achieved success in the USA with tours on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and television appearances and has been honoured in Australia and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6757531.stm | work=BBC News | title=The man behind Dame Edna Everage | date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] was created in Sydney in 1958.

The '''bookwriter''' is the member of a [[Musical theatre|musical]]'s writing team who creates the book—the musical's plot, character development, and dramatic structure.  Essentially, the bookwriter is the playwright of the musical.  He or she works very closely in collaboration with the [[lyricist]] and [[composer]] to create an integrated piece of drama.

There is a common misconception that the bookwriter merely writes the dialogue; though the book does include the musical's spoken text, it is much more than that, defining and organizing the dramatic action of the entire piece, including action that is musicalized by the songwriter(s).  Even "sung-through," "operatic," or "through-composed" musicals, where there is little, if any, spoken text, require as much contribution from a bookwriter as do musicals with extensive dialogue scenes.

The bookwriter is often also the musical's lyricist, composer, or director.

[[File:St Michael and Gudula Saint Sacrament 5.jpg|thumb|The Winchester Cross on display]]
The '''Brussels Cross''' or '''Drahmal Cross''' is an [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Christian cross|cross]]-[[reliquary]] of the early 11th century, now in the treasury of the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral]], [[Brussels]], that bears engraved images and an inscription in [[Old English]]. 

==Description==
Badly damaged and with its once jewelled front missing, the Brussels Cross takes the form of a large piece of cross-shaped wood covered with a silver plate bearing medallions engraved with the [[evangelists' symbols]] at the end of the arms and an ''Agnus Dei'' at the center. Across the arms the artist has inscribed his name in large [[Latin script|Latin]] letters: + ''Drahmal me worhte'' (‘Drahmal made me’).  An inscription around the edges reads: + ''Rod is min nama; geo ic ricne Cyning bær byfigynde, blod bestemed'' (‘Rood is my name. Trembling once, I bore a powerful king, made wet with blood’). These lines bear a close relationship to ll. 44 and 48 in the [[Old English]] poem, '[[The Dream of the Rood]]'. This is followed by a common form of dedication: ''þas rod het Æþmær wyrican and Aðelwold hys beroþo[r] Criste to lofe for Ælfrices saule hyra beroþor'' (‘Æthlmær and Athelwold, his brother, ordered this rood to be made so as to praise [[Christ]] for the soul of Ælfric, their brother’). The [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] inscription is contained on a silver strip which runs around the edges of the cross. It is written not in [[runes]], but in Roman letters, in a curious mixture of Latin-style majuscules and minuscules. The letters 'NE' of ''ricne'', 'NG' of ''cyning'' and 'ME' of ''bestemed'' are written as ligatures. Although it has not proved possible to identify with any certainty the persons named in the inscription, the text is in late West-Saxon which would ascribe it to the late tenth century or perhaps later.

The Brussels Cross and its two-line inscription in Anglo-Saxon verse were first brought to public attention in modern times by H. Logeman in 1891. Traditionally reputed to contain the largest extant fragments of the True Cross, it has been preserved at the Cathedral of SS. Michel and Gudule since the middle of the seventeenth century. The cross is 46.5 by 28&amp;nbsp;cm. (18.3 by 11&amp;nbsp;inches) in size. The front was once covered by a jewelled gold plate, probably taken away by French soldiers under [[Dumouriez]] in 1793; the back is still covered with silver, with the symbols of the four evangelists at the ends of the four arms and the symbol of the ''[[Agnus Dei]]'' in the centre.  The earlier [[Lothair Cross]] is a comparable work that is still intact. The name of the craftsman, Drahmal, is probably [[Norsemen|Norse]] and from the northern England, but nothing more can be deduced about him. Judging from the language of the inscription as well as from the epigraphy and the style of the images, the cross most likely dates from the beginning of the 11th century.  The images are in a "stolid" version of the early "[[Winchester#Medieval period|Winchester]] style".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1984|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Three Brothers==
The Brussels Cross was created in England, but the three brothers, Ælfric, Æthelmær and Æthelwold, cited in the prose part of the inscription, have never been positively identified. The language is a fairly regular late West-Saxon, with one [[Anglic languages|Anglian]] form, ''bestemed'', and a few irregular spellings, such as ''byfigynde'' (with 'y' for 'e' in the ending) in the verse, ''wyrican'' and ''beroþor'' (both with an intrusive vowel) in the prose. The form ''bestemed'' (for West-Saxon ''bestiemed'', ''bestymed'') does not necessarily indicate a northern origin for the inscription; it is usually explained as a traditional spelling taken over from older poetic vocabulary.

Some scholars have identified Ælfric, Æthelmær and Æthelwold with Africus, Agelmarus and Agelwardus of Worcester around the year 1007. Others have suggested that the Æthelmær is the well-known patron of [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], who founded the abbey at [[Eynsham]] in 1005, but offer no identification of the other two names. It is possible, furthermore, that the holy relic which forms part of the present cross is the same as the ''lignum Domini'' ('Wood of the Lord') sent by [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]] to [[King Alfred]] in 883 or 885. None of these possibilities is susceptible to proof. The Belgian scholar Simone D’Ardenne offers the most plausible analysis. She favors the identification of the relic with Alfred’s ''lignum Domini'' ('Wood of the Lord'), and she has studied all the available evidence to present a highly plausible account of its later history. According to her, the [[relic]] remained in the hands of the West-Saxon royal family until near the end of the tenth century, when it left the possession of the direct line. Its new owners had it enclosed in a [[reliquary]] (the present cross) and presented it to [[Westminster Abbey]]. It later found its way to the [[Netherlands]], probably during the reign of the last Norman King of England, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] (1135–1154), when numbers of [[Flanders (county)|Flemish]] soldiers were in England.

The '''Cape Performing Arts Board''' (CAPAB) was a [[South African]] theatre organisation based in [[Cape Town]], serving the former [[Cape Province]]. It was one of the four state funded performing arts councils in the four former provinces of South Africa instituted in 1963.

== History ==

In 1961 the National Theatre Organisation was disbanded and replaced by four provincial performing arts councils. In Cape Town the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) was instituted in 1962 with the aim to promote the performing arts in the Cape Province and South Arica. The arts councils received sufficient government subsidies to fund various art forms as well as the operational requirements of the theatre facilities. Staff could be taken into permanent employment.

== Demise ==

Since 1994 government policy changed dramatically. All performing arts boards were transformed to managers of playhouses and the various arts companies had to become independent. The CAPAB Drama Department staged its last production in May 1997 with a final performance of [[David Mowat]]'s ''The Guise'', a play which has as its theme the survival of the theatre.

The new organisation, Artscape, was launched on 27 March 1999 to replace CAPAB and the Nico Malan Theatre Complex was renamed the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]].

== Nico Malan Theatre Centre ==

The Nico Malan Theatre Centre was opened on 19 May 1971, to be programmed and managed by Cape Performing Arts Board as a production house with four arts companies – orchestra, opera, ballet and drama. These companies had full-time artistes, technical and administrative staff.

In line with the new South African the political dispensation and the concurrent changes, the complex was renamed the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] in March 2001.

CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (Afrikaans: Kaaplandse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste – KRUIK). Founded in 1963, after the dissolving of the National Theatre Organisation, with Danie van Eeden*?? as its first director. (He was followed consecutively by Gé Korsten, George Loopuyt and Michael  Maas.)  Registered as a society not for gain, it was headed by a policy-making council chaired by the provincial administrator and representative of all interested parties, including the province, the city municipality of Cape Town, the department of national education,  the business sector as well as representatives of the various performing art forms. Their function was to provide artists and artisans with a secure career option, to develop and promote drama, ballet, music and opera by offering audiences in the province with regular professional productions. Its first productions were Becket (Anouilh) and Hedda Gabler (Ibsen, in Afrikaans) in the Hofmeyr Theatre in November 1963. Their first opera (The Bartered Bride by Smetana) was done on 8 February 1965 in the Alhambra Theatre.  Their first indigenous in play Afrikaans was *** in 196*, while the first indigenous English play was The Year of the Locust by James Ambrose Brown (1966).  Initially renting theatres in the various cities, CAPAB purchased the Opera House in Port Elizabeth in 1967, and refurbished it for use as a base for their work in the Eastern Cape. In 1971 they opened the Nico Malan Theatre Complex in Cape Town, The Opera House with a performance of the ballet Sylvia, and the Theatre with a controversial [Presidential] opening production, "KONING LEAR" [Uys Krige] - directed by Dieter Reible, ["Christine" - Barto Smit was also scheduled, but banned before rehearsals commenced due to subject matter].    Feydeau's "Hond Se Gedagte" [A Flea in her Ear'] also directed by Dieter Reible followed 'Lear'.

 The opening of this theatre "for whites only" – despite the protests of artists, critics and many of the population – was to be one of the most troublesome issues for the council over the next twenty years, as it was actively boycotted by the Cape non-white population as well as their supporters. It was belatedly opened for all on 21 February 1975, but this had little effect on the boycott, which lasted for many more years. In 1972  a third venue, the Arena, was builtin a large rehearsal room, to house the work of CAPAB;'s experimental company [Aubrey berg's production of Hofmann's "The Burgomaster"]. The first head of drama was the long serving  Pieter Fourie, followed by Johan Esterhuizen in 19**, and later by***.  CAPAB also had a very successful youth company, founded to do educational work and  originally led by Robin Malan*? Followed over the years by i.a. Eileen Thorns, ** and Ivan Abrahams  and. .  the     CAPAB:Cape Provincial Arts Board. . Together with PACT and the Phoenix Players, they staged Athol Fugard’s Boesman and Lena and People are Living There, both directed by Fugard and starring Yvonne Bryceland and Glyn Day in 1970. Peter Curtis and Pieter Fourie ran this drama company circa 1971. They staged their plays at the old Hofmeyr Theatre. They acquired their own theatre and opera house in 1971 in the form of the Nico Malan. The Nico’s first performance in front of an integrated audience, the Academy Theatres’ Who Saw Him Die took place on 21 February 1975. Their production of Dalene Matthee’s Fiela se Kind starring Shaleen Surtie-Richards was staged at the Nico Malan in 1986. Basil Rubin in association with CAPAB staged William Luce’s Zelda at the Adcock-Ingram in August 1987. Together with Volute Productions they staged Robert Hewett’s Gulls which Keith Grenville directed in 1987. Together with the other three performing arts councils they staged The Great Walt for their Christmas production in 1987 and Singin’ in the Rain for their Christmas production in 1988. They staged My Fair Lady in 1989/90. They presented Michael Drinn’s The Phantom of the Opera in 1990. Together with  PACT, the [[Johannesburg Civic Theatre]] Association and NAPAC they presented A Chorus Line in 1992. Together with NAPAC and PACOFS they presented Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! in 1993. **** (Tucker, 1997) CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (****-****).  Cape Town.  Chris Swart was the director (from 19** to 19**), Peter Curtis the artistic director of English drama(from 19** to 19**) and Pieter Fourie the artistic director of Afrikaans drama (from 19** to 19**).

While studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse, Britton (then Womack) made her New York theatrical debut in [[Caroline Kava]]'s ''The Early Girl'' at The Courtyard Playhouse.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;  Britton played seasoned prostitute Laurel opposite Cooper Lawrence, who played Joan. Britton's performance, while well received, nearly got her ousted from the Neighborhood Playhouse program, which prohibited students from taking professional employment during their course of study. After graduating, Britton spent two more years working in [[off-Broadway]] theatre productions. In 1995, Britton made her feature film debut in [[Edward Burns]]' comedy-drama ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-brothers-mcmullen-19950809 |title=The Brothers McMullen &amp;#124; Movie Reviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1995-08-09 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Los Angeles]] after the film's success.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

In 1996, she began co-starring as Nikki Faber in the ABC sitcom ''[[Spin City]]'' opposite [[Michael J.

|colspan=6|Coxeter notation expresses [[Coxeter group]]s as a list of branch orders of a [[Coxeter diagram]], like the [[polyhedral groups]], {{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}} = [p,q]. [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral groups]], {{CDD|node|2|node|n|node}}, can be expressed a product [ ]×[n] or in a single symbol with an explicit order 2 branch, [2,n].
|}

In [[geometry]], '''Coxeter notation''' (also '''Coxeter symbol''') is a system of classifying [[symmetry group]]s, describing the angles between fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]] in a bracketed notation expressing the structure of a [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]], with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and has been more comprehensively defined by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]].

== Reflectional groups==
{{Further information|Point group}}

For [[Coxeter group]]s, defined by pure reflections, there is a direct correspondence between the bracket notation and [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The numbers in the bracket notation represent the mirror reflection orders in the branches of the Coxeter diagram. It uses the same simplification, suppressing 2s between orthogonal mirrors.

The Coxeter notation is simplified with exponents to represent the number of branches in a row for linear diagram. So the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; group is represented by [3&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;], to imply ''n'' nodes connected by ''n-1'' order-3 branches. Example ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents diagrams {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}}.

Coxeter initially represented bifurcating diagrams with vertical positioning of numbers, but later abbreviated with an exponent notation, like [...,3&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;p,q,r&lt;/sup&gt;], starting with [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node|splitsplit1|branch3|node}} or  {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|nodes}} as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Coxeter allowed for zeros as special cases to fit the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; family, like ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2,2&lt;/sup&gt;], like {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node|3|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3a|nodea|3a|nodea}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3ab|nodes}}.

Coxeter groups formed by cyclic diagrams are represented by parenthesese inside of brackets, like [(p,q,r)] = {{CDD|pqr}} for the [[triangle group]] (p q r). If the branch orders are equal, they can be grouped as an exponent as the length the cycle in brackets, like [(3,3,3,3)] = [3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}} or {{CDD|branch|3ab|branch}}. {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|branch}} can be represented as [3,(3,3,3)] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

More complicated looping diagrams can also be expressed with care. The [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram#Ranks 4.E2.80.9310|paracompact Coxeter group]] {{CDD|node|split1|branch|split2|node}} can be represented by Coxeter notation [(3,3,(3),3,3)], with nested/overlapping parentheses showing two adjacent [(3,3,3)] loops, and is also represented more compactly as [3&lt;sup&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing the [[rhombus|rhombic symmetry]] of the Coxeter diagram. The paracompact complete graph diagram {{CDD|tet}} or  {{CDD|branch|splitcross|branch}}, is represented as [3&lt;sup&gt;[3,3]&lt;/sup&gt;] with the superscript [3,3] as the symmetry of its [[regular tetrahedron]] coxeter diagram.

The Coxeter diagram usually leaves order-2 branches undrawn, but the bracket notation includes an explicit '''2''' to connect the subgraphs. So the Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|3|node|2|node|3|node}} = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented by [3]×[3] = [3]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [3,2,3]. Sometimes explicit 2-branches may be included either with a 2 label, or with a line with a gap: {{CDD|node|3|node|2x|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|3|2|3|node|3|node}}, as an identical presentation as [3,2,3].

For the affine and hyperbolic groups, the subscript is one less than the number of nodes in each case, since each of these groups was obtained by adding a node to a finite group's diagram.

== Subgroups ==
Coxeter's notation represents rotational/translational symmetry by adding a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator outside the brackets, [X]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which cuts the order of the group [X] in half, thus a index 2 subgroup. This operator implies an even number of operators must be applied, replacing reflections with rotations (or translations). When applied to a Coxeter group, this is called a '''direct subgroup''' because what remains are only direct isometries without reflective symmetry.

The '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators can also be applied inside of the brackets, like [X,Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [X,(Y,Z)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and creates '''"semidirect" subgroups''' that may include both reflective and nonreflective generators. Semidirect subgroups can only apply to Coxeter group subgroups that have even order branches adjacent to it. Elements by parentheses inside of a Coxeter group can be give a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator, having the effect of dividing adjacent ordered branches into half order, thus is usually only applied with even numbers. For example, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [4,(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}). 

If applied with adjacent odd branch, it doesn't create a subgroup of index 2, but instead creates overlapping fundamental domains, like [5,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [5/2], which can define doubly wrapped polygons like a [[pentagram]], {5/2}, and [5,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] relates to [[Schwarz triangle]] [5/2,3,3], [[polytope density|density]] 2.

Groups without neighboring '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements can be seen in ringed nodes Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for [[uniform polytope]]s and honeycomb are related to ''hole'' nodes around the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements, empty circles with the alternated nodes removed. So the [[snub cube]], {{CDD|node_h|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and the [[snub tetrahedron]], {{CDD|node|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and a [[demicube]], h{4,3} = {3,3} ({{CDD|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node_1|3|node|3|node}}) has symmetry [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3] ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node_h0|4|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|nodes|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}).

Note: [[Pyritohedral symmetry]] {{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} can be written as {{CDD|node|4|2|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, separating the graph with gaps for clarity, with the generators {0,1,2} from the Coxeter group {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, producing pyritohedral generators {0,12}, a reflection and 3-fold rotation. And chiral tetrahedral symmetry can be written as  {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} or  {{CDD|node_h2|2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {12,0120}.

Johnson extends the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operator to work with a placeholder 1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nodes, which removes mirrors, doubling the size of the fundamental domain and cuts the group order in half.&lt;ref name="subgroups2"&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 255, halving subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; In general this operation only applies to individual mirrors bounded by even-order branches. The '''1''' represents a mirror so [2p] can be seen as [2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p], or [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], like diagram {{CDD|node|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|2x|p|node_c3}}, with 2 mirrors related by an order-2p dihedral angle. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c3}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c3}}, or in bracket notation:[1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p, &lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [p].

Each of these mirrors can be removed so h[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1] = [1,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p], a reflective subgroup index 2. This can be shown in a Coxeter diagram by adding a &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symbol above the node: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node}} = {{CDD|node|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch}}.

If both mirrors are removed, a quarter subgroup is generated, with the branch order becoming a gyration point of half the order: 
:q[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a rotational subgroup of index 4. {{CDD|node_h2|2|2x|p|2|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h0}} =  {{CDD|labelp|branch_h2h2}}.

For example, (with p=2): [4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] = [2] = [&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;], order 4. [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 2.

The opposite to halving is doubling&lt;ref name="subgroups"/&gt; which adds a mirror, bisecting a fundamental domain, and doubling the group order.
: {{Brackets|p}} = [2p]

Halving operations apply for higher rank groups, like [[tetrahedral symmetry]] is a half group of [[octahedral group]]: h[4,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3], removing half the mirrors at the 4-branch. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate all connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c1|3|node_c2}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c1|split2|node_c2}}, h[2p,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,3] = [(p,3,3)].

If nodes are indexed, half subgroups can be labeled with new mirrors as composites. Like {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}, generators {0,1} has subgroup {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, generators {1,010}, where mirror 0 is removed, and replaced by a copy of mirror 1 reflected across mirror 0. Also given {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2}, it has half group {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node_n1|3|node_n2|3|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0}}, generators {1,2,010}.

Doubling by adding a mirror also applies in reversing the halving operation: {{Brackets|3,3}} = [4,3], or more generally {{Brackets|(q,q,p)}} = [2p,q].

=== Radical subgroups ===
[[File:43-radial subgroups.png|thumb|A radical subgroup is similar to an alternation, but removes the rotational generators.]]
Johnson also added an [[asterisk]] or star '''*''' operator for "radical" subgroups&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 259, radical subgroup&lt;/ref&gt;, that acts similar to the &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; operator, but removes rotational symmetry. The index of the radical subgroup is the order of the removed element.  For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2]. The removed [3] subgroup is order 6 so [2,2] is an index 6 subgroup of [4,3].

The radical subgroups represent the inverse operation to an [[#Extended symmetry|extended symmetry]] operation. For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], and in reverse [2,2] can be extended as [3[2,2]] ≅ [4,3]. The subgroups can be expressed as a Coxeter diagram: {{CDD|node_c1|4|node|3s|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|4|node_x|3|node_x}} ≅ {{CDD|nodeab_c1|2|node_c1}}. The removed node (mirror) causes adjacent mirror virtual mirrors to become real mirrors.

If [4,3] has generators {0,1,2}, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], index 2, has generators {0,12}; [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] ≅ [3,3], index 2 has generators {010,1,2}; while radical subgroup [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], index 6, has generators {01210, 2, (012)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}; and finally [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3*], index 12 has generators {0(12)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;0, (012)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;01}.

A '''trionic subgroup''' is an index 3 subgroups. There are many
Johnson defines a ''trionic subgroup'' with operator ⅄, index 3. For rank 2 Coxeter groups, [3], the trionic subgroup, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] is [ ], a single mirror. And for [3''p''], the trionic subgroup is [3''p'']&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [''p'']. Given {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_n1}}, with generators {0,1}, has 3 trionic subgroups. They can be differentiated by putting the ⅄ symbol next to the mirror generator to be removed, or on a branch for both: [3''p'',1&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_trionic}} = {{CDD|node_n0|p|3_n1|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0|2_n1}},  {{CDD|node_trionic|3x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, and [3''p''&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|3trionic|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|3_n1|node_n0|2_n1}} with generators {0,10101}, {01010,1}, or {101,010}.

[[#Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry|Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry]]: [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], relating the symmetry of the [[regular tetrahedron]] and [[tetragonal disphenoid]].

For rank 3 Coxeter groups, [''p'',3], there is a trionic subgroup [''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [''p''/2,''p''], or {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|3trionic|node_n2}} = {{CDD|2_n2|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n2|p|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}. For example the finite group [4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [2,4], and Euclidean group [6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [3,6], and hyperbolic group [8,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [4,8]. 

An odd-order adjacent branch, ''p'', will not lower the group order, but create overlapping fundamental domains. The group order stays the same, while the [[density (polytope)|density]] increases. For example the [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3], of the regular polyhedra [[icosahedron]] becomes [5/2,5], the symmetry of 2 regular star polyhedra. It also relates the hyperbolic tilings {p,3}, and [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Hyperbolic_star-tilings|star hyperbolic tilings]] {p/2,p} 

For rank 4, [''q'',2''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2''p'',((p,q,q))], {{CDD|node|q|node|2x|p|node|3trionic|node}} = {{CDD|labelq|branch|split2-pq|node|2x|p|node}}. 

For example [3,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,3,3], or {{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2|3trionic|node_n3}} = {{CDD|2_n3|2_n2|node_n1|3_n2|3_n3|3|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2,3} in [3,4,3] with the trionic subgroup [4,3,3] generators {0,1,2,32123}. For hyperbolic groups, [3,6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [6,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;], and [4,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,4,4].

[[File:33-trionic subgroups.png|thumb|Trionic relations of [3,3]]]
Johnson identified two specific '''trionic subgroups'''&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 258, trionic subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; of [3,3], first an index 3 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], with [3,3] ({{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}} = {{CDD|node|split1|branch|label2}}) generators {0,1,2}. It can also be written as [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)] ({{CDD|node|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}) as a reminder of its generators {02,1}. This symmetry reduction is the relationship between the regular [[tetrahedron]] and the [[tetragonal disphenoid]], represent a stretching of a tetrahedron perpendicular to two opposite edges.

Secondly he identifies a related index 6 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; or [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}), index 3 from [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {02,1021}, from [3,3] and its generators {0,1,2}.

These subgroups also apply within larger Coxeter groups with [3,3] subgroup with neighboring branches all even order.
[[File:334 trionic subgroups2.png|thumb|Trionic subgroup relations of [3,3,4]]]
For example, [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4], and [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] are subgroups of [3,3,4], index 2, 3 and 6 respectively. The generators of [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2,4}} ≅ [8,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,8], order 128, are {02,1,3} from [3,3,4] generators {0,1,2,3}. And [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4}}, order 64, has generators {02,1021,3}. As well, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4].

Also related [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] has trionic subgroups: [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], order 64, and 1=[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [[4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 32.

=== Central inversion===
[[File:Point Reflection.png|thumb|A 2D central inversion is a 180 degree rotation, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
A [[central inversion]], order 2, is operationally differently by dimension. The group [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents ''n'' orthogonal mirrors in n-dimensional space, or an [[n-flat]] subspace of a higher dimensional space. The mirrors of the group [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] are numbered {{tmath|0 \dots n-1}}. The order of the mirrors doesn't matter in the case of an inversion. The matrix of a central inversion is {{tmath|-I}}, the Identity matrix with negative one on the diagonal.

From that basis, the central inversion has a generator as the product of all the orthogonal mirrors. In Coxeter notation this inversion group is expressed by adding an alternation &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to each 2 branch. The alternation symmetry is marked on Coxeter diagram nodes as open nodes.

A [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] can be marked up with explicit 2 branches defining a linear sequence of mirrors, open-nodes, and shared double-open nodes to show the chaining of the reflection generators.

For example, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] and [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are subgroups index 2 of [2,2], {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}, and are represented as {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2|node}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|node}}) and {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}) with generators {01,2} and {0,12} respectively. Their common subgroup index 4 is [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and is represented by {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}), with the double-open {{CDD|node_h4}} marking a shared node in the two alternations, and a single [[rotoreflection]] generator {012}.

=== Rotations and rotary reflections ===
Rotations and [[rotary reflection]]s are constructed by a single single-generator product of all the reflections of a prismatic group, [2''p'']×[2''q'']×... where [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'',...)=1, they are isomorphic to the abstract [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''n''=2''pq''.

The 4-dimensional double rotations, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), which include a central group, and are expressed by Conway as ±[C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2003, p.46, Table 4.2 Chiral groups II&lt;/ref&gt;, order 2''pq''. From Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|2|node_n2|2x|q|node_n3}}, generators {0,1,2,3}, the single generator of [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}} is {0123}. The half group, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or cyclc graph, [(2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)], {{CDD|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h4|2x}} expressed by Conway is [C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;], order ''pq'', with generator {01230123}.

If there is a common factor ''f'', the double rotation can be written as {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), generator {0123}, order 2''pqf''. For example, ''p''=''q''=1, ''f''=2, {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is order 4. And {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, generator {01230123}, is order ''pqf''. For example {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is order 2, a [[central inversion]].

=== Commutator subgroups ===
Simple groups with only odd-order branch elements have only a single rotational/translational subgroup of order 2, which is also the [[commutator subgroup]], examples [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. For other Coxeter groups with even-order branches, the commutator subgroup has index 2&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where c is the number of disconnected subgraphs when all the even-order branches are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter and Moser, 1980, Sec 9.5 Commutator subgroup, p. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [4,4] has three independent nodes in the Coxeter diagram when the '''4'''s are removed, so its commutator subgroup is index 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and can have different representations, all with three '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or [(4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)]. A general notation can be used with +''c'' as a group exponent, like [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Example subgroups ===

==== Rank 2 example subgroups ====
[[Dihedral symmetry]] groups with even-orders have a number of subgroups. This example shows two generator mirrors of [4] in red and green, and looks at all subgroups by halfing, rank-reduction, and their direct subgroups. The group [4], {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1}} has two mirror generators 0, and 1. Each generate two virtual mirrors 101 and 010 by reflection across the other.

==== Rank 3 Euclidean example subgroups ====
The [4,4] group has 15 small index subgroups. This table shows them all, with a yellow fundamental domain for pure reflective groups, and alternating white and blue domains which are paired up to make rotational domains. Cyan, red, and green mirror lines correspond to the same colored nodes in the Coxeter diagram. Subgroup generators can be expressed as products of the original 3 mirrors of the fundamental domain, {0,1,2}, corresponding to the 3 nodes of the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}. A product of two intersecting reflection lines makes a rotation, like {012}, {12}, or {02}. Removing a mirror causes two copies of neighboring mirrors, across the removed mirror, like {010}, and {212}. Two rotations in series cut the rotation order in half, like {0101} or {(01)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}, {1212} or {(02)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}. A product of all three mirrors creates a [[transreflection]], like {012} or {120}.

{{See also|Goursat tetrahedron#Extended symmetry}}

Coxeter's notation includes double square bracket notation, {{Brackets|X}} to express [[automorphism|automorphic]] symmetry within a Coxeter diagram. Johnson added alternative of angled-bracket &lt;[X]&gt; or {{langle}}[X]{{rangle}} option as equivalent to square brackets for doubling to distinguish diagram symmetry through the nodes versus through the branches. Johnson also added a prefix symmetry modifier [Y[X]], where Y can either represent symmetry of the Coxeter diagram of [X], or symmetry of the fundamental domain of [X].

For example, in 3D these equivalent [[rectangle]] and [[Rhombus|rhombic]] geometry diagrams of &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt;: {{CDD|branch|3ab|3ab|branch}} and {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}}, the first doubled with square brackets, {{Brackets|3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;}} or twice doubled as [2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with [2], order 4 higher symmetry. To differentiate the second, angled brackets are used for doubling, {{langle}}[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}} and twice doubled as {{langle}}2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}}, also with a different [2], order 4 symmetry. Finally a full symmetry where all 4 nodes are equivalent can be represented by [4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with the order 8, [4] symmetry of the [[Square (geometry)|square]]. But by considering the [[tetragonal disphenoid]] fundamental domain the [4] extended symmetry of the square graph can be marked more explicitly as [(2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4)[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]].

Further symmetry exists in the cyclic &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; and branching &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; diagrams. &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; has order 2''n'' symmetry of a regular ''n''-gon, {''n''}, and is represented by [''n''[3&lt;sup&gt;[''n'']&lt;/sup&gt;]]. &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt; are represented by [3[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3] and [3[3&lt;sup&gt;2,2,2&lt;/sup&gt;]] respectively while &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; by [(3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,3,4,3], with the diagram containing the order 24 symmetry of the regular [[tetrahedron]], {3,3}. The paracompact hyperbolic group &lt;math&gt;{\bar{L}}_5&lt;/math&gt; = [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node|branch3|splitsplit2|node|split1|nodes}}, contains the symmetry of a [[5-cell]], {3,3,3}, and thus is represented by [(3,3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3,3,3].

An [[asterisk]] * superscript is effectively an inverse operation, creating ''radical subgroups'' removing connected of odd-ordered mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Norman W. Johnson, Asia Ivić Weiss, ''Quaternionic modular groups'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 295, Issues 1–3, 1 July 1999, Pages 159–189 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002437959900107X]&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at generators, the double symmetry is seen as adding a new operator that maps symmetric positions in the Coxeter diagram, making some original generators redundant. For 3D [[space group]]s, and 4D point groups, Coxeter defines an index two subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}, {{Brackets|X|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which he defines as the product of the original generators of [X] by the doubling generator. This looks similar to {{Brackets|X}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the chiral subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}. So for example the 3D space groups {{Brackets|4,3,4}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (I432, 211) and {{Brackets|4,3,4|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} (Pm{{overline|3}}n, 
223) are distinct subgroups of {{Brackets|4,3,4}} (Im{{overline|3}}m, 229).

== Computation with reflection matrices as symmetry generators ==

A Coxeter group, represented by [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|q|node_n2}}, is given Coxeter notation [p,q] for the branch orders. Each node in the Coxeter diagram represents a mirror, by convention called ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The ''generators'' of this group [p,q] are reflections: ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotational subsymmetry is given as products of reflections: By convention, σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/p, and σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a rotation of angle π/q, and σ&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/2.

[p,q]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|3|q|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, is an index 2 subgroup represented by two rotation generators, each a products of two reflections: σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and representing rotations of π/''p'', and π/''q'' angles respectively.

With one even branch, [''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2x|q|node_n2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2|2x|q|node_n2}}, is another subgroup of index 2, represented by rotation generator σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, and reflectional ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

With even branches, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}}, is a subgroup of index 4 with two generators, constructed as a product of all three reflection matrices: By convention as: ψ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;1,2,0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are [[rotary reflection]]s, representing a reflection and rotation or reflection.

In the case of affine Coxeter groups like {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, or {{CDD|node_n0|infin|node_n1}}, one mirror, usually the last, is translated off the origin. A [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] generator τ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix T&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) is constructed as the product of two (or an even number of) reflections, including the affine reflection. A [[transreflection]] (reflection plus a translation) can be the product of an odd number of reflections φ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;), like the index 4 subgroup {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|4|node_h4|4|node_h2}}.

Another composite generator, by convention as ζ (and matrix Z), represents the [[Inversion in a point|inversion]], mapping a point to its inverse. For [4,3] and [5,3], ζ = (ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;h/2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h'' is 6 and 10 respectively, the [[Coxeter number]] for each family. For 3D Coxeter group [p,q] ({{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}}), this subgroup is a rotary reflection [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

Coxeter groups are categorized by their rank, being the number of nodes in its [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The structure of the groups are also given with their abstract group types: In this article, the abstract [[dihedral group]]s are represented as ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[cyclic group]]s are represented by ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 2 ===
Example, in 2D, the Coxeter group [p] ({{CDD|node|p|node}}) is represented by two reflection matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, The cyclic symmetry [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) is represented by rotation generator of matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 3 ===
The finite rank 3 Coxeter groups are [1,''p''], [2,''p''], [3,3], [3,4], and [3,5].

To reflect a point through a plane &lt;math&gt;ax + by + cz = 0&lt;/math&gt; (which goes through the origin), one can use &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}-2\mathbf{NN}^T &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the 3x3 identity matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the three-dimensional [[unit vector]] for the vector normal of the plane.  If the [[L2 norm]] of &lt;math&gt;a, b,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is unity, the transformation matrix can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \left [\begin{smallmatrix} 1 - 2 a^2  &amp; - 2 a b &amp; - 2 a c \\ - 2 a b  &amp; 1 - 2 b^2 &amp; - 2 b c  \\ - 2 a c &amp; - 2 b c &amp; 1 - 2c^2 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

==== Dihedral symmetry====
The reducible 3-dimensional finite reflective group is [[dihedral symmetry]], [''p'',2], order 4''p'', {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|2|node_n2}}. The reflection generators are matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Identity. [''p'',2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2|2x|node_h2}}) is generated by 2 of 3 rotations: S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt;. An order ''p'' [[rotoreflection]] is generated by V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, the product of all 3 reflections.

The simplest irreducible 3-dimensional finite reflective group is [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [3,3], order 24, {{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|3|node_n2}}. The reflection generators, from a D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; construction, are matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Rank one groups==
{{Further information|One-dimensional symmetry group}}
In one dimension, the ''bilateral group'' [&amp;nbsp;] represents a single mirror symmetry, abstract ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2. It is represented as a [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] with a single node, {{CDD|node}}. The ''[[identity group]]'' is the direct subgroup [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry order 1. The '''+''' superscript simply implies that alternate mirror reflections are ignored, leaving the identity group in this simplest case. Coxeter used a single open node to represent an alternation, {{CDD|node_h2}}.

== Rank two groups==
{{Further information|Point groups in two dimensions}}
[[File:Regular hexagon symmetries2.png|400px|thumb|A regular [[hexagon]], with markings on edges and vertices has 8 symmetries: [6], [3], [2], [1], [6]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with [3] and [1] existing in two forms, depending whether the mirrors are on the edges or vertices.]]
In two dimensions, the ''[[rectangle|rectangular]] group'' [2], abstract ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ], being the product of two bilateral groups, represents two orthogonal mirrors, with Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node}}, with [[Order (group theory)|order]] 4. The '''2''' in [2] comes from linearization of the orthogonal subgraphs in the Coxeter diagram, as {{CDD|node|2x|node}} with explicit branch order 2. The ''rhombic group'', [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), half of the rectangular group, the [[point reflection]] symmetry, Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, order 2.

Coxeter notation to allow a '''1''' place-holder for lower rank groups, so [1] is the same as [ ], and [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as [ ]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h2}}.

The ''full p-gonal group'' [p], abstract ''[[dihedral group]]'' D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, ([[Nonabelian group|nonabelian]] for p&gt;2), of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2''p'', is generated by two mirrors at angle ''π''/''p'', represented by Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|p|node}}. The ''p-gonal'' subgroup [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[cyclic group]]'' ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''p'', generated by a rotation angle of&amp;nbsp;''&amp;pi;''/''p''.

Coxeter notation uses double-bracking to represent an [[automorphism|automorphic]] ''doubling'' of symmetry by adding a bisecting mirror to the [[fundamental domain]]. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[p]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; adds a bisecting mirror to [p], and is isomorphic to [2p].

In the limit, going down to one dimensions, the ''full [[apeirogon]]al group'' is obtained when the angle goes to zero, so [∞], abstractly the [[infinite dihedral group]] D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, represents two parallel mirrors and has a Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|infin|node}}. The ''[[One-dimensional symmetry group#Translational symmetry|apeirogonal group]]'' [∞]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|infin|node_h2}}, abstractly the infinite [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the ''additive group'' of the [[integers]], is generated by a single nonzero translation.

In the hyperbolic plane, there is a ''full [[pseudogon]]al group'' [''iπ/λ''], and ''pseudogonal subgroup'' [''iπ/λ'']&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|ultra|node_h2}}. These groups exist in regular infinite-sided polygons, with edge length λ. The mirrors are all orthogonal to a single line.

In three dimensions, the ''full orthorhombic group'' or ''orthorectangular'' [2,2], abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Order (group theory)|order]] 8, represents three orthogonal mirrors, (also represented by Coxeter diagram as three separate dots {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}). It can also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ]×[ ], but the [2,2] expression allows subgroups to be defined:

First there is a "semidirect" subgroup, the ''orthorhombic group'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4.  When the '''+''' superscript is given inside of the brackets, it means reflections generated only from the adjacent mirrors (as defined by the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}) are alternated. In general, the branch orders neighboring the '''+''' node must be even. In this case [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] represent two isomorphic subgroups that are geometrically distinct. The other subgroups are the ''pararhombic group'' [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), also order 4, and finally the ''[[Point reflection|central group]]'' [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}) of order 2.

Next there is the ''full ortho-''p''-gonal group'', [2,p] ({{CDD|node|2|node|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4p, representing two mirrors at a [[dihedral angle]] π/''p'', and both are orthogonal to a third mirror. It is also represented by Coxeter diagram as {{CDD|node|p|node|2|node}}.

The direct subgroup is called the para-''p''-gonal group, [2,p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2p, and another subgroup is [2,p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, also of order 2p.

The ''full gyro-p-gonal group'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4''p''. The gyro-''p''-gonal group, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2''p'' is a subgroup of both [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] and [2,2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

The [[polyhedral group]]s are based on the symmetry of [[platonic solid]]s: the [[tetrahedron]], [[octahedron]], [[cube]], [[icosahedron]], and [[dodecahedron]], with [[Schläfli symbol]]s {3,3}, {3,4}, {4,3}, {3,5}, and {5,3} respectively. The Coxeter groups for these are: [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}}), [3,5] ({{CDD|node|3|node|5|node}}) called full [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [[octahedral symmetry]], and [[icosahedral symmetry]], with orders of 24, 48, and 120.
[[File:Pyritohedral in icosahedral symmetry.png|thumb|[[Pyritohedral symmetry]], [3+,4] is an index 5 subgroup of [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3].]]
In all these symmetries, alternate reflections can be removed producing the rotational tetrahedral [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), octahedral [3,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h2}}), and icosahedral [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|5|node_h2}}) groups of order 12, 24, and 60. The octahedral group also has a unique index 2 subgroup called the [[pyritohedral symmetry]] group, [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|node}}), of order 12, with a mixture of rotational and reflectional symmetry. Pyritohedral symmetry is also an index 5 subgroup of icosahedral symmetry: {{CDD|node_n0|5|node_n1|3|node_n2}} --&gt; {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|4|node_h2|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, with virtual mirror '''1''' across '''0''', {010}, and 3-fold rotation {12}.

The tetrahedral group, [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), has a doubling {{Brackets|3,3}} (which can be represented by colored nodes {{CDD|node_c1|3|node_c2|3|node_c1}}), mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, and this produces the [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_c2|3|node_c1|4|node}}) group. The subgroup [3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|3|node|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3], and [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{See|List of planar symmetry groups}}

In the Euclidean plane there's 3 fundamental reflective groups generated by 3 mirrors, represented by Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|node|4|node|4|node}}, {{CDD|node|6|node|3|node}}, and {{CDD|node|split1|branch}}, and are given Coxeter notation as [4,4], [6,3], and [(3,3,3)]. The parentheses of the last group imply the diagram cycle, and also has a shorthand notation [3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

{{Brackets|4,4}} as a doubling of the [4,4] group produced the same symmetry rotated π/4 from the original set of mirrors.

Direct subgroups of rotational symmetry are: [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [6,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [(3,3,3)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] and [6,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are semidirect subgroups.

== Complex reflections==
[[File:Rank2_shephard_subgroups3.png|thumb|All subgroup relations on rank 2 Shephard groups.]]
Coxeter notation has been extended to [[Complex vector space|Complex space]], C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where nodes are [[unitary reflection]]s of period greater than 2. Nodes are labeled by an index, assumed to be 2 for ordinary real reflection if suppressed. [[Complex reflection group]]s are called [[Shephard group]]s rather than [[Coxeter group]]s, and can be used to construct [[complex polytope]]s.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^1&lt;/math&gt;, a rank 1 shephard group {{CDD|pnode}}, order ''p'', is represented as &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[], []&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; or ]&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[. It has a single generator, representing a 2''&amp;pi;''/''p'' radian rotation in the [[Complex plane]]: &lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Coxeter writes the rank 2 complex group, &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; represents [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|pnode|3|q|3|rnode}}. The ''p'' and ''r'' should only be suppressed if both are 2, which is the real case [''q'']. The order of a rank 2 group &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;g = 8/q(1/p+2/q+1/r-1)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, 9.7 Two-generator subgroups reflections. pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' is 2,3,4,...), &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[8]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[5]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[10]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|pnode|4|node}}, {{CDD|3node|3|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|6|node}}, {{CDD|3node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|4node|3|4node}}, {{CDD|3node|8|node}}, {{CDD|4node|6|node}}, {{CDD|4node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|5|3node}}, {{CDD|5node|3|5node}}, {{CDD|3node|10|node}}, {{CDD|5node|6|node}}, {{CDD|5node|4|3node}}. 
[[File:Rank2_infinite_shephard_subgroups3.png|thumb|left|Some subgroup relations among infinite Shephard groups]]

Infinite groups are &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[12]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[8]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or {{CDD|3node|12|node}}, {{CDD|4node|8|node}}, {{CDD|6node|6|node}}, {{CDD|3node|6|3node}}, {{CDD|6node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|4node|4|4node}}, {{CDD|6node|3|6node}}.

Index 2 subgroups exists by removing a real reflection: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[2''q'']&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Also index ''r'' subgroups exist for 4 branches: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''r'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For the infinite family &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for any ''p'' = 2, 3, 4,..., there are two subgroups: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; [''p''], index ''p'', while and &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[]×&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[], index 2.

'''Crop art''' is an environmental art practice using plants and seeds in the landscape to create statements, marks and/or images. [[Agnes Denes]], Matthew Moore (artist), [[Dennis Oppenheim]] and [[Stan Herd]] are practitioners of Crop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Maika|title=Interview: Agnes Denes|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/agnes-denes/print/|publisher=Interview Magazine|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vanesian|first1=Kathleen|title=Food for Thought: Artist Matthew Moore to Show Work at 2010 Sundance Film Festival|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/food-for-thought-artist-matthew-moore-to-show-work-at-2010-sundance-film-festival-6613834|accessdate=15 August 2017|publisher=Phoenix New Times|date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dennis Oppenheim: Directed Seeding - Cancelled Crop 1969|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/oppenheim-directed-seeding-cancelled-crop-t12402|publisher=Tate Museum|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Crop Art and Other Earthworks.''

==Historical precedents==
[[File:LindaPaulsen.jpg|thumb|Linda Paulsen demonstrates making seed art at the Minnesota State Fair]]
[[File:TOR New Orleans float.jpg|thumb|Rose Bowl Parade, Tournament of Roses, New Orleans float]]
One [[folk art]] version of crop art is called '''seed art''', a [[Visual arts|visual art]] form created in [[mosaic]]-style, similar to the technique of  [[pointillism]] in painting, or [[needlepoint]] textiles. Seed mosaic images are created by fixing [[Plant|vegetable matter]], especially [[seed]]s, to a background. Coleen Sheehy,&lt;ref&gt;''Seed Queen'' by  Coleen Sheehy, Minnesota Historical Society Press: St. Paul, MN, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Seed Queen'' quotes a classic text on the subject: ''Decorating with Seed mosaics, Chipped Glass and Plant materials'' (first pub.1960)  by Elenor Van Rennslaer&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Van Rennslaer ''Decorating with Seed mosaics, Chipped Glass and Plant materials'' Kessinger Publishing, LLC (July 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; "...mosaics are tiles, glass, or stones set in mortar. Instead of these you can create a different kind of mosaic using such plant materials as seeds, tiny pods, and flowers" (Sheehy 49).
An example is the [[Corn Palace]] of Mitchell, South Dakota, that was first built for the  1892 Corn Exposition. Outer walls of the building were -and still are-  covered in murals made from multi-colored ears of corn (Sheehy 24)  The seed mosaic portraits by [[Lillian Colton]] are also examples. Her seed portraits of celebrities were exhibited in the strictly defined "Crop art" category at the [[Minnesota State Fair]] beginning in 1966. Rules for entry of Crop art allow "only seeds from Minnesota-grown farm crops or cultivated garden flowers, fruits, and vegetables" with no wild plant seeds permitted. Colton continued to teach and make Crop art until her death at age 95 in 2007 (Sheehy 2). A new generation of Crop, or Seed artists, known as the  "Postmodern School of Minnesota Crop Art" (Sheehy 90) is continuing this folk tradition. Some of these artists are "Cathy Camper, Alan Carpenter, Kim Cope, Linda Koutsky, Nancy Loung, Suzy Mears, Laura Melnick, and David Steinlicht" (Sheehy 90). There is a custodial aspect and preservation ethic associated with this plant-based art form.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Making Crop art is not only a way preserving and rejuvenating a vibrant folk craft but its practice foregrounds the need to collect, store, and value the lore and varieties of seeds.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
In Los Angeles, the [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Bowl Parade]] floats employ the flowers of plants in a similar collage or mosaic style.

==Crop circles==
The term Crop art might be used to describe formations known as [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Ency of Rel&amp;Spir"&gt;"Crop Circles." Encyclopedia of Religious and Spiritual Development. 2005.  SAGE Publications. 20 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.sage-ereference.com/religion/Article_n57.html&gt;. Eltjo H. Haselhoff&lt;/ref&gt; Crop Circles first came to mass media attention during  the 1980s after they were noticed in some agricultural fields in southern England (Ency Rel/Spir). Most often the images consist of very large and intricate series of rings and lines formed when standing crops, such as wheat and rye are flattened into patterns. Some attribute these designs to the marks left by landings of extra terrestrial craft because the images are usually very large, appear over a short period of time, and some do not show any visible tracks into or out of the design.  These same type of figures are found all over the world; though many do not attribute their manifestation to  visitations by alien beings. Crop Circles  are sometimes called crop formations, agroglyphs, or [[pictograms]]. Some are also created by recognized "landscape artists" for  commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="Ency of Rel&amp;Spir" /&gt;

'''Fin bathroom''' is a "bath museum" that is located in [[Fin Garden|Fin garden]], [[kashan]], and it is the shambles of Amir Kabir. This bathroom consists of two large and small bathroom. Construction of small bathroom is related to the [[Safavid era]] and it has been created with the original building of the garden. By building a large bath in the time of [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar|Fath Ali Shah]], the large bath was allocated to state dignitaries and VIPs of community and it was known as the Royal Bathroom. In contrast, the small bathroom was recognized as crew bathroom and was used by the general population.
The remarkable thing is that both bathrooms were complete with all the traditional features and architectural landmarks. Fin Bath in 1314 was registered as a national monument; it has also been registered in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rasekhoon.net/article/show/1010875/10-historic-bathrooms-of-iran/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Meyer Blumenthal''' (1875–1930) was an American philanthropist who founded the ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation),'' which awarded the [[Prix Blumenthal]] from 1919-1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians — to promote Franco- American relations.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;

For their altruism, Florence Blumenthal and her husband [[George Blumenthal (banker)|George Blumenthal]] received the [[Légion d'honneur|French Legion of Honor]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  Both [[:fr:Rue Florence-Blumenthal|a street]] as well as [[:fr:Square Florence-Blumenthal|a public square]] in Paris are named in her honor.

==Biography==
Florence Meyer was born in Los Angeles in 1875, the third of eight children&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; of [[Marc Eugene Meyer]], dry goods merchant from [[Strasbourg, France]], and Harriet Newmark Meyer, daughter of [[Joseph Newmark]], who founded New York’s Elm Street Synagogue.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;  Florence's younger brother [[Eugene Isaac Meyer|Eugene Meyer Jr.]] was president and publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]].''&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paris residence"&gt;{{Cite web

In 1925, Blumenthal moved to Paris with her husband, later donating to the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Children’s Hospital in Paris]] the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.  She and her husband received the [[French Legion of Honor]] in 1929,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  and Blumenthal died of bronchial pneumonia at her home in Paris on September 21, 1930, at age fifty-five.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{Cite web

In her autobiography, retired Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham described her aunt, Florence Blumenthal, as her father's much-loved sister with the perfect figure. Known as Florie to the family, she was known for bringing home massive amounts of clothing from Paris. She was also related to the powerful Levi Strauss family through her older sisters, Rosalie and Elise, each of whom had married a nephew of Strauss'.

Recognizing the quality of care provided to their son by Professor Le Mee at the Necker Children's Hospital in Paris, the Blumenthals make a significant donation for the construction of a new building, the Blumenthal Pavilion, built in 1926 as an innovative Ear Nose &amp; Throat (ENT) center operating around the clock, similar to the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].

==Prix Blumenthal==
{{Main|Prix Blumenthal}}
The [[Prix Blumenthal]] (or ''Blumenthal Prize'') was a grant or [[stipend]] awarded through the ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation)'', which Florence Blumenthal had founded.  Grants were given from 1919-1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

Juries including [[Paul Signac]] and [[Aristide Maillol]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; awarded a [[Prix Blumenthal]] [[prize money|purse]] of six thousand francs per year for two years.  This was increased from 1926 until her death in 1930 to ten thousand francs a year.

From 1919 to 1954 nearly two hundred artists received grants,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; including in 1921 [[Georges Migot]] (1891–1976), composer, painter, and a carver; in 1926 [[Paul Belmondo (sculptor)|Paul Belmondo]], sculptor; also in 1926  [[Paule Marrot]], textile artist;&lt;ref name="dauphinomaniac2"&gt;{{Cite web

===Impact of the Prix===
As an example of the impact of the Prix Blumenthal, textile artist [[Paule Marrot]] received the stipend in 1928, which allowed Marrot to open her workshop in [[Batignolles]] on rue Truffaut — where she became widely known for furniture textiles.&lt;ref name="legion"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Fragrance extraction''' refers to the [[separation process]] of aromatic compounds from raw materials, using methods such as [[distillation]], [[solvent extraction]], [[Expeller pressing|expression]], [[sieving]], or [[enfleurage]]. The results of the extracts are either [[essential oil]]s, [[Absolute (substance)|absolutes]], [[Concrete (extraction)|concrete]]s, or [[butter]]s, depending on the amount of [[wax]]es in the extracted product.

To a certain extent, all of these techniques tend to distort the odour of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. Heat, chemical solvents, or exposure to oxygen in the extraction process denature the aromatic compounds, either changing their odour character or rendering them odourless.

==Maceration/solvent extraction==
{{See also|Solvent extraction}}
Certain plant materials contain too little volatile oil to undergo expression, or their chemical components are too delicate and easily denatured by the high heat used in steam distillation. Instead, the oils are extracted using their solvent properties.

===Organic solvent extraction===
Organic solvent extraction is the most common and most economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged and agitated in a solvent that can dissolve the desired [[aromatic]] compounds. Commonly used solvents for ''maceration/solvent extraction'' include [[hexane]], and [[dimethyl ether]].

In organic solvent extraction, aromatic compounds as well as other hydrophobic soluble substances such as [[wax]] and [[pigment]]s are also obtained. The extract is subjected to vacuum processing, which removes the solvent for re-use. The process can last anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this matter as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for ''distillation'' or easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by heat. The remaining waxy mass is known as a ''[[Concrete (extraction)|concrete]]'', which is a mixture of essential oil, waxes, resins, and other [[lipophilic]] (oil-soluble) plant material, since these solvents effectively remove all hydrophobic compounds in the raw material. The solvent is then removed by a lower temperature distillation process and reclaimed for re-use.

Although highly fragrant, concretes are too viscous – even solid – at room temperature to be useful. This is due to the presence of high-molecular-weight, non-fragrant waxes and resins. Another solvent, often [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], which only dissolves the fragrant low-molecular weight compounds, must be used to extract the fragrant oil from the concrete. The alcohol is removed by a second distillation, leaving behind the ''[[Absolute (substance)|absolute]]''. These extracts from plants such as jasmine and rose, are called absolutes.

Due to the low temperatures in this process, the absolute may be more faithful to the original [[scent]] of the raw material, which is subjected to high heat during the distillation process.

===Supercritical fluid extraction===
Supercritical fluid extraction is a relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the extraction solvent. When [[carbon dioxide]] is put under high pressure at slightly above room temperature, a [[supercritical fluid]] forms (Under normal pressure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changes directly from a solid to a gas in a process known as [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimation]].) Since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[non-polar]] compound has low surface tension and wets easily, it can be used to extract the typically [[hydrophobic]] aromatics from the plant material. This process is identical to one of the techniques for making [[decaffeinated]] [[coffee]].

In [[Critical point (chemistry)|supercritical fluid]] extraction, high pressure [[carbon dioxide]] gas (up to 100 atm.) is used as a solvent. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively unreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odour of the raw material. Like solvent extraction, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extraction takes place at a low temperature, extracts a wide range of compounds, and leaves the aromatics unaltered by heat, rendering an essence more faithful to the original. Since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is gas at normal [[atmospheric pressure]], it also leaves no trace of itself in the final product, thus allowing one to get the absolute directly without having to deal with a concrete. It is a low-temperature process, and the solvents are easily removed. Extracts produced using this process are known as ''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extracts''.

===Ethanol extraction===
Ethanol extraction is a type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oils or concrete resulting from organic solvent extraction, expression, or enfluerage. Ethanol extracts from dry materials are called ''tinctures'', while ethanol washes for purifying oils and concretes are called ''absolutes''.

The impure substances or oils are mixed with ethanol, which is less hydrophobic than solvents used for organic extraction, dissolves more of the oxidized aromatic constituents ([[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, etc.), leaving behind the wax, fats, and other generally hydrophobic substances. The alcohol is evaporated under low-pressure, leaving behind [[Absolute (substance)|absolute]]. The absolute may be further processed to remove any impurities that are still present from the solvent extraction.

Ethanol extraction is not used to extract fragrance from fresh plant materials; these contain large quantities of water, which would also be extracted into the ethanol.

==Distillation==
[[Distillation]] is a common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from [[plant]]s, such as [[orange blossom]]s and [[rose]]s. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through [[condensation]] of the distilled vapor. Distilled products, whether through steam or dry distillation are known either as ''essential oils'' or ''ottos''.

Today, most common essential oils, such as lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus, are distilled. Raw plant material, consisting of the [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], [[wood]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[root]]s, [[seed]]s, or [[peel (fruit)|peel]], is put into an [[alembic]] (distillation apparatus) over [[water]].

===Steam distillation===
Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material for 60–105 minutes, which drives out most of their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation, which contain both water and the aromatics, is settled in a [[Florentine flask]]. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water as the oil will float to the top of the distillate where it is removed, leaving behind the watery distillate. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material, is called [[hydrosol]] and is sometimes sold for consumer and commercial use. This method is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[Plant stem|stems]]. Popular hydrosols are rose water, lavender water, and orange blossom water. Many plant hydrosols have unpleasant smells and are therefore not sold.

Most oils are distilled in a single process. One exception is [[Ylang-ylang]] ([[Cananga odorata]]), which takes 22 hours to complete distillation. It is [[Fractional distillation|fractionally distilled]], producing several grades (Ylang-Ylang "extra", I, II, III and "complete," in which the distillation is run from start to finish with no interruption).

===Dry/destructive distillation===
Also known as ''rectification'', the raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous [[pyrolysis]], which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil [[amber]] and fragrant [[wood]]s (such as [[birch]] tar) where an intentional "burned" or "toasted" odour is desired.

===Fractionation distillation===
Through the use of a [[fractionation column]], different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to manipulate the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the [[perfumer]] more control over their composition process.

==Expression==
[[wikt:expression|Expression]] as a method of fragrance extraction where raw materials are pressed, squeezed or compressed and the [[essential oil]]s are collected. In contemporary times, the only fragrant oils obtained using this method are the peels of fruits in the citrus family. This is due to the large quantity of oil is present in the peels of these fruits as to make this extraction method economically feasible. Citrus peel oils are expressed mechanically, or ''cold-pressed''. Due to the large quantities of oil in citrus peel and the relatively low cost to grow and harvest the raw materials, citrus-fruit oils are cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange oils that are obtained as [[by-product]]s of the commercial citrus industry are among the cheapest citrus oils.

Expression was mainly used prior to the discovery of [[distillation]], and this is still the case in cultures such as [[Egypt]]. Traditional Egyptian practice involves pressing the plant material, then burying it in unglazed ceramic vessels in the desert for a period of months to drive out water. The water has a smaller molecular size, so it diffuses through the ceramic vessels, while the larger essential oils do not. The [[Nymphaeaceae|lotus]] oil in [[Tutankhamen]]'s tomb, which retained its scent after 3000 years sealed in [[alabaster]] vessels, was pressed in this manner.

==Enfleurage==
[[Enfleurage]] is a two-step process during which the odour of aromatic materials is absorbed into wax or fat, then extracted with [[ethanol|alcohol]]. Extraction by [[enfleurage]] was commonly used when [[distillation]] was not possible because some fragrant compounds [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in modern industry, due to both its prohibitive cost and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.

[[File:GluedToTheBox.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Jonathan Cape]])]]
{{italic title}}
'''''Glued to the Box''''' (TV Criticism from the ''Observer'' 1979–1982), is the third and final collection of the television criticism [[Clive James]] wrote for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-critics-armchair-assassins-405315.html The Independent, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes material from articles that run from 2 December 1979 to 28 March 1982. In the Introduction he writes that he had, "never thought of television criticism as a career. It is the sort of thing one goes into with a whole heart but not for ones whole life." The volume finishes with his "standing up and moving aside" for his successor, [[Julian Barnes]]. "No doubt he will slag one of my programmes first chance he gets, but by then I will be in the habit of damning all critics as fools." ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' wrote: "Along with its two predecessors, (''[[Visions Before Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Crystal Bucket]]''), it will stand as a once-only critical phenomenon: ten years worth of high intelligence and wit." [[Sheridan Morley]] called him "far and away the funniest writer in regular [[Fleet Street]] employment."  The book is dedicated to [[Pat Kavanagh (agent)|Pat Kavanagh]] and [[Dan Kavanagh]] and carries an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Charles Péguy]] at its start.

'''iPhone art''' is a form of [[Interactive art]] that takes place on the screen of the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], or [[iPod Touch]]. It is distinct from pictorial works of art produced with an iPhone using paint apps such as [[Brushes]] or [[ArtRage]].

iPhone Art evolved from screen-based interactive art that formerly appeared on PC computer screens or on wall-mounted displays in galleries and museums. Due to the portability and ease of distribution with the [[iTunes App Store]], these forms of art are currently experiencing a renaissance as interactive works of art from the 1990s and 2000s are adapted to the iPhone and iPad, some even becoming bestsellers in the Entertainment and Music categories where these apps normally appear, since there is currently no Art category in the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20bciart.html For Digital Artists, Apps Provide New Palette, Reyhan Harmanci, New York Times, August 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first iPhone artists include [[Miltos Manetas]] and Memo Atken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo Akten - Work » by type|url=http://www.memo.tv|publisher=www.memo.tv|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created the JacksonPollock app,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JACKSONPOLLOCK .ORG by MILTOS MANETAS, 2003, a website readymade|url=http://www.manetas.com/pollock/|publisher=www.manetas.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theo Watson]] who created FATTAG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fat Tag – Open source tagging for the iPhone {{!}} F.A.T.|url=http://fffff.at/fattag/|publisher=fffff.at|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2009/jul/7/art-in-your-pocket/ Art In Your Pocket by Jonah Brucker-Cohen, Rhizome.org, July, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Snibbe]] who created Gravilux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravilux|url=http://snibbe.com/store/gravilux|publisher=snibbe.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bubble Harp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BubbleHarp|url=http://snibbe.com/store/bubbleharp|publisher=snibbe.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Golan Levin]], creator of Yellowtail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellowtail - Interactive Art by Golan Levin and Collaborators|url=http://www.flong.com/projects/yellowtail|publisher=www.flong.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/may/26/art-in-your-pocket-2/ Art In Your Pocket 2 by Jonah Brucker-Cohen, Rhizome.org, May, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Corliss Blakely and Meri Aaron Walker (iPhoneArtGirl) have held art exhibits with art made exclusively on their iPads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hockney's latest Paris art show, 'Fleurs fraiches,' shows off his iPhone 'Brushes' creations|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/10/david_hockneys_latest_paris_ar.html|publisher=www.cleveland.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Damon Albarn]] recorded the entirety of the new [[Gorillaz]] album, [[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]], on his iPad with various apps while on his North American tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gorillaz - The Fall|url=http://thefall.gorillaz.com/|publisher=thefall.gorillaz.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iPhone art may pose a threat to traditional gallery distribution of [[digital art]] because individual artist can distribute their apps directly to the general public without working through a gallery dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/blog/2010/05/19/art99 Art Wants to be Ninety-Nine Cents by Scott Snibbe, blog posting May 19, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lena Söderberg''', born '''Sjööblom''' (born 31 March 1951) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] model who appeared as a [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] in the November 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date = November 1972 |title = Playmate of the Month |journal = Playboy Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Lenna Sjööblom'''. Her [[centerfold]] was photographed by [[Dwight Hooker]].

A head and shoulder section of her centerfold, this cropped section itself known as [[Lenna]], is often used to test algorithms in [[digital image processing]].&lt;ref name=JH&gt;Jamie Hutchison, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf "Culture, Communication, and an Information Age Madonna"], ''IEEE Professional Communication Society Newsletter'' Vol. 45, No. 3, May/June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] in 1997, where she gave a presentation about herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml Imaging Experts Meet Lenna in Person].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the ubiquity of her ''Playboy'' photo scan, she has been called the "first lady of the internet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19260550 BBC News].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/playboy_backups/lena.html |title=Playboy Newsdesk - Lena |newspaper=Cs.cmu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was given to her by Jeff Seideman in a press release he issued announcing her appearance at the 50th annual IS&amp;T Conference.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:GeorgeLeybourne1.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Leybourne]], one of the first ''lions comiques'', on a [[sheet music]] cover by [[Alfred Concanen]]]]
The '''''lion comique''''' was a type of popular entertainer in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[music hall]]s, a parody of upper-class toffs or "swells" made popular by [[Alfred Vance]] and [[G. H. MacDermott]], among others. They were artistes whose stage appearance, resplendent in [[wikt:evening dress|evening dress]] (generally [[white tie]]), contrasted with the cloth-cap image of most of their music-hall contemporaries.

The songs the ''lions comiques'' sang were "hymns of praise to the virtues of idleness, womanising and drinking",{{sfnp|Kift|Kift|1996|p=49|ps=none}} perhaps the most well known of which is [[George Leybourne]]'s "[[Champagne Charlie (song)|Champagne Charlie]]". The ''lion comique'' deliberately distorted social reality for amusement and escapism.{{sfnp|Vicinus|1975|p=262|ps=none}}

'''Mae Murray''' (born '''Marie Adrienne Koenig''', May 10, 1885 – March 23, 1965) was an American actress, dancer, film producer, and screenwriter. Murray rose to fame during the [[silent film]] era and was known as "The Girl with the Bee-Stung Lips" and "The Gardenia of the Screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wortis Leider|first=Emily |title=Dark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino|publisher=Macmillan|year=2004|pages=64, 64|isbn=0-571-21114-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Murray was born in New York City, the second-oldest child of Joseph and Mary (''née'' Miller) Koenig. Her maternal grandparents had emigrated from France while her paternal grandparents had emigrated from Germany. She had two brothers, William Robert (born November 1889) and Howard Joseph (born January 1884).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ankerich|first=Michael G. |others=Brownlow, Kevin |title=Mae Murray: The Girl with the Bee-Stung Lips|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-13690-3|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family eventually moved to an apartment in the [[Lower East Side]]. In May 1896, Joseph Koenig, Murray's father, died from acute [[gastritis]] due to his alcoholism. To support the family, Mary Koenig took a job as a housekeeper for [[Harry Payne Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ankerich|first=Michael G. |others=Brownlow, Kevin |title=Mae Murray: The Girl with the Bee-Stung Lips|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-13690-3|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stage===
She first began acting on the Broadway stage in 1906 with dancer [[Vernon and Irene Castle|Vernon Castle]]. In 1908, she joined the [[chorus line]] of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], moving up to headliner by 1915. Murray became a star of the club circuit in both the United States and Europe, performing with [[Clifton Webb]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as some of her many dance partners.

===Films===
Murray made her motion picture debut in ''[[To Have and to Hold]]'' in 1916. She became a major star for [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], starring with [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Delicious Little Devil]]'' and ''Big Little Person'' in 1919. At the height of her popularity, Murray formed her own production company with her director, [[John M. Stahl]]. Critics were sometimes less than thrilled with her over-the-top costumes and exaggerated emoting, but her films were popular with movie-going audiences and financially successful.

In 1925, Murray, Leonard, and Stahl produced films at [[Tiffany Pictures]], with ''Souls for Sables'' (1925), starring [[Claire Windsor]] and [[Eugene O'Brien (actor)|Eugene O'Brien]], as the first film made by Tiffany. For a brief period of time, Murray wrote a weekly column for newspaper scion [[William Randolph Hearst]].

At her career peak in the early 1920s, Murray, along with such other notable Hollywood personalities as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[William S. Hart]], [[Jesse L. Lasky]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Donald Crisp]], [[Conrad Nagel]] and [[Irving Thalberg]] was a member of the board of trustees at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund]] – a charitable organization that offers assistance and care to those in the motion picture and television industries without resources. Four decades later, Murray herself received aid from that organization.

In the early 1920s, Murray was painted by the well known Hollywood portrait painter [[Theodore Lukits]].  This work titled ''Symphony in Jade and Gold (The Actress Mae Murray)'' (1922, Private Collection, Northern California) depicted Murray in the nude, gazing in a mirror.  It was exhibited at the Pacific Asia Museum in 1999 and two other venues as part of the exhibition ''Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist''.
[[File:Mae Murray Photoplay August 1916.png|left|thumb|200px|Mae Murray in ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine in 1916]]

===Decline===
Murray appeared in the title role in the [[Erich von Stroheim]] directed film ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' (1925), opposite [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]].  When silent films gave way to [[sound film|talkies]], Murray made an insecure debut in the new medium in ''[[Peacock Alley (1930 film)|Peacock Alley]]'' (1930), a remake of her earlier 1921 version ''[[Peacock Alley (1921 film)|Peacock Alley]]''.  In 1931, she was cast with newcomer [[Irene Dunne]], leading man [[Lowell Sherman]], and with fellow silent screen star [[Norman Kerry]] in the talkie ''[[Bachelor Apartment (film)|Bachelor Apartment]]''. The film was critically panned at the time of release and Murray made only one more film, ''High Stakes'' (1931) also with Sherman.

[[File:Maemurray.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mae Murray, 1926]]

A crucial blow to her film career occurred after she married her fourth husband, [[Mdivani|David Mdivani]], a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] man of minor aristocratic roots, whose brothers Serge and Alexis married actress [[Pola Negri]] and the heiress [[Barbara Hutton]] respectively. The couple married on June 27, 1926, and Mdivani became her manager, suggesting that his new wife ought to leave MGM. Murray took her husband's advice and walked out of her contract with MGM, making a powerful foe of studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]]. Later, she would swallow her pride and pleaded to return, but Mayer would not rehire her. In effect, Mayer's hostility meant that Murray was blacklisted from working for the Hollywood studios.&lt;ref name="Hill 2009"&gt;Program Note for "High Stakes" issued by Films on the Hill, Washington DC (June 13, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1927, Murray was sued by her then-masseuse, the famous Hollywood fitness guru [[Sylvia of Hollywood]] for the outstanding amount of $2,125 during a humiliating and detailed court case.&lt;ref&gt;''Hollywood Undressed: Observations of Sylvia As Noted by Her Secretary'' (1931) Brentano’s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In the 1940s, Murray appeared regularly at [[Billy Rose|Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe]], a nightclub which specialized in a [[Gay Nineties|"Gay '90s"]] atmosphere, often presenting stars of the past for nostalgic value. Her appearances collected mixed reviews: her dancing (in particular the Merry Widow Waltz) was well received, but she was criticized for her youthful costumes and heavy makeup application, trying to conceal her age. In 1946, she taught ballroom dancing to young teenagers at a dance studio in Los Angeles. It was located on Crenshaw Blvd., near 48th Street.

Murray's finances continued to collapse, and for most of her later life she lived in poverty. She was the subject of an authorized biography, ''The Self-Enchanted'' (1959), written by Jane Ardmore, that has often been incorrectly called Murray's autobiography.

On the evening of February 19, 1964, 78-year-old Murray was found disoriented in [[St. Louis]], thinking that she had completed a bus trip to New York. Murray explained to a [[Salvation Army]] officer that she had become lost trying to find her hotel, which she had forgotten the name of. She also refused bus fare back to Los Angeles as she claimed to have a ticket for the remainder of the journey in her purse, "if she could find it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YrMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i-wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=990,1605441 | title = Star of silent film days found wandering, lost | date = February 21, 1964 | work = Ottawa Citizen | accessdate = February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Prince David Mdivani and Mae Murray, 1926.jpg|thumb|Murray with fourth husband [[Mdivani|David Mdivani]] in 1926]]
In September 1908, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], while she was appearing in the ''Follies of 1908'', Murray married William M. Schwenker, Jr. (born 1885), the unemployed son of a brewery-supply dealer, who cut off his son's allowance upon news of the wedding;&lt;ref&gt;"Wedding Breakfast Made Him Bankrupt", ''The New York Times'', April 10, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced in 1910. On December 18, 1916, she married former dancer and future Olympic bobsled champion [[Jay O'Brien]].

After divorcing O'Brien in 1918,&lt;ref name="Motion Picture World 1918"/&gt; Murray wed movie director [[Robert Z. Leonard]] on August 18, 1918; they divorced on May 26, 1925.

Murray married her fourth husband, [[Mdivani|David Mdivani]], on June 27, 1926. They had one child, Koran David Mdivani (born 1927), before divorcing in 1933. Koran was later raised by Sara Elizabeth "Bess" Cunning of [[Averill Park, New York]], who began taking care of him in 1936, when the child was recovering from a double [[mastoid]] operation (Cunning's brother Dr. David Cunning was the surgeon). When Murray attempted to regain custody of her son in 1939, Cunning and her other brothers, John, Ambrose, and Cortland, refused, according to the ''[[New York Times]]'', at which time Murray and her former husband, Mdivani, entered a bitter custody dispute. It finally ended in 1940, with Murray being given legal custody of the child and the court ordering Mdivani to pay $400 a month maintenance. However, Koran Mdivani continued to live with Bess Cunning, who adopted him in 1940 under the name Daniel Michael Cunning.&lt;ref&gt;"Mae Murray Sues for Son's Custody: Asserts Up-State Family Refuses to Give Up Mdivani", ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1939, p. 28; "Mae Murray Opens Fight for Her Son", ''The New York Times'', September 29, 1939, p. 20; "Mae Murray Wins Case", ''The New York Times'', March 5, 1940, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Mdivani had managed to siphon off most of Murray's money.&lt;ref name="Hill 2009"/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Mae Murray Grave.JPG|thumb|200px|Grave of Mae Murray, Valhalla Memorial Park]]

Many years later, Murray moved into the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture House]] in [[Woodland Hills, California|Woodland Hills]], a retirement community for Hollywood professionals. She died there on March 23, 1965 at the age of 79.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S41kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=THUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2246,4730411&amp;dq=mae+murray+death&amp;hl=en|title=Mae Murray Played Role of Star Right Up to Death at 79|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=May 29, 1965|work=St. Joseph News-Press|page=3A|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]], [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|North Hollywood, California]].

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Mae Murray has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6318 Hollywood Blvd. She was one of three actresses ([[Pola Negri]] and [[Theda Bara]] were the others) whose eyes were combined to form the [[Chicago International Film Festival]]'s logo, a stark, black and white close-up of the composite eyes set as repeated frames in a strip of film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofilmfestival.com/history/ About Our Logo &amp;ndash; The Chicago International Film Festival.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary MacLane''' (May 1, 1881 &amp;ndash; ''c''. August 6, 1929) was a controversial [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born [[Americans|American]] writer whose frank memoirs helped usher in the [[Confessional poetry|confessional style of autobiographical writing]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicagoan,'' obituary editorial, August 1929. Quoted in ''Tender Darkness'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; MacLane was known as the "Wild Woman of Butte".&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;Watson, Julia Dr. (2002). "Introduction", ''The Story of Mary MacLane''. {{ISBN|1-931832-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLane was a very popular author for her time,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary article, 9 August 1929&lt;/ref&gt; scandalizing the populace with her shocking bestselling first memoir and to a lesser extent her two following books. She was considered wild and uncontrolled, a reputation she nurtured, and was openly [[bisexuality|bisexual]] as well as a vocal [[feminism|feminist]]. In her writings, she compared herself to another frank young memoirist, [[Marie Bashkirtseff]], who died a few years after MacLane was born,&lt;ref name="Mary MacLane 1911"&gt;Story of Mary MacLane (1902 and 1911), first entry.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[H. L. Mencken]] called her "the Butte Bashkirtseff."&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;

== Early life and family ==
MacLane was born in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada in 1881,&lt;ref name="Mary MacLane 1911"/&gt; but her family moved to the Red River area of Minnesota, settling in [[Fergus Falls]], which her father helped develop. After his death in 1889, her mother remarried a family friend and lawyer, H. Gysbert Klenze. Soon after, the family moved to [[Montana]], first settling in [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] and finally in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], where Klenze drained the family funds pursuing mining and other ventures. MacLane spent the remainder of her life in the [[United States]]. She began writing for her school paper in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''Tender Darkness'', bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
[[File:Mary MacLane.jpg|thumb|Mary MacLane (From the inside cover of The Story of Mary MacLane, Herbert S. Stone and Company, 1902)]]

From the beginning, MacLane's writing was characterized by a direct, fiery, highly [[individualist]]ic style. She was, however, also strongly influenced by such American regional realists as [[John Townsend Trowbridge]] (with whom she exchanged a few letters), [[Maria Louise Pool]], and [[Hamlin Garland]].

At the age of 19 in 1901, MacLane wrote her first book, titled by its author ''I Await the Devil's Coming'' but changed by its publishers, Herbert S. Stone &amp; Co., to ''The Story of Mary MacLane.'' It sold 100,000 copies in the first month &lt;ref&gt;''Tender Darkness'', introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and was influential on young women, but was pilloried by [[Conservatism|conservative]] critics and readers, and lightly ridiculed by [[H. L. Mencken]].

Some critics{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} have suggested that even by today's standards, MacLane's writing is raw, honest, unflinching, self-aware, sensual, and extreme.  She wrote openly about [[egotism|egoism]] and her own self-love, about sexual attraction and [[lesbian|love for other women]], and even about her desire to [[marry]] the [[Devil]].

Her second book, ''My Friend Annabel Lee'' was published by Stone in 1903. More experimental in style than her debut book, it was not nearly so sensational, though MacLane was said to have made a fairly large amount of money.

Her final book, ''I, Mary Maclane: A Diary of Human Days'' was published by [[Frederick A. Stokes]] in 1917 and sold moderately well but may have been overshadowed by America's recent entry into [[World War I]].

In 1917, she wrote and starred in the 90-minute autobiographical [[silent film]] titled ''[[Men Who Have Made Love to Me]]'',&lt;ref name=imdb /&gt; for [[Essanay Studios]]. Produced by film pioneer [[George Kirke Spoor]] and based on MacLane's 1910 article of the same title for a Butte newspaper, it has been speculated to have been an extremely early, if not the earliest, sustained breaking of the [[fourth wall]] in cinema, with the writer-star directly addressing the audience. Though stills and some subtitles have survived, the film is now believed to be lost.

== Influence ==
Among the numerous authors who referenced, parodied, or answered MacLane were [[Mark Twain]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Harriet Monroe]], famed lawyer [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Ring Lardner Jr.]], [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Daniel Clowes]] in [[Ice Haven]]. Among the less-remembered was [[Gertrude Sanborn]], who published an optimistic riposte to MacLane's 1917 ''I, Mary MacLane'' under the title ''I, Citizen of Eternity'' (1920).

== Personal life ==
MacLane had always chafed, or felt, "''anxiety'' of place,"&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; at living in Butte, which was a mining city far from cultural centers, and used the money from her first book's sales to travel to Chicago, then Massachusetts. She lived in [[Rockland, Massachusetts]], wintering in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], from 1903–1908, then in [[Greenwich Village]] from 1908–1909, where she continued writing and, by her own account, living a [[decadent]] and [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] existence. {{Citation needed|reason= Citation for to-be-published letters removed, unpublished sources not considered reliable per Wikipedia:Verifiability|date=July 2018}} She was close friends with the feminist writer [[Inez Haynes Irwin]], who is mentioned in MacLane's private correspondence and is referenced in some of MacLane's 1910 writing in a Butte newspaper.

For a period she lived with her friend [[Caroline M. Branson]], who had been the long-time companion of [[Maria Louise Pool]] until the death of the latter in 1898. They lived in the Rockland's house that Pool left to Branson. Mary Maclane also had a relationship with [[Harriet Monroe]]. In a poem dated 1902, MacLane writes:

Dear Harriet Monroe -

I remember you

I remember you on a summer forenoon.

You were there and I was there.

We went out to walk by the lake-shore.

The lake-shore was very beautiful.

You were so fascinating that day. You were so strong. You were so true.

Particularly you were so true.

I loved you.

I had infinite faith in you.

And you were kind.

You were kind - so that I felt it without knowing it.

Which is a wonderful thing and goes far.

Surely no Pharisee was ever yet kind like that.

For a summer forenoon:

My love to you - oh, my love to you.

Dear Harriet Monroe. -

At any rate - good-by.

- My love to you, always. - &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLane|first1=Mary|title=Human Days: A Mary MacLane Reader|date=2014|publisher=Petrarca Press|page=270|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=PZzEBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLane died in [[Chicago]] in early August 1929, aged 48. She was less frequently discussed through the mid to late 20th century, and her prose remained out of print until late 1993, when ''The Story of Mary MacLane'' and some of her newspaper feature work was republished in ''Tender Darkness: A Mary MacLane Anthology''.

== Contemporary collections and performances ==
In January 2011, the publisher of ''Tender Darkness'' (1993) announced forthcoming publication of an integrated complete-works anthology and biographical study of MacLane. The first volume, ''Human Days: A Mary MacLane Reader'' (with a Foreword by [[Bojana Novakovic]]), was published in late 2014.

In 2011, Novakovic wrote and performed "The Story of Mary MacLane - By Herself" in [[Melbourne, Australia]], which was subsequently staged in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 2012.

After graduating in 2006, Bachman sent out 76 video resumes without finding work, and had to take an unpaid internship with North American Media Group's ''[[North American Hunter]]'' Television in [[Minnetonka]], driving {{convert|150|mi}} round trip each day, and working nights as a waitress at a nightclub.&lt;ref name="Chaska"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SCTimes/&gt; Four months later she was hired as a full time producer for the show. She progressed to camera work, first by giving on-camera [[archery]] tips that other hunters were unwilling to, and later by filming and editing many of her own hunts to be aired for free, including a [[bowhunting|bow hunt]] of a 202 inch Illinois [[White-tailed deer]].&lt;ref name=SCTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Realtree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quincy"/&gt; "Nobody turns down free work, I learned," she says.&lt;ref name="Chaska"/&gt; As a camera professional, she shot, produced, and edited the first season of [[Mark Kayser]]'s ''[[Extreme Pursuits]]'' program.&lt;ref name="Realtree"/&gt;

In 2010, Bachman left NAMG to found her own production company named Deadly Passion Productions. She edited and did post-production work for hunting television shows including ''[[Dangerous Game (TV series)|Dangerous Game]]'', created online and instructional videos, led seminars on hunting at sports shows, managed social media sites, and wrote magazine articles.&lt;ref name="Realtree"/&gt; In January 2012, she returned to ''North American Hunter'' as a host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HuntingClub/posts/178821142224271|title=She's Back: Melissa Bachman returns to the North American Hunting Club.|date=January 31, 2012|work=''[[North American Hunter]]''|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-Bulletin"/&gt; Among her work for NAH was a five-day-a-week video series called ''"My Take" with Melissa Bachman'', that ran from February to August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author=Melissa Bachman|user=MelissaBachman |number=169089135456428032 |date=February 13, 2012 |title=Checkout my new web series called "My Take" that I'll be posting 5-days a week which revolves around hunting...|access-date=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author=Melissa Bachman|user=MelissaBachman |number=238830654584926208 |date=August 23, 2012 |title="My Take" is going on hold and Melissa has a pretty good reason why!

The ''Winchester Deadly Passion'' program, also produced by North American Media Group, began airing in July 2012 on the [[Pursuit Channel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theoutdoorwire.com/story/1341558615vkhj53nau36|title=North America Media Group Unveils Winchester Deadly Passion|work=The Outdoor Wire|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was picked up by the [[Sportsman Channel]] for its third season, July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2014/07/winchester-deadly-passion-with-melissa-bachman-debuts-this-week/|title=Winchester Deadly Passion with Melissa Bachman Debuts This Week|last=Scheuermann|first=Michelle|date=July 2, 2014|work=Ammoland Shooting Sports News|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after and sponsored by [[Winchester Ammunition]].

She works around 200 days a year in the field, switching between two cameramen who need more time off.&lt;ref name=SCTimes/&gt; In 2014, the program came out with a clothing line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2014/08/deadly-passion-apparel-now-available/|title=Deadly Passion Apparel Now Available|last=Scheuermann|first=Michelle|date=August 27, 2014|work=AmmoLand Shooting Sports News|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015, Bachman sponsored an ammunition based jewelry line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2015/05/melissa-bachman-teams-up-with-sureshot-jewelry/|title=Melissa Bachman Teams Up with SureShot™ Jewelry|last=Scheuermann|first=Michelle|date=May 11, 2015|work=AmmoLand Shooting Sports News|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachman struggles for an answer when asked about her life outside TV programs and hunting.&lt;ref name="Chaska"/&gt; "I can't even keep a plant alive — that's how little I'm home," she says.&lt;ref name="SCTimes"/&gt;

== Controversies over trophy hunting ==
On August 30, 2012, the [[National Geographic Channel]] were planning Bachman to be one of their contestants for the show that would become [[Ultimate Survival Alaska]], until a [[Change.org]] petition to exclude her because of her hunting background received 13,000 signatures in under 24 hours.&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/national-geographic-channel-animal-rights-melissa-bachman-ultimate-survivor-alaska-367238|title=National Geographic Channel Drops Survivalist Over Animal Rights Complaints|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=August 31, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Geographic's statement, in three [[Twitter]] posts, said she was eliminated because hunting was not the focus of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/arts/television/national-geographic-takes-hunter-off-tv-show.html?_r=0|title=National Geographic Takes Hunter Off TV Show|last=Kepler|first=Adam W.|date=September 2, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NatGeoChannel/status/241290996325953536|title="Upon further reflection, we plan to eliminate one of the survivalists from the ensemble cast, Melissa Bachman…"|last=Nat Geo Channel|date=August 30, 2012|work=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservationist Tim Martell, who launched the petition, had previously launched a Facebook campaign against [[Rosie O'Donnell]] for appearing with a [[hammerhead shark]] she had caught.

In November 2013, Bachman posted a photograph of herself smiling by the body of a lion, captioned "An incredible day hunting in [[South Africa]]!

'''Michael Dickinson''' (born 1950, [[Durham, England|Durham]]) is an English artist known for his work in Turkey, who works with political and satirical [[collage]]s. In 2008, he was prosecuted for a collage of the Turkish prime minister, but acquitted.&lt;ref name=tait&gt;Tait, Robert. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/turkey.humanrights "Turkish court acquits British artist over portraying PM as US poodle"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 September 2008. Retrieved 26 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the international [[art movement]] [[Stuckism]].&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

==Life and work==
Michael Dickinson was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, and spent most of his early years in [[Kuwait]], where his father was an employee of the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] and where he attended the Anglo-American School.&lt;ref name=timessatire&gt;Alberge, Dalya and Erdem, Suna (2006). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article675651.ece Satire that could land British artist in a Turkish jail], ''[[The Times]]'', 17 June 2006. Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Fyling Hall]] school in [[Yorkshire]]. He lives and works as an English teacher in Istanbul. He is the founder of the Istanbul branch of the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/world.html#Turkey "Stuckist groups"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a writer, playwright and actor.

===Collage banned by Tripod===

In May 2005, Dickinson's web site, "The Carnival of Chaos", was blanked and he was informed by the host Tripod (a member of the [[Lycos]] group), "You are no longer an authorized member of Tripod. You have been removed because your web site violated our Terms of Service."&lt;ref name=banned&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Index.html "The Carnival of Chaos banned"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after he had posted a collage, ''Tyrant's Pants'', showing President Bush in his underpants with a cruise missile coming out of his rear and a [[swastika]] on his right buttock.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

[[File:Tyrant's-Pants.jpg|thumb|upright|''Tyrant's Pants'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing President Bush]]
The collage was a response to a photo which had appeared with the headline "Tyrant's in his pants" on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', showing captive [[Saddam Hussein]] in underpants.&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

===Turkish court case===

In June 2006, [[Istanbul]] police removed one of Dickinson's collages from a show in the city organised by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; Dickinson states that he hung his work in the show unknown to the organisers.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton&gt;Birch, Nicholas.

Bush|President Bush]] in a pet show.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; 
He was informed by Turkish authorities that he would be prosecuted for "insulting the Prime Minister's dignity"; the charge carries a sentence of one to three years.&lt;ref name=blairasked&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2220955,00.html "Blair asked to help artist facing jail"] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 11 June 2006.

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Best in Show.jpg|thumb|left|''Best in Show'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing Turkish Prime Minister [[Tayyip Erdoğan]] as a dog given a rosette by US President George Bush]]
''[[The Times]]'' said: "The case could greatly embarrass Turkey and Britain, for it raises questions about Turkey’s human rights record as it seeks EU membership, with Tony Blair’s backing."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], co-founder of the Stuckist movement, wrote to British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] asking for his intervention:&lt;ref name=vatan&gt;[http://www.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=haberdetay&amp;tarih=12.06.2006&amp;Newsid=79736&amp;Categoryid=7 "Erdoğan'ı kızdıran kolaj için Blair devreye girdi"] ''Vatan'' (in Turkish) online, 12 June 2006. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is intolerable that a country applying for EU membership should censor freedom of political comment in this way. I trust you will communicate your strongest condemnation and ask for this case to be abandoned immediately. I ask for your assurance that you will oppose Turkish EU membership in the strongest terms, until Turkey adopts the attitudes of the civilised world towards human rights."&lt;ref name=stuckistartist&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Turkey.html "Blair asked to intervene as Stuckist artist faces 3 years jail in Turkey for this collage"] stuckism.com.

"It’s such an Alice in Wonderland feeling. The law is so absurd ... This law exists in Turkey about insulting 'Turkishness' or the State. You’re not allowed to state your opinion."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt;

In September 2006, Dickinson attended the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of the Global Peace and Justice Coalition show, charged with insulting behaviour for exhibiting Dickinson's work. The prosecutor described Dickinson as "ill-intentioned", but declined to bring a case because of "lack of evidence".&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; Hasan Gungor of the Istanbul-based group,  Initiative for Freedom of Speech, attributed this to fear of international news, when the [[European Union]] has concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt;

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Good Boy.jpg|thumb|''Good Boy'' by Michael Dickinson. He was prosecuted for its display.]]
Members of Global Peace and Justic Coalition remonstrated with Dickinson for distracting attention from their anti-[[Iraq War]] cause, and he then held up another collage showing Erdogan as a dog with a lead of the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]; he was arrested and charged with insulting the Turkish prime minister's dignity&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; with a trial date scheduled for October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Oliver.

In July 2007, Dickinson's collages were displayed at the [[A Gallery]], London, in the Stuckist show ''I Won't Have Sex with You as long as We're Married''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/AGalleryJuly07/IndexShow.html "I won't have sex with you as long as we're married"], stuckism.com.

On 25 September 2008, he was acquitted of any crime, the judge ruling that although there were "some insulting elements" in his collage, it fell "within the limits of criticism".&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; The case has favourable implications for Turkey's relationship with the [[European Union]], which had called for an improvement of its human rights record.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; Dickinson said, "I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions."&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

In June 2009, Dickinson fled Turkey for his native country, Britain, after learning that his acquittal had been overturned. Unable to find work, he returned to Istanbul soon after. In January 2010, a Turkish court convicted Dickinson of mocking the Turkish prime minister and levied a fine.   Refusing to pay the fine as a matter of principle, Dickinson faces up to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

Dickinson's application for a residence permit was refused due to his 2010 conviction, but he remained in the country after the expiry of his tourist visa. He was arrested in October 2013 for shouting [[Gezi Park]]-related slogans at police, and detained after his expired visa was discovered. He was deported after some days (and banned from returning for five years), choosing to go to Barcelona rather than his native Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickinson, ''CounterPunch'', 1 November 2013, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/01/tossed-out-of-turkey-after-twenty-seven-years/ Tossed Out Of Turkey After Twenty Seven Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.  But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that ''he'' is no singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohencentric.com/2015/06/22/rarely-viewed-video-leonard-cohen-on-his-atrocious-voice-dylan-lead-belly-ice-t-songwriting-love-wheres-the-beef/|title=1992 Video: Leonard Cohen On His Atrocious Voice, Dylan, Ice-T, Songwriting, Love &amp; Where's The Beef|date=22 June 2015|work=cohencentric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

{{Culture of Pakistan}}

[[Pakistan]] has a wide variety of [[folklore]], mostly circulated regionally. However, certain tales have related variants in other regions of the country or in [[neighbouring]] [[countries]]. ''Pakistani [[mythology]]'' here means the myths and sacred narratives of the culturally and linguistically [[Indo-Iranians|related groups of ancient peoples]] who inhabited the region of Pakistan and its borderlands.

==Music==
{{Main article|Pakistani folk music}}

== Provincial folklore ==
The provinces of Pakistan are known by the love stories in their folklore that have been immortalized by singers, reciters and storytellers of the regions.

=== Sindhi folklore ===
{{Main article|Sindhi folklore}}
'''Sindhi folklore''' ({{lang-sd|'''  لوڪ ادب'''}}) is the [[folklore|folk]] tradition which has developed in Sindh over a number of centuries.Sindh abounds with folklore, in all forms, and colors from such obvious manifestations as the traditional [[Watayo Faqir]] tales, the legend of ''Moriro'', epic tale of [[Dodo Soomro|Dodo Chanesar]], to the heroic character of [[Marui]] which distinguishes it among the contemporary folklores of the region. The love story of [[Sassui Punhun|Sassui]], who pines for her lover Punhu, is known and sung in every Sindhi settlement.  Other examples of the folklore of Sindh include the stories of Umar Marui and Suhuni Mehar.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyan Adwani, ed. ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''. [[Jamshoro]]: Sindhi Adabi Board, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sindhi folk Singers and women play a vital role to transmit the Sindhi folklore. They sang the [[Sindhi folk tales|folktales of Sindh]] in songs with passion in every village of Sindh.

Sindhi folklore has been compiled in  a series of forty volumes under [[Sindhi Adabi Board]]'s project of '''Folklore and Literature'''.This valuable project was accomplished by noted sindhi scholar [[Nabi Bux Khan Baloch|Dr.Nabi Bux Baloch]].The material for the project has been collected both from the oral traditions village folks and the written record. This folklore series deals with diverse segments Sindhi folklore and literature i.e. Fables and Fairy-tales, pseudo-historical Romances, Folk-poetry, Folk songs, Proverbs, Riddles etc.

=== Balochi folklore ===
[[Balochi language|Balochi]] folklore is alive with the love stories of [[Hani and Sheh Mureed|Hani and Shah Murad Chakar]], [[Shahdad and Mahnaz]], [[Lallah and Granaz]], [[Bebarg and Granaz]], and [[Mast and Sammo]], among others. The war tales of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] are equally stirring. The ''[[chap (dance)|chap]]'', a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] style of dancing, has a curious rhythm distinguished by an inertial back sway with every forward step. Baloch music has a unique flavour of its own.

=== Kashmiri folklore ===
[[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] regions in the north are equally rich in folklore.

=== Pakhtun folklore ===
In the [[Pukhtun]] areas of the northwest, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] is the home of energetic warlike dancers, the most prominent being the Khattak dance, which bears the name of the tribe that dances it. The romantic tale of [[Adam Khan And Durkhanai|Adam Khan]] and Durkhanai features a lute player (''[[rabab]]'') whose music earns the love of a beautiful girl, although she hasn't seen him yet.

=== Punjabi folklore ===
{{Main article|Punjabi folklore}}
Many folk tales from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] have been disseminated worldwide by the [[Punjabi diaspora]], especially in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States. The tale of two lovers, [[Heer Ranjha|Heer]] and Ranjha, is based in the [[Pakistan]]i part of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], in a city called [[Jhang]]. Today it is celebrated in songs, movies, theatre, and quotations. One may call a romantic person a Ranjha, meaning he is a devoted lover. Similarly a girl in love may be called "Heer." Apart from the epic of Hir and Ranjha, the Punjab has a rich tradition of ballads, folk tales, folk music and dance. The folklore of the Potohar Plateau of the north shows a local variant, while the lush green irrigated agriculture of the central plains is home to more sophisticated forms of folklore. The oldest living urban centre of Multan in the south is home to gentler forms of music and dance.

=== Saraiki folklore ===
[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] areas in the south are equally rich in folklore.

== External folklore ==

'''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'''&lt;ref&gt;Published in Neunzert 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[performance art|performance artist]] [[Lubo Kristek]] and also a series of his [[happening]]s. The artist started his happening series in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage.&lt;ref name="p121"&gt;Putová 2013, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
The first action was held in the city of [[Znojmo]]. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage). 

The second happening took place in public area – on the pavement of Mariahilfer Straße in [[Vienna]] in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina’s [[pointe shoe]]s into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Putová 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the [[avant-garde]] sense.

The assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschloß Riegersburg, today [[Schloss Ruegers]] (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.

In 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, [[Landsberg am Lech]]. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled ''Third Eye of Distant Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Manuela|last=Rieger|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/landsberg/Kunst-zum-Nachdenken-id3697011.html|title=Kunst zum Nachdenken|website=Augsburger Algemeine|publisher=|date=12 May 2008|access-date=16 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In the happening a new character appeared, Temptation (played by the prima ballerina of the Brno National Theatre Jana Přibylová), who gives the spectators electronic devices from a pink sack and who suddenly turnes into the devil). In one of the last scenes, this character toys with a representation of human fate – a black figurine – which she throws to the ground as soon as she tires of her plaything. At the end of the happening, Kristek carried the pink sack full of electronic refuse to the altar of the Landsberg Church of the Holy Cross. In this way, he emphasised the sharp contrast between our ancestors´ legacy and what will remain after the current epoch.&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;Putová 2018, [http://glyptotheque.com/index.php/meeting-point/requiem-for-mobile-telephones Chapter: Meeting place – Requiem for Mobile Telephones]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following happening took place in a Polish city of [[Sucha Beskidzka]]  in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a [[cult]] or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this “modern god” on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] the mobile phones.

{{Quote|The artist destroys the mobiles in the happenings. He disposes of them like refuse, but at the same time, he applies the ritual principle of sacrifice. The participants of the happening then “receive” the destroyed telephone (analogous with the torn up god) or even “consume” it via their reconnection in the creative process (analogous with the resurrection). The characters and spectators sew the mobiles on to the travelling assemblage, and they become co-creators of a work of art with a shape that changes from event to event. So through his message ''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'', Kristek achieves what he foretold in his picture ''The Moss Covered Telephone Call''. He experiments with the involvement of the public in events at he{Clarification}} interface between ritual and theatrical and creative art, with the use of random impulses during a collective creative process and with emphasis on the experiencing of the current moment. He attempts to restore lost communication and transform relations in an alienated “digital society”.&lt;ref name="requiem" /&gt;}}

''Requiem for Mobile Telephones'' belongs to Kristek’s critical assemblages as well as ''Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety'' (1976) that reveals the traps of consume approach and ''In the Prematurely Cloned Age of One Planet'' (2003) that questiones the ethics of current medical science.

'''Sand Mandala''' ({{bo|t=དཀྱིལ་འཁོར།|w=dkyil 'khor|thdl=kilkhor}}; {{zh|s=沙坛城|p=Shā Tánchéng}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;) is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition involving the creation and destruction of [[mandalas]] made from coloured  [[sand]]. A sand [[mandala]] is ritualistically  [[Art destruction|dismantled]] once it has been completed and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished to symbolize the Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life.
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sand mandala displaying its materials]]

==Materials and construction==
Historically, the mandala was not created with natural, dyed sand, but granules of crushed coloured stone. In modern times, plain white stones are ground down and dyed with opaque inks to achieve the same effect. The monks use a special, extremely dense sand in order to limit interference by things like wind or sneezes.  Before laying down the sand, the monks assigned to the project will draw the geometric measurements associated with the mandala. The sand granules are then applied using small tubes, funnels, and scrapers, called [[chak-pur]], until the desired pattern over-top is achieved. Sand mandalas traditionally take several weeks to build due to the large amount of work involved in laying down the sand in such intricate detail. It is common that a team of monks will work together on the project, creating one section of the diagram at a time, working from the centre outwards.

==Themes==
The [[Kalachakra]] Mandala for instance, contains 722 deities portrayed within the complex structure and geometry of the mandala itself. Other smaller mandalas, like the one attributed to [[Vajrabhairava]] contain significantly fewer deities and require less geometry, but still take several days to complete. Like all mandalas, these are meant as two-dimensional representations of what is supposed to be a three-dimensional environment. Various buildings have been suggested to be three-dimensional mandalas such as: [[Borobodur]] in Java, Indonesia, and [[the Bayon]] in Siem Reap, Cambodia, although no academic consensus on either has yet been reached.

Many sand mandala contain a specific outer locality which is clearly identified as a [[charnel ground]].

The colours for the painting are usually made with naturally coloured sand, crushed gypsum (white), yellow ochre, red sandstone, charcoal, and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Mixing red and black can make brown, red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower pollen, or powdered roots and bark.

==Ritual destruction==
The destruction of a sand mandala is also highly ceremonial. Even the deity syllables are removed in a specific order&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Barry|title=Wheel of Time, The: Visual Scripture of Tibetan Buddhism|origyear=1992|year=2003|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1559391871 |edition=2nd |author2=Yignyen, Tenzin |author3=Samten, Lobsang |author4=Chogyen, Pema Lobsang |author5=Gyaltsen, Dhondup Lobsang |author6=Lhundup, Jamphel |author7=Migyur, Tenzin |author8=Legdan, Tenzin |author9=Gyaltsen, Lobsang |author10=Kirti Tsenshab |author11=Moldow, Deborah |author12=Durgin, Gregory |chapter=X et. seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ༼༢༢༨།༢༢༩༽ --&gt; along with the rest of the geometry until at last the mandala has been dismantled. The sand is collected in a jar which is then wrapped in silk and transported to a river (or any place with moving water), where it is released back into nature. This symbolizes the ephemerality of life and the world.

'''Sankarabharanam''' ({{lang-en|The Jewel of Shankara}}) is a 1980 Indian [[Telugu language|Telugu-language]] [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Kaasinathuni Viswanath|K. Viswanath]]. Produced by Edida Nageswara Rao under the production company Poornodaya Art Creations, ''Sankarabharanam'' starred J. V. Somayajulu, Manju Bhargavi, Chandramohan and Rajyalakshmi.

==Plot==
The film begins with an introduction by Viswanath in the form of a [[Sanskrit]] [[Subhashita]] शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गानरसं फणिः (Music is enjoyed equally well by babies, animals and even snakes). We hope you appreciate our effort in bringing you the 'Jeeva Dhara' (Lifestream) of Indian classical music."

"Sankarabharanam" Sankara Sastri is a very popular [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] singer and a widower. People come in huge numbers to listen to his voice and consider him a great man. He has mastered the raga ''[[Shankarabharanam]]'' and hence is eponymous with the same. Tulasi, ([[Manju Bhargavi]]) is a Dasi's daughter who has great interest in music and dance.  She is also an admirer of Sastri, and goes to the riverbank in the early mornings when Sastri typically taught his own daughter.

One morning Tulasi is so thrilled by Sastri's singing that she begins dancing on the riverbank, oblivious of her surroundings.  Sastri sees her, and Tulasi also comes to her senses&amp;nbsp;— and abruptly stops, expecting Sastri's rebuke.  But Sastri reciprocates her sincerity and continues singing&amp;nbsp;— Thus is born an unspoken, platonic teacher-student relationship between the young dancer and the veteran singer.  This bond, bound to be misunderstood by a callous world, forms the crux of the story.

Tulasi's mother, of course, wants her to follow in the family profession by servicing rich clients.  The mother is waiting for the opportune time to introduce her daughter to prostitution, and one day she extracts a high price from a rich hedonist who's eager to be Tulasi's "first".  That man forces himself on Tulasi.  The foul deed done, the man sees a photo of Sastri in Tulasi's room and flings it to the ground while telling her that she's free to become the old Sastri's girlfriend now since he's done with her.  Tulasi, quiet until then, is ostensibly more hurt by the insult to Sastri, her [[guru]], than the crime perpetrated on herself.  She takes a shard of glass from the broken frame of Sastri's photo, and stabs the client.

A murder trial ensues, and Sastri tries to save Tulasi by consulting his lawyer brother ([[Allu Ramalingaiah]]), who wins the case in Tulasi's favour.  Justice comes through as Tulasi's mother is sent to jail for unlawful flesh trade, while Tulasi is a free but homeless woman.  Sastri brings Tulasi to his home&amp;nbsp;— precipitating changes in his own life.  The public, of course, assume that Sastri is keeping Tulasi at home as a mistress&amp;nbsp;— and avoid him as a debauchee.  Even Sastri's maid and musical accompanists, who until then grudgingly bore the maestro's mentoring of "that prostitute's daughter", openly rebel and leave.  Tulasi feels responsible for Sastri's troubles, and eventually moves out of his house.

Sastri's problems are not all due to Tulasi, however.  The winds of change have made classical music wane in popularity, while [[pop music]] is on the ascendant.  Sastri loses his loyal audience and, with it, his comfortable lifestyle.  Ten years pass, and Sastri is living in a small house with his grown up daughter.  Meanwhile, by a quirk of fate, Tulasi has inherited her mother's property that was under litigation until then.  She wants to help the struggling Sastri anonymously. Tulasi has a ten-year-old son by then, ostensibly from her one-&amp;-only conjugal encounter, and wishes that her son redeems his life by becoming Sastri's student&amp;nbsp;— A chance she desperately wanted for herself, but was denied by Fate. So Tulasi gets her son to pretend to be homeless, and enter Sastri's household as a servant boy&amp;nbsp;— and to earn his trust. Things go according to plan, and Tulasi is content to watch from a distance as her son gradually becomes a part of Sastri's household, and then his musical protege.

Pamulaparti Venkata Kameswara Rao ([[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandramohan]]), a [[Amateur|dilettante]] [[Niyogi|Niyogi Brahmin]] boy, falls in love with Sastri's daughter.  Although Sastri rejects the alliance at first, he later agrees after learning of the man's interest in classical music.  Tulasi then arranges for a concert on the day of Sastri's daughter's wedding, where Sastri finds his lost audience return to hear his voice.  Sastri sings at the concert, but suffers a heart attack part-way through it.  Then his disciple, Tulasi's son, takes over from the sidelines and continues singing the song.. As Sastri watches his student with pride, he also sees Tulasi at the side of the hall, and realizes (via eye contact with his lawyer brother) that the boy is Tulasi's son. A doctor is brought to attend to Sastri, who is on stage clutching his chest with pain, but Sastri waves off the physician, knowing that his end is near. As Tulasi's son completes the song, Sastri symbolically anoints the boy as heir to his music, then dies&amp;nbsp;— Tulasi comes running to her guru at that moment, and falls down at his feet&amp;nbsp;— Moments later we realize that she too has died with the shock of Sastri's death. The film ends in this tragic but uplifting note, as the newly-weds Chandra Mohan &amp; Sastri's daughter take charge of Tulasi's son.

==Production==
After hearing the plot, the producers were initially taken aback due to the [[parallel cinema]] tone to the subject matter, but finally [[Edida Nageswara Rao]] agreed to produce the film. He wanted [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] to enact the role of Sankara Sastry, [[K. Viswanath]] wanted [[Sivaji Ganesan]] to perform the role, but couldn't approach him for various reasons and also wanted [[Krishnam Raju]] for the role, but later refused as Viswanath felt his image as a star would ruin the role and he finally chosen a debutant [[J. V. Somayajulu]], a stage artist for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/Original-choice-Sankarabharanam|title=Original choice for Sankarabharanam?|first=|last=admin|date=8 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vamsy]], who went on to direct films like ''[[Sitaara]]'', ''[[Anveshana]]'' and ''[[Ladies Tailor (1985 film)|Ladies Tailor]]'' was one of the assistant directors in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/lessons-in-direction/article7642344.ece|title=Lessons in direction|first=B.

==Soundtrack==
The music, largely [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] based, was composed by [[K.V. Mahadevan]].
[[M. Balamuralikrishna]] was the original choice for the male playback singer, due to the heavy classical content of the compositions. But K. V. Mahadevan, having faith in the mettle of [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]], insisted on him taking up this challenge.

[[Image:StudioEIS NCC 9981.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Some of the 42 signers of the U.S. Constitution at the National Constitution Center, Philadelphia. Photo (c) Elliot Schwartz for StudioEIS]]'''StudioEIS''' (pronounced "Studio Ice") is a [[sculpture]] and [[design studio]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. It specializes in "visual storytelling" — the production of figurative sculpture in [[bronze]], stone, and resin for narrative exhibitions at cultural institutions, museums, and corporations worldwide.

== History ==

StudioEIS was founded in 1977 by [[New York City]] natives Ivan Schwartz (BFA [[Boston University]] College of Fine Arts) and Elliot Schwartz (BFA [[California Institute of the Arts]], MFA [[Yale University]]). It pioneered the design and production of innovative figurative sculptures for use as visual storytelling elements within museum settings during the 1970s. When the company was founded, [[museum]] displays were "peopled" by store mannequins. With growing resistance to using mass-produced mannequins for exhibitions, and with many museums eliminating staff positions, StudioEIS found a niche for itself in the world of narrative storytelling for museums. With the [[American Bicentennial]] at hand and a renewed interest in history, numerous museums were established across the country to address topics as diverse as [[civil rights]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] history, and science and technology. This confluence of talent and need created the initial impetus for StudioEIS' work.

Museums large and small began out-sourcing displays via [[exhibition designers]], and called upon StudioEIS to create lifelike sculptures to tell stories about American culture and its political history in vivid ways that put a face to history. StudioEIS' early commissions, for the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], were figurative, life-sized, and designed to engage the museum visitor.

With a growing reputation, StudioEIS began to work outside the museum world where innovative object making through visual storytelling was born at StudioEIS. The studio now began to work with [[architects]], industrial and scenic designers, restaurant designers, and hotel/[[casino designers]]. Sony, the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], Nike's flagship stores in Portland and Chicago, [[The Discovery Channel]], and [[Martha Stewart Living]] are among its many corporate clients. StudioEIS' sculptures have been on display outside the United States in Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Italy, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi.

The prominence of the studio grew as it became especially well known for its bronze portrait sculptures and public works, which have included sculptures of iconic figures, such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Albert Einstein]], Frederick Douglass and 42 bronze [[Founding Fathers]] at the [[National Constitution Center]] - which may be the largest bronze sculpture project of its type in American history. The distinguished portrait sculptures created by StudioEIS are featured in important cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History, The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, The Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia and The American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  StudioEIS' expertise has been called upon for high-profile "forensic" reconstruction projects for George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] Estate and Gardens, the exhibition "Written in Bone" at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the exhibition JANE, Starvation, Cannibalism &amp; Endurance at Jamestown for Jamestown and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.

Today StudioEIS' staff of [[sculptors]], [[painters]], costumers, researchers, and model-makers is enhanced by specialists in wax works, metal fabrication, and [[bronze casting]]. A project will often include collaboration with scholars in [[anthropology]], costume history, and [[forensic science]]. The sculptures of [[George Washington]] at ages 19, 45 and 57 that were unveiled at [[Mount Vernon]] in 2006 involved state-of-the-art forensic research and computer reconstruction.

StudioEIS’ Archive resides at the Briscoe Center of American History at the University of Texas/Austin. It was unveiled in November 2014.

'''Sylvia Beach''' (March 14, 1887 – October 5, 1962), born '''Nancy Woodbridge Beach''', was an American-born bookseller and  publisher who lived most of her life in [[Paris]], where she was one of the leading [[expatriate]] figures between [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]].{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}

She is known for her Paris bookstore, [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], where she published [[James Joyce]]'s controversial book, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), and encouraged the publication and sold copies of Hemingway's first book, ''[[Three Stories and Ten Poems]]'' (1923).

==Early life==
Beach was born in her father's [[parsonage]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States, on March 14, 1887, the second of three daughters of Sylvester Beach and Eleanor Thomazine Orbison. She had an older sister, Holly, and a younger sister, Cyprian.&lt;ref&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; Although named Nancy after her grandmother Orbison, she later decided to change her name to Sylvia.  Her maternal grandparents were missionaries to India, and her father, a Presbyterian minister, was descended from several generations of clergymen.  When the girls were young the family lived in Baltimore and in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey]]. Then in 1901, the family moved to France upon Sylvester Beach's appointment as assistant minister of the [[American Church in Paris]] and director of the American student center.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Beach spent the years 1902-1905 in Paris, returning to New Jersey in 1906 when her father became minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton.  Beach made several return trips to Europe, lived for two years in Spain, and worked for the Balkan Commission of the Red Cross.  During the last years of the Great War, she was drawn back to Paris to study contemporary French literature.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

While conducting some research at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], Beach found the name of a lending library and bookshop, ''La Maison des Amis des Livres''&lt;ref&gt;"The House of the Friends of Books"&lt;/ref&gt; at 7 [[rue de l'Odéon]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|Paris VI]], in a French literary journal.{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} There she was warmly welcomed by the owner who, to her surprise, was a plump fair-haired young woman, [[Adrienne Monnier]]. Monnier was wearing a garment that looked like a cross between a peasant’s dress and a nun’s habit, "with a long full skirt … and a sort of tight-fitting velvet waistcoat over a white [[silk blouse]]. She was in gray and white like her bookshop."{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Although Beach was dressed in a Spanish cloak and hat, Monnier knew immediately that she was American.  At that first meeting Monnier declared, "I like America very much".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Beach replied that she liked France very much. They later became lovers and lived together for 36 years&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; until Monnier’s suicide in 1955.

Beach immediately became a member of Monnier’s lending library, and when in Paris she regularly attended the readings by authors such as [[André Gide]],  [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Jules Romains]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Inspired by the literary life of the [[Left Bank]] and by Monnier’s efforts to promote innovative writing, Beach dreamed of starting a branch of Monnier’s book shop in New York that would offer contemporary French works to American readers.  Since her only capital was US$3,000 which her mother gave her from her savings, Beach could not afford such a venture in New York.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, Paris rents were much cheaper and the exchange rates favorable, so with Monnier’s help, Beach opened an English language bookstore and lending library that she named [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]]. Four years beforehand, Monnier had been among the first women in France to found her own bookstore. Beach's bookstore was located at 8 rue Dupuytren, Paris VI.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}
[[File:12 Rue Odéon, Paris May 2014.jpg|thumb|150px|left|12 Rue Odéon, Paris VI, location of the original Shakespeare &amp; Co., with memorial plaque on the right]]
[[File:Paris Rue de l Odeon 12 plaque retouched.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque, at 12 Rue Odéon, Paris VI mentioning that " In July 1920, Beach met Irish writer [[James Joyce]] at a dinner party hosted by French poet [[André Spire]]. Soon after, Joyce joined Beach's lending library.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, "When Paris Sizzled," p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce had been trying, unsuccessfully, to publish his manuscript for his masterpiece, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulyssess]]'' and Beach, seeing his frustration, offered to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, 'When Paris Sizzled," p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Sylvia Beach published James Joyce's Ulysses in this apartment."]]
Shakespeare and Company quickly attracted both French and American readers - including a number of aspiring writers to whom Beach offered hospitality and encouragement as well as books.  As the [[franc]] dropped in value and the favorable exchange rate attracted a huge influx of Americans, Beach’s shop flourished and soon needed more space.  In May 1921, Shakespeare and Company moved to 12 [[rue de l'Odéon]], just across the street from Monnier’s ''Maison des Amis des Livres''.  Shakespeare and Company gained considerable fame after it published [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1922, as a result of Joyce's inability to get an edition out in English-speaking countries.{{sfnp|Fitch|1983|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Griffin|1992|p=3}} Beach would later be financially stranded when Joyce signed on with another publisher, leaving Beach in debt after bankrolling, and suffering severe losses from, the publication of ''Ulysses''.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Shakespeare and Company experienced difficulty throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but remained supported by wealthy friends, including [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]].  In 1936 when Beach thought that she would be forced to close her shop, André Gide organized a group of writers into a club called Friends of Shakespeare and Company.  Subscribers paid 200 francs a year to attend readings at Shakespeare and Company.  Although subscriptions were limited to a select group of 200 people (the maximum number the store could accommodate), the renown of the French and American authors participating in readings during those two years attracted considerable attention to the store.  Beach recalled that by then, "we were so glorious with all these famous writers and all the press we received that we began to do very well in business".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp = 210-211}} [[Violette Leduc]] describes meeting her and the ambiance of the shop in her autobiography ''La Bâtarde''.{{sfnp|Leduc|Coltman|2003|p=TBA}} Shakespeare and Company remained open after the [[Fall of Paris#A new German offensive and the fall of Paris|Fall of Paris]], but by the end of 1941, Beach was forced to close.{{sfnp|Glass|2009|pp = 24–27}}
She was interned for six months during [[World War II]] at [[Vittel]] until [[Tudor Wilkinson]] managed to secure her release in February 1942. Beach kept her books hidden in a vacant apartment upstairs at 12 rue de l'Odeon. [[Ernest Hemingway]] symbolically "liberated" the shop in person in 1944,{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=219-220}} but it never re-opened for business.

In 1956, Beach wrote ''Shakespeare and Company'', a memoir of the inter-war years that details the cultural life of Paris at the time.  The book contains first-hand observations of [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Valery Larbaud]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[André Gide]], [[Leon-Paul Fargue]], [[George Antheil]], [[Robert McAlmon]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Stephen Benet]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Harry Crosby]], [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Caresse Crosby]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Man Ray]], and many others.

After Monnier's suicide in 1955, Beach had a relationship with [[Camilla Steinbrugge]].{{sfnp|Monnier|McDougall|1996| p=529}}&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; Although Beach's income was modest during the last years of her life, she was widely honored for her publication of ''Ulysses'' and her support of aspiring writers during the 1920s. She remained in Paris until her death in 1962, and was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]]. Her papers are archived at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=andre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|title=Sylvia Beach|date=May 4, 2003|accessdate=2010-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820084635/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[George Whitman]] opened a new bookshop in 1951 at a different location in Paris (in the [[rue de la Bûcherie]]) originally called ''Le Mistral'', but renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 in honor of the late Sylvia Beach.{{sfnp|Sharkey|2002|}} Since his death in 2011, it has been run by his daughter [[Sylvia Beach Whitman]], named after Beach.{{sfnp|Lennan|2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">A '''technical advisor''' is an individual who is an expert in a particular field of [[wiktionary:knowledge|knowledge]], hired to provide detailed information and advice to people working in that field.  For example, a construction company might hire a technical expert in fluid dynamics to advise them if seeking to move a small water course or a company operating in [[adventure education]] will frequently hire technical experts to ensure that their policies and procedures are robust enough to handle the hazards they are going to face.

==Film and television==
[[Movie director|Movie]] or [[television director]]s, will often hire a technical advisor to ensure that a complicated area is portrayed accurately in the production. For example, a director for a show involving [[combat]] [[aviation]] might hire one or more current or former combat [[Aviator|pilots]] to serve as technical advisors. Similarly, a [[historical period|period]] movie may include one or more [[historian]]s of the period, or eyewitnesses if possible, for the same purpose.

Technical advisors typically answer to the director. Their expertise adds realism both to the [[acting]] and to the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of a movie. Some advisors for military movies have been known to run miniature [[recruit training|boot camp]]s to give [[actor]]s a first-hand experience of a [[wiktionary:military|military]] setting. Captain [[Dale Dye]] is a noted technical advisor and provider of military training for actors through his [[Warriors, Inc.]]. The [[US Army]] has often provided technical advisors to [[war film]]s. [[Nipo T. Strongheart]] was a noted technical advisor on several movies dealing with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref name=Hearne2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Hearne|title=Native Recognition: Indigenous Cinema and the Western|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ9z36n4ps8C&amp;pg=PA78|date=25 January 2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-4399-7|pages=78, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strongheart1954"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[British Army]] have supplied their own brand of technical military advisors to the film industry. [http://www.kftv.com/news/2016/08/24/screen-action-filming-with-the-military Paul Biddiss] is one such expert, who has built on a long military career to advise on a multitude of high-profile films and TV series. 

Technical advisors who have become actors include [[George Kennedy]] (an Army advisor to the ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]]'' [[television show]]) and [[John Dierkes]] (an accountant working for the [[U.S. Treasury]], who provided technical assistance to the makers of ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]''). A former [[child actor]], [[Frank Coghlan Jr]], enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]], and later became an advisor to Hollywood on Navy-themed films.&lt;ref&gt;Coghlan, Frank ''They Still Call Me Junior'' McFarland &amp; Co 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Lee Ermey]], a former U.S. Marine who became a technical advisor on several [[Vietnam War]] films lensed in the [[Philippines]] became a lead actor in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' as well as an advisor. Ermey said "A technical advisor must be a salesman. He's got to be able to sell the producer-director on his way of doing things"&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Larry ''The Few and the Proud: Marine Corps Drill Instructors in Their Own Words'' 2006 W.W. Norton &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} Ermey told of battles with Kubrick over realism, and what could be shown onscreen and be appreciated by a cinema audience. Ermey lost battles over such items as a recruit having concealed a fully loaded magazine in his footlocker rather than a few stray rounds, and the way Marine Corps Drill Instructors hit recruits in the solar plexus rather than slapping their faces. Ermey won over Kubrick in other points of Marine Corps decorum.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;{{rp|159}}

'''''The Fly II''''' is a 1989 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] starring [[Eric Stoltz]] and [[Daphne Zuniga]]. It was directed by [[Chris Walas]] as a [[sequel]] to the [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), itself a [[Film remake|remake]] of the 1958 [[The Fly (1958 film)|film of the same name]]. Stoltz's character in this sequel is the adult son of Seth Brundle, the scientist-turned-'Brundlefly', played by [[Jeff Goldblum]] in the 1986 remake. With the exception of stock footage of Goldblum from the first film, [[John Getz]] was the only actor to reprise his role.

==Plot==
Several months after the events of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, who is the owner of the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments and fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a [[housefly]]. Martin grows up in a clinical environment. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease.

At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a dog. The next night, he brings it some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but not to duplicate the programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. An attempt to teleport the dog fails, leaving it horribly deformed. It maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a [[bungalow]] on the Bartok facility's property. He also offers Martin a job: repair his father's Telepods. He apologizes about the dog and assures Martin that its suffering was brief. When Martin is uneasy about the proposition, Bartok shows him Veronica Quaife's videotapes, which documented Seth Brundle's progress with the Telepods. Seeing his late father describe how the Telepods ostensibly improved and energized his body, Martin accepts Bartok's proposal.

As he begins work on the Telepods, Martin befriends an employee, Beth Logan. Beth invites Martin to a party at the specimens division, where he learns that the mutated dog is still kept alive and studied. Thinking Beth is aware of the dog's imprisonment, Martin argues with her, leaves the party, and goes to the animal's holding pen. The deformed dog, in terrible pain, still remembers Martin and happily wags its tail at the sight of him before he tearfully euthanizes it with [[chloroform]]. Martin is in a sullen mood for a while and denies having anything to do with the dog's death when Bartok questions him about it. Martin reconciles with Beth, and re-arrives at his father's "eureka" moment when he realizes the Telepod's computer need to be creative to analyze living flesh. Martin then shows Beth his perfected Telepods by teleporting a kitten without harm. They become lovers and have sex, but Martin begins showing signs of his eventual mutation into a human-fly hybrid. Martin devises a potential cure for his condition, which involves swapping out his mutated genes for healthy human genes. Martin shelves this idea when he realizes the other person would be subject to a grotesque genetic disfigurement.

Eventually, Martin learns that Bartok has hidden cameras in his bungalow. Martin breaks into Bartok's records room, where he learns of his father's true fate. Bartok confronts Martin and explains that he's been waiting for his inevitable mutation. He reveals his plan to use Martin's body and the Telepods' potential for genetic manipulation for profit. Martin's insect genes fully awaken and his transformation into a human-insect hybrid begins. He escapes from Bartok Industries. Bartok is unable to use the Telepods, as they are locked by a password. Martin also installed a computer virus which will erase the Telepods' programming if the wrong password is entered. Bartok orders a search for Martin.

Martin goes to Beth and explains the situation. The two flee. They visit Veronica Quaife's old confidant, Stathis Borans, who confirms for Martin that the Telepods are his only chance for a cure. They keep running, but Martin's physical and emotional changes become too much for Beth to handle, and she eventually surrenders them both to Bartok. Without revealing the password, he becomes enveloped in a cocoon. Bartok interrogates Beth for the password. Shortly after, the fully transformed "Martinfly" emerges from his cocoon and breaks into Bay 17. He grabs Bartok and forces him to type in the password, which is revealed to be DAD. He then drags Bartok and himself into a Telepod. Martinfly gestures Beth to activate the gene-swapping sequence and, despite Bartok's protests, Beth complies. Martin is restored to a fully human form, while Bartok is transformed into a freakish monster who is now kept in the same cell the dog used to be. In the film's final shot, as the Bartok creature leans towards a dish of food, it notices a fly.

[[Janet Maslin]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "The only respect in which it matches Mr. Cronenberg's ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|Fly]]'' is in its sheer repulsiveness, since this film degenerates into a series of slime-ridden, glop-oozing special effects in its final half hour."&lt;ref name="maslin89"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Janet |title=Review/Film; Another Look at Insecthood As a Possible Way of Life - The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/11/movies/review-film-another-look-at-insecthood-as-a-possible-way-of-life.html |website=New York Times.com |publisher=Janet Maslin |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrington from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' offered the film similar criticism, calling the film's script "flat", and criticized the film's special effects as being "clumsy".&lt;ref name="harrington89"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harrington |first1=Richard |title=‘The Fly II’ (R) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theflyiirharrington_a0aaa6.htm |website=Washington Post.com |publisher=Richard Harrington |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film a BOMB, his lowest rating, calling the film "Alternately dull and messy but mostly dull.&lt;ref name="Maltin2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Maltin|title=Turner Classic Movies Presents Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide: From the Silent Era Through 1965: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fttJBgAAQBAJ|date=29 September 2015|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-698-19729-9|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Hughes from ''[[Empire Magazine]]'' awarded the film 3/4 stars, writing, "Whilst this fly is not as tightly scripted or keenly directed as its parent, it does have pace, breathless tension and the sort of gross-out effects that rules out kebabs for some time after the credits have rolled."&lt;ref name="hughes2000"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=David |title=The Fly II Review |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/fly-ii/review/ |website=Empire Online.com |publisher=David Hughes |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Lady and the unicorn Desire.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Lady and the Unicorn'': ''À mon seul désir'' ([[Musée national du Moyen Âge]], Paris)]]
'''''The Lady and the Unicorn''''' ({{lang-fr|La Dame à la licorne}})  is the modern title given to a series of six [[tapestry|tapestries]] woven in [[Flanders]] from wool and silk, from designs ("[[cartoon]]s") drawn in Paris around 1500.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/collection/oeuvre/tenture-la-dame-a-la-licorne.html the six tapestries at the Musée du Moyen-Âge website]&lt;/ref&gt;   The set, on display in the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]] (former Musée de Cluny) in Paris, is often considered one of the greatest works of art of the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.

Five of the tapestries are commonly interpreted as depicting the five [[senses]] – taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. The sixth displays the words "''À mon seul désir''".  The tapestry's meaning is obscure, but has been interpreted as representing [[love]] or understanding.  Each of the six tapestries depicts a noble lady with the [[unicorn]] on her left and a [[lion]] on her right; some include a [[monkey]] in the scene.  The pennants, as well as the armour of the Unicorn and Lion in the tapestry bear the arms of the sponsor, [[Jean Le Viste]], a powerful nobleman in the court of [[Charles VII of France|King Charles VII]]. However, a very recent study of the heraldry appears to lend credence to another hypothesis - previously dismissed - that the real sponsor of the tapestry is Antoine II Le Viste (1470–1534), a descendant of the younger branch of the Le Viste family and an important figure at the court of Charles VIII, Louis XII and François I.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Decu Teodorescu, "La tenture de la ''Dame  la licorne'' : nouvelle lecture des armoiries", in ''Bulletin Monumental'', [[Société française d'archéologie]], n° 168-4, 2010, pp. 355-367.  The coat of arms that appears on the tapestry was attributed by specialists to the older branch and to the chief of the Le Viste family, Jean IV Le Viste, but it blatantly breaks the rules of French heraldry with an incorrect superposition of colours (blue on red).  While underscoring the weakness of the arguments in favour of the name Jean IV Le Viste as the patron of the tapestry, this new study suggests the probability of the intervention of Antoine II Le Viste, the descendant of the younger branch of the family, in ordering the Lady and the Unicorn.  The incorrect superposition of colours could have been a deliberate choice intended to apprise the observer, in an explicit et well known manner, that he was faced with a familiar phenomenon, that of the modification of the coat of arms by a mark of cadency.  Documentary sources appear to lend credence to this hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestries are created in the style of ''[[mille-fleur]]s'' (meaning: "thousand flowers").

The tapestries were rediscovered in 1841 by [[Prosper Mérimée]] in [[Boussac, Creuse|Boussac]] castle (owned at the time by the subprefect of the [[Creuse]]) where they had been suffering damage from their storage conditions. In 1844 the novelist [[George Sand]] saw them and brought public attention to the tapestries in her works at the time (most notably in her novel ''Jeanne''), in which she correctly dated them to the end of the fifteenth century, using the ladies' costumes for reference.&lt;ref name="amazon.com_2015-01-01"&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Mysteries-History-Places-Symbolism/dp/0892541725/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420132161&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780892541720| title=Medieval Mysteries: A Guide to History, Lore, Places and Symbolism: Karen Ralls PhD, p. 180: 9780892541720: Amazon.com: Books| newspaper=Amazon.com| date= | author=| accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the artefacts continued to be threatened by damp and mould until 1863, when they were brought to the Thermes de Cluny in Paris. Careful conservation has restored them nearly to their former glory.

==Content and themes ==
[[File:Edmond du Sommerard photograph BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|Edmond du Sommerard, curator of the [[Musée de Cluny]], who bought the tapestries]]The subject of the tapestries are complex, and scholars "now (generally) agree that they present a meditation on earthly pleasures and courtly culture, offered through an allegory of the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-symbolism-of-the-lady-and-the-unicorn-tapestry-cycle-91325|title=Explainer: the symbolism of The Lady and the Unicorn tapestry cycle|last=De Vitis|first=Mark|date=February 8, 2018|website=The Conversation|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;''Touch''
The lady stands with one hand touching the unicorn's horn, and the other holding up the pennant. The lion sits to the side and looks on.

;''Taste''
The lady is taking sweets from a dish held by a maidservant. Her eyes are on a parakeet on her upheld left hand. The lion and the unicorn are both standing on their hind legs reaching up to pennants that frame the lady on either side. The monkey is at her feet, eating one of the sweetmeats.

;''Smell''
The lady stands, making a wreath of flowers. Her maidservant holds a basket of flowers within her easy reach. Again, the lion and unicorn frame the lady while holding on to the pennants. The monkey has stolen a flower which he is smelling, providing the key to the allegory.

;''Hearing''
The lady plays a [[portative organ]] on top of a table covered with an [[Oriental rug]].  Her maidservant stands to the opposite side and operates the bellows.  The lion and unicorn once again frame the scene holding up the pennants.  Just as on all the other tapestries, the unicorn is to the lady's left and the lion to her right - a common denominator to all the tapestries.

;''Sight''
The lady is seated, holding a mirror up in her right hand. The unicorn kneels on the ground, with his front legs in the lady's lap, from which he gazes at his reflection in the mirror. The lion on the left holds up a pennant.

;''À Mon Seul Désir''
This tapestry is wider than the others, and has a somewhat different style. The lady stands in front of a tent, across the top of which is written "''À Mon Seul Désir''", an obscure motto, variously interpretable as "to my only/sole desire", "according to my desire alone"; "by my will alone", "love desires only beauty of soul", "to calm passion". Her maidservant stands to the right, holding open a chest. The lady is placing the necklace she wears in the other tapestries into the chest. To her left is a low bench with a dog sitting on a decorative pillow. It is the only tapestry in which she is seen to smile. The unicorn and the lion stand in their normal spots framing the lady while holding onto the pennants.

This tapestry has elicited a number of interpretations.  One interpretation sees the lady putting the necklace into the chest as a renunciation of the passions aroused by the other senses, and as an assertion of her free will.  Another sees the tapestry as representing a sixth sense of understanding (derived from the sermons of [[Jean Gerson]] of the University of Paris, ''c.'' 1420).  Various other interpretations see the tapestry as representing love or virginity.  It is also debated whether the lady in ''"À Mon Seul Désir"'' is picking up or setting aside the necklace.

In The Lady with the Unicorn tapestry series, it is generally accepted that the first five tapestries represent the five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.  The interpretation of the sixth tapestry, "À Mon Seul Désir," remains uncertain.  
&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, Adolfo Salvatore.  The Unicorn Tapestries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York:Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998. pp. 99-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new proposal suggests that the French words, "à mon seul désir," translate to "with my unique desire," meaning that people are the only species that covet material objects even as we share the five senses with animals.  The tapestries appear to be arranged to show that while we share the five senses, we are unique in our want of valuable possessions.  In the scenario depicted in the last tapestry, it is unclear whether the lady is taking her necklace from the box held by her maid or putting it away, but that distinction doesn’t matter.  The point is that she treasures the golden necklace.

In the first five tapestries, one or more of the animals are shown utilizing the represented sense along with the women.  In "Sight," the unicorn is gazing at itself in a mirror held by the lady.  Presumably, all of the animals can hear the music being played by the women in the "Hearing" tapestry.  In "Taste," a monkey is eating a sweetmeat as the lady takes a sweet from a bowl held by her maid, and in "Smell," the monkey is sniffing a flower as the lady assembles a flower wreath.  The "Touch" tapestry features the lady's hand touching the unicorn's horn.  In the final tapestry, only the two women are engaged in handling the necklace, while some of the animals seem to watch from afar.
The blue tent in the last tapestry also serves to separate the human figures from the natural world, which includes the unicorn with its mythical qualities.  The tent frames the lady handling her necklace with a strip of cloth and her maid and is not present in any of the previous tapestries.  In all of the tapestries except "Smell," a falcon, sometimes wearing jesses, is hunting another bird.  In the sixth tapestry, this occurs above and outside of the tent and may represent hunting as another trait or proclivity shared between people and animals.

The interpretation of people alone valuing material objects ties the individual representations of the six tapestries together and allows them to flow towards the realization that, while people may live alongside the natural and mythical worlds (which, in medieval times, were likely considered the same), they remain separate and not completely in either due to their unique desires.

==In popular culture==
* The tapestries are described in detail by the narrator of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s novel ''The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge''.
* ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn (album)|The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' is the title of a 1970 album by the English folk guitarist [[John Renbourn]], comprising arrangements of early music. It shows the tapestry ''À Mon Seul Désir'' on its cover.
* These tapestries are depicted in the novel ''The Lady and the Unicorn'' by [[Tracy Chevalier]].
* Several of the tapestries can be seen hanging on the walls of the Gryffindor Common Room in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series of films.
* The six tapestries have inspired the six movements of [[Kaija Saariaho]]'s clarinet concerto ''D'om le Vrai Sens'': the title is an anagram of "A mon seul désir".
* The tapestries are featured heavily in the novel ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn]]'' and its anime adaptation. The Lady, Lion, Unicorn and chest are symbolized by various characters, mecha and items in the series.
* One of the tapestries can be found hanging in the Musée Crune in the game ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]]''.
* The tapestry ''Sight'' is the cover art of [[Anonymous 4]]'s 1994 [[early music]] album ''Love's Illusion: Music from the Montpellier Codex 13th Century''.
* The tapestries' orange trees were adapted and redesigned by artist [[Leon Coward]] for the mural ''The Happy Garden of Life'' in the 2016 sci-fi movie ''[[2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Masson |first=Sophie |author-link=Sophie Masson |title=2BR02B: the journey of a dystopian film–an interview with Leon Coward |website=Feathers of the Firebird |url=https://firebirdfeathers.com/2016/10/19/2br02b-the-journey-of-a-dystopian-film-an-interview-with-leon-coward/ |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural also makes use of the [[millefleur]] style.
* The tapestries appear briefly in a scene of the 2016 movie ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through The Looking Glass]]''
*[[Rumer Godden]]'s 1938 novel ''The Lady and the Unicorn'' is based around a run-down 18th-century house built by French émigrés in Calcutta, where the chapel (now converted into an apartment) bears the coat of arms with the unicorn and a French sundial in the garden is inscribed 'Mon Seul Desir'.  The ghosts of the first inhabitants appear to the current residents, principally Rosa, who is having a love-affair with a young Englishman.
* After discovering them in a book, the tapestries become an obsession of the protagonist in the 2018 film "The Escape".

'''The School of Panamerican Unrest''' ''(La Escuela Panamericana del Desasosiego)'' is a [[conceptual art]] project led by Mexican artist [[Pablo Helguera]]. The project involves a series of performances, discussions and screenings to seek connections between the different regions of the Americas. The core of the project consisted of a travelling schoolhouse which made 30 stops between the U.S. state of Alaska and Chile's [[Antártica Chilena Province|Antártica Chilena]] [[Provinces of Chile|province]] between May and September 2006, following the entire length of the [[Pan-American Highway]]. At each stop topics such as immigration, globalization and the role of art in society were examined as they relate to Pan-American culture, history and ideology. The project echoes the efforts of intellectuals such as [[José Marti]], [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José Vasconcelos]] to create a unified cultural region in the Americas. The project began with an interview of Marie Smith Jones, the last living speaker of [[Eyak language|Eyak]], a Native Alaskan language; and ended with an interview with [[Cristina Calderón]], the last living speaker of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]], in [[Puerto Williams]], [[Tierra del Fuego]].  Currently a travelling exhibition and accompanying documentary are being planned, bringing together the documentation obtained during the project.

'''''The Writer Will Do Something''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] video game written by Matthew S. Burns and [[Tom Bissell]] and created using [[Twine (software)|Twine]].

== Development ==
The game was originally written in 2015 by Matthew S. Burns and Tom Bissell. Bissell had previously worked on [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]] franchises such as ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dias|first=Bruno|url=https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/kzz4xx/experience-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-writing-for-video-games|title=Experience the Horror and Absurdity of Writing for Video Games|date=2017-09-11|work=Waypoint|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns aimed to explain to video gaming fans how chaotic and difficult a creative project can be, as he felt critics and fans would often wonder "why didn't the devs just do this" when he felt there were barriers that prevented that which would be explained through this behind-the-curtain look.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Orland|first=Kyle|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/play-the-game-that-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-make-a-good-game/|title=How tough can game making be? One AAA dev offers a playable answer|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2015-04-02|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its release to August 2015, the game was played 38,000 times.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/250657/Honest_tales_from_the_trenches_of_AAA_game_writing.php|title=Honest tales from the trenches of AAA game writing|last=Francis|first=Bryant|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2015-08-10|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players questioned whether developers would be so rude to each other, while developers deemed the game a documentary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
It tells the story of a video game writer sitting through a meeting about a AAA game – the third in the fictional ''ShatterGate'' franchise – which is having issues after receiving negative feedback and with a looming [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] date.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game exudes an air of "weary pain",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and aims to explore the "debilitating pressure of high-budget videogame writing".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Calixto|first=Joshua|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/the-year-in-feels/|title=The Year in Feels|date=2015-12-18|work=[[Kill Screen]]|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameplay sees the player click on the text to view the next text screen.

== Critical reception ==
''Waypoint'' deemed the game a "painfully accurate satire of the role [[video game writing]] takes place in video games."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]'' deemed it a "gripping, well-constructed work"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and outlined what it saw as the game's thesis statement: "No one sets out to make a bad game, but bad games still get made all the time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Meanwhile, ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' felt it was a "mix of sharp social observation and collective embarrassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Brendan|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/04/have-you-played-the-writer-will-do-something/#more-400071|title=Have You Played… The Writer Will Do Something?|date=2016-10-04|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kill Screen]]'' compared the game's keen sense of [[auteur]] status to those of ''[[Cibele (video game)|Cibele]]'', ''[[The Beginner's Guide]]'', and ''[[Emily Is Away]]'', and further described it as a "PTSD flashback" with circular arguments and no clear solution.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' suggested that to video game players, this is a clever way for them to break their rose-tinted glasses of how their favourite games get made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Muncy|first=Julie|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/best-games-missed-2015/|title=Games You Might Have Missed in 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=2015-12-22|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gamasutra]]'' noted that while there are  practical guides, blogs and talks available to teach aspiring writers how to write video games, this is a rare interactive experience that demonstrates what it is actually 'like' to write a video game, likening it to "Empathy Machines" as defined by Liz England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/240030/New_Twine_game_simulates_life_as_a_AAA_game_writer.php|title=New Twine game simulates life as a AAA game writer|last=Wawro|first=Alex|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2015-03-30|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5492">[[File:Hortus Sanitatis 1491.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1491 illustration, depicting the extraction and use of a toadstone]]

The '''toadstone''', also known as '''bufonite''', is a [[mythical]] stone or [[Gemstone|gem]] that was thought to be found in the head of a [[toad]]. It was supposed to be an [[antidote]] to [[poison]] and in this it is not unlike '''batrachite''', supposedly formed in the heads of frogs. Toadstones were actually the button-like [[fossilized]] teeth of ''[[Lepidotes]]'', an extinct genus of [[ray-finned fish]] from the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. They appeared to be "stones that are perfect in form" and were set by European jewellers into magical rings and amulets from Medieval times until the 18th century.&lt;ref name='Independent UK Fossils1'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fossils: myths, mystery and magic | date=2007-02-12 | publisher=Independent UK | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fossils-myths-mystery-and-magic-436005.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
From ancient times people associated the fossils with jewels that were set inside the heads of toads. The toad has poison glands in its skin, so it was naturally assumed that they carried their own antidote and that this took the form of a magical stone. They were first recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the first century.

According to Paul Taylor of the London [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]:

{{quote|Like [[Shark tooth#History of discovery|tonguestones]], toadstones were considered to be antidotes for poison and were also used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]". As early as the 14th century, people began to adorn jewelry with toadstones for their [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] abilities. In their folklore, a toadstone was required to be removed from an old toad while the creature was still alive, and as instructed by the 17th century [[naturalist]] [[Edward Topsell]], could be done by setting the toad on a piece of red cloth.}}

[[File:Lepidotes elvensis skull.jpg|thumb|[[Fossile|Fossilized]] ''[[Lepidotes]]'', showing detail of the skull, from which toadstones originated]]
[[File:Various toadstones.jpg|thumb|right|Toadstones from Jurassic sediments in Oxfordshire UK]]

The true toadstone was taken by contemporary jewellers to be no bigger than the nail of a hand and they varied in colour from a whitish brown through green to black, depending on where they were buried.&lt;ref name="17thC Lapidary"&gt;Thomas Nicols (1652). Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones. Part ii, chapter xxxvi, pp.158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; They were supposedly most effective against poison when worn against the skin, on which occasion they were thought to heat up, sweat and change colour.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Widdowes alias Woodhouse (1631). [https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5158807 Naturall Philosophy: Or Description of the World, and of the Severall Creatures therein contained]. Second Edition, corrected and enlarged.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person was bitten by a venomous creature a toadstone would be touched against the affected part to effect a cure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lupton (1576). A Thousand Notable Things, Of Sundry Sortes.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively  Johannes de Cuba, in his book ''Hortus sanitatis'', claimed that toadstone would help with kidney disease and earthly happiness.&lt;ref name=Campbell33&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Marian |date=2009 |title=Medieval Jewellery in Europe 1100-1500|publisher=V&amp;A Publishing |page=33 |isbn=9781851775828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose toadstones were discovered among other gemstones in the Elizabethan [[Cheapside Hoard]] and there are surviving toadstone rings in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].

==Allusions in literature==

The toadstone is [[Allusion|alluded]] to by Duke Senior in [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1599), in  Act 2, Scene 1, lines 12 through 14:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sweet are the uses of adversity; &lt;br /&gt;
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, &lt;br /&gt;
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[James Branch Cabell]]'s [[short story]] "Balthazar's Daughter" (collected in ''The Certain Hour'') and its subsequent play adaptation ''The Jewel Merchants'', [[Alessandro de Medici]]  attempts to seduce Graciosa by listing various precious jewels in his possession, including "jewels cut from the brain of a toad".

'''Verse drama''' is any [[drama]] written as [[poetry|verse]] to be spoken; another possible general term is '''poetic drama'''.  For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in [[Europe]] (and was also important in non-European cultures).  [[Greek tragedy]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s plays are written in verse, as is almost all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s drama, [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and others like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]''.

Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of [[tragedy]], providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of [[Christopher Fry]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] being possibly the end of a long tradition).

==Dramatic verse==
'''Dramatic verse''' occurs in a dramatic work, such as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], composed in poetic form.  The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as [[ancient Greece]].

The [[English Renaissance]] saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]] developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form.  Though a few plays, such as ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as [[blank verse]]; there are also passages of prose.

Dramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Verse drama did have a role in the development of [[Irish theatre]].

==Closet drama==
{{main|closet drama}}
An important trend from around 1800 was the [[closet drama]]: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.

Instead, [[opera]] would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse [[libretto]] can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. 

According to [[Robertson Davies]] in ''[[A Voice From the Attic]]'', closet drama is "''Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!''". But indeed a great deal of it was written in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded [[Epic poetry|epic]]. Prolific in the form were, for example, [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]] and [[Gordon Bottomley]].

==Dramatic poetry in general==
'''Dramatic poetry''' is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. 

The major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and [[libretti]]. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include [[dramatic monologue]]s, such as those written by [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

'''''Wings of Desire''''' ({{Lang-de|Der Himmel über Berlin|lit=The Heaven Over Berlin}}) is a 1987 [[romantic fantasy]] film directed by [[Wim Wenders]]. The film is about invisible, immortal [[angel]]s who populate Berlin and listen to the thoughts of its human inhabitants, comforting those who are in distress. Even though the city is densely populated, many of the people are isolated or estranged from their loved ones. One of the angels, played by [[Bruno Ganz]], falls in love with a beautiful, lonely [[trapeze]] artist, played by [[Solveig Dommartin]]. The angel chooses to become mortal so that he can experience human sensory pleasures, ranging from enjoying food to touching a loved one, and so that he can discover human love with the trapeze artist.

Inspired by art depicting angels visible around [[West Berlin]], at the time enclaved by the [[Berlin Wall]], Wenders and author [[Peter Handke]] conceived of the story and continued to develop the screenplay throughout the [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Germany|German]] co-production. The film was shot by [[Henri Alekan]] in both colour and a sepia-toned black-and-white, the latter being used to represent the world as seen by the angels. The cast includes [[Otto Sander]], [[Curt Bois]] and [[Peter Falk]].

For ''Wings of Desire'', Wenders won awards for Best Director at both the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes Film Festival]] and [[European Film Award for Best Director|European Film Awards]]. The film was a critical and financial success, and academics have interpreted it as a statement of the importance of cinema, libraries, the circus, or [[German reunification|German unity]], containing [[New Age]], religious, secular or other themes.

It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'', released in 1993. ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'', a U.S. remake, was released in 1998. In 1990, numerous critics named ''Wings of Desire'' as one of the best [[1980s in film|films of the 1980s]].

==Plot==
In a [[Berlin]] divided by the [[Berlin Wall]], two [[angel]]s, Damiel and Cassiel, watch the city, unseen and unheard by its human inhabitants. They observe and listen to the thoughts of Berliners, including a pregnant woman in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, a young [[prostitution in Germany|prostitute]] standing by a busy road, and a broken man who feels betrayed by his wife. Their ''[[:wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' is, as Cassiel says, to "assemble, testify, preserve" reality. Damiel and Cassiel have always existed as angels; they were in Berlin before it was a city, and before there were any humans.

Among the Berliners they encounter in their wanderings is an old man named Homer, who dreams of an "epic of peace". Cassiel follows the old man as he looks for the then-demolished [[Potsdamer Platz]] in an open field, and finds only the [[graffiti]]-covered Wall. Although Damiel and Cassiel are pure observers, visible only to children, and incapable of any interaction with the physical world, Damiel begins to fall in love with a profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named Marion. She lives by herself in a caravan in [[West Berlin]], until she receives the news that her group, the Circus Alekan, will be closing down. Depressed, she dances alone to the music of [[Crime &amp; the City Solution]], and drifts through the city.

[[File:GWT 39, Boyenstraße im Juni 1989.jpg|left|thumb|200 px|The graffiti on the [[Berlin Wall]] is depicted in the film.]]
Meanwhile, actor [[Peter Falk]] arrives in West Berlin to make a film about the city's [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] past. Falk was once an angel, who, having grown tired of always observing and never experiencing, renounced his immortality to become a participant in the world. Also growing weary of infinity, Damiel's longing is for the genuineness and limits of human existence. He meets Marion in a dream, and is surprised when Falk senses his presence and tells him about the pleasures of human life.

Damiel is finally persuaded to shed his immortality. He experiences life for the first time: he bleeds, sees colours, tastes food and drinks coffee. Meanwhile, Cassiel taps into the mind of a young man just about to commit suicide by jumping off a building. Cassiel tries to save the young man but is unable to do so, and is left tormented by the experience. Sensing Cassiel's presence, Falk reaches out to him as he had Damiel, but Cassiel is unwilling to follow their example. Eventually, Damiel meets the trapeze artist Marion at a bar during a concert by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], and she greets him and speaks about finally finding a love that is serious and can make her feel complete. The next day, Damiel considers how his time with Marion taught him to feel amazed, and how he has gained knowledge no angel is capable of achieving.

===Development===
[[File:Berlin Tiergarten Siegessaeule 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Berlin art depicting angels served as an inspiration to the filmmakers.]]
After living and working in the United States for eight years, director [[Wim Wenders]] returned to his native [[West Germany]] and wished to reconnect to it with a film about his favourite part of it, [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref name="KennyWenders"/&gt; Planning to make ''[[Until the End of the World]]'' in 1985, he realised the project would not be ready for two years, and wishing to return to photography as soon as possible, he considered another project.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=164}}

[[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s poetry partially inspired the story. Wenders claimed angels seemed to dwell in Rilke's poetry, and the director had also jotted "angels" in his notes one day,&lt;ref name="Wenders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1290-on-wings-of-desire |title=On Wings of Desire |last=Wenders |first=Wim |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807112715/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1290-on-wings-of-desire |archivedate=7 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted angel-themed artwork in cemeteries and around Berlin.&lt;ref name="KennyWenders"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[film treatment|treatment]], Wenders also considered a backstory in which God exiled his angels to Berlin as punishment for defending humans after 1945, when God had decided to forsake them.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=165}}

Wenders employed [[Peter Handke]], who wrote much of the dialogue, the poetic narrations, and the film's recurring poem "Song of Childhood".{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}} Wenders found the names Damiel and [[Cassiel]] in an encyclopedia about angels, and also had photographs of [[Solveig Dommartin]], [[Bruno Ganz]] and [[Otto Sander]] that served as muses.&lt;ref name="Wenders"/&gt; The idea that angels could read minds led to Wenders considering personal dialogue no one would say aloud.&lt;ref name="KennyWenders"/&gt; Wenders did not view the angel protagonist as representative of himself, instead deciding the angel could be an embodiment of film, and that the purpose of film could be to help people by opening their eyes to possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13525798.html |title=Das Kino könnte der Engel sein |last=Müller |first=Andre |date=19 October 1987 |accessdate=12 September 2017 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] | language= German | deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413233902/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13525798.html |archivedate=13 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Handke did not feel able to write a single coherent story, but promised to regularly send notes on ideas during production.&lt;ref name="Handke"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Handke |first2=Peter |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter [[Richard Reitinger]] also assisted Wenders in scripting scenes around Handke's contributions.{{sfn|Wenders|1997|p=67}}

Given the nature of this arrangement, Wenders would hold daily meetings with his crew, frequently at late hours, to plan the logistics for the following day.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=165}} French producer [[Anatole Dauman]] did not see a large budget as necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/wenders-takes-wing-117908/ |title=Wenders takes wing |last=Lerner |first=Dietlind |date=30 January 1994 |accessdate=13 August 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807073433/http://variety.com/1994/film/news/wenders-takes-wing-117908/ |archivedate=7 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the project was funded with 5 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]].{{sfn|Lüdi|Lüdi|2000|p=60}}

Wenders believed it would be important for the actors playing the two main angel characters to be familiar and friendly with each other. Ganz and Sander had performed in some of the same stage productions for 20 years.&lt;ref name="KennyWenders"/&gt; Sander and Ganz also recommended [[Curt Bois]] to Wenders and asked Bois to perform.&lt;ref name="Sander"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |last3=Sander |first3=Otto |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois' performance as Homer marked his final feature film in an 80-year career, beginning as a child actor.{{sfn|Huda|2004|p=249}}

[[Peter Falk]]'s role was not planned until photography had already begun, with Wenders planning an artist or political official to have an analogous role until assistant Claire Denis suggested the ''[[Columbo]]'' star would be familiar to everyone.&lt;ref name="Feaster"/&gt; Falk described the part as "the craziest thing that I've ever been offered", but quickly agreed.&lt;ref name="KennyWenders"/&gt; He was accustomed to the improvisation the newly created role required, and when Wenders and Falk met, they conceived ideas of the character sketching and searching for a hat.&lt;ref name="Feaster"/&gt; [[Nick Cave]] and his band were based in West Berlin, with Wenders calling him "a real Berlin hero" and deciding "It was inconceivable for me to make a film in Berlin without showing one of his concerts".{{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=113-114}}

The film was shot by [[Henri Alekan]],{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=237}} whose cinematography represents the angels' point of view in monochrome, as they cannot see colours, and switches to colour to show the human point of view. During filming, Alekan used a very old and fragile silk stocking that had belonged to his grandmother as a filter for the monochromatic sequences,{{sfn|Hurbis-Cherrier|2012|p=277}} adding a touch of [[sepia (color)|sepia]] to the [[black and white]].&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/five-visual-themes-wings-desire-immortal-film-about-watching |last=Singer |first=Leigh |date=14 September 2016 |title=Five visual themes in Wings of Desire – Wim Wenders' immortal film about watching |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=5 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601070531/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/five-visual-themes-wings-desire-immortal-film-about-watching |archivedate=1 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenders felt it was natural that angels without experience of the physical world would not see colour, and also thought black-and-white cinematography by Alekan would provide a novel view of Berlin.&lt;ref name="Wenders"/&gt;

A challenge in the cinematography was posed by using the camera for the perception of angels, as angels are not restrained in how far they can observe, in any dimension.{{sfn|Cook|1997|pp=167-168}} The story's Circus Alekan is named in the cinematographer's honour.{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=237}}

Filming took place at actual locations in [[West Berlin]], such as [[Hans Scharoun]]'s [[Berlin State Library]],&lt;ref name="Pulver"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/aug/17/top-10-films-set-in-berlin |last=Pulver |first=Andrew |date=17 August 2011 |title=10 of the best films set in Berlin |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=5 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310050627/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/aug/17/top-10-films-set-in-berlin |archivedate=10 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Wall was recreated in studio,&lt;ref name="Pulver"/&gt; due to shooting the true Wall being outlawed. Some pieces of the recreation were made from inexpensive wood, with one being destroyed by rain during production.&lt;ref name="Feaster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111419%7C0/Wings-of-Desire.html |last=Feaster |first=Felicia |date= |title=Wings of Desire |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=5 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807074357/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111419%7C0/Wings-of-Desire.html |archivedate=7 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With little idea of how to portray the angels and no costume design, Wenders said the filmmakers consulted artwork, experimented, and found the idea of armor during production, and told U.S. filmmaker [[Brad Silberling]] they did not decide on overcoats until later.&lt;ref name="Silberling"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |last3=Silberling |first3=Brad |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hairstyle was loosely inspired by a photograph of a Japanese warrior.&lt;ref name="Sander"/&gt;

Although the circus scenes required extensive and risky acrobatics, Dommartin was able to learn the trapeze and rope moves in a mere eight weeks, and did all the work herself, without a stunt double.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Jakubowski |first=Maxim |author-link=Maxim Jakubowski |date=6 February 2007 |title=Solveig Dommartin, Wenders' fearless angel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/feb/06/solveigdommartinwendersacro |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085907/http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/feb/06/solveigdommartinwendersacro |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During production, the filmmakers called German police after Falk went missing. Falk had been spending hours exploring West Berlin and was discovered in a café.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/wie-peter-falk-columbo-wurde-fotostrecke-136179-7.html |title=Fotostrecke: Die vielen Optionen des Peter Falk |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=12 September 2017 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021065720/http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/wie-peter-falk-columbo-wurde-fotostrecke-136179-7.html |archivedate=21 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
Peter Handke arrived in West Berlin during the editing process, led by [[Peter Przygodda]]. Handke believed it bordered on a [[silent film]], aside from some music, and lacked much of the notes he had sent to Wenders during filming. Handke thus proposed adding his writings via [[voice-over]].&lt;ref name="Handke"/&gt; After Falk left Berlin, he recorded much of his voice-over in a sound studio in [[Los Angeles]]. Much of this was improvised, though Wenders still supervised by telephone.&lt;ref name="Feaster"/&gt;

With the filming performed in lengthy [[take]]s, and the camera used as "the eye of the angel", much of the movement was conveyed in the camerawork rather than in editing effects.{{sfn|Wenders|1997|p=67}} There was five hours of footage to edit down to the final cut.{{sfn|Wenders|1997|p=67}} A [[Pieing|pie fight]] between the stars was filmed for the final scene, but later edited out.{{sfn|Klosterman|2009|p=37}}

Composer [[Jürgen Knieper]] assumed harps and violins would suffice for a [[film score|score]] for a film about angels, until he saw a cut of the film. Seeing the angels were discontent, he wrote a different score employing a choir, voices and whistling.&lt;ref name="Knieper"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |last3=Knieper |first3=Jürgen |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurent Petitgand]] contributed the circus music, an ensemble work performed with accordions, saxophones and keyboards.{{sfn|Davison|2017}}

==Themes and interpretations==
[[File:Monumento al Ángel Caído en los jardines del Parque de El Retiro (Madrid).jpg|150px|thumb|The story contains similarities to the [[fallen angel]] concept, though unrelated to evil.]]
The concept of angels, spirits or ghosts who help humans on Earth had been common in cinema, from ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941) and the 1946 works ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=141}} Many earlier U.S. and U.K. films demonstrate high amounts of reverence, while others allow reasonable amounts of fun. [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s ''A Matter of Life and Death'' presents an early example of spirits being jealous of the lives of humans.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=141}} The shift from monochrome to colour, to distinguish the angels' reality from that of the mortals, was also used in Powell and Pressburger's film.{{sfn|Batchelor|2000|p=37}} While ''Wings of Desire'' does not portray Berliners as living in a utopia, academic Roger Cook wrote that the fact that people have pleasure "gives, as the English title suggests, wings to desire".{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=165}}

[[Portrayals of God in popular media|God]] is not mentioned in the film,{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=115}} and is only referred to in the sequel ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'' when the angels state a purpose to connect humans with "Him".{{sfn|Hasenberg|1997|p=54}} Scholars Robert Phillip Kolker and Peter Beickene attributed the apparent lack of God to [[New Age]] beliefs, remarking Damiel's "[[fallen angel|fall]]" is similar to the story of [[Lucifer]], though not related to evil.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=148}} Reviewer [[Jeffrey Overstreet]] concurred that "Wenders had left his church upbringing behind", and the cinematic angels are "inventions he could craft to his specifications", with little regard for biblical beliefs. Overstreet characterized them as "whimsical metaphors, characters who have lost the joy of sensual human experience".{{sfn|Overstreet|2007|p=122}} Nevertheless, Professor [[Craig Detweiler]] believed the sky-level view of Berlin and the idea of [[guardian angel]]s evoke God.{{sfn|Detweiler|2009|p=124}} Authors Martin Brady and Joanne Leal added that even if Damiel is tempted by seemingly profane things, the atmosphere of Berlin means the human Damiel is still in "a place of poetry, myth and religion".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=263}}

In one scene, Damiel and Cassiel meet to share stories in their observations, with their function revealed to be one of preserving the past.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=116}} Professor Alexander Graf wrote this connects them to cinema, with Wenders noting ''Wings of Desire'' itself depicts or shows places in Berlin that have since been destroyed or altered, including a bridge, [[Potsdamer Platz]] and the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]].{{sfn|Graf|2002|pp=117-118}}

The closing titles state: "Dedicated to all the former angels, but especially to Yasujiro, François and Andrej." This is a reference to Wenders' fellow filmmakers [[Yasujirō Ozu]], [[François Truffaut]], and [[Andrei Tarkovsky]].{{sfn|Scheibel|2017|p=167}} These directors had all died before the release of the film, with Kolker and Beickene arguing they were an influence on Wenders: Ozu had taught Wenders order; Truffaut the observation of people, especially youth;{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=138}} and Tarkovsky, a less clear influence on Wenders, consideration of morality and beauty.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=140}} Identifying directors as angels could tie in with the film characters' function to record.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=118}}
[[File:Ozu Yasujiro.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Yasujirō Ozu]], one of the film dedication's "angels".]]

Academic Laura Marcus believed a connection between cinema and print is also established in the angels' affinity for libraries, as Wenders portrays the library as a tool of "memory, and public space", making it a miraculous place.{{sfn|Marcus|2015|pp=205-206}} The depiction of Damiel, by using a pen or an immaterial pen, to write "Song of Childhood", is also tribute to print and literacy, introducing, or as Marcus hypothesized, "perhaps even releasing, the visual images that follow".{{sfn|Marcus|2015|p=206}} Kolker and Beickene interpreted the use of poetry as part of screenwriter Peter Handke's efforts to elevate language above common rhetoric to the spiritual.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=147}} Reviewing the poetry, Detweiler remarked that Handke's "Song of Childhood" bears parallels to [[St. Paul]]'s [[1 Corinthians 13]] ("''When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child ... ''").{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}} Professor Terrie Waddell added that the poem established "centrality of childhood" as a key theme, noting that the children can see angels and accept them without question, tying them in with the phenomenon of [[imaginary friend]]s.{{sfn|Waddell|2015}}

The film has also been read as a call for [[German reunification]], which followed in 1990. Essayists David Caldwell and Paul Rea saw it as presenting a series of two opposites: East and West, angel and human, male and female.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=114}} Wenders' angels are not bound by the Wall, reflecting East and West Berlin's shared space, though East Berlin remains primarily black and white.{{sfn|Byg|2014|p=28}} Scholar Martin Jesinghausen believed the film presumed reunification would never happen, and contemplated its statements on divides, including territorial and "higher" divides, "physicality and spirituality, art and reality, black and white and colour".{{sfn|Jesinghausen|2000|p=80}}

Researcher Helen Stoddart, in discussing the depiction of the circus and trapeze artist Marion in particular, submitted that Marion is the classic circus character, creating an image of danger and then potential. Stoddart argued that Homer and Marion may find the future in what remains of history found in Berlin.{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|p=188}} Stoddart considered the circular nature of the story, including a parallel between the angel who cannot see the physical (Damiel), and the faux angel (Marion) who can "see the faces".{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|p=178}} Marion also observes that all directions lead to the Wall, and the final French dialogue "We have embarked" while the screen states "[[To be continued]]", suggests "final movement to a new beginning".{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|pp=179-180}}

==Style==
[[File:Rainer Maria Rilke, 1900.jpg|125px|thumb|[[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s poetry influenced the concept and style.{{sfn|Waddell|2015}}&lt;ref name="Wenders"/&gt;]]
[[British Film Institute]] writer Leigh Singer assessed the cinematic style as "bold" and artistic in its use of colour, "existential voiceover" and "languorous pacing".&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt; Singer also commented on the use of symbolism and the combinations of diverse pieces of culture, from the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] to the music of [[Nick Cave]]. In Singer's estimation, the cinematography is able to communicate the angels' "invisible intimacy and empathy".&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt; Professor Terrie Waddell described the "dialogue and monologue" as "lyrical", in the mold of Rilke's poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2015}} Scholar Alexander Graf considered how these voice-overs and verbal exchanges are frequently combined with background radio and television sounds, and concluded the "image and soundtrack" that comprise the style convey a point of "blindness": "men and women are plagued by their everyday problems; children are, like the angels, in their own dreamy world".{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=119}}

Professor Russell J.A. Kilbourn judged the style as opposed to [[realism (arts)|realism]] and "emphatically German" in looking at particular situations of human life.{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=83}} Authors Martin Brady and Joanne Leal remarked the storytelling shies away from an entirely [[narrative]] format, and the film's writing style is embodied in the Homer character as "the angel of story-telling".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=263}} Perception of people becomes key to the storytelling, with Brady and Leal quoting Handke's vision for a new narrative: "You have only interpreted and changed the world; what matters is to ''describe'' it".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=264}} Psychologist Ryan Niemiec wrote that, by focusing on "the beauty of each moment", ''Wings of Desire'' conveys "awe and wonder".{{sfn|Niemiec|2009|p=138}}

As Singer observed, ''Wings of Desire'' serves as a "Symphony of a city" in capturing a "wintry, pre-unification Berlin".&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt; Kilbourn said that the place highlighted in the German title ''Der Himmel über Berlin'', like the desire referenced in the English title, is of great importance, and that the "frequent angel's-eye-view shots of East and West Berlin" allows for "quasi-objective voyeuristic surveillance".{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=84}} Observing the angels' trench-coat fashion, sociologist [[Andrew Greeley]] wrote it fit the "wet, blustery, cold northern Germany" setting.{{sfn|Greeley|2017|p=118}} Looking at the coats and ponytails, Dr. Detweiler found the visualization of the angels "so cool and stylish".{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}}

Music is used in differing ways throughout the story. Musicologist Annette Davison argued Knieper's score in angel scenes is artistic, with elements of Eastern European and Orthodox Christian music, and Petitgand's music displays a "slippery" harmony frequently heard in circus entertainment.{{sfn|Davison|2017}} When Marion leaves the Circus Alekan, there is an increase in [[rock music]], particularly by Cave and [[Crime &amp; the City Solution]]. Davison submitted this symbolizes "utopian promise of the sensual mortal world", and that lyrics echo the plot: Cave's "[[The Carny]]" suggests a disappearing carnival worker as the Circus Alekan closes, and "[[From Her to Eternity]]" suggests a desire for a woman's love.{{sfn|Davison|2017}} Professor Adrian Danks wrote that Cave's rock music symbolized "the physical, worldly reality of Berlin", with "The Carny" adding a feel of sorrow in the background, while Marion gives "breathy accompaniment".{{sfn|Danks|2016|p=114}}

[[Image:Smichov andel wings of desire.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Prague's ''Angel'' by [[Jean Nouvel]].]] 
In 1993, Wenders made a sequel, ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'', which he found desirable to explore Berlin post-[[German reunification|reunification]], more so than for the sake of a sequel.{{sfn|Bromley|2001|p=6}} In 1998, a U.S. remake directed by [[Brad Silberling]] called ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'' was released. The setting was moved to [[Los Angeles]] and [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Nicolas Cage]] starred.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; In 1990, an Indian film in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], titled ''[[Njan Gandharvan]]'' was made by [[Padmarajan|P Padmarajan]], with a similar thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wn.com/kumar_ganesh_njan_gandharvan |last= |first= |date=5 September 2009 |title=Onam Keli Switzerland 2009 skit Njan Gandharvan |work=[[World News Network]] |accessdate=1 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702030533/https://wn.com/kumar_ganesh_njan_gandharvan |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Prague]], Czech Republic, [[Jean Nouvel]] designed ''Angel'', a building that features an angel from the film observing the people of the [[Smíchov]] district.{{sfn|Humphreys|2011|p=158}}

A stage adaptation of ''Wings of Desire'' was created by the [[Northern Stage]] theatre company in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], U.K. in 2003. This particular adaptation, which used film footage of the city and stories from the community, was adapted and directed by Alan Lyddiard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/sep/17/theatre4 |last=Hickling |first=Alfred |date=17 September 2003 |title=Wings of Desire |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822053459/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/sep/17/theatre4 |archivedate=22 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and [[Toneelgroep Amsterdam]] presented another stage adaptation, created by [[Gideon Lester]] and Dirkje Houtman and directed by [[Ola Mafaalani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/theater/reviews/05wing.html |last=Isherwood |first=Charles |date=5 December 2006 |title=Foolishly, an Angel Falls in Love and Rushes In ... and Up |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822055905/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/theater/reviews/05wing.html |archivedate=22 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wenders' story was also an influence on the play ''[[Angels in America]]'' by [[Tony Kushner]], in which angels intermingle with troubled mortals.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/01/earth_angel.html |last=Winter |first=Jessica |date=2010 |title=Earth Angel |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |accessdate=2 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822060821/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/01/earth_angel.html |archivedate=22 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[R.E.M.]]'s music video for "[[Everybody Hurts]]" also takes cues from the film.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt; ''Wings of Desire'' was possibly Ganz's most remembered role before ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name="Dutka"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/27/entertainment/ca-ganz27 |last=Dutka |first=Elaine |date=27 February 2005 |title=A descent into the bunker |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=21 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608114259/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/27/entertainment/ca-ganz27 |archivedate=8 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===International Fund for Monuments (1965-1984)===

The ''International Fund for Monuments'' (IFM) was an organization created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909-1994) after his retirement from the [[U.S. Army]] in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project to arrest the settlement of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] by freezing the soil underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 as a vehicle for the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the [[Rock cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]] in [[Ethiopia]]. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist [[Lila Acheson Wallace]] (1889-1984), who offered $150,000 to the ''International Fund for Monuments'' and [[UNESCO]] for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of [[Haile Selassie I]] and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to [[Easter Island|Easter Island (Rapa Nui)]] in [[Chile]]. Gray formed the ''Easter Island Committee'', with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as ''[[moai]]'' exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist [[William Mulloy]] (1917-1978), Gray selected an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the [[Seagram Building]] in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C.

An important chapter for the organization started with its involvement in the broad international effort led by [[UNESCO]] for the protection of the city of [[Venice]], [[Italy]] from catastrophic flooding. After the extremely high tide of 4 November 1966, the city, including the historic [[Piazza San Marco]], was inundated for more than twenty-four hours. The ''International Fund for Monuments'' set up a ''Venice Committee'', with Professor John McAndrew (1904-1978) of [[Wellesley College]] as chairman and Gray as executive secretary. On the part of the Committee, appeals were made to the American public, and local chapters set up in American cities. This early initiative led to the formation of the independent organization Save Venice in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.savevenice.org/about/history-mission History &amp; Mission: History]". Save Venice. savevenice.org. Retrieved 21 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts helped establish a reputation for IFM. In [[Spain]], the organization formed a ''Committee for Spain'' under the leadership of American diplomat and [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Ambassador to Spain]] in 1965-67 [[Angier Biddle Duke]] (1915-1995).

At the invitation of UNESCO in the 1970s IFM became involved in architectural conservation in [[Nepal]], where the organization adopted the Mahadev temple complex in [[Gokarna, Nepal|Gokarna]], in Nepal's [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The 14th-century temple building was surveyed, rotten timbers were replaced, and the foundations were strengthened. Sculpted wooden architectural elements were painstakingly cleaned of layers of a [[motor oil]] coating that had been applied annually for protection.

The site was the keystone of a defensive system constructed in the early period of Haitian independence to protect the young state from French attempts to reclaim it as a  colony. Local artisans reconstructed wooden and tile roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress. IFM also sponsored a traveling exhibition and a film about the history of the ''Citadelle'', which was used for educational purposes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/World%20Monuments%20Fund_The%20First%20Thirty%20Years.pdf World Monuments Fund. 1996.

Through donations and matching funds, WMF has worked with local community and government partners worldwide to safeguard and conserve places of historic value for future generations. To date, WMF has worked at more than 500 sites in 91 countries, including many [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]. WMF has worked at internationally famous tourist attractions as well as lesser-known sites. Highly prominent projects are many temples at [[Angkor]], [[Cambodia]], starting in 1990, including [[Preah Khan]] and [[Phnom Bakheng]]; the [[Château de Chantilly]] in Chantilly, France; the ghost town of [[Craco]], Italy; many structures in [[Rome]], including the [[Temple of Hercules]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], and the [[House of Augustus]]; several sites on [[Easter Island]]; various sites at ancient [[Luxor]] in Egypt; [[Lalibela]] in Ethiopia; [[San Ignacio Miní]] in Argentina; the ancient Maya city of [[Naranjo, Guatemala]]; the [[Segovia Aqueduct]] in Segovia, Spain; as well as 25 projects in [[Venice]], Italy, over 20 years. WMF has also participated in projects in the United States, including [[Ellis Island]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society]], and many sites in [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]].

===World Monuments Watch===

Every two years WMF publishes the ''World Monuments Watch'' (formerly the ''World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites''). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the ''World Monuments Watch'', WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites.

The sites are nominated by international and local preservation groups and professionals, including local authorities. Sites of all types, including secular and religious architecture, archaeological sites, landscapes and townscapes, and dating from all time periods, from ancient to contemporary, are eligible. An independent panel of international experts reviews and selects the sites that make up the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf Press Release: World Monuments Watch List ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521092007/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf |date=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the panelists were [[Christina Cameron]], Alfredo Conti, Pierre-André Lablaude, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Christopher Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/downloads/2010_Watch_Panelists_Bios.pdf |title=2010 World Monuments Watch Panelist Bios |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Initiatives===

WMF also operates a number of special initiatives that transcend individual projects at specific sites and address broader themes in heritage preservation.

[[File:WMF Future of Babylon.ogv|thumb|This video details WMF's site management plan for Babylon, a blueprint for working on the site today as well as planning for the future.]]

====Iraq's Cultural Heritage====
Following the [[Iraq War]] WMF created the ''Iraq Cultural Heritage Conservation Initiative'' to address the many threats to Iraq’s cultural heritage resulting from the occupation and from a long period of political isolation and conflict. At the ancient city of [[Babylon]] WMF has launched a program with the support of the [[United States Department of State]] to develop a comprehensive site management plan, help local officials prepare a nomination for [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] listing, and establish site boundaries for the long-term protection of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23babylon.html John Noble Wilford. "After Years of War and Abuse, New Hope for Ancient Babylon." ''New York Times'', March 22, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modernism at Risk====

Through this initiative, the biennial ''World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize'' was established in 2008. The inaugural prize was awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten mbH for the restoration of the former [[ADGB Trade Union School]], an important [[Bauhaus]] structure in [[Bernau bei Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The 2010 prize was awarded to Bierman Henket Architecten and Wessel de Jonge Architecten for the restoration of the [[Zonnestraal (estate)|Zonnestraal Sanatorium]], an aftercare colony for tubercular patients near [[Hilversum]], in the [[Netherlands]], built in 1931. The 2012 prize was awarded to the Architectural Consortium for Hizuchi Elementary School for the restoration of Hizuchi Elementary School in Hizuchi, Yawatahama City, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.
