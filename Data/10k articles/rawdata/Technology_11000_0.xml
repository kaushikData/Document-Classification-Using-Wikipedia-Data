      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">A '''battery indicator''' (also known as a '''battery gauge''') is a device which gives information about a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].  This will usually be a visual indication of the battery's [[state of charge]].  It is particularly important in the case of a [[battery electric vehicle]].

==Automobiles==
[[File:66ChargerDash2.jpg|thumb|1966 [[Dodge Charger]] dashboard, note ammeter marked "Alternator" at top left]]
Some [[automobile]]s are fitted with a battery condition meter to monitor the [[Car battery|starter battery]]. This meter is, essentially, a [[voltmeter]] but it may also be marked with coloured zones for easy visualization. 

Many newer cars no longer offer voltmeters or ammeters; instead, these vehicles typically have a light with the outline of an automotive battery on it. This can be somewhat misleading as it may be confused for an indicator of a bad battery when in reality it indicates a problem with the vehicle's charging system. 

Alternatively, an [[ammeter]] may be fitted.  This indicates whether the battery is being charged or discharged.  In the adjacent picture, the ammeter is marked "Alternator" and the symbols are "C" (charge) and "D" (discharge). 

Both [[ammeter]]s and [[voltmeter]]s individually or together can be used to assess the operating state of an automobile battery and charging system.

==Electronic devices==
A battery indicator is a feature of many electronic devices.  In [[mobile phone]]s, the battery indicator usually takes the form of a [[bar graph]] - the more bars that are showing, the better the battery's state of charge.

==Computers==
Computers may give a signal to users that an internal standby battery needs replacement. Portable computers using rechargeable batteries generally give the user some indication of the remaining operating time left on the battery. A [[Smart Battery System]] uses a controller integrated with an interchangeable battery pack to provide a more accurate indication of the state of battery charge. 

==Batteries not part of a system==
Batteries that are part of a system, such as computer batteries, can have their properties checked and logged in operation to assist in determining remaining charge. A real battery can be modeled as an ideal battery with a specified [[Electromotive force|EMF]], in series with an [[internal resistance]]. As a battery discharges, the EMF may drop or the internal resistance increase; in many cases the EMF remains more or less constant during most of the discharge, with the voltage drop across the internal resistance determining the voltage supplied. Determining the charge remaining in many battery types not connected to a system that monitors battery use is not reliably possible with a voltmeter. In battery types where [[Electromotive force|EMF]] remains approximately constant during discharge, but resistance increases, voltage across battery terminals is not a good indicator of capacity. A meter such as an equivalent series resistance meter ([[ESR meter]]) normally used for measuring the ESR of electrolytic capacitors can be used to evaluate internal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flippers.com/esrkthnt.html Use of ESR meter to measure battery resistance, indicator of state of charge]&lt;/ref&gt; ESR meters fitted with protective diodes cannot be used, a battery will simply destroy the diodes and damage itself. An ESR meter known not to have diode protection will give a reading of internal resistance for a rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery of any size down to the smallest [[button cell]]s which gives an indication of the state of charge. To use it, measurements on fully charged and fully discharged batteries of the same type can be used to determine resistances associated with those states.

The cost of an ESR meter makes it uneconomic for measuring battery voltages as its only function, but a meter used for cheeking capacitors can take on the additional duty.

These include the LM331 [[Voltage controlled oscillator|voltage-to-frequency converter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.national.com/company/pressroom/files/Eng_Interview_NSC.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030812093423/http://www.national.com/company/pressroom/files/Eng_Interview_NSC.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2003-08-12 | title=Engineering Silicon Valley | page=1 | format=PDF | publisher=[[National Semiconductor]] | date= | accessdate=2010-07-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[LM337]] adjustable negative [[voltage regulator]] (complement to the LM317).

==Life and career==
Pease was born on August 22, 1940 in [[Rockville, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = National Semiconductor Staff Scientist Bob Pease Named To Electrical Engineering Hall Of Fame |publisher = [[National Semiconductor]] |url = http://www.national.com/news/item/0,1735,803,00.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030115113150/http://www2.national.com/news/item/0%2C1735%2C803%2C00.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = January 15, 2003 |date = October 21, 2002 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A new Fahrenheit temperature sensor|author=Robert A.

He started work in the early 1960s at [[George A. Philbrick]] Researches (GAP-R). GAP-R pioneered the first reasonable-cost, mass-produced [[operational amplifier]] (op-amp), the K2-W. At GAP-R, Pease developed many high-performance op-amps, built with discrete [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] components.

In 1976, Pease moved to [[National Semiconductor Corporation]] (NSC) as a designer and applications engineer, where he began designing analog monolithic integrated circuits, as well as design reference circuits using these devices.  He had advanced to staff scientist by the time of his departure in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12167632|title=Departure of chip-design legend Bob Pease prompts outpouring in valley|author=Cassidy, Mike|publisher=''San Jose Mercury News''|date=April 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924060022/http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12167632|archivedate=September 24, 2012|accessdate=2010-07-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[http://www.edn.com/blog/1700000170/post/1030042103.html EDN Blog] link fails--&gt;  During his tenure at NSC, he began writing a popular continuing monthly column called "Pease Porridge" in ''[[Electronic Design (magazine)|Electronic Design]]'' about his experiences in the world of electronic design and application.&lt;ref name=Gawel&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawel|first=Richard|title=An English Major Remembers An Analog Giant|url=http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/An-English-Major-Remembers-An-Analog-Giant/2.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625143506/http://electronicdesign.com/article/analog-and-mixed-signal/An-English-Major-Remembers-An-Analog-Giant/2.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 25, 2011|work=Electronic Design|publisher=Penton Media, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-21|date=June 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used in [[Iraq]], and helps [[Military of the United States|US military forces]] against the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]]' adaptive tactics by providing data laterally and on a broader scale than with traditional reports.

The data shared between patrols on "The Net" (as is it is sometimes referred to by soldiers) has already played a crucial role to dismantle grenade-traps hidden behind posters of [[Moqtada al-Sadr]] that [[Military of the United States|US soldiers]] often rip down.

The '''CLidar''' is a scientific instrument used for measuring particulates ([[aerosols]]) in the lower atmosphere. CLidar stands for camera [[lidar]], which in turn is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[light]]" and "[[radar]]". It is a form of [[remote sensing]] and used for [[atmospheric physics]].  

==Description==
In this technique a very wide-angle lens images light scattered from a laser beam onto a CCD ([[Charge-coupled device]]) camera. The camera is positioned hundreds of meters away from the (usually vertically-pointed) laser beam. The geometry of the CLidar is shown in the figure. It is important in the analysis that the optics, the wide-angle lens in this case, accurately maps equal angles onto an equal number of pixels throughout the 100 degree field-of-view.

[[image:CLidarDiagram2008.jpg]]

==Example==
In the second figure, an image from the CCD camera is shown which is analyzed by adding up the individual pixels at each altitude.The camera was 122 meters from the vertically pointed, circularly-polarized laser beam. The beam is brighter near the ground due to near-ground aerosols. A bright spot due to a cloud can be seen near the top of the beam. The beam was positioned diagonally on the CCD array to use the space more effectively. A lighthouse and power pole can also be seen in the image.

[[Image:CLidarExampleImage2008.jpg]]

==Differences between Lidar and CLidar==
The CLidar technique has the advantage over the lidar technique of being able to measure all the way to the ground. The signal strength is also much more constant than a lidar signal which can change by many orders of magnitude. It has very high altitude resolution in the lower atmosphere. The instrument components are typically simpler than those in the lidar also.  

Disadvantages include poor altitude resolution in the upper atmosphere, difficulty designing optics that gathers substantial amounts of light, and a loss in noise rejection ([[signal-to-noise ratio]]).

==History==
CRI, incorporated in 2006, was founded by Fridrik Jonsson, Art Shulenberger, Oddur Ingolfsson, and KC Tran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=18&amp;lang=en |title=About Us |accessdate=11 July 2012 |publisher=Carbon Recycling International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929192922/http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=18&amp;lang=en |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Icelandic individuals and funds, investors include Canadian multinational methanol supplier and distributor [[Methanex]] and Chinese multinational automotive manufacturing company [[Geely]].

CRI's first commercial scale plant, the George Olah Plant (named after [[George Andrew Olah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/13/tech/fuel-cell-biomethanol-denmark/index.html |author=Matthew Knight |title=Electric car concept drives progress with extended 500-mile range |accessdate=24 July 2012 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1994 Nobel Prize Laureate in chemstiry), was completed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=8&amp;lang=en |title=First Commercial Plant |accessdate=11 July 2012 |publisher=Carbon Recycling International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703233732/http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=8&amp;lang=en |archivedate=July 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRI is currently working on several new projects in parallel, including in a EU [[Horizon 2020]] research programme funded [http://www.mefco2.eu MefCO2] consortium to build a renewable methanol demonstration plant in [http://carbonrecycling.is/mefco2-project/ Germany] and in the [http://www.fresme.eu FreSME] consortium to build a renewable methanol demonstration plant in [http://carbonrecycling.is/fresme-project/ Sweden]. 

==Renewable methanol==
Renewable methanol can be used as a fuel, chemical feedstock or blended with gasoline. Fuels which are produced partially or fully from methanol include [[biodiesel]], [[dimethyl ether]] or [[Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers|oxymethylene ether]], as well as [[Gas to liquids|synthetic gasoline]] from the [https://www.exxonmobilchemical.com/en/products-and-services/technology-licensing-and-services/methanol-to-gasoline-synthesis Mobil methanol-to-gasoline (MTG)] process. Gasoline blends range from 3% methanol, which is allowed in [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0030 European standard gasoline], to 56% methanol, a blend for [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible fuel vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=3&amp;lang=en |title=Products |accessdate=13 July 2012 |publisher=Carbon Recycling International}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRI has run fleet tests with a range of lower blends and higher blend options in cars from different manufacturers, including 100% methanol in special flexible fuel vehicles manufactured by Geely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruv.is/frett/eldsneyti-ur-utblaestri |title=Eldsneyti úr útblæstri |accessdate=24 July 2012 |publisher=RÚV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carbonrecycling.is/news/2017/11/1/methanol-car-fleet-test-yields-positive-results|title=Methanol car fleet test yields positive results|work=CRI - Carbon Recycling International|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable methanol is compatible with [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]] as well as [[Methanol fuel cell|methanol fuel cells]]. 

==Production==
[[File:Carbon Recycling International GO Plant.jpg|upright|thumb|CRI's first CSP, the GO Plant]]

Production of renewable methanol does not depend on agricultural resources, as hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the primary inputs. CRI's emissions-to-liquids production process is based on three main modules, carbon dioxide purification, hydrogen generation and the methanol synthesis and purification system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carbonrecycling.is/innovation1/|title=ETL-Technology|website=CRI - Carbon Recycling International|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The catalytic conversion process from hydrogen and carbon dioxide occurs in one step, while production of methanol from fossil fuels, such as natural gas or coal, involves several reforming steps to obtain syngas followed by the catalytic step&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingham|first=Alan|date=2017-10-01|title=Reducing the Carbon Intensity of Methanol for Use as a Transport Fuel|url=https://doi.org/10.1595/205651317X696216|journal=Johnson Matthey Technology Review|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=297–307|doi=10.1595/205651317x696216|issn=2056-5135}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Plants===
The George Olah Plant, or the GO Plant, has a name-plate capacity of 5 million liters per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=8&amp;lang=en |title=First Commercial Plant |accessdate=11 July 2012 |publisher=Carbon Recycling International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703233732/http://cri.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=8&amp;lang=en |archivedate=July 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located close to the [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|Blue Lagoon]] spa facility and HS Orka's [[Svartsengi Power Station|Svartsengi power station]]. The plant can capture and utilize around 10% of the carbon dioxide emitted by the Svartsengi power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grapevine.is/News/ReadArticle/Carbon-Recycling-In-Effect-Near-Blue-Lagoon |author=Paul Fontaine |title=Carbon Recycling In Effect Near Blue Lagoon |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012 |publisher=The Reykjavík Grapevine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The [[European Union]]'s [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009|renewable energy directive]] recognizes renewable methanol as a renewable transport fuel from non-biological sources, which means that it can be used as an advanced renewable transport fuel under the EU's renewable fuel blending mandates.

==Impact==
Carbon dioxide is a major cause of [[global warming]]. By removing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions, CRI's process helps to mitigate [[Climate change mitigation|climate change]]. Renewable methanol burns cleanly as a fuel and substituting renewable methanol for gasoline and diesel fuels reduces urban emissions of [[Particulates|particulate matter]], sulphur oxides ([[Sulfur oxide|SOx]]) and nitrous oxides ([[NOx]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://methanolfuels.org|title=Methanol Fuels|website=methanolfuels.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

CRI's process can also be used to store energy in the form of methanol, especially in cases where the energy source is intermittent. For example, [[wind power|wind]] and [[solar energy|solar power]] are intermittently  available. Methanol is also a good [[energy carrier]]. As a liquid fuel it is easier and cheaper to store and transport than hydrogen or methane.

==Future projects==
CRI plans to implement standardized CSPs (commercial scale plants), each with a capacity of at least 50,000 tons of methanol production per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carbonrecycling.is/comercial-scale/|title=Commercial Scale Plants|website=CRI - Carbon Recycling International|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">'''Chemical Agent Resistant Coating''' is a paint commonly applied to military vehicles to provide protection against chemical and biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milspray.com/CARC_Technical_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |title=CARC Technical Paper |publisher=Milspray.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221191915/http://www.milspray.com/CARC_Technical_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-DTL/MIL-DTL-53072C_11404/ |title=MIL-SPECS |publisher=Every Spec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the paint is engineered to be easily [[decontamination|decontaminated]] after exposure to [[chemical warfare]] and [[biological warfare]] agents. The paint is also resistant to damage and removal by decontaminating solutions. Two-component systems (e.g. [[epoxy]] or [[polyester]]-based) are often employed. This coating is described in MIL-DTL-53072E.

== Background ==

As of 2018, the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) led research and development activity for CARC and was the approving authority of CARC products for the Department of Defense (DoD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2007/ARL-TN-285.pdf|title=Evaluation of Chemical Agent Resistant Coatings That Are Exposed to Ultraviolet Radiation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=223|title=Camouflage Coating and Corrosion {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985, U.S. Army Regulation 750-1 mandated the use of CARC systems on all tactical equipment. Regulations mandated the hardening of equipment (i.e. ground support equipment, tactical wheeled vehicles, and aircraft) against the impacts of chemical attacks and subsequent cleaning agents following contamination. These same regulations were followed by the Marine Corps and Air Force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==

As of 1985, most military vehicles and equipment were painted with camouflaged CARCs. These topcoats produced a non-porous finish that acted as a protectant against radioactive, biological and chemical contamination. CARC repelled chemical by preventing absorption, with chemicals beading up on the finish surface where they could be washed away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CARC coatings were also used by government contractors who refurbish vehicles and parts for the U.S. military. Examples included Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs), High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), generators, containers and shelter exteriors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solvent-borne CARCs were developed in the early 1980s. The impetus for CARC development was the need to protect costly military equipment. Operation Desert Storm further increased concern of the potential for chemical attacks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pfonline.com/articles/protecting-the-troopsand-their-equipment|title=Protecting the Troops—and Their Equipment|last=McElroy|first=Bob|website=www.pfonline.com|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, high-performance water-reducible CARCs were commonly used. These materials met DoD’s VOC objective of 1.8 lb/gal and contained no hazardous air pollutants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Description == 

The impetus for improved CARC formulations was to reduce the cost of material degradation for the DoD. An improved topcoat was composed to have 44% primary pigments and inorganic extenders, 24% resins, 30% solvent, and 2% additives. Formulations changed from inorganic to polymeric-based extenders in to enhance the protective features of the topcoat and reduce the cost of material degradation. Additionally, air pollution regulations required reformulation of the coating’s solvent content to reduce the emission of hazardous air pollutants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==

As of 2000, two different CARC topcoats included:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

1) One-component, moisture-cure urethane (MCU): MCU CARCs cured in a two-stage process where water and isocyanate groups combined to produce a cured paint film. The materials were designed for resistance to windblown dust, sand and chemical agents. An improvement to solvent-borne polyurethanes, MCU materials offered both lower levels of volatile organic compounds and elimination of hazardous air pollutants.

2) Two-component, high-performance, water-reducible polyurethane: Waterbased CARCs, most commonly used by the military, were composed of water-reducible polyurethane resins, marking the first time a water-based two-component CARC was commercially available. This formulation eliminated several solvents, including methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene and xylene. Citation

== Dimensions and technology ==

The base model ''Cougar 1400'' is available in different equipment variants. Generally the [[four-wheel drive|4WD]] machine has four large wheels of equal size, it has a [[four-wheel steering]] system and also features [[crab steering]] mode. The special purpose [[tractor]]-like vehicle has a travel length of {{convert|11.5|m|ft}}, and a travel height of about {{convert|3.96|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="claasbrochure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claas.com/countries/generator/cl-pw/zzz_downloadcenter/document_pool/fem/cougar/pr_cou_en-int,lang=en_UK.pdf |title=Claas Cougar 1400 |work=www.claas.com |format=PDF |accessdate=8 March 2011}} (product brochure)&lt;/ref&gt; Its road transport width depends on tire dimensions, and takes up from just {{convert|3|to(-)|3.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt;

The machine has a [[Daimler AG|Daimler (Chrysler)]]/[[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz OM457 engine|OM 457 LA]] 6-cylinder diesel engine with a maximum output of {{convert|350|kW|hp-metric}}.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Claas as a German manufacturer refers to 350 kW (480 hp) per following [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]]-[[Pferdestärke|PS]] standard (metric horsepower)&lt;!--and rounded kW/hp conversion--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt; The fuel tank can hold up to {{convert|960|L|USgal}} of [[diesel fuel]].&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt; The Cougar's weight is – depending on equipment and the amount of loaded fuel – approximately {{convert|18500|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="claasvision23" /&gt; The machine operates at speeds up to {{convert|21|km/h}}, or up to {{convert|40|km/h}} while moving between fields on roads.&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt;

Five pendulum suspended mowing units are fitted to every Claas Cougar, a triple combination at the front and one outrigger unit on each side in the middle of the machine. The two side mowers are mounted on telescoping booms between the axles. Each mowing unit can be individually controlled and maneuvered up, down, left, and right in order to mow narrow plots or smaller areas with less than five mowers, to adjust the mowers to uneven ground, and to help the operator avoid encountering obstacles. Additionally the Cougar is equipped with active hydropneumatic mower unit balancing, and the two outrigger units are equipped with hydraulic collision protection devices;&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt; they automatically swing back when they meet with obstacles. 

With its five mowers the Claas Cougar can cut at widths up to {{convert|14|m|ft}}, and it has a working capacity of up to {{convert|22|ha|m2}} per hour.&lt;ref name="claasbrochure" /&gt;

To fold the mower decks for transport and to unfold them into operating position Claas uses a special hydraulic folding design.&lt;ref name="claasvision23" /&gt; For road transport the Cougar's cab is rotated 180°, so that the lifted and folded front and side mowers are located at the vehicle's rear then. Both, folding and cab rotating operations, are automatically managed and can easily be activated by the driver from within the cab. They only take a few seconds or minutes.&lt;!--less than 2 minutes--&gt;
The cab is air-conditioned and has airride seats, each window has its own wiper. 

== History ==

[[File:Claas Cougar.jpg|thumb|Claas ''Cougar 1400'' presented at [[Agritechnica]] 2005]]
The ''Cougar 1400'', equipped with five Claas disc mower units per default, was first presented at [[Agritechnica]] 2003 in Germany and was awarded "Machine of the Year" there.&lt;ref name="claasvision23" /&gt; At [[SIMA]] 2005 in Paris, it was awarded a silver medal.&lt;ref name="claasvision23" /&gt;

In 2006, Claas presented a Cougar 1400 fitted with five [[flail mower]]s (&lt;!--Spearhead--&gt;mulching units)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claas.com/countries/generator/cl-pw/en/claas-US/products/fem/cougar/mowing-technology/flail/start,lang=en_US.html |title=Mowing Technology.

The machine has a working width of {{convert|12.6|m|ft}} then, and can be used e.g. for mulching corn stubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landtechnikmagazin.de/sonstige-Landtechnik-Bild-Brachlandpflege-und-Maiszuensler-Bekaempfung-in-abgeernteten-Koernermais-Bestaenden-mit-Mulch-COUGAR-6262-314.php |title=Der Mulch-Cougar |work=www.landtechnikmagazin.de |date=8 January 2007 |language=German |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flail mower supplier [[Spearhead Machinery]] (based in [[Salford Priors]], England) calls the combination ''Trident 12600 HD''. This naming follows other models of their ''Trident'' range of flail mowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spearheadmachinery.com/News/2010/ClaasCougar.aspx |title=Spearhead teams up with the Claas Cougar |work=www.spearheadmachinery.com |year=2010 |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five Trident decks for the Cougar have a weight of {{convert|4700|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spearhead.dk/00207/00228/00472/ |title= Trident 12600 HD – World largest mower |work=www.spearhead.dk |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Claas added roller [[Conditioner (farming)|conditioners]] to the Cougar lineup. The mowing units of the ''Cougar 1400RC'' are equipped with roller conditioners, whereas the mowers of the ''Cougar 1400C'' have tine (roller) conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claas.com/countries/generator/cl-pw/en/claas-US/products/fem/cougar/mowing-technology/roller-conditioner/start,lang=en_US.html |title=Mowing Technology.

'''Conductive polymers''' or, more precisely, '''intrinsically conducting polymers''' (ICPs) are [[organic polymer]]s that [[Electrical conductance|conduct]] [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="Inzelt-introduction"&gt;{{ cite book | series = Monographs in Electrochemistry | title = Conducting Polymers: A New Era in Electrochemistry | first = György | last = Inzelt | editor-first = F. | editor-last = Scholz | publisher = Springer | date = 2008 | pages = 1–6 | chapter = Chapter 1: Introduction | isbn = 978-3-540-75929-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4rFDAzo5lPQC&amp;lpg=PA264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such compounds may have metallic conductivity or can be [[semiconductor]]s.

==History==
Polyaniline was first described in the mid-19th century by [[Henry Letheby]], who investigated the electrochemical and chemical oxidation products of aniline in acidic media.  He noted that reduced form was colourless but the oxidized forms were deep blue.&lt;ref name="Inzelt-history"&gt;{{ cite book | series = Monographs in Electrochemistry | title = Conducting Polymers: A New Era in Electrochemistry | first = György | last = Inzelt | editor-first = F. | editor-last = Scholz | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | date = 2008 | pages = 265–267 | chapter = Chapter 8: Historical Background (Or: There Is Nothing New Under the Sun) | isbn = 978-3-540-75929-4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4rFDAzo5lPQC&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first highly-conductive organic compounds were the [[charge transfer complex]]es.&lt;ref name="firsthalfcentury"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1196/annals.1292.016|title=An Overview of the First Half-Century of Molecular Electronics|date=2003|last1=Hush|first1=Noel S.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1006|pmid=14976006|bibcode=2003NYASA1006....1H|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, researchers reported that polycyclic aromatic compounds formed semi-conducting [[charge-transfer complex]] salts with halogens.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  In 1954, researchers at Bell Labs and elsewhere reported organic charge transfer complexes with resistivities as low as 8 ohms-cm.&lt;ref name=Okamoto/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/173168a0 | title = Electrical Conductivity of the Perylene–Bromine Complex | date = 1954 | last1 = Akamatu | first1 = Hideo | last2 = Inokuchi | first2 = Hiroo | last3 = Matsunaga | first3 = Yoshio | journal = Nature | volume = 173 | issue = 4395 | pages = 168–169|bibcode = 1954Natur.173..168A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970s, researchers demonstrated salts of [[tetrathiafulvalene]] show&lt;ref name="UTD"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00784a066|title=Electron transfer in a new highly conducting donor-acceptor complex|date=1973|last1=Ferraris|first1=JohnS|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=95|pages=948–949|last2=Cowan|first2=D.

Broad research on charge transfer salts continues today. While these compounds were technically not polymers,  this indicated that organic compounds can carry current. While organic conductors were previously intermittently discussed, the field was particularly energized by the prediction of [[superconductivity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.134.A1416|title=Possibility of Synthesizing an Organic Superconductor|date=1964|last1=Little|first1=W.

Reinhold&lt;/ref&gt; cites multiple reports of similar high-conductivity oxidized polyacetylenes.  With the notable exception of [[charge transfer complex]]es (some of which are even [[superconductor]]s), organic molecules were previously considered insulators or at best weakly conducting [[semiconductors]].  Subsequently, DeSurville and coworkers reported high conductivity in a polyaniline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0013-4686(68)80071-4|title=Electrochemical chains using protolytic organic semiconductors|date=1968|last1=De Surville|first1=R.|last2=Jozefowicz|first2=M.|last3=Yu|first3=L.T.|last4=Pepichon|first4=J.|last5=Buvet|first5=R.|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=13|pages=1451–1458|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, in 1980, Diaz and Logan reported films of polyaniline that can serve as electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(80)80081-7|title=Electroactive polyaniline films|date=1980|last1=Diaz|first1=A|last2=Logan|first2=J|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=111|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While mostly operating in the [[quantum realm]] of less than 100 nanometers, "molecular" electronic processes can collectively manifest on a macro scale. Examples include [[quantum tunneling]], [[negative resistance]], [[phonon]]-assisted hopping and [[polaron]]s. In 1977, [[Alan J.

==Types==
Linear-backbone "polymer blacks" ([[polyacetylene]], [[polypyrrole]], polyindole and [[polyaniline]]) and their copolymers are the main class of conductive polymers. [[Poly(p-phenylene vinylene)]] (PPV) and its soluble derivatives have emerged as the prototypical [[electroluminescent]] semiconducting polymers. Today, poly(3-alkylthiophenes) are the archetypical materials for [[Solar cell#Organic/polymer solar cells|solar cell]]s and transistors.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Synthesis==
Conductive polymers are prepared by many methods. Most conductive polymers are prepared by oxidative coupling of monocyclic precursors. Such reactions entail [[dehydrogenation]]:
:n H–[X]–H → H–[X]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;–H + 2(n–1) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2(n–1) e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The low [[solubility]] of most polymers presents challenges.  Some researchers add solubilizing functional groups to some or all monomers to increase solubility. Others address this through the formation of nanostructures and surfactant-stabilized conducting polymer dispersions in water. These include [[polyaniline nanofibers]] and [[Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)|PEDOT]]:[[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate|PSS]]. In many cases, the molecular weight of conductive polymers are lower than conventional [[polymer|polymers]] such as polyethylene. However, in some cases, the [[molecular weight]] need not be high to achieve the desired properties.

==Molecular basis of electrical conductivity==
The conductivity of such polymers is the result of several processes. For example, in traditional polymers such as [[polyethylene]]s, the valence electrons are bound in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized [[covalent bond]]s. Such "sigma-bonding electrons" have low mobility and do not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the material. However, in [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] materials, the situation is completely different. Conducting polymers have backbones of contiguous sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbon centers. One valence electron on each center resides in a p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, which is orthogonal to the other three sigma-bonds. All the p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals combine with each other to a molecule wide delocalized set of orbitals. The electrons in these delocalized orbitals have high mobility when the material is "doped" by oxidation, which removes some of these delocalized electrons. Thus, the [[Conjugated system|conjugated p-orbitals]] form a one-dimensional [[electronic band structure|electronic band]], and the electrons within this band become mobile when it is partially emptied. The band structures of conductive polymers can easily be calculated with a [[Tight binding|tight binding model]]. In principle, these same materials can be doped by reduction, which adds electrons to an otherwise unfilled band. In practice, most organic conductors are doped oxidatively to give p-type materials. The redox doping of organic conductors is analogous to the doping of silicon semiconductors, whereby a small fraction silicon atoms are replaced by electron-rich, ''e.g.'', [[phosphorus]], or electron-poor, ''e.g.'', [[boron]], atoms to create [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] and [[p-type semiconductor]]s, respectively.

Although typically "doping" conductive polymers involves oxidizing or reducing the material, conductive organic polymers associated with a [[protic solvent]] may also be "self-doped."

Undoped conjugated polymers state are semiconductors or insulators.  In such compounds, the energy gap can be &gt; 2 eV, which is too great for thermally activated conduction. Therefore, undoped conjugated polymers, such as polythiophenes, [[polyacetylene]]s only have a low electrical conductivity of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm. Even at a very low level of doping (&lt; 1%), electrical conductivity increases several orders of magnitude up to values of around 0.1 S/cm. Subsequent doping of the conducting polymers will result in a saturation of the conductivity at values around 0.1–10 kS/cm for different polymers. Highest values reported up to now are for the conductivity of stretch oriented polyacetylene with confirmed values of about 80 kS/cm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/347539a0|title=Light-emitting diodes based on conjugated polymers|date=1990|last1=Burroughes|first1=J.

==Properties and applications==
Due to their poor processability, conductive polymers have few large-scale applications. They have promise in antistatic materials&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; and they have been incorporated into commercial displays and batteries, but there have been limitations due to the manufacturing costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, and inability to directly melt process. Literature suggests they are also promising in [[organic solar cells]], [[Printed electronics|printing electronic circuits]], [[Organic LED|organic light-emitting diodes]], [[actuator]]s, [[electrochromism]], [[supercapacitors]], [[chemiresistor#Conductive polymers|chemical sensors]] and [[biosensors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1016/j.aca.2008.02.068 | title =  Conducting polymers in chemical sensors and arrays | date =  2008 | last1 =  Lange | first1 =  Ulrich | last2 =  Roznyatovskaya | first2 =  Nataliya V. | last3 =  Mirsky | first3 =  Vladimir M. | journal =  Analytica Chimica Acta | volume =  614 | pages =  1–26 | pmid =  18405677 | issue =  1}}&lt;/ref&gt; flexible transparent displays, [[electromagnetic shielding]] and possibly replacement for the popular transparent conductor [[indium tin oxide]].  Another use is for [[microwave]]-absorbent coatings,  particularly radar-absorptive coatings on [[stealth aircraft]]. Conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new applications with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. The new nano-structured forms of conducting polymers particularly, augment this field with their higher surface area and better dispersability.

With the availability of stable and reproducible dispersions, PEDOT and [[polyaniline]] have gained some large-scale applications. While PEDOT ([[poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)]]) is mainly used in antistatic applications and as a transparent conductive layer in form of PEDOT:PSS dispersions (PSS=[[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate|polystyrene sulfonic acid]]), polyaniline is widely used for printed circuit board manufacturing – in the final finish, for protecting copper from corrosion and preventing its solderability.&lt;ref name=nalwa&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/B978-012513760-7/50070-8|title=Handbook of Nanostructured Materials and Nanotechnology|editor= Nalwa, H.S.|publisher=Academic Press|place= New York, USA|year= 2000|volume=5|pages=501–575|isbn=978-0-12-513760-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Polyindole is also starting to gain attention for various applications due to its high redox activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tebyetekerwa|first1=Mike|last2=Xu|first2=Zhen|last3=Li|first3=Weili|last4=Wang|first4=Xingping|last5=Marriam|first5=Ifra|last6=Peng|first6=Shengjie|last7=Ramakrishna|first7=Seeram|last8=Yang|first8=Shengyuan|last9=Zhu|first9=Meifang|title=Surface Self-Assembly of Functional Electroactive Nanofibers on Textile Yarns as a Facile Approach Towards Super Flexible Energy Storage|journal=ACS Applied Energy Materials|date=13 December 2017|doi=10.1021/acsaem.7b00057}}&lt;/ref&gt; thermal stability,&lt;ref name="Unveiling Polyindole 2017"/&gt; and slow degradation properties than competitors polyaniline and polypyrrole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Weiqiang|last2=Xu|first2=Jingkun|title=Progress in Conjugated Polyindoles: Synthesis, Polymerization Mechanisms, Properties, and Applications|journal=Polymer Reviews|date=18 August 2016|volume=57|issue=2|pages=248–275|doi=10.1080/15583724.2016.1223130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Visible anchor|Electroluminescence}} ===
[[Electroluminescence]] is light emission stimulated by electric current. In organic compounds, electroluminescence has been known since the early 1950s, when Bernanose and coworkers first produced electroluminescence in crystalline thin films of acridine orange and quinacrine. In 1960, researchers at Dow Chemical developed AC-driven electroluminescent cells using doping. In some cases, similar [[light emission]] is observed when a [[voltage]] is applied to a thin layer of a conductive organic polymer film. While electroluminescence was originally mostly of academic interest, the increased conductivity of modern conductive polymers means enough power can be put through the device at low voltages to generate practical amounts of light. This property has led to the development of [[flat panel display]]s using [[organic LED]]s, [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, and optical [[amplifier]]s.

===Barriers to applications===
Since most conductive polymers require oxidative doping, the properties of the resulting state are crucial. Such materials are salt-like (polymer salt), which diminishes their solubility in organic solvents and water and hence their processability. Furthermore, the charged organic backbone is often unstable towards atmospheric moisture.  The poor processability for many polymers requires the introduction of solubilizing or substituents, which can further complicate the synthesis.

Experimental and theoretical thermodynamical evidence suggests that conductive polymers may even be completely and principally insoluble so that they can only be processed by [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]].&lt;ref name="nalwa"/&gt;

===Trends===
Most recent emphasis is on [[organic light emitting diode]]s and organic [[polymer solar cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec_subscribe.asp?CID=2235&amp;DID=82525&amp;action=detail Overview on Organic Electronics]. Mrs.org. Retrieved on 2017-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Organic Electronics Association is an international platform to promote applications of [[organic semiconductor]]s. Conductive polymer products with embedded and improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection have led to both prototypes and products. For example,  Polymer Electronics Research Center at University of Auckland is developing a range of novel DNA sensor technologies based on conducting polymers, photoluminescent polymers and inorganic nanocrystals (quantum dots) for simple, rapid and sensitive gene detection.  Typical conductive polymers must be "doped" to produce high conductivity. As of 2001, there remains to be discovered an organic polymer that is ''intrinsically'' electrically conducting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~colinc/science/past/PhD/html-thesis/node8.html Conjugated Polymers: Electronic Conductors] (April 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital currency''' ('''digital money''', '''electronic money''' or '''electronic currency''') is a type of [[currency]] available in digital form (in contrast to physical, such as [[banknote]]s and [[coin]]s). It exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but can allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include [[Virtual currency|virtual currencies]] and [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital vs. Virtual Currencies|url=http://bitcoinmagazine.com/15862/digital-vs-virtual-currencies/|publisher=Andrew Wagner|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[central bank]] issued money accounted for in a computer database (including [[digital base money]]). Like traditional [[money]], these currencies may be used to buy physical [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital currencies are impacting video games with... |url=https://www.offgamers.com/blog/digital-currencies-are-impacting-video-games-with-new-exciting-possibilities/|publisher=Offgamers|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is bitcoin?|url=http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/|publisher=CoinDesk|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital currency is a money balance recorded electronically on a [[stored-value card]] or other devices. Another form of electronic money is network money, allowing the transfer of value on [[computer networks]], particularly the [[Internet]]. Electronic money is also a claim on a private [[bank]] or other financial institution such as [[bank deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Laham, Al-Tarawneh, Abdallat|first=|date=2009|title=Development of Electronic Money and Its Impact on the Central Bank Role and Monetary Policy|url=http://iisit.org/Vol6/IISITv6p339-349Al-Laham589.pdf|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital money can either be centralized, where there is a central point of control over the money supply, or [[Decentralization|decentralized]], where the control over the money supply can come from various sources.

==History==
In 1983, a research paper by [[David Chaum]] introduced the idea of digital cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF|title=Blind signatures for untraceable payments|last=Chaum|first=David|date=1982|website=|publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he founded [[DigiCash]], an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/12241/quick-history-cryptocurrencies-bbtc-bitcoin/|title=A Quick History of Cryptocurrencies BBTC — Before Bitcoin|last=Griffith|first=Ken|date=April 16, 2014|work=[[Bitcoin Magazine]]|via=|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It filed for bankruptcy in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-217527.html|title=Digicash files Chapter 11|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a.html|title=Requiem for a Bright Idea|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Chaum left the company.

In 1997, Coca-Cola offered buying from vending machines using mobile payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nearfieldcommunication.org/payment-systems.html|title=History of Mobile &amp; Contactless Payment Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that [[PayPal]] emerged in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/15862/digital-vs-virtual-currencies/|title=Digital vs Virtual currencies|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems followed suit, such as [[e-gold]], but it faced issues because it was used by criminals and was closed by U.S Department of Justice in 2005.&lt;ref name="FT11282013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foley|first1=Stephen|title=E-gold founder backs new Bitcoin rival|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7488616-561a-11e3-96f5-00144feabdc0|accessdate=May 11, 2018|publisher=Financial Times|date=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2008, [[bitcoin]] was introduced, which marked the start of digital currencies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Origins of digital currencies date back to the 1990s [[Dot-com bubble]]. One of the first was [[E-gold]], founded in 1996 and backed by gold. Another known digital currency service was [[Liberty Reserve]], founded in 2006; it lets users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1% fee. Both services were centralized, reputed to be used for money laundering, and inevitably shut down by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Black Market Bank' Accused of Laundering $6B in Criminal Proceeds|author=Jack Cloherty |date=28 May 2013 |work=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/black-market-bank-accused-laundering-6b-criminal-proceeds/story?id=19275887 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q coins or QQ coins, were used as a type of commodity-based digital currency on [[Tencent QQ]]'s messaging platform and emerged in early 2005. Q coins were so effective in China that they were said to have had a destabilizing effect on the Chinese Yuan currency due to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='China's virtual currency threatens the Yuan' |date=5 December 2006 |work=Asia Times Online |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/HL05Cb01.html |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent interest in [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] has prompted renewed interest in digital currencies, with [[bitcoin]], introduced in 2008, becoming the most widely used and accepted digital currency.

==Comparisons==
===Digital versus virtual currency===
According to the [[European Central Bank]]'s 2015 "Virtual currency schemes – a further analysis" report, virtual currency is a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which, in some circumstances, can be used as an alternative to money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemesen.pdf|title=Virtual currency schemes - a further analysis|last=|first=|date=February 2015|website=ecb.europa.eu|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous report of October 2012, the virtual currency was defined as a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the [[Bank for International Settlements]]' November 2015 "Digital currencies" report, it is an asset represented in digital form and having some monetary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d137.pdf|title=Digital Currencies|last=|first=|date=November 2015|website=bis.org|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital currency can be denominated to a sovereign currency and issued by the issuer responsible to redeem digital money for cash. In that case, digital currency represents electronic money (e-money). Digital currency denominated in its own units of value or with decentralized or automatic issuance will be considered as a virtual currency.

As such, bitcoin is a digital currency but also a type of virtual currency. Bitcoin and its alternatives are based on cryptographic algorithms, so these kinds of virtual currencies are also called cryptocurrencies.

===Digital versus traditional currency===
Most of the traditional [[money supply]] is [[Demand deposit|bank money]] held on computers. This is also considered digital currency. One could argue that our increasingly cashless society means that all currencies are becoming digital, but they are not presented to us as such.&lt;ref name="ECB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Virtual Currency Schemes |date=October 2012 |publisher=European Central Bank |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-92-899-0862-7 |page=5 |url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf |format=PDF |author= |chapter=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053452/http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf |archivedate=6 November 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of systems ==

=== Centralized systems ===
{{Main|Electronic funds transfer}}

Currency can be exchanged electronically using [[debit card]]s and [[credit card]]s using [[electronic funds transfer at point of sale]].

==== Mobile digital wallets ====
A number of electronic money systems use [[contactless payment]] transfer in order to facilitate easy payment and give the payee more confidence in not letting go of their electronic wallet during the transaction.
* In 1994 [[Mondex]] and [[National Westminster Bank]] provided an "electronic purse" to residents of [[Swindon]]
* In about 2005 [[Telefónica]] and [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA Bank]] launched a payment system in [[Spain]] called Mobipay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fujitsu.com/es/about/resources/case-studies/mobipay_en.html|title=Mobipay - Fujitsu Spain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used simple [[short message service]] facilities of [[feature phones]] intended for pay-as you go services including taxis and pre-pay phone recharges via a BBVA current bank account debit.
* In January 2010, [[Venmo]] launched as a mobile payment system through SMS, which transformed into a social app where friends can pay each other for minor expenses like a cup of coffee, rent and paying your share of the restaurant bill when you forget your wallet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kortina.net/essays/origins-of-venmo/|title=Origins of Venmo|accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular with college students, but has some security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/safety_net/2015/02/venmo_security_it_s_not_as_strong_as_the_company_wants_you_to_think.html|title=Venmo Money, Venmo Problems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be linked to your bank account, credit/debit card or have a loaded value to limit the amount of loss in case of a security breach. Credit cards and non-major debit cards incur a 3% processing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venmo.com/about/fees/|title=Venmo pricing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 19, 2011, [[Google Wallet]] released in the United States to make it easy to carry all your credit/debit cards on your phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/this-day-in-tech-google-wallet-launches/|title=This Day in Tech: Google Wallet launches|last=|first=|date=September 19, 2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012 [[Ireland]]'s [[O2 (Ireland)|O2]] (owned by [[Telefónica]]) launched Easytrip to pay [[road tolls]] which were charged to the mobile phone account or prepay credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepaypers.com/mobile-payments/easytrip-o2-launch-mobile-toll-payments-service-in-the-republic-of-ireland/749223-16/abstract|title=Easytrip, O2 launch mobile toll payments service in the Republic of Ireland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The UK's [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] invented O2 Wallet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.o2.co.uk/money|title=O2 - O2 money - The O2 Wallet service closed on 31st March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at about the same time. The wallet can be charged with regular bank accounts or cards and discharged by participating retailers using a technique known as 'money messages'. The service closed in 2014.
* On September 9, 2014, [[Apple Pay]] was announced at the [[iPhone 6]] event. In October 2014 it was released as an update to work on [[iPhone 6]] and [[Apple Watch]]. It is very similar to [[Google Wallet]], but for Apple devices only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6127587/apple-watch-works-with-apple-pay-to-replace-your-credit-cards|title=Apple Watch works with Apple Pay to replace your credit cards|last=|first=|date=September 9, 2014|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decentralized systems ===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
{{see also|List of cryptocurrencies}}
A cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that relies on [[cryptography]] for chaining together digital signatures of asset transfers, [[peer-to-peer]] networking and [[decentralization]].
In some cases a [[proof-of-work]] or [[proof-of-stake]] scheme is used to create and manage the currency.&lt;ref name="ars1"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/wary-of-bitcoin-a-guide-to-some-other-cryptocurrencies/ Wary of Bitcoin?

Cryptocurrencies allow electronic money systems to be decentralized. The first and most popular system is [[bitcoin]], a peer-to-peer electronic monetary system based on cryptography.

===Virtual currency===
{{main|Virtual currency}}
A virtual currency has been defined in 2012 by the [[European Central Bank]] as "a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific [[virtual community]]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|last=|first=|date=October 2012|website=ecb.europa.eu|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of Treasury]] in 2013 defined it more tersely as "a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/ig/Audit%20Reports%20and%20Testimonies/OIG-16-006.pdf|title=Audit Report|last=|first=|date=November 10, 2015|website=Treasury.gov|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key attribute a virtual currency does not have according to these definitions, is the status as legal tender.

== Law ==
Since 2001, the European Union has implemented the [[E-Money Directive]] "on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions" last amended in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0110:en:NOT|title=Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions amending Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC, Official Journal L 267, 10/10/2009 P. 0007 - 0017|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts on the real nature of EU electronic money have arisen, since calls have been made in connection with the 2007 EU [[Payment Services Directive]] in favor of merging payment institutions and electronic money institutions. Such a merger could mean that electronic money is of the same nature as [[Demand deposit|bank money]] or [[Demand deposit|scriptural money]].

In the United States, electronic money is governed by Article 4A of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] for wholesale transactions and the [[Electronic Fund Transfer Act]] for consumer transactions. Provider's responsibility and consumer's liability are regulated under Regulation E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2009/fil09066.pdf|title=ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER ACT (REGULATION E)|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.occ.gov/topics/bank-operations/bit/intro-to-electronic-money-issues-appendix.pdf|title=In Introduction to Electronic Money Issues - Appendixes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==



{{Globalize|section|date=October 2018}}


Virtual currencies pose challenges for central banks, financial regulators, departments or ministries of finance, as well as fiscal authorities and statistical authorities.

===U.S. Treasury guidance===
On March 20, 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a guidance to clarify how the U.S. [[Bank Secrecy Act]] applied to persons creating, exchanging, and transmitting virtual currencies.&lt;ref name="FinCEN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html |title=FIN-2013-G001: Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies |date=18 March 2013 |publisher=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network |page=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319213642/http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |access-date=29 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securities and Exchange Commission guidance===
In May 2014 the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) "warned about the hazards of bitcoin and other virtual currencies".&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bobelian |first1=Michael |title=SEC Warns Investors To Beware Of Bitcoin |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbobelian/2014/05/09/sec-warns-investors-to-beware-of-bitcoin |work=Forbes |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York state regulation===
In July 2014, the [[New York State Department of Financial Services]] proposed the most comprehensive regulation of virtual currencies to date, commonly called [[BitLicense]].&lt;ref name=Forbes714&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bobelian|first1=Michael|title=New York's Financial Regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, Maintains Lead On Bitcoin Regulation|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbobelian/2014/07/25/new-yorks-financial-regulator-benjamin-lawsky-maintains-lead-on-bitcoin-regulation |work=Forbes |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the US federal regulators it has gathered input from bitcoin supporters and the financial industry through public hearings and a comment period until 21 October 2014 to customize the rules. The proposal per NY DFS press release “sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity".{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} It has been criticized by smaller companies to favor established institutions, and Chinese bitcoin exchanges have complained that the rules are "overly broad in its application outside the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=SydneyEmber |title=More Comments Invited for Proposed Bitcoin Rule |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/more-comments-invited-for-proposed-bitcoin-rules/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |work=DealBook|publisher=NY Times |date=21 August 2014 |ref=nyt814 |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption by governments==
As of 2016, over 24 countries are investing in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) with $1.4bn in investments. In addition, over 90 [[central bank]]s are engaged in DLT discussions, including implications of a [[Central bank digital currency|central bank issued digital currency]].&lt;ref name="econotimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/BoE-explores-implications-of-blockchain-and-central-bank-issued-digital-currency-277718 |title=BoE explores implications of blockchain and central bank-issued digital currency |website=EconoTimes.com |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hong Kong]]’s [[Octopus card]] system: Launched in 1997 as an electronic purse for public transportation, is the most successful and mature implementation of contactless smart cards used for mass transit payments. After only 5 years, 25 percent of Octopus card transactions are unrelated to transit, and accepted by more than 160 merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartcardalliance.org/resources/lib/Hong_Kong_Octopus_Card.pdf|title=Hong Kong Octopus Card|last=|first=|date=2005|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[London]] Transport’s [[Oyster card]] system: Oyster is a plastic smartcard which can hold pay as you go credit, Travelcards and Bus &amp; Tram season tickets. You can use an Oyster card to travel on bus, Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground and most National Rail services in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster?intcmp=1685|title=What is Oyster?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Japan]]’s [[FeliCa]]: A contactless RFID [[smart card]], used in a variety of ways such as in ticketing systems for public transportation, e-money, and residence door keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Products/felica/about/|title="Contactless" convenience with Sony's FeliCa|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Netherlands]]' [[Chipknip]]: As an electronic cash system used in the Netherlands, all ATM cards issued by the Dutch banks had value that could be loaded via Chipknip loading stations. For people without a bank, pre-paid Chipknip cards could be purchased at various locations in the Netherlands.

'''Canada'''

The [[Bank of Canada]] have explored the possibility of creating a version of its currency on the blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3595010/Celent-calls-on-central-banks-to-issue-their-own-digital-currencies.html |title=Celent calls on central banks to issue their own digital currencies /Euromoney magazine |website=Euromoney.com |date=2016-10-20 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation’s five largest banks — and the blockchain consulting firm R3 — for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run in 2016, the central bank issued CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar [[Ethereum]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/dealbook/central-banks-consider-bitcoins-technology-if-not-bitcoin.html|title=Central Banks Consider Bitcoin’s Technology, if Not Bitcoin|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

'''China'''

A deputy governor at the [[People’s Bank of China|central bank of China]], Fan Yifei, wrote that "the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; According to Fan Yifei, the best way to take advantage of the situation is for central banks to take the lead, both in supervising private digital currencies and in developing digital legal tender of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-09-01/on-digital-currencies-central-banks-should-lead |title=On Digital Currencies, Central Banks Should Lead - Bloomberg View |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish government proposed getting rid of the obligation for selected retailers to accept payment in cash, moving the country closer to a "cashless" economy.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/denmark-cash-idUSL5N0XX2ZQ20150506 |title=Denmark proposes cash-free shops to cut retail costs |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2015-05-06 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Chamber of Commerce is backing the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/22/denmark-paper-money/ |title=Cashless society: Denmark to allow shops to ban paper money |website=Fortune.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a third of the Danish population uses [[MobilePay]], a smartphone application for transferring money.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

'''Ecuador'''

A law passed by the [[National Assembly of Ecuador]] gives the government permission to make payments in electronic currency and proposes the creation of a national digital currency. "Electronic money will stimulate the economy; it will be possible to attract more Ecuadorian citizens, especially those who do not have checking or savings accounts and credit cards alone. The electronic currency will be backed by the assets of the Central Bank of Ecuador", the National Assembly said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ecuador-create-government-run-digital-currency-it-bans-bitcoin-1458280 |title=Ecuador to Create Government-Run Digital Currency as It Bans Bitcoin |website=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Sistema de Dinero Electrónico ("electronic money system") was launched, making Ecuador the first country with a state-run electronic payment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Everett Rosenfeld |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/06/ecuador-becomes-the-first-country-to-roll-out-its-own-digital-durrency.html |title=Ecuador becomes the first country to roll out its own digital durrency |website=Cnbc.com |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant real-time payment system developed by National Payments Corporation of India facilitating inter-bank transactions. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform.
UPI is built over Immediate Payment Service(IMPS) for transferring funds. Being a digital payment system it is available 24*7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested. It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank), Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID. An UPI-PIN (UPI Personal Identification number that one creates on the UPI app of the bank) is required to confirm each payment.

'''Sweden'''

[[Sweden]] is in the process of replacing all of its physical banknotes, and most of its coins by mid-2017. However, the new banknotes and coins of the [[Swedish krona]] will probably be circulating at about half the 2007 peak of 12,494 kronor per capita. The [[Riksbank]] is planning to begin discussions of an electronic currency issued by the central bank to which "is not to replace cash, but to act as complement to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Speeches/2016/Skingsley-Should-the-Riksbank-issue-e-krona/|title=Skingsley: Should the Riksbank issue e-krona?|first=|last=Riksbanken|website=www.riksbank.se|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221093204/http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Speeches/2016/Skingsley-Should-the-Riksbank-issue-e-krona/|archive-date=21 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Governor [[Cecilia Skingsley]] states that cash will continue to spiral out of use in Sweden, and while it is currently fairly easy to get cash in Sweden, it is often very difficult to deposit it into bank accounts, especially in rural areas. No decision has been currently made about the decision to create "e-krona".  In her speech, Skingsley states: "The first question is whether e-krona should be booked in accounts or whether the ekrona should be some form of a digitally transferable unit that does not need an underlying account structure, roughly like cash." Skingsley also states: "Another important question is whether the Riksbank should issue e-krona directly to the general public or go via the banks, as we do now with banknotes and coins." Other questions will be addressed like interest rates, should they be positive, negative, or zero?

'''Switzerland'''

In 2016, a [[city government]] first accepted digital currency in payment of city fees.  [[Zug, Switzerland]], added bitcoin as a means of paying small amounts, up to {{CHF|200}}, in a test and an attempt to advance Zug as a region that is advancing future technologies.  In order to reduce risk, Zug immediately converts any bitcoin received into the Swiss currency.&lt;ref name=dwf20160701&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alpine-crypto-valley-pays-with-bitcoins/a-19371082? |last=Uhlig/jse |first=Christian |title=Alpine 'Crypto Valley' pays with Bitcoins |work=DW Finance |date=1 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160920160330/http://www.dw.com/en/alpine-crypto-valley-pays-with-bitcoins/a-19371082? |archivedate=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Swiss Federal Railways]], government-owned railway company of Switzerland, sells bitcoins at its ticket machines.&lt;ref name="sbb.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/services/further-services/bitcoin.html |title=SBB: Make quick and easy purchases with Bitcoin |website=Sbb.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbb.ch"/&gt;

'''UK'''

The Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government advised his Prime Minister and Parliament to consider using a blockchain-based digital currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35344843 |title=Government urged to use Bitcoin-style digital ledgers|website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief economist of [[Bank of England]], the central bank of the United Kingdom, proposed abolition of paper currency. The Bank has also taken an interest in bitcoin.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Szu Ping Chan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/11/inside-the-bank-of-englands-vaults-can-cash-survive/ |title=Inside the Bank of England's vaults: can cash survive? |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2016-09-13 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it has embarked on a multi-year research programme to explore the implications of a central bank issued digital currency.&lt;ref name="econotimes.com"/&gt; The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country's economic output.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The Bank said that it wanted the next version of the bank’s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

'''Ukraine'''

The [[National Bank of Ukraine]] is considering a creation of its own issuance/turnover/servicing system for a blockchain-based national cryptocurrency.&lt;ref name="forklog.net"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://forklog.net/cashless-ukraine-the-national-bank-considers-blockchain-technology/ |title=Cashless Ukraine: The National Bank Considers Blockchain Technology |website=ForkLog.net |date=2016-10-19 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulator also announced that blockchain could be a part of a national project called "Cashless Economy".&lt;ref name="forklog.net"/&gt;

==Adoption by financial actors==
Government attitude dictates the tendency among established heavy financial actors that both are risk-averse and conservative. None of these offered services around cryptocurrencies and much of the criticism came from them.

The first mover among these has been [[Fidelity Investments]], [[Boston]] based [[Fidelity Digital Assets]] LLC will provide enterprise-grade custody solutions, a cryptocurrency trading execution platform and institutional advising services 24 hours a day, seven days a week designed to align with blockchain's always-on trading cycle".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/10/15/fidelity-launches-institutional-platform-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum/#a5ea5ae93c46 Fidelity Launches Institutional Platform For Bitcoin And Ethereum&lt;/ref&gt; It will work with [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]] with general availability scheduled for 2019.

== Hard vs. soft digital currencies ==
Hard electronic currency does not have the ability to be disputed or reversed when used. It is nearly impossible to reverse a transaction, justified or not. It is very similar to cash. Advantages of this system include it being cheaper to operate, and transactions are instantaneous. Western Union, [[KlickEx]] and [[Bitcoin]] are examples of this type of currency.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@wikoff.shawn/the-expert-shawn-wikoff-talks-about-electronic-money-d01964dd669c|title=The expert Shawn Wikoff talks about Electronic money|last=Wikoff|first=Shawn|date=2016-09-13|website=Medium|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft electronic currencies are the opposite of hard electronic currencies. Payments can be reversed. Usually, when a payment is reversed there is a "clearing time." This can take 72 hours or more. Examples of soft currencies are [[PayPal]] and any type of [[credit card]]. A hard currency can be "softened" with a third party service.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Many existing digital currencies have not yet seen widespread usage, and may not be easily used or exchanged. Banks generally do not accept or offer services for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-mostly-avoid-providing-bitcoin-servicesthe-bitcoin-banking-blues-1387745329|title=Banks Mostly Avoid Providing Bitcoin Services|first=Robin|last=Sidel|date=22 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that cryptocurrencies are extremely risky due to their very high [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tucker |first=Toph |title=Bitcoin's Volatility Problem: Why Today's Selloff Won't Be the Last |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-05/bitcoins-volatility-problem-why-todays-sell-off-wont-be-the-last |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potential for [[pump and dump]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Jason D. |title=A crypto-currency primer: Bitcoin vs. Litecoin |url=http://www.zdnet.com/a-crypto-currency-primer-bitcoin-vs-litecoin-7000024301/ |publisher=ZDNet |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulators in several countries have warned against their use and some have taken concrete regulatory measures to dissuade users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Frances Schwartzkopff |author2=Peter Levring|title= Bitcoins Spark Regulatory Crackdown as Denmark Drafts Rules|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-17/bitcoin-rules-drafted-in-denmark-as-regulator-warns-against-use.html |date=18 December 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-cryptocurrencies are all [[centralized]].

'''Global Entrepreneurs Network''' (@GEN) was the world's first web hosting and e-commerce hosting provider, founded by Thomas Heimann in 1994. The company merged in late 1998 with Sage Network (later Interliant - INIT).

Early History

Thomas Heimann was an early online entrepreneur marketing his "Computer Profits" and "All-in-One Electronic Marketing Kit" which were two products that taught entrepreneurs how to use Usenet/News Groups for online marketing. He came to the realization that the World Wide Web would become the "Great Equalizer" and de facto platform for online commerce. In his attempts to set up a web presence for his own marketing business he realized that the few companies that were selling web servers and offering web related services to businesses at the time were simply too expensive for entrepreneurs and small businesses, with the least expensive solution cobbled together at the time costing in excess of $5,000.00.

In late 1994 Thomas met (online) Rich Skrenta, an engineer with Novel at the time, and the two discussed what it would take to provide simple web hosting and email solutions, as well as domain registration services, and the two reached an arrangement that gave birth to the Global Entrepreneurs Network (GEN). GEN – using the initial domain of Entrepreneurs.net – purchased a Unix Server to be hosted by Rich Skrenta in his basement, and GEN would pay Rich Skrenta a one-time fee of $50 for every domain registered and account set up on the server. Rich wrote a number of Perl scripts to automate domain registration and account setup, and Global Entrepreneurs Network officially opened doors as a membership organization offering [https://web.archive.org/web/19981207030455/http://home.gen.com/compare.htm two membership plans]: Standard Membership at $49/month or $249/year and full-service membership at $99/month or $895/year. Each membership plan included a domain registration, with 5 email addresses and a 5 MB website for standard members and unlimited email addresses and 100 MB website for full-service members.

Since the domain registration process at the time was entirely free, GEN became the first company to offer free domain registration via a web-based order form that in turn connected to the scripts Rich Skrenta created to automate the registration process with InterNIC.

Originally GEN was started in Thomas Heimann's two-bedroom apartment with a handful of early day employees, most of which worked 'practically free' just for the excitement of being part of something "big". In late 1995 GEN was able to secure a sublease at below markt rates for class A office space at 100 N Tampa Street in downtown Tampa, where the company would remain for the next two years.

;Growth and expansion

In 1995 GEN hired Raymond Karrenbauer, who became instrumental in designing the first Microsoft IIS-based web server farm, which was a strategic decision that led to GEN becoming the first web hosting provider to offer Microsoft Frontpage hosting in 1996 upon Microsoft's launch of the product, with its $9.95/month Start Smart Frontpage hosting plan.

In 1996 GEN reached an agreement with America Online (AOL) and created an 'All in One' eBusiness CD ROM that provided Internet access via AOL, combined with online signup for GEN's hosting services and MS Frontpage software. GEN would introduce the eBusiness CD ROM and its various other programs at the 2007 CEBIT in Hannover Germany.

In 1998 GEN reached an agreement with iMall, at the time the leading provider of online mall services, and CardService to facilitate online storefronts and credit card processing for its full-service membership customers.

GEN was at the time the world's largest web hosting and ecommerce provider, with over 35,000 customers and domains hosted in over 50 countries. GEN maintained offices in Cologne, Germany, as well as outside of Canberra, Australia, in addition to its Florida headquarters.

;Some of GEN's accomplishments:

* Invented the email autoresponder in 1995
* First web-based and free domain registration service 
* GEN was the largest submitter of domain registrations to Internic and provided DNS services to hundreds of thousands of domains

In late 1998, GEN International, Inc (GEN - Global Entrepreneurs Network) was [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=20905&amp;seqNum=3 acquired] by/merged with Sage Networks, which later renamed to Interliant, prior to its [http://edgar.secdatabase.com/389/95012399006267/filing-main.htm IPO].

'''Ida Henrietta Hyde''' (September 8, 1857 – August 22, 1945) was an [[United States|American]] [[Physiology|physiologist]] known for developing a micro-[[electrode]] powerful enough to stimulate tissue chemically or electronically, yet small enough to inject or remove tissue from a cell. Ida was never married and agnostic in her religious standing. She retired at the age in 63 in the year 1920. After her retirement, Ida traveled to several places, including Switzerland, Austria, Egypt, India, and several locations in Germany. On August 22, 1945 Ida Hyde died of a cerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the biological sciences: a biobibliographic sourcebook|last=Rose|first=Rose|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Born in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Iowa]], Ida was one of four children to Meyer and Babette (Lowenthal) Heidenheimer, [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] from [[Württemberg]]. The [[surname]] Hyde was taken after their arrival in the [[United States]]. Ida's father was a merchant that worked out of home and who left the family on one of his trips, leaving Babette to care for the children. In order to keep the family afloat, they moved to [[Chicago]], where Babette took in jobs of cleaning and mending until she was able to start a prosperous business.All of the children were able and sent to public school and became educated middle class individuals, with the intention of Ida’s only brother Ben, to attend university.&lt;ref name="BioSci"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Rose|title=Women in the biological sciences: a biobibliographic sourcebook|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=246|isbn=0-313-29180-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oPGJZ7e06PQC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%22Ida+Henrietta+Hyde%22|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the family home was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Chicago]], which destroyed the family business as well. Without any form of income, Ida as the oldest daughter, entered the work force at age 14 as a [[Hatmaking|milliner's]] [[apprentice]]. Because of her age, older than that of her siblings, much of the burden of supporting the family fell on her.  She brought in a large portion of the family income, and even paid for her only brother's education at the [[University of Illinois]]. Over time, she rose in her occupation to the job of saleslady. Her experience in the clothing store proved to be valuable later in life because of her ability to fashion her own clothing with minimal supplies.&lt;ref name="BioSci"/&gt;

==Education==
At the store where she worked, Hyde chanced upon an English version of [[Ansichten der Natur]] (View of Nature) by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. It was from this work that her love of biology was born. In addition, it spurred her toward continuing her education, which she did by attending night classes at the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] during 1875–76 in spite of her parent's objections. Her further educational studies came to her while she was visiting her brother at his university and chanced upon meeting several women working in [[academia]]. She was able to pass her entrance exams for the [[College Preparatory School]] and later entered the same university as her brother.

Ida began studying at the University of Illinois at the age of 24, but her study was cut short when her brother became sick in 1882 and she had to attend to him. She also used all of her savings for just one year of education. However, she passed the county teacher's exam and, three years later, the Chicago teacher's exams, and for the next seven years she worked as a [[teacher]] of second- and third-graders within the [[Chicago Public Schools|Chicago public school system]].  Her biological pursuits still were still expressed in her attempts to work nature studies into the [[Primary education|public school system]]. She saved money to put towards her tuition, remaining focused on her goal of attaining a college degree.&lt;ref name= "JWA"&gt;Butin, Jan. "Ida Henrietta Hyde (1857-1945)" Encyclopedia, Jewish Women's Archive, accessed March 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 she was finally able to return to the collegiate scene at the age of 31. She enrolled at [[Cornell University]] and earned her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in just three years. She was then offered a biology scholarship at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. She accepted and began under the tutelage of [[Jacques Loeb]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].&lt;ref name="BioSci"/&gt;  As an assistant att Woods Hole Biological Laboratory, she conducted research on the nervous system of jellyfish.  She produced many detailed drawings and descriptions of the nerve cells.  In 1893, Hyde received a European Fellowship from the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, which would later become the [[American Association of University Women]].

Ida’s results from the research at Woods Hole is said to have helped motivate Dr. Goette in inviting her to come to University of Strasbourg in 1893, to work with him even as no woman had done previously. Hyde, during her attendance at Strasbourg, was the first woman in Germany to have ever petitioned to matriculate for an advanced degree in natural science or mathematics. At the time it was necessary to petition the government and get permission from the faculty. Before this process went fully into motion Ida withdrew her attempts. It is said that the large number of people who spoke out against Ida going through with the petition is what was the cause of that decision, and that Heidelberg University would be a better place to gain her degree.

Ida received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Heidelberg University]], Germany at age 39 after many frustrating obstacles presented because of her gender. She was required to go beyond the work of an average student to receive her degree, and became the third woman to graduate with a doctorate there. The main problem in obtaining her degree was that her teaching professor, [[Wilhelm Kühne]], disliked the thought of allowing a woman to work under him. But her accomplishments eventually surmounted his opposition and she passed the doctoral examinations with honor in February 1896 and became the first woman to receive a doctorate from this institution.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Elsie|year=1981|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde: Early Experiments|journal= Physiologist|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1–2|url=http://the-aps.org/publications/tphys/legacy/1981/issue6/10.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her thesis project examined the physiological development of jellyfish ([[Anthomedusae|Hydromedusa]]).

Ida researched at several other institutions before going to the University of Kansas including University of Berne 1896, and Radcliffe College 1897. After she started working at KU, Hyde also studied at Rush Medical College over several summers to receive her M. D. in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Women of Science since 1900|last=Wayne|first=Tiffany K.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=978-1-59884-158-9|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the course of Ida’s seven years of teaching she was involved in establishing the “Science in the Schools” program in Chicago’s public school system. This program helped to introduce Nature Studies into these school, where Ida was even known for sharing her own teaching methods with the other educators.

Following completion of her doctorate, she was invited to Naples, Italy as the Investigator of Residence at the Naples Zoological Station, a prestigious post.  She continued work on marine invertebrate physiology, until moving to the University of Bern, Switzerland to work with Dr. Kronecker on muscle physiology.  She became the first woman admitted to do research at Harvard Medical School under W.T. Porter.  While continuing her research, she also furthered her education and medical training  at Harvard.  Hyde remained an educator as well, teaching classes at preparatory schools and at Woods Hole during the summer.

She was hired as an Associate Professor by the University of Kansas in 1899 and founded the Department of Physiology, also serving as its first Chairman of the Department of Physiology, where she worked for 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Gail S. (1981) Ida Henrietta Hyde: The First Woman Member of the Society.  24(6) pp. 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Over her career, Hyde's research covered the nervous, circulatory, and respiratory systems of vertebrates and invertebrates, and explored the effects of narcotics, caffeine, and alcohol on the body. Also in through the course of her work she noted the differences in the effects of music on the cardiovascular system in athletes, musicians, and farmers and caffeine being the cause of decreased efficiency in physical work. She was the first women elected into the American Society of Physiologists in 1902, and was its only female member until 1913.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=G. S.|date=December 1, 1981|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde: The First Woman Member of the Society.|url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/1980-1989/1981/December.pdf|journal=The Physiologist|doi=|pmid=7043503|access-date=|volume=24|pages=10–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microelectrode ===
Hyde was a researcher and professor, but also an inventor and innovator. She developed instruments for monitoring physiological parameters in a marine animal that could be used in seawater.  Her most well-known invention was an intracellular micropippette electrode. Dr. Hyde had observed that electrolytes in high concentrations affect processes of cell division, leading to her noting of the minute differences in electrical potential within cells. In order to understand how these nerve and muscle cells work, she needed to be able to stimulate the cells properly and be able to record the results of the change in the currents of the individual cells occurring. Ida’s microelectrode can be used for stimulating cells at the micro level while recording electrical activity within the cell without disturbing the cellular wall. This device was a revolutionary invention in neurophysiology and the study of contractile nerve tissue, however, the micro electrode was never officially attributed to Ida as being its first inventor.&lt;ref name = "JWA" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnson" /&gt;

Though Dr. Hyde’s possible microelectrode invention was reported in 1921, several others also created electrodes similar to Ida’s, while scientific historians, like G. Kass-Simon have accredited Hyde’s invention as being the original and revolutionary. Another microelectrode was supposedly invented another time, about twenty years after Ida was said to have made her version of this invention, by Judith Graham and Ralph W. Gerard from the University of Chicago. Then in the 1950s, Gerard was nominated for a Nobel Prize, because of his developed model of the microelectrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventors and Inventions|last=Benson|first=Alvin K.|publisher=Salem Press, Incorporated|year=2010|isbn=978-1-58765-522-7|location=Pasadena, CA|pages=578–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributions to the Human Health Field ===
Ida Hyde lectured on multiple occasions within and outside of the University of Kansas.With the aid of area physicians, she established a program of public medical examination of school children for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and spinal meningitis. Though she was not a true medical professional, she was elected to membership in the Kansas Medical Society because of her expertise in the knowledge and control of infectious diseases. And in 1918 she was appointed State Chairman of the Kansas Women’s Committee on Health, Sanitation and National Defense. A notable proportion of the lectures Ida held in her career were on hygiene and spreadable diseases. Dr. Hyde spoke openly about human sexuality and its involvement in the spread of disease, as well as being an open promoter of public health education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Confronting Discrimination of Women ===
::''It was not until I had worked many days in the splendid laboratory assigned to my private use that it dawned upon me that I was occupying a unique position... In the university circle the news quickly spread that an American "woman's rights" freak... had had the boldness and audacity to force entrance into the college halls. '' -- Ida H. Hyde, "Before Women Were Human Beings".&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = Ida H | year = 1938 | title = Before Women Were Human Beings... Adventures of an American Fellow in German Universities of the '90's. | url = | journal = AAUW Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 226–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde repeatedly encountered barriers to her education and career due to her gender, and pressed for more equal access and treatment of women in academia throughout her life.  When she was denied the right to enroll in Strassburg University because of her gender, she went to Heidelberg University.  Although she was allowed to matriculate, the university's medical school did not permit women, and the faculty denied her entry to physiology lectures or laboratories.  Fortunately, her male colleagues shared their lecture notes, and after intense study she passed her doctoral examinations with honor.&lt;ref name= "Sloan"&gt;Sloan, Jan Butin (1978) The Foundation of the Naples Table Association for Promoting Scientific Research by Women, 1897. ''Signs'', 4(1) 208-216. University of Chicago Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173357&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote about her difficulties in a revealing account in the [[AAUW]] Journal entitled "Before Women Were Human Beings".&lt;ref name ="Human" /&gt;

After returning to America, Hyde enlisted the help of many fellow women academics and wealthy female benefactors to create a fund to support women in science.  The Naples Table Association became a source of both financial aid and professional support for women in scientific research, with 36 women benefiting from the program.&lt;ref name="Sloan" /&gt;  In 1927, she established a scholarship at the [[University of Kansas]] (KU) for women pursuing careers in the sciences, and endowed the Ida H. Hyde International Fellowship with the Association of American University Women ([[AAUW]]).&lt;ref&gt;Emily Taylor Center for Women &amp; Gender Equity, The University of Kansas. http://emilytaylorcenter.ku.edu/pioneer-woman/hyde accessed March 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On the campus of KU, she pushed for toilet facilities in the science buildings; these buildings were built with only restrooms provided for men, assuming there would be no need for women's facilities.  She repeatedly pressed the university for equal pay and worked in the community to increase the opportunities for women in diverse professions.

The '''Imperial Typewriter Company''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturer of [[typewriter]]s based in [[Leicester]], England.

The company was founded by [[Hidalgo Moya]], an [[United States|American]]-[[Spain|Spanish]] engineer who lived in England. After first building the Moya typewriter, he set up the Imperial Typewriter Company in Leicester in 1911 with local businessmen John Gordon Chattaway, William Arthur Evans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/1914-william-arthur-evans-1914-15 Leicester Lit &amp; Phil Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph Wallis Goddard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anjas-cutebeads.blogspot.fr/2013/06/the-eccentric-brain-behind-imperial.html|title=The Eccentric Brain Behind Imperial Typewriters|last=|first=|date=21 June 2013|website=|archive-url=https://archive.is/qLJhp|archive-date=16 Apr 2014|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stopped manufacturing typewriters when electric models and then [[word processor]]s and [[personal computers]] became popular, causing typewriter sales to fall.

The company was acquired by [[Litton Industries]] in 1966, and gradually introduced [[Royal Typewriter Company]] models largely assembled from parts shipped from [[Hartford, Connecticut]], United States. In May 1974, Asian workers at the Imperial Typewriter Company in Leicester went on strike over unequal bonus payments and discrimination in promotion. The shop stewards committee and [[Transport &amp; General Workers Union]] branch refused their support, but the strikers stayed on strike for almost 14 weeks. The manufacture of typewriters ceased at Leicester and Hull in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/wbd641/EuropeImperial2.html|title=European Typewriters / Britain / Imperial 2|date=28 October 2009|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028062514/http://www.geocities.com/wbd641/EuropeImperial2.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8876">This is a list of '''[[Valmet]] products.''' The Valmet Corporation is a developer and supplier of technologies, [[automation system]]s and services for the pulp, paper and energy industries but Valmet’s history as an industrial operator stretches back over 200 years. This list concentrates mainly on the historical products while the new products are described in the main article.

== Historical Valmet products ==

=== Airplane industry ===
Valmet's airplane products came from [[Valtion lentokonetehdas]]. Valmet designed and made  [[Valmet L-70 Vinka]] and [[Aermacchi M-290 RediGO|Valmet L-90 Redigo]]. It also designed the [[Valmet Tuuli|Tuuli III]] and L-89 Turbovinha. It also had a license to make [[Fouga CM.170 Magister|Fouga Magister]], [[Saab 35 Draken|Saab Draken]] and [[BAE Systems Hawk|BAe Hawk]].

The products were later moved to Patria Finavitec Oy and [[Patria (company)|Patria]] company's Patria Aviation Oy.

==== Aerospace ====
Main tasks were the assembly and licence production of [[Fouga Magister]] trainers, [[Saab 35 Draken|Saab Draken]] fighters and [[BAE Hawk|BAe Hawk]] trainers. The [[Tampere]] factory was closed in the 1960s and main part of the aircraft factory became the facility at [[Kuorevesi]].

Domestically-designed aircraft included the Valmet Vihuri in the 1950s, the Valmet Vinka in the late 1970s and the Valmet Redigo in the mid-1980s.

A line of military [[trainer aircraft]] for the [[Finnish Air Force]] developed and manufactured by Valmet include the [[Valmet L-70 Vinka|L-70 Vinka]] and [[Valmet L-90 Redigo|L-90 Redigo]].

After the Finnish state privatized Valmet in 1996, the aviation division was detached and integrated into Finnish defense industries, [[Patria (company)|Patria]], as Patria Finavitec. The military part is mostly state-owned but EADS owns 27 per cent of Patria.

This period started with the assembly of [[F/A-18 Hornet]] fighter aircraft and NH90 helicopters. Civilian work increased in the form of participating in design and manufacture of parts for [[Airbus]] aircraft, most notably [[Airbus A380|A380]] spoilers.

=== Saab-Valmet ===
In 1968 Valmet and [[Saab Group|Saab]] started a company called Saab-Valmet. It had a car factory in [[Uusikaupunki]] and it produced mainly Saab cars. The factory is now [[Valmet Automotive]].

=== Paper mills ===
Valmet made [[paper mill]] machinery and [[process control]] equipment. ''Valtion tykkitehdas'' produced [[artillery]] pieces for the [[Finnish Army]] along with [[Tampella]] AB industries. After [[World War II]] production switched to paper mills.

[[Paper machine]]s production technology was made in Rautpohja fun factory by Uolevi Konttinen, Olavi Miekk-oja and a technician.  Unlike for many other gun factories it was easier for Valmet to change their products.  The first two paper machines were made for Metalexport to Poland in 1953.  In 1969 it made an agreement to make paper and cardboard machines with [[Tampella]] and [[Wärtsilä]].

Valmet concentrated to make paper machines for making paper for newspapers, magazines and bags. The companies had a common marketing organization.

Valmet first made [[tractor]]s for Finland. In the beginning of 1960's Valmet made a tractor factory to [[Brazil]] and later one in [[Tanzania]]. Valmet took over Volvo BM's tractor production in the 1980s. In 1994 Valmet sold the [[Valmet tractor|Valmet (tractor)]] to [[Sisu Auto]] which Partek bought in 1997. Partek came part of [[Kone]] in 2002. It sold the tractors to [[AGCO]] Corporation. The company makes tractors in [[Äänekoski|Äänekoski's]] [[Suolahti]] factory. In 2001 they took [[Valtra]] trademark into use. Originally Valtra was a product name of Valmet's products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4085">A '''major appliance''', or '''domestic appliance''', is a large [[machine]] in [[home appliance]] used for routine housekeeping tasks such as [[cooking]], washing [[laundry]], or [[food preservation]].  An appliance is different from a [[plumbing fixture]] because it uses electricity or fuel.

Major appliances differ from [[small appliance]]s because they are bigger and not portable.  They are often considered [[Fixture (property law)|fixture]]s and part of [[real estate]] and as such they are often supplied to tenants as part of otherwise unfurnished rental properties. Major appliances may have special electrical connections, connections to gas supplies, or special plumbing and ventilation arrangements that may be permanently connected to the appliance. This limits where they can be placed in a home.

Many major appliances are made of enamel-coated sheet steel which, in the middle 20th century, was usually white. The term '''white goods''' in contrast to [[brown goods]], is also used, primarily where [[British English]] is spoken, although definitions for the term "white goods" can differ. In the [[United States]], the term ''white goods'' can also refer to [[linens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/white%20goods " 'white goods' - Definition - Merriam-Webster"&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] ''[[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]] "whiteware" may be used, elsewhere a term from [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.govt.nz/energy-star-products/whiteware "Energy Star Products"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728220811/http://www.energystar.govt.nz/energy-star-products/whiteware |date=2012-07-28 }} ''[[Energy Star]].govt.nz''&lt;/ref&gt;
Since major appliances in a home consume a significant amount of energy, they have become the objectives of programs to improve their [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in many countries. Energy efficiency improvements may require changes in construction of the appliances, or improved control systems.

==Brands==
[[File:Cosmo Appliances Gas Range.jpg|thumbnail|A modern gas [[stove]]]]
In the early days of [[electrification]], many major consumer appliances were made by the same companies that made the generation and distribution equipment.{{cn|date=October 2016}} While some of these brand names persist to the present day, even if only as licensed use of old popular brand names, today many major appliances are manufactured by companies or divisions of companies that specialize particular appliances.

'''Marching lines''' are a pair of lines drawn on the glass of a [[compass]], and arranged at 45 degrees to each other. These are an essential component in hiking through the wilderness. Most modern compasses have adjustable luminous marching lines.

[[File:WatermelonBaller.JPG|thumb|A melon baller]]
'''Melon balls''' are balls of [[Melon#Culinary fruit|melon]] made using a melon baller that varies from around 1 centimeter to 3 centimeters (about 3/8 inch to 1 inch). They are generally used in [[fruit salad]].

==Melon ballers==
A '''melon baller''', formally called a Parisienne scoop, is a small spoon-like tool used to cut round- or oval-shaped sections of [[melon]], known as melon balls, by pressing them into the melon's flesh and rotating. It can also be used to cut other soft fruit and ice cream. The [[diameter]] of a melon baller's bowl varies from around 1 centimeter to 3 centimeters (about 3/8 inch to 1 inch), and it is typically made of [[stainless steel]] with a [[handle (grip)|handle]] of [[wood]], [[metal]], or hard [[plastic]]. Some varieties have the handle in the middle and a different-sized bowl on each end, and the bowl typically has a small hole in the middle to allow air and juice through. It is more commonly known as a prepping utensil. Melon ballers can be used for a variety of melons; like [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]], or [[Honeydew (melon)|honeydew]]. They typically are multifunctional utensils.

'''Michael Aldrich''' (22 August 1941 &amp;ndash; 19 May 2014) was an English inventor, innovator and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;2010 A. Hartley '20 Great British Inventors.Michael Aldrich 1941-' Msn News UK London 24/8/10 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/MSN%2020%20Great%20British%20Inventors%20-%20Michael%20Aldrich.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he invented [[online shopping]]&lt;ref&gt;2009 Tkacz,Ewaryst,Kapczynski,Adrian 'Internet Technical Development and Application ' Springer p255  {{ISBN|978-3-642-05018-3}}  'The first pilot system was installing in Tesco in the UK [first demonstrated in 1979 by Michael Aldrich]..&lt;/ref&gt; to enable online transaction processing between consumers and businesses,&lt;ref&gt;2013 BBC News Magazine:'British inventor of online shopping on his inspiration'. BBC videoclip of Michael Aldrich. 16 September 2013 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24109101]&lt;/ref&gt;  or between one business and another, a technique known later as [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;2011 I.Wallis ed '50 Best Business Ideas [of the last 50 years]' Crimson Publishing,p35  {{ISBN|978-1-85458-671-1}} 'Entrepreneur Michael Aldrich conceived the idea of e-commerce'&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980 he invented the Teleputer, a multi-purpose home infotainment centre that was a fusion of PC, TV and Telecom networking technologies. In 1981 he developed the concept of interactive broadband local loop [[cable TV]] for mass market consumer telecommunications.

Aldrich had a 38-year career in the [[Information technology|IT industry]], 20 years of which were spent as CEO of an international computer company, Redifon/[[Rediffusion]]/ROCC Computers. He retired as CEO in 2000 and became non-executive Chairman (2000-2014). He also worked for [[Honeywell]] (now [[Groupe Bull]]) and [[Burroughs Corporation]] (now [[Unisys]]).

Aside from his inventions and innovations, he is known for his pro bono public service. He was an IT adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 1981-86, IT adviser to the [[Confederation of British Industry]] January 1982-December 1983, President of the [[Institute of Information Scientists]] 1984-85, and Chairman of the [[Tavistock Institute of Human Relations]] 1989-99. He has had a long, formal association with the [[University of Brighton]] in various capacities since 1982.

==Personal life==
Michael Aldrich was born on 22 August 1941 in [[Welwyn Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. He went to school at [[Clapham College]] in London and, in 1959, he won a scholarship to the [[University of Hull]] to study History. He became engaged to Sandy Kay Hutchings, a student at Hull Art College, originally named [[Hull School of Art]], in 1960, and they married in 1962, just prior to his graduation. They had four children and were grandparents to eight grandchildren.&lt;ref name="aldricharchive.com"&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/biography.html  ''Biography, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aldrich spent 15 years with Honeywell and Burroughs in the UK in various sales and marketing roles, where he became known as an innovator, before joining the Board of Redifon in 1977.

In 1979, Aldrich invented online shopping by connecting a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line. The intellectual basis for his system was his view that [[videotex]], the modified domestic TV technology with a very simple menu-driven human–computer interface, was a 'new, universally applicable, participative communication medium-the first since the invention of the telephone.' This enabled 'closed' corporate information systems to be opened to 'outside' correspondents not just for transaction processing but also for messaging [e-mail] and information retrieval and dissemination [later known as [[e-business]].]&lt;ref&gt;1982 ''Videotex Communications, Collected Papers'' Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton December 1982 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/papers/1982/Videotex%20Communications%20Dec'82.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; His language of 'impacts competitive trading position', 'using IT for competitive advantage', 'externalises labour costs', etc. became commonplace in the management consultancy industry later in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;1982 ''Management Guide to IT,Collected Papers'' Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton January 1982 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/papers/1982/Management%20%20Guide%20to%20IT%20Jan'82.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas fed into the [[Business Process Reengineering]] strategies of the 1990s. His concept of information technology as a mass communications medium is a driver for the contemporary IT industry. His definition of the new mass communications medium as 'participative' [interactive, many-to-many] was fundamentally different to the traditional definitions of [[mass communication]] and [[mass media]] and a precursor to the social networking on the [[Internet]] 25 years later.

In March 1980 he launched Redifon's Office Revolution. The Revolution was that corporate computer information systems had hitherto been in-house.From hereon consumers, customers, agents, distributors,suppliers and service companies would be connected on-line to the corporate systems and business would be transacted electronically in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;1980 '' TV paves the way for Information Brokerage, Minicomputer News'' p. 12 London May 1980, the most comprehensive report of the March 1980 Press Conference launching the Redifon R 1800/50 computer system. Is 'Information Brokerage' aka 'browser industry'?[http://www.aldricharchive.com/cuttings/1980/ols%20may%2080.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;2011 M. Aldrich 'Online Shopping in the 1980s' IEEE 'Annals of the History of Computing' Vol 33 No4 pp57-61 October–December 2011 ISSN 1058-6180 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/anhc-33-4-anec-aldrich.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; he designed, manufactured, sold, installed, maintained and supported many online shopping systems, using videotex technology.&lt;ref&gt;1980 ''Checking on the check-outs, Financial Times'' London 12 July 1980 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/cuttings/1980/ols%20july%2080.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; These systems which also provided voice response and handprint processing pre-date the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]], the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], and [[Microsoft]] MS-DOS, and were installed mainly in the UK by large corporations.

In 1980 he invented a system he called the 'Teleputer' by connecting a modified 14-inch colour television to a plinth containing a [[Zilog]] Z80 microprocessor running a modified version of the [[CP/M]] operating system and a chip set containing a modem, character generator and auto-dialler. The Teleputer of 1980's operate as a stand-alone colour PC (at a time when computer screens were mainly mono-chromatic), with a full complement of application software and network with other computers via dial-up or leased lines.&lt;ref&gt;1981 Large.P''The Thing has arrived, and guess what- it's British teleputer, The Guardian'' London 30 September 1981 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/guardian%20and%20ft%20articles.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The system included two 360&amp;nbsp;KB floppy disks (later a 20&amp;nbsp;MB Hard disk), a keyboard and a printer. The name 'Teleputer' later became synonymous with the fusion of computers, telecommunications and television in a single device. There were plans to add video-disks which at the time, in prototype form, were 12&amp;nbsp;inches. In many ways the Teleputer was the first home media centre concept.&lt;ref&gt;1981 Price.P ''Living by Numbers, The Sunday Times Colour Supplement'', London 27 September 1981 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/living%20by%20numbers%20sunday%20times.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Teleputer had been conceived for mass market home use, it was put into production for business use with the TV tuner removed. There was no consumer electronics market for it (at the time the consumer electronics market was just waking up to the VCR) but it was relatively easy to cost-justify the Teleputer for business networking.&lt;ref&gt;1981 Charlish.G ''Enter the Teleputer, all purpose information tool, Financial Times'' London 2 October 1981 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/guardian%20and%20ft%20articles.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely used in the UK and, because a Cyrillic version was made, in the then USSR.

The Teleputer was often used with the Online Shopping systems. Most computer systems by their nature are transient but many of Aldrich's systems were transformative. A number were recorded for posterity and case studies have survived.&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneer Case Studies, Innovative Information Systems, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton, England [http://www.aldricharchive.com/pioneer_cs.html] and [http://www.aldricharchive.com/innovative_information.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first recorded Business-to-Business (B2B) Online Shopping system was [[Thomson Holidays]][1981]&lt;ref&gt;1988 Palmer.C ''Using IT for competitive advantage at Thomson Holidays, Long range Planning'' Vol 21 No.6 p26-29, Institute of Strategic Studies Journal,London- Pergamon Press [now Elsevier.B.V.] December 1988. Original story at [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/Thomson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first recorded Business-to-Consumer (B2C) online shopping system was [[Gateshead]] SIS/[[Tesco]][1984]&lt;ref&gt;1984''Videotex takes Gateshead Teleshopping into the home, The Incorporated Engineer'', Journal of the IEE September 1984 p.6 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/videotex%20takes%20gateshead.pdf] The original story can be found at [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/IM_Gateshead%20Council.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first recorded online home shopper was Mrs Jane Snowball, 72,&lt;ref&gt;2013 BBC News Magazine: 'Online Shopping: The pensioner who pioneered a home shopping revolution' Denise Winterman and Jon Kelly. 16 September 2013 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24091393]&lt;/ref&gt; of Gateshead, England in May 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Gateshead celebrates world's first online shopper'' and the Mrs Snowball interview can be found at [http://www.aldricharchive.com/Snowball.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gateshead system had an Online Shopping Basket [later renamed Online Shopping Trolley] invented by Aldrich's colleague John Phelan.&lt;ref&gt;2011 'John Phelan Application Developer and Project Manager' Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/pioneer_ref_rocc_john_phelan_.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most interesting{{According to whom|date=August 2010}} B2B applications in the surviving case studies were in the auto industry. [[Peugeot]]-Talbot (1981), then trading as Talbot Motors, installed a system for dealers to locate and adopt both a new car from the manufacturer or a used car from other dealers. [[Ford]] (1982) installed systems with ISPs in Brentwood England and Valencia Spain that permitted dealers in many European countries to buy new cars from Ford or transfer existing new cars from other dealers' lots. [[General Motors]][1985] used systems for selling truck spares. The [[Nissan]][1984] systems were truly revolutionary.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They combined car purchase by the dealer from the manufacturer (known in the industry as 'adoption') with car sale and financing to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;1988 ''Behind the driving wheel at NISSAN, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton, [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/NISSAN.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nissan systems networked credit ratings from outside agencies (mainly UAPT Infolink 1985)&lt;ref&gt;1985 ''Uapt/Infolink, Innovative Information Systems'' Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/INFOLINK.pdf] Summer 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and finance provision from either Nissan or other suppliers in real-time as part of the complete consumer purchasing transaction. This is the world's first recorded B2C online shopping for high value consumer durables and a model for the complex internet-based online shopping transactions for consumer durables that followed 20 years later. The Nissan system was copied by other credit rating and finance companies at the time but these systems appear to have been supplied by Aldrich's company under confidentiality agreements and no record is extant.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction,Innovative Information Systems,Aldrich Archive'' Para 9,University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/innovative_information.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich's systems directly changed the holiday, retail, auto, finance and credit ratings industries. Online shopping was an important development for [[electronic commerce]]. E-commerce changed the way the world does business. Both of his B2C systems in [[Gateshead]] and [[Bradford]] were shopping and information services. Bradford Centrepoint [1987] even ran a news service at one point. These systems were pioneering pre-internet systems.&lt;ref&gt;1993 Cahill.M ''Computer Technology and Human Services in the 1990s: Advancing Theory and Practice: Teleshopping and Social Services in the UK'', 'Computers in Human Services' Vol. 9 [3/4] London 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich's original intention had been to develop a consumer electronics market for IT systems linked to a concept for broadband interactive information processing and cable TV distribution. He had a particular schema for a wired community.&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich.M 'Videotex Key to the Wired City' Quiller Press London {{ISBN|0-907621-12-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He campaigned successfully to change the law in the UK to permit new cable TV technology.&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich.M co-author'Cable Systems'HMSO London {{ISBN|0-11-630821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich articulated and broadcast the ubiquitous business and social potential of his mass communications medium concept of IT and created systems to realise that dream, sold and installed them, and created satisfied clients. Well known in the 1980s in the UK, he was all but forgotten 20 years later. His ideas were copied, plagiarised and patented in the 1990s without acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Aldrich Archive, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/introduction.html]'None of the US Patents[ for online shopping and the online shopping trolley] mention Michael Aldrich, John Phelan or Redifon/Rediffusion/ROCC'&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomson Holidays reverse-engineered his system (the sincerest form of homage in the computer business)&lt;ref&gt;1989 Allan E. Altar 'The Great Chiefs of Europe-Colin Palmer' CIO Magazine, IDG UK February 1989 pp29-31&lt;/ref&gt; and in the peer-reviewed 1988 report used his language while virtually air-brushing his contribution. For online shopping he produced both the system and the business rationale for using it. The tie between his online shopping systems and the innovative information systems he created is the concept that videotex was a new, mass communications medium. That was the giant conceptual leap from the world of EDP to modern IT, emancipating computing from corporate information centres, and a precursor to the development of the Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows approaches to universal human/computer interface design for PCs and the Apple iPhone 3G. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The three areas of his work in consumer electronics—online shopping/Teleworking/Telebanking, Home Information Centres and broadband cable TV—and his book, papers and UK Government reports represent a significant contribution to the development of contemporary IT mass communications, consumer information and transaction systems, electronic commerce and e-business. Aldrich's ideas are the basis for Internet [[home shopping]].In June 2011 an ICM Poll in the UK voted Aldrich's date of birth as the 7th most important date in the history of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kelkoohistoryoftheinternet.co.uk/  2011 ICM Poll UK]&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2012 the UK Intellectual Property Office [formerly the UK Patents Office] nominated Aldrich for a public poll to identify the UK Visionary Innovator to celebrate World IP Day on 26 April. He came 4th in the Poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/wipd-2012/wipd-2012-innovators.htm  Visionary Innovators]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently gaps in the surviving records held at the Aldrich Library and it is likely that further information and illumination will be forthcoming in due course because of new academic and patent interest.

He was also an innovator in other areas of computer and information technology including large-scale data capture, mixed media scanning, minicomputer networking, voice response and handprint processing. He patented the world's first static signature recognition system in 1984. He founded ROCC Computers in 1984 after a management buy-out of Rediffusion Computers. The company traded mainly in the UK and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="aldricharchive.com"/&gt;

===High-profile IT projects===
In the 20 years from 1978 to 1998, Michael Aldrich and his team undertook many high-profile projects which in many ways created the company's reputation. A number of case studies have survived. It was not unusual for the times that there were high-profile IT projects; what was unusual was that a small UK IT company of 500–700 people became involved in high profile, high value, high risk and technically difficult projects. What is even more unusual is that there is no evidence to suggest that the projects were anything but very successful.
The first project for which evidence survives was to provide a system to automatically read handprinted timesheets for the nationalised railway, [[British Rail]] with over 100,000 employees, to complete the weekly payroll.[1978]. Regional centres were established throughout the UK. Scanners were used to read timesheets and for other applications. The systems were used for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/ocr%20and%20scanning%20British%20rail%201978.pdf 1978 ''British Rail, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest project was the Siberian Gas Pipeline for [[Gazprom]][1981-83] where 46 computer systems with 1200 terminals and 240 Teleputers were networked to provide logistics support for the operation of the pipeline. Every aspect of the project was fraught with difficulties,
including political, technical, environmental, technical support, economic and resourcing problems. Some 1500 Russian hardware and software specialists were trained. The system was the most advanced IT system then installed in the USSR. It was used for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/ussr.html ''USSR, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest European project was the [[Ford Europe]] system [1981-83] for dealers to locate and adopt a car, an online shopping system for dealers in the UK and much of Europe networking to systems based in the UK and Valencia, Spain. The system was used for nearly two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/Ford.pdf 1985 ''Ford, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest UK project, apart from the Inland Revenue [the UK IRS], was the pricing of over 334 million medical prescriptions per annum for the Prescription Pricing Authority[1981-83][now [[NHS Prescription Services]]], part of the UK's single provider health system.These systems were used throughout the UK for a decade or more. The most politically sensitive project was probably the cattle passport system for the [[British Cattle Movement Service]] to address the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]][mad cow disease] crisis in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;1988 ''British Cattle Movement Service, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton, [http://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/bcms.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There were hundreds of other projects.
The legacy of these projects is somewhat perverse. Leading-edge technology was seen to work well and to be reasonably easy to implement. It may have encouraged others to take risks that were not always justifiable. The 1990s onwards in the UK saw a succession of big, failed IT projects.

===Profession===
Michael Aldrich became a Fellow of the [[British Computer Society]] in 1984 and he was made a Chartered Fellow in 2004. In 1986 he was invited to become a Companion of the [[Chartered Management Institute]], the UK's elite management leadership organization. He is an Honorary Fellow of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]]. In 2002 he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Brighton for services to Information Technology.
Michael Aldrich was invited to address an invited audience including British Royalty on 23 March 1983 in Edinburgh, Scotland to mark the 25th Anniversary of the founding of the British Computer Society.&lt;ref&gt;1983 ''HRH Duke of Kent etc,'Computing', Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton 14 April 1983 [http://www.aldricharchive.com/cuttings/1983/teleputers%20apr%2083.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was titled 'Computers in the Community.'&lt;ref&gt;1983 ''Computers in the Community,Aldrich Archive'',February 1983 University of Brighton, [http://www.aldricharchive.com/papers/1983/Computers%20In%20The%20Community%20Feb'83.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987 Michael Aldrich was made a Freeman of the City of London,England. He became a Founder Member of the Company of Information Technologists which became a Chartered City Livery in 1992. The Company's membership consists of senior IT professionals.He is a Liveryman of the [[Worshipful Company of Information Technologists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/biography.html ''Biography, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information Technology Advisory Panel 1981–86===
In 1981, at the beginning of the IT age, the British Government assembled a team of six UK IT experts, on a ''pro bono'' basis, to provide high-level advice to the government. This team was known as the Information Technology Advisory Panel. It reported to Prime Minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and was located in the Cabinet Office adjacent to 10 Downing Street in London, England. In its five-year existence it produced three reports for publication by the government. Little else is known about its activities.
Michael Aldrich was a member of the team for the whole term of its existence. He wrote a seminal paper on re-cabling the UK with local loop broadband cable and paying for it without government subsidy by distributing cable television alongside data and telephone services.&lt;ref&gt;1981 Aldrich.M. ''The Original Discussion Paper, Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/original_discussion.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The panel then wrote a report, published it and the government subsequently changed the law to legalise such systems.&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich M.co-author ''Cable Systems'',London- HMSO 1982 {{ISBN|0-11-630821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, 12 million UK homes were passed by these high-speed broadband links.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Aldrich M. ''Cable Story,Aldrich Archive'', University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The second report concerned the emerging software and information business and, among other issues, identified the potential power of providers who might control both content and electronic delivery.&lt;ref&gt;1983 Aldrich M. co-author ''Making a Business of Information'' London- HMSO 1983ISBN 011 6308249&lt;/ref&gt;  The third report was a long-range forecast of the potential effects of IT on schools and teaching and it predicted powerful PCs on school desks.&lt;ref&gt;1986 Aldrich M. co-author ''Learning to Live with IT'', London- HMSO 1986 {{ISBN|0-11-630831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel was disbanded in 1986.

===Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 1989-99===
Michael Aldrich became a member of the Council of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations[TIHR] in 1988 and was elected Chairman in 1989, a post he held for a decade. TIHR was then located at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] hospital in Hampstead, London, England. The TIHR was spun out of the Tavistock Clinic as a charity in 1947. The Tavistock Clinic is a centre of excellence for studying and addressing the clinical behaviour of individuals. The TIHR is focussed on group behaviour.
In 1988 the TIHR had an illustrious history at the forefront of the social and psychological
sciences but was somewhat in the shadows of the world-famous founding fathers who had once worked there or indeed were still working there. These people were approaching retirement and
the TIHR needed to renew itself. The transition of the TIHR was to take nearly two decades.
The 1989-99 period was characterised by the physical relocation of the TIHR from the Tavistock Clinic in Hampstead to its own building in London's City financial district; the stabilisation of the Institute's finances;the 50th Anniversary[1997] celebration that saluted the past achievements while embracing future challenges; the publication of the Tavistock Anthology&lt;ref&gt;'The Social Engagement of Social Sciences, A Tavistock Anthology' Vols 1-3 Trist.E, Emery.F and Murray.H, University of Pennsylvania Press 1990-97 {{ISBN|0-8122-8194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which served to draw an elegant line under the TIHR's previous achievements; and the development of new lines of research by a talented younger team.
Michael Aldrich left the Council in 1999. He remains a member of the Tavistock Association.

===University of Brighton===
Michael Aldrich first became involved with the then Brighton Polytechnic in 1977 when he was sponsoring student employees for degrees in electronic engineering and computer science. Under the sponsorship, employees were paid to attend college full-time for degrees. In 1982 he joined the governing body of the college, became Chairman and then Founding Chairman of the University of Brighton. In all he served 17 years on the governing body of the institution, 11 years as Chairman[1987-1998]. He retired from the Board of Governors in 1999. In 1990 he was responsible for appointing Professor [later Sir] David Watson as the first Vice-Chancellor[1990-2005]. A particularly talented leadership team developed the new university and for 1999 the University was declared 'University of the Year' by the London 'Sunday Times' newspaper. In 1992, Aldrich became Founding Chairman of the University's Foundation a fundraising body. The Aldrich family has been a longtime benefactor of the University. In 1995 Michael and wife Sandy began the Aldrich Collection of Contemporary Art which, by 2009, had grown to more than 300 works dating back over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Selected Works:The Aldrich Collection at the University of Brighton, ed Miles.B,2000. {{oclc|319718969}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The works have been created mainly by former students and artist professors at the University's highly rated Faculty of Art.&lt;ref&gt;'The Aldrich Collection' Jonathan M Woodham, Art and Design in Brighton 1859-2009, the University of Brighton Centre for Research and Development 2009, pp 387-393 {{ISBN|978-1-905593-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works are also held in web-accessible digitised form to provide a permanent virtual gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/aldrich  Aldrich Collection Faculty of Art University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the University named its new business, bio-sciences, engineering and technology library the 'Aldrich Library.'  In 2002 Aldrich relinquished the chairmanship of the Foundation and remained a Trustee. In 2008, Michael Aldrich agreed to donate his IT papers for the period 1977-2000, the Aldrich Archive, to the University for teaching, learning, scholarship and research. Much of the first part of the archive which relates to technology and events has been digitised and is web-accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/index.html Michael Aldrich Archive,University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of the archive project was launched in 2010. It will gather and digitise material relating to the people who built and used the systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2010/100304aldrich_archive.php?PageID=8100  2010 University of Brighton News Release, 4 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 the University of Brighton Business School announced that it would be using the Aldrich Archive for teaching and research.A  Michael Aldrich Prize would be awarded to the outstanding e-commerce student on merit each year.&lt;ref&gt;2010 'Getting down to Business with the help of the Aldrich Archive' University of Brighton [http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2010/101110aldrich_archive.php?PageId=810]&lt;/ref&gt; The first awards were made in the Summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldricharchive.com/michael_aldrich_prize.html  The Michael Aldrich Prize, University of Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich died on 19 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/announcements/deaths/obituary/11236944.Michael_ALDRICH/ | title=Michael Aldrich | newspaper=The Argus | date=27 May 2014 | accessdate=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micromachines''' are [[mechanics|mechanical]] objects that are [[fabrication (semiconductor)|fabricated]] in the same general manner as [[integrated circuits]].  They are generally considered to be between 100 [[nanometre]]s to 100 [[micrometre]]s in size, though that is debatable. The applications of micromachines include [[accelerometer]]s that detect when a [[automobile|car]] has hit an object and trigger an [[airbag]]. Complex systems of [[gear]]s and [[lever]]s are another application.

==Fabrication==
The fabrication of these devices is usually done by two techniques, [[surface micromachining]] and [[bulk micromachining]]. To do bulk micromachining, the region needed is highly doped with boron and the unwanted silicon is etched in liquid silicon etches.  This technique is termed an etchstop as the doping of boron produces an unetchable layer/pattern.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techneglas.com/dopantpages/etch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transducers==
Most micromachines act as [[transducer]]s; in other words, they are either [[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s.

Sensors convert information from the environment into interpretable electrical signals. One example of a micromachine sensor is a resonant chemical sensor. A lightly damped mechanical object vibrates much more at one frequency than any other, and this frequency is called its resonance frequency. A chemical sensor is coated with a special [[polymer]] that attracts certain [[molecule]]s, such as those found in [[anthrax]], and when those molecules attach to the sensor, its [[mass]] increases. The increased mass alters the resonance frequency of the mechanical object, which is detected with circuitry.

Actuators convert electrical signals and energy into motion of some kind. The three most common types of actuators are [[electrostatics|electrostatic]], [[thermal]], and [[magnetism|magnetic]]. Electrostatic actuators use the force of electrostatic energy to move objects. Two mechanical elements, one that is stationary (the [[stator]]) and one that is movable (the [[rotor (electric)|rotor]]) have two different voltages applied to them, which creates an [[electric field]]. The field competes with a restoring force on the rotor (usually a spring force produced by the bending or stretching of the rotor) to move the rotor. The greater the electric field, the farther the rotor will move. Thermal actuators use the force of thermal expansion to move objects. When a material is heated, it expands an amount depending on material properties. Two objects can be connected in such a way that one object is heated more than the other and expands more, and this imbalance creates motion. The direction of motion depends on the connection between the objects.
This is seen in a "heatuator", which is a U-shaped beam with one wide arm and one narrow arm. When a current is passed through the object, heat is created. The narrow arm is heated more than the wide arm because they have the same current density. Since the two arms are connected at the top, the stretching hot arm pushes in the direction of the cold arm. Magnetic actuators used fabricated magnetic layers to create forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Microthermoforming''' is the abbreviation for [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] or microscale [[thermoforming]], or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or [[microstructure]] products. Microstructure products means products that have structures in the [[micrometre]] range and have their technical function provided by the shape of the microstructure [1]. Thermoforming [2] in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro [[injection moulding]] or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.

Moulds for polymer microreplication in general and in particular for microthermoforming can be fabricated by various methods such as mechanical micromachining, lithographic based methods in combination with electroplating (see also the so-called '[[LIGA]]' process) and wet or dry etching. And they can be fabricated of various materials such as metal, silicon and glass.

== State of the art ==
For several years now, at [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), a pressure or high pressure (thermo)forming process is used to fabricate film microchips for [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) [3–5] and for three-dimensional cell cultivation [6–8]. The process is derived from the macroscopic trapped sheet forming process [2]. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as [[polycaprolactone]] (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.

First examples of processes coming near to something that could be called 'microthermoforming' originate from the second half of the nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated [9]. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated [10]. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. [[elastomeric]] material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called 'rubber-assisted hot embossing process' [11].

== Features and applications ==
The microthermoforming process including its products can have all the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the thermoformed microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. Thermoformed e.g. [[microfluidic]] structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly in the range of a few micrometers. Specific properties of thermoformed microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications.

Compared to the other microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, modifications of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercuts]]. Thus, e.g. thermoformed chips for three-dimensional cell cultivation can be provided with pores, cell adhesion patterns [6–8], surface topologies and electrodes [12].

Future application fields for microthermoforming are expected to be

* generally life sciences, e.g. flexible film microchips such as [[µTAS]] (Micro Total Analysis Systems) and LOC ([[Lab-on-a-chip]]) devices, possibly in continuous format and combined with polytronic circuits, also as human implants
* especially [[tissue engineering]], e.g. film substrates or scaffolds for three-dimensional cell cultivation in fundamental research, medical diagnosis, pharmaceutical active substance research, and clinical research and therapy, particularly if integrated in standard laboratory platforms such as petri dishes and microtitre plates
* micropackaging, e.g. micro sensor and actuator housings or caps
* [[smart textiles]] etc.

{{Politics of Iran}}

The '''Ministry of Information and Communications Technology''' , or '''Ministry of ICT'''  ({{lang-fa|وزارت ارتباطات و فناوری اطلاعات}}) established in 1908, is responsible for [[Mail|postal services]], telephones and [[information technology]] in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].

Laying out and implementing policies pertaining to post and communications are among the functions of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, which is also in charge of issuing import licenses for certain communication apparatus and parts thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310232210/http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Post in Iran was in the form of "Bureau" before 1876 and all postal affairs have been done by this Bureau. Because of some success in that year, the "Bureau" was changed to the Ministry by the command of Naser-aldin Shah. By this command, Amin-almolk, the Minister of tasks and council, was elected for executing this ministry. After a year, in 1877, he resigned the Ministry of tasks and council to have more time for supervising the affairs of the new ministry. During the following years, this ministry was executed by Amin-almolk, as the minister and Mirza Rahim as the deputy.
In 1882, a lithographed booklet named "the Tariff of the Great Post Office of Iran" was published. There were some maps from all of the telegram offices, post offices, pony post roads and post network in that time in this booklet. According to the content of the booklet, in Iran there were 7 main and 5 secondary post lines.
After this year, it seems to have no major revision in that Bureau or Ministry of the Post but in its organizational and structural form. After the presidency of Amir Kabir, new revolutions appeared in the post of Iran. The posts of the Imperialists" activities were in suspension and the postmen did the post affairs fast and accurate according to the Amir"s discipline. 
Post attained a new organization in 1906. Telegraph bureau was attached to the Post and the Ministry of Post and Telegraph formed. The first telephone patent assigned to Basir-ol-mamalek in 1900 and thus telephone worked in Tehran. In 1929, the Ministry of Post and Telegraph offered a proposal to the parliament for purchasing the stocks of Telephone Company. Then the Ministry of Post and Telegraph and Telephone was formed by pronouncing the permission and purchasing the stocks of Telephone Company in the end of ………, 
After this year multilateral development had been done in this ministry till 2003. There were several subsidiary company and center which developed many evolutions and spread the communication situations by their ability and activity in post and telecommunication fields.  
Simultaneous with passing the Bill of duties and responsibilities and renaming the ministry from "Ministry of P.T.T" to "Ministry of I.C.T" in 2003 by the parliament, and according to the structural reform of T.C.I, the new collection of laws, tasks and authorizations of this ministry was codified.
Thus 3 companies: Data Communication Company - renamed to I.C.T in 2005- T.I.C and M.C.I were established beside T.C.I.
Some of the evolutions are establishing T.C.I and I.R.I Post Company as well as organizing two organizations named I.S.A and C.R.A, and also establishing two councils named "High Council of IT" and "Space Council". 

Ministers of the Revolution

1.    Dr. Mohammad Eslami: He worked as the Minister of P.T.T in the transitional government.
2.    Dr. Seyed Mahmoud Ghandi: He was appointed the dean of the Telecommunication College and then as the Minister of PTT by the council of the revolution.On 28.6.1981, he and 72 other officials were martyred at the Islamic Republic Party Central Office by an assassins attack.
3.    Seyed Morteza Nabavi: He was appointed the Financial – Administrative Deputy of the Telecommunications Company of Iran in 1980 and then as the Minister of P.T.T.
4.    Seyed Mohammad Gharazi: At 1981 he was appointed as the Minister of Petroleum and from 1985 to 1997 as the Minister of P.T.T.
5.    Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref: From 1997 to 2000 he was the Minister of P.T.T.
6.    Nasr-o-allah Jahangard: He was the supervisor of the Ministry of P.T.T from June to September of 2000.
7.    Dr. Seyed Abdollah Mirtaheri: He was appointed as the supervisor of the Ministry of P.T.T. from September 2000 to January 2001.
8.    Dr. Seyed Ahmad Motamedi: He was appointed as the Minister of I.C.T from January 2001 to September 2005.
9.    Dr. Mohammad Soleimani: He was the Minister of I.C.T from September 2005 to September 2009.
10.    Reza Taghipour: From September 2009 to……..

'''Mixlink''' (Mixlink II) is a computer used with [[Agfa]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Mixture - MIXLINK taken over from Agfa|url=http://www.scanningresources.com/archive.php?lang=en&amp;detail=13|accessdate=26 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to facilitate calculation of color mixes.

==Technical characteristics==
Mixlink contains the [[Intel 80386]] processor with the [[clock rate]] which may be set to either 9.2 or 33&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[RAM]] size is 640 kB. The [[Hard disk drive|HDD]] function is served by the built-in flash memory that has the size of approximately 800 kB. Mixlink has the monochrome [[display device|display]].

Mixlink is also staffed with [[CD drive]] and [[floppy drive]].

==Use==

Mixlink was intended to be used with the supplied [[floppy disk|floppy]] and [[Compact Disc|CD disk]], which provided the system environment ("operating system") and the application to be used for calculating color mixes. However, it is possible to install and run [[MS-DOS]] on Mixlink.

Currently, Mixlink computers are not used; their functions may solely be performed by [[Personal computer|personal computers (PCs)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">The '''modulation error ratio''' or '''MER''' is a measure used to quantify the performance of a [[digital radio]] (or digital TV) transmitter or receiver in a communications system using [[digital modulation]] (such as [[quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]). A signal sent by an ideal transmitter or received by a receiver would have all [[Constellation diagram|constellation points]] precisely at the ideal locations, however various imperfections in the implementation (such as [[Noise (electronic)|noise]], low [[image rejection ratio]], [[phase noise]], [[carrier suppression]], [[distortion]], etc.) or signal path cause the actual constellation points to deviate from the ideal locations. 

Transmitter MER can be measured by specialised equipment, which [[demodulation|demodulates]] the received signal in a similar way to how a real radio demodulator does it. Demodulated and detected signal can be used as a reasonably reliable estimate for the ideal transmitted signal in MER calculation.

== Definition ==
An '''error vector''' is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] in the I-Q plane between the ideal constellation point and the point received by the receiver. The Euclidean distance between the two points is its magnitude.

The modulation error ratio is equal to the ratio of the [[root mean square]] (RMS) power (in Watts) of the reference vector to the power (in Watts) of the error. It is defined in [[Decibel|dB]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{MER (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( {P_\mathrm{signal} \over P_\mathrm{error}}  \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;error&lt;/sub&gt; is the RMS power of the error vector, and P&lt;sub&gt;signal&lt;/sub&gt; is the RMS power of ideal transmitted signal.

MER is defined as a [[percentage]] in a compatible (but reciprocal) way:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{MER (\%)} = \sqrt{ {P_\mathrm{error} \over P_\mathrm{signal}} } \times 100\%
&lt;/math&gt;

with the same definitions.

MER is closely related to [[error vector magnitude]] (EVM), but MER is calculated from the average power of the signal. MER is also closely related to [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. MER includes all imperfections including deterministic [[amplitude imbalance]], [[quadrature error]] and [[distortion]], while noise is random by nature.

A '''monoblock''' (or '''monobloc''') '''LNB''' is a type of [[low-noise block downconverter]] used in [[communications satellite]] reception, this dual LNB is the simplest solution to achieve multifeed reception for two satellites.

This design consists of two independent LNBs in a single case. The two LNBs can be automatically addressed with any [[DiSEqC]] 1.0 or higher receiver. In some cases, they can also be addressed with ToneBurst/MiniDiSEqC. However, they are only available for satellites with a fixed 3 degree, 4.3° or 6° spacing. In [[Europe]], for example, there are monoblock single, twin and quad LNBs for the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]], which have a pre-defined spacing of 6 degrees (for [[Astra 19.2°E]]/[[Hot Bird 13°E]]). 

In March 2007, a new type of monoblock, called the [[Duo LNB]] was introduced by [[CanalDigitaal]] in the [[Netherlands]] for the simultaneous reception of  [[Astra 19.2°E]]/[[Astra 23.5°E]] with a spacing of just 4.3 degrees. Unlike most other monoblocks, the Duo LNB was intended for use with 60&amp;nbsp;cm dishes (most monoblocks require a larger, 80&amp;nbsp;cm or 1&amp;nbsp;m dish). The Duo LNB is available in twin and quad versions.

'''National Payments Corporation of India''' (NPCI, {{lang-hi|भारतीय राष्ट्रीय भुगतान निगम}}) is an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India.

==Organisation==
Founded in 2008, NPCI is a not-for-profit organisation registered under section 8 of the [[Companies Act 2013]]. The organisation is owned by
a consortium of major banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watal Report, December 2016|url=http://finmin.nic.in/reports/watal_report271216.pdf|website=Ministry of Finance|publisher=Ministry of Finance|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been promoted by the country's central bank, the [[Reserve Bank of India]].

[[File:Oxygen Plasma Cleaning.JPG|thumb|Fig. 1. The surface of a [[MEMS]] device is cleaned with bright, blue oxygen plasma in a [[Plasma etching|plasma etcher]] to rid it of carbon contaminants. (100mTorr, 50W RF)]]

'''Plasma cleaning''' is the removal of impurities and contaminants from surfaces through the use of an energetic [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD) plasma created from gaseous species. Gases such as [[argon]] and [[oxygen]], as well as mixtures such as air and hydrogen/nitrogen are used. The plasma is created by using high frequency voltages (typically kHz to &gt;MHz) to ionise the low pressure gas (typically around 1/1000 atmospheric pressure), although atmospheric pressure plasmas are now also common.&lt;ref name="Shun'ko"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evgeny V.

==Methods==
In plasma, gas atoms are excited to higher energy states and also ionized. As the atoms and molecules 'relax' to their normal, lower energy states they release a photon of light, this results in the characteristic “glow” or light associated with plasma. Different gases give different colors. For example, oxygen plasma emits a light blue color.

A plasma’s activated species include [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], metastables, and [[photons]] in the short wave ultraviolet (vacuum UV, or VUV for short) range. This 'soup', which incidentally is around room temperature, then interacts with any surface placed in the plasma.

If the gas used is oxygen, the plasma is an effective, economical, environmentally safe method for critical cleaning. The VUV energy is very effective in the breaking of most organic bonds (i.e., C–H, C–C, C=C, C–O, and C–N) of surface contaminants. This helps to break apart high molecular weight contaminants. A second cleaning action is carried out by the oxygen species created in the plasma (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, O, O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, ionised ozone, metastable excited oxygen, and free electrons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Adhesive Technology, Revised and Expanded|date=2003|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0824709860|page=1036|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYbHqiapRjsC|author=A. Pizzi|edition=2, illustrated, revised|author2=K. L. Mittal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species react with organic contaminants to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. These compounds have relatively high [[vapor pressure]]s and are evacuated from the chamber during processing. The resulting surface is ultra-clean. In Fig. 2, a relative content of carbon over material depth is shown before and after cleaning with excited oxygen &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:ShunkoDBDFig6.tif|thumb|Fig. 2. Content of carbon over material depth z: before a sample treatment - diamond points and after the treatment during 1 s. - square points]]

If the part to be treated consists of easily oxidized materials such as silver or copper, inert gases such as argon or helium are used instead. The plasma activated atoms and ions behave like a molecular sandblast and can break down organic contaminants. These contaminants are again vapourised and evacuated from the chamber during processing.

Most of these by-products are small quantities of gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor with trace amounts of carbon monoxide and other hydrocarbons.

Whether or not organic removal is complete can be assessed with [[contact angle]] measurements. When an organic contaminant is present, the [[contact angle]] of water with the device will be high. After the removal of the contaminant, the [[contact angle]] will be reduced to that characteristic of contact with the pure substrate.

If a surface to be treated is coated with a patterned conductive layer (metal, [[indium tin oxide|ITO]]) deposited on it, treatment by a direct contact with plasma (capable for contraction to microarcs) could be destructive. In this case, cleaning by neutral atoms excited in plasma to metastable state can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evgeny V. Shun’ko |author2=Veniamin V. Belkin |last-author-amp=yes|title=Treatment Surfaces with Atomic Oxygen Excited in Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Admixed to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal= AIP Advances|volume= 2 |issue= |pages= 022157-24|doi=10.1063/1.4732120|bibcode= 2012AIPA....2b2157S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the same applications to surfaces of glass samples coated with [[chromium|Cr]] and [[indium tin oxide|ITO]] layers are shown in Fig. 3.

[[File:ContactAngleWaterWiki.tif|thumb|Fig. 3. Contact Angle of Water Droplet of 5 ''μ''l on glass coated with different materials.]]
After treatment, the [[contact angle]] of a water droplet is decreased becoming less than its value on the untreated surface. In Fig. 4, the relaxation curve for droplet footprint is shown for glass sample. A photograph of the same droplet on the untreated surface is shown in Fig. 4 inset. Surface relaxation time corresponding to a data shown in Fig. 4 is about 4 hours.

Plasma ashing is the process in which plasma cleaning is performed for the sole purpose of removing carbon. Plasma ashing is always done with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;ref&gt;Plasma Treatment Basics - http://www.plasmaetch.com/plasma-treatment-basics.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2561">'''Rodrig Goliescu''' (1882–1942) was a [[Romania]]n [[inventor]], [[engineer]], and [[Lieutenant]], who built the ''avioplan'', the first [[airplane]] with a tubular [[fuselage]].The model, with a length of 1.2 m was successfully tested in 1909, having a take off angle of 30 degrees. The originality of this aircraft was the shape of the fuselage, designed for minimum drag and acting as a tube fan, similar to the way the modern vertical take off aircraft and helicopters are designed. This shape reduced drag and increased the efficiency of the propeller. Helped by the Minister of Education, [[Spiru Haret]], who also helped [[Aurel Vlaicu]], in 1909 he went to France to acquire an engine for his aircraft. In Paris he sent a survey "Laws of air dynamics" to the French Academy, study that was published in "La France automobile et aérienne" magazine, on 15 May 1909. Goliescu patented his invention in France (patent no. 402329). In the same year he learned to fly and he built an updated version of his aircraft, this time in full size. The aircraft had a half cylinder fuselage, but still the air from the propeller flowed through as in the first model. He flies with his aircraft for the first time, in November 1909, on Juvisy airfield, near Paris, and he reaches an altitude of about 50 m. It was for the first time to fly an aircraft with a tubed propeller.

After his flights, only in 1932, the Italian engineer Luigi Stipa will build an aircraft with a "barrel fuselage" under the name of [[Stipa-Caproni]] but the concept will reach its dedication after the Second World War, being successfully implemented in helicopters like SA-365 [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]], [[RAH-66 Comanche]] or the new [[X-35]] fighter.

Between 1932 and 1936, he flight tested his "Aviocoleopter", the first [[vertical take-off and landing]] aircraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">A '''roll-away computer''' is an idea introduced as part of a series by [[Toshiba]] in 2000, which aimed to predict the trends in personal computing five years into the future. Since its announcement, the roll-away computer has remained a theoretical device.

A roll-away computer is a computer with a [[Flexible display|flexible]] [[polymer]]-based display technology, measuring 1 [[Millimetre|mm]] thick and weighing around 200 grams.{{citation needed|reason=This sounds terrifically specific; where do these numbers come from?|date=May 2015}}

The first one is the [[Toshiba DynaSheet]], named in homage to the [[Dynabook]], an influential 1970s vision of the future of computers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The Dynasheet will feature wireless Gigabit Ethernet for LAN environments as well as 4 Mbit/s [[Bluetooth]]-V and [[UMTS]]-3 connectivity for mobile roaming in most of the countries of the world.

Flexible and [[rollable display]]s started entering the market in 2006 (see [[electronic paper]]).

The R&amp;D department of Seiko Epson has demonstrated a flexible active-matrix LCD panel (including the pixel thin film transistors and the peripheral TFT drivers), a flexible active-matrix OLED panel, the world's first flexible 8-bit [[Asynchronous_circuit#Asynchronous_CPU|asynchronous CPU]] (ACT11)&lt;ref&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was an Italian [[polymath]], regarded as the epitome of the "Renaissance Man", displaying skills in numerous diverse areas of study. Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].

While the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, he was, during his lifetime, employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the parachute, an improved version of the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]] &lt;ref&gt;P. Innocenzi, The innovators behind Leonardo. The true story of the scientific and technological Renaissance. Springer, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).

Leonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent [[Renaissance Humanism]].

==Condensed biography==
{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}
[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]

:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.&lt;!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science---&gt;

Leonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.

His curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a flying machine.

In 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].

Among the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the ''[[Annunciation]]'' show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.

Leonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.

==Approach to scientific investigation==
[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a fœtus from Leonardo's journals]]
[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]

During the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.

As a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.

A recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by [[Fritjof Capra]] argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leonardo's notes and journals==

Leonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.

On his death, his writings were left mainly to his pupil Melzi with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. This did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.

==Publication==

Leonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''De divina proportione'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or "Books", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.

These pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.&lt;ref name=JPR&gt;''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}.[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo] (accessed 2007-02-04)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: ‘I will not write this because I wrote it before.’ And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.&lt;ref name= JPR/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Natural science==

===Light===
Leonardo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]

For an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.

At the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.
In the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.

Leonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.

===Human anatomy===
Leonardo wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]

====Topographic anatomy====
Leonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.
[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]
If, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.

In the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil Melzi.

In conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as "caricatures", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.

====Dissection====
[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]
As Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the hospital Santa Maria Nuova in [[Florence]]. Later he dissected in [[Milan]] at the hospital Maggiore and in [[Rome]] at the hospital Santo Spirito (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Treatise on painting]]''.
[[File:The Principle Organs and Vascular and Urino-Genital Systems of a Woman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body.]]
Among the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.

Leonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.

Leonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.

Leonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]] as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said "Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body - its structure and function - that perhaps has been overlooked by some."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman &lt;small&gt;(See left)&lt;/small&gt; reveal many traditional misconceptions.&lt;ref name=MK&gt;Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.

===Comparative anatomy===
[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]
Leonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of Francesco Sforza. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several diagrams of a standing horse with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.

He studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.
Other drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.

===Botany===
Leonardo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.

[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]

One such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.

Apart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].

A number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.

The plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' demonstrate the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.

===Geology===
[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]

As an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven "by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within."

Leonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno Valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.

It had been observed for many years that strata in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.

[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]

&lt;blockquote&gt;And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].

In Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the Annunciation paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical [[stratum|strata]]. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.&lt;ref&gt;The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says "Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them." In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartography===
[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]
In the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.

Recent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo’s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo’s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]
Leonardo wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.

Many of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.

There are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.

Leonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.

===Astronomy===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The earth is not in the centre of the Sun’s orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=4AK9996_-Y8C&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;pg=RA1-PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Da Vinci's notebooks] on [[astronomy]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Alchemy===
Claims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending paint pigment. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with the ''Last Supper'' deteriorating within a century, and the ''Battle of Anghiari'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.

Leonardo said about alchemists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quicksilver" is an old name for mercury.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind."''&lt;ref name=Notebooks&gt;Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci - Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mathematical studies==

===Perspective===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.&lt;ref name=JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of linear perspective. In 1436 Alberti published ''"della Pittura"'' ("On Painting"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of [[linear perspective]]. [[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|280px|Draft of the perspective for ''Adoration of the Magi'']]

Leonardo studied [[linear perspective]] and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.

The unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a "perspective" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.&lt;ref name=JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Geometry===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''De divina proportione''.]]

While in Milan in 1496 Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,&lt;ref&gt;[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''"De divina proportione"'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''"De divina proportione"'' was published in 1509.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of mathematicians, which are:—the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.&lt;ref name=JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Engineering and invention==
[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''  says of Leonardo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines&lt;!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --&gt; and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Practical inventions and projects===
[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]
Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles. He utilized [[lever]]age and [[cantilever]]ing, [[pulley]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], [[gear]]s, including angle [[gears]] and [[rack and pinion]] gears; [[Watt's linkage|parallel linkage]], [[lubrication]] systems and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons]]' Laws of Friction by 150 years.&lt;ref name= NW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.

As an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.&lt;ref name=JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bridges and Hydraulics===
[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]
Leonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.

In 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&amp;nbsp;m (720&amp;nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebjørn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].

===War machines===
[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]
Leonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines "designed to fail" | date=December 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.

[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]

Leonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed "to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion." He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The "fan type" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.

Leonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&amp;nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 199"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&amp;feature=BF&amp;list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&amp;index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.

===Flight===
[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]
In Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic.

&lt;blockquote&gt;An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.&lt;ref name= JPR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]

The desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.&lt;ref&gt;Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.

One design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].&lt;ref name="leonardodavincisinventions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &amp;#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&amp;#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical instrument===
{{Main|Viola organista}}
The viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.

Leonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488–1489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.

==Leonardo's inventions made reality==
[[File:Leonardo flying machine.JPG|thumb|Model of a flying machine by Leonardo in the V&amp;A museum]]

In the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for flying machines.

A difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in [[France]], do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.

A '''secret decoder ring''' (or '''secret decoder''') is a device which allows one to decode a simple [[substitution cipher]] - or to encrypt a message by working in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As inexpensive toys, they have been often used as promotional items by retailers, radio and television programs from the 1930s through to the current day.
Decoders, whether badges or rings, are a fun way for children to tap into a common fascination with [[encryption]], [[cipher]]s, and [[Cryptography|secret codes]], and are used to send hidden messages back and forth to one another.

==History==
Secret decoders are generally circular scales, descendants of the [[cipher disk]] developed in the 15th century by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Rather than the complex polyalphabetic [[Alberti cipher]] method, the decoders for children invariably use simple [[Caesar cipher]] substitutions.

The most well-known example started in 1934 with the [[Ovaltine]] company's sponsored radio program ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio)|Little Orphan Annie]]''.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;[http://www.mwotrc.com/rr2005_08/decoders.htm CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT AND DECODER RINGS], Stephen A. Kallis, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; The fan club's member's handbook included a simple substitution cipher with a resulting numeric cipher text. This was followed the next year with a membership badge or pin that included a cipher disk - enciphering the letters A-Z to numbers 1-26. Similar badges and pocket decoders continued with the ''[[Captain Midnight]]'' radio and television programs.

None of these early decoders were in the form of [[Ring (jewellery)|finger rings]], but "secret compartment" rings were common radio program premiums&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; and in the early 1960s secret decoder rings appeared - notably in conjunction with the ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'' television program sponsored by [[PF Flyers|PF Shoes]]. A later, less ornate, decoder ring was offered by Kix Cereals. and the men's magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' offered a [[Captain Jet]] Decoder Ring{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}- and in 2000 Ovaltine offered a Secret Decoder Ring to be worn on the finger which used their traditional A-Z to 1-26 scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~jrolsen2/premiums/ovaltine.html The Ovaltine "Secret Decoder Ring"], John Olsen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messages==
Ovaltine and other companies that marketed early decoders to children often included "secret messages" on their [[radio]] shows aimed at children. These could be decoded for a preview of the next episode of the show.

==Film references==
The film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

depicts the ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' radio show transmitting a secret message that deciphered to: "Be sure to drink your [[Ovaltine]]." This, however, is incorrect. Although the announcer instructed the listeners to set their decoder rings to "B-2", thus indicating that the letter "B" (the first letter in the supposedly decoded message) was represented by the number "2", the first code number in the message was not "2". As Ralphie decodes the message, his pin is clearly set on "B-12".

Decoder rings are mentioned by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in [[Last Action Hero]].

The '''Falco''' ([[English language|English:]] hawk) is a tactical [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)]] designed and produced by [[Selex ES]] (now [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]] formerly Leonardo-Finmeccanica and Finmeccanica, originally by Galileo Avionica of [[Italy]]). The UAV is designed to be a medium-altitude, medium-endurance surveillance platform &lt;ref name="flightglobal.com"/&gt; capable of carrying a range of payloads, including several types of high resolution sensors. A larger variant, the Falco EVO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/-/falco-evo|title=Falco EVO - DETTAGLIO - Leonardo - Aerospace, Defence and Security|website=www.leonardocompany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is capable of carrying larger payloads is also available. Neither system is designed to carry weapons, The launch customer, Pakistan, reportedly wanted the Falco armed, a request that Italy rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&amp;id=news%2Fasd%2F2011%2F03%2F01%2F01.xml&amp;headline=Pakistan%20Air%20Chief%20Outlines%20Procurement%20Plans |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020205131/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&amp;id=news%2Fasd%2F2011%2F03%2F01%2F01.xml&amp;headline=Pakistan%20Air%20Chief%20Outlines%20Procurement%20Plans |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
* The Falco UAV's maiden flight took place in December 2003 and Galileo Avionica had completed platform qualification in late October 2004. Over 40 hours of flight-testing had been completed by then at the Salto di Quirra test range in [[Sardinia]]. Validation of flight controls had been completed in September 2004. Testing of the onboard systems was planned to be started in early 2005 and integration of the electro-optical sensor suite planned for July 2005. Radar installation was scheduled to begin in 2006.&lt;ref name="flightglobal.com"/&gt;
* In January 2007 it was reported that Galileo Avionica had finished factory acceptance tests and was ready to deliver the first production Falco UAV System to its launch customer, then believed to be Pakistan. The production version of the Falco UAV used a modified powerplant developing 80&amp;nbsp;hp (60&amp;nbsp;kW), supplied by UAV Engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/01/29/211769/first-galileo-avionica-falco-uav-set-for-delivery-launch-customer-remains.html|title=News Channel - Homepage - flightglobal.com|website=Flightglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2009 it was reported that a modified version named Falco Evo, evo meaning evolution, was being offered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6357">{{about|the tool as used for [[astrometry]]|the "navigator's sextant"|Sextant}}

'''Sextants''' for astronomical observations were devices depicting a sixth of a circle, used primarily for measuring the positions of [[star]]s. They are of significant historical importance, but have been replaced over time by [[transit telescope]]s, [[astrometry]] techniques, and [[satellites]] such as [[Hipparcos]].

There are two types of astronomical sextants, [[mural instrument]]s and frame-based instruments.

==Mural sextants==
[[Image:Ulugh Beg observatory.JPG|thumb|Remains of Ulugh Beg's mural sextant, [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, 15th century.]]
{{Main article|Mural instrument}} 

The first known mural sextant was constructed in [[Ray, Iran]], by [[Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi]] in 994.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Khujandi|title=Abu Mahmud Hamid ibn al-Khidr Al-Khujandi}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure the [[Axial tilt|obliquity of the ecliptic]], al-Khujandī invented a device that he called al-Fakhri sextant (al-suds al Fakhrī), a reference to his patron, Buwayhid ruler, Fakhr al Dawla (976-997). This instrument was a sixty-degree arc on a wall aligned along a [[meridian arc]] (north-south line). Al Khujandi’s instrument was larger than previous instruments; it had a radius of about twenty meters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sevim Tekeli|Tekeli, Sevim]] (1958), 'Nasiruddin, Takiyuddin ve Tycho Brahe'nin Rasat Aletlerinin mukayesesi'. ''Ankara Universitesi Dil ve Tarih-Cografya Fakültesi Dergesi'', XVI, p.&amp;nbsp;4. {{link language|tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main improvement incorporated in al-Fakhri sextants over earlier instruments was bringing the precision of reading to seconds while older instruments could only be read in degrees and minutes. This was confirmed by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|al-Birūni]], [[Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi|al-Marrākushī]] and [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī|al-Kāshī]]. Al-Khujandī used his device to measure the sun's angle above the horizon at the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s; these two measurements allow computation of the latitude of the sextant's location and the obliquity of the ecliptic.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

[[Ulugh Beg]] constructed a Fakhri Sextant that had a radius of 40.4 meters, the largest instrument of its type in the 15th century. Housed in the [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]], the sextant had a finely constructed arc with a staircase on either side to provide access for the assistants who performed the measurements.

==Framed sextants==
[[Image:Tycho instrument sextant 16.jpg|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]'s sextant, used for measuring the angular distances between stars.]]
A sextant based on a large metal frame had an advantage over a mural instrument in that it could be used at any orientation. This allows the measure of angular distances between astronomical bodies.

These instruments differ substantially from a [[sextant|navigator's sextant]] in that the latter is a reflecting instrument. The navigator's sextant uses mirrors to bring the image of the sun, moon or a star to the horizon and measure the altitude of the object. Due to the use of the mirrors, the angle measured is twice the length of the instrument's arc. Hence, the navigator's sextant measures 120° on an arc with an included angle of 60°. By comparison, the astronomical sextants are large and measure angles directly — a 60° arc will measure at most 60°.

===Construction===

These large sextants are made primarily of wood, brass or a combination of both materials. The frame is heavy enough to be stiff and provide reliable measures without flexural changes in the instrument compromising the quality of the observation.  The frame is mounted on a support structure that holds it in position while in use. In some cases, the position of the sextant can be adjusted to allow measurements to be made with any instrument orientation. Owing to the size and weight of the instrument, attention was paid to balancing it so that it could be moved with ease.

Observations were typically made with an [[alidade]], though newer versions could use a [[telescope]]. In some cases, a system of counter-weights and pulleys were used to allow the observer to manipulate the instrument in spite of its size.

===Usage===
[[Image:Johannes Hevelius und Elisabetha Hevelius.jpg|thumb|Johannes and Elisabetha Hevelius observing with the sextant.]]
These instruments were used in much the same way as smaller instruments, with effort possibly scaled due to the size. Some of the instruments might have needed more than one person to operate.

If the sextant is permanently fixed in position, only the position of the alidade or similar index need be determined.  In that case, the observer moved the alidade until the object of interest is centered in the sights and then reads the [[Graduation (instrument)|graduation]]s marked on the arc.

For instruments that could be moved, the process was more complex.  It was necessary to sight the object with two lines.  The edge of the instrument would typically be supplied with sights and the instrument was aligned with one of the two objects of interest. The alidade was then aligned with the second object as well. Once each object was centred in one set of sights, the reading could be taken.  This could be a challenge for a moving star observed with a very large instrument as a single person might not be able to confirm both sights with ease; an assistant was a great benefit. The illustration of the Hevelius instrument to the right shows how two persons would use such a sextant: his wife [[Elisabetha Hevelius|Elisabetha]] is aligning the instrument while Johannes sets the alidade.

===Well-known framed sextants===
*[[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]  used a sextant for the determination of the [[equinox]]es.
* [[Tycho Brahe]] used a sextant for many of his stellar position measurements.
* [[Johannes Hevelius]] used a sextant with a particularly ingenious [[alidade]] to provide stellar position measurements of great accuracy.
* [[John Flamsteed]], the first [[Astronomer Royal]], used a sextant at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]].

In [[Russia]], [[Finland]], and a few nearby countries, a '''sokha''' ({{lang-ru|соха}}, {{Lang-lt|žagrė}}) is a light wooden [[ard_(plough)|ard]], consisting of two body ards, with their parallel beams forming the two shafts for a single horse-drawn tillage implement with two socket shares (рассоха).&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Hopfen, ''Farm Implements for Arid and Tropical Regions'', 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In later types the double body is combined into one wooden board. Chronicles and other literary sources show that the sokha was in use in [[Russia]] at least since the 13th century. It originated from northern [[Russia]], e.g., around [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotekar.ru/rusNovgorod/86.htm {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kroka.ru/html/s/soha.html {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sokha adapts the body ard to a single-animal harness following the pattern of a shaft-drawn cart and adds a [[spade]]-like component that turned over the soil. (On [[plough]]s the curved [[mouldboard]] both cuts and turns the soil.) Other design features can vary depending on local building custom.

'''Spin polarization''' is the degree to which the [[spin (physics)|spin]], i.e., the intrinsic [[angular momentum]] of elementary particles, is aligned with a given direction.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite book | author=J. Kessler| title=Polarized Electrons | publisher=Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg | date=1976 | pages=7–19 | isbn=0-387-07678-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property may pertain to the spin, hence to the [[magnetic moment]], of [[conduction electrons]] in [[ferromagnet]]ic [[metals]], such as [[iron]], giving rise to spin-polarized [[current (electricity)|currents]]. It may refer to (static) [[spin waves]], preferential correlation
of spin orientation with ordered lattices (semiconductors or insulators).

It may also pertain to beams of particles, produced for particular aims, such as  [[polarized neutron scattering]] or [[muon spin spectroscopy]]. Spin polarization of electrons or of nuclei, often called simply [[magnetization]], is also produced by the application of a [[magnetic field]]. [[Curie law]] is used to produce an induction signal in [[Electron spin resonance]] (ESR or EPR) and in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR).

Spin polarization is also important for [[spintronics]], a branch of [[electronics]]. [[Magnetic semiconductor]]s are being researched as possible spintronic materials.

The spin of free electrons is measured either by a [[Low-energy electron diffraction|LEED]] image from a clean [[Tungsten|wolfram]]-crystal (SPLEED)&lt;ref name="SPLEED_Ki"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.1008 | author=J.

Back scattered electrons are decelerated by annular optics and focused onto a ring shaped electron multiplier at about 15°. The position on the ring is recorded. This whole device is called a [[Nevill Francis Mott|Mott-detector]]. Depending on their spin the electrons have the chance to hit the ring at different positions. 1% of the electrons are scattered in the foil. Of these 1% are collected by the detector and then about 30% of the electrons hit the detector at the wrong position. Both devices work due to spin orbit coupling.

The [[circular polarization]] of electromagnetic fields is due to spin polarization of their constituent [[photons]].

In the most generic context, spin polarization is any alignment of the components of a non-scalar
(vectorial, tensorial, spinor) field with its arguments, i.e., with the nonrelativistic three spatial or
relativistic four spatiotemporal regions over which it is defined. In this sense, it also includes
[[gravitational waves]] and any field theory that couples its constituents with the differential
operators of vector analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2313">'''Staged combustion''' is a method for reducing [[nitrogen oxides]] ([[NOx]]) emissions from [[combustion]]. There are two methods - air staged supply and fuel staged supply. Applications include [[boiler]]s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.praxair.com/praxair.nsf/AllContent/CD232FC669F0D02885256EDF006BDE37/$File/P-8872.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rocket engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMP9P3CXCF_0.html |title=ESA - Launchers Home - First hot firing of European staged-combustion demonstration engine |publisher=Esa.int |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air staged supply==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
;Characteristics
* NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; reduction rate from 50-75% is possible.
* Spatial separation of primary and secondary air.
* Control of combustion performance with primary air (sub-stoichiometric conditions, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 1).
* Secondary air supply for burnout (usually,above stoichiometric conditions, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&gt;1 ).
* Simple configuration.
* Application at small scale combustions.

==Fuel staged supply==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
;Characteristics
* NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; reduction rate from 50-75% is possible.
* Minor temperature instabilities at the reduction zone.
* Lower temperature necessary.
* Complex constructive configuration.
* Application at large scale combustions.

==History==
Staged combustion dates back to the [[hot bulb engine]] of the 1890s. The first stage of combustion occurred inside the hot bulb and the hot gases were then forced out into the cylinder, where they mixed with additional air, and the second stage of combustion took place. At this time, staged combustion was used because it was a convenient method of ignition and it is unlikely that there would have been much concern about [[air pollution]]. A modern application of the principle is the [[Stratified charge engine]], in which a rich mixture is ignited by a spark and the resulting flame-front ignites the weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder.

{{For|the commune of Réunion|Le Tampon}}

[[Image:Tampon.JPG|thumb|Tampon with scale]]

A '''tampon''' is a [[feminine hygiene]] product designed to absorb the menstrual flow by insertion into the [[vagina]] during [[menstruation]]. Once inserted correctly a tampon is held in place by the vagina and expands as it soaks up menstrual blood. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of [[rayon]] and [[cotton]]. Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings. 

The average woman may use approximately 11,400 tampons in her lifetime (if she uses only tampons rather than other products).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Several countries regulate tampons as medical devices. In the United States, they are considered to be a Class II medical device by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). They are sometimes used for [[hemostasis]] in [[surgery]].

==Design and packaging==
[[Image:Tampon with applicator.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tampon with applicator]]
[[Image:Elements of a tampon with applicator.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The elements of a tampon with applicator. Left: the bigger tube ("penetrator"). Center: cotton tampon with attached string. Right: the narrower tube.]]
[[File:Tampon inserted.svg|thumb|Tampon inserted]]
[[File:Insert1.jpg|thumbnail|Tampon inserted with applicator]]
Tampon design varies between companies and across product lines in order to offer a variety of applicators, materials and absorbencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/femalehealth/periods/tampons.html|title= Tampons|website= Palo Alto Medical Foundation|accessdate= October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main categories of tampons based on the way of insertion - digital tampons inserted by finger and applicator tampons. Tampon applicators may be made of plastic or cardboard, and are similar in design to a syringe. The applicator consists of two tubes, an "outer", or barrel, and "inner", or plunger. The outer tube has a smooth surface to aid insertion and sometimes comes with a rounded end that is petaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.steadyhealth.com/articles/Using_tampons__Facts_and_Myths_a53.html|title= Using Tampons: Facts And Myths|website= SteadyHealth|accessdate= October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madaras2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynda Madaras|title=What's Happening to My Body? Book for Girls: Revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCC5Kbvy1fwC&amp;pg=PA180|date=8 June 2007|publisher=Newmarket Press|isbn=978-1-55704-768-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main differences are in the way the tampon expands when in use; applicator tampons generally expand axially (increase in length), while digital tampons will expand radially (increase in diameter).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Steadyhealth.com_October_28_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steadyhealth.com/medical-answers/pain-while-inserting-a-tampon.html |title=Pain While Inserting A Tampon |newspaper=Steadyhealth.com |date=  |author= |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most tampons have a cord or string for removal. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of [[rayon]] and [[cotton]]. Organic cotton tampons are made from only 100% cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edana.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/tampons-for-menstrual-hygiene---modern-products-with-ancient-roots.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Tampons for menstrual  hygiene: Modern products with ancient roots|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absorbency ratings===
[[Image:Tamponlable.jpg|thumb|right| 2 water drop marks mean that the absorbency is between 6 and 9&amp;nbsp;g.]]
Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings, which are consistent across manufacturers in the U.S.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pms.about.com/od/hygiene/f/tampon_absorben.htm |title=Tampon Absorbency Ratings - Which Tampon is Right for You |newspaper=Pms.about.com |date=  |author= |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Junior/Light absorbency: 6&amp;nbsp;g and under
* Regular absorbency: 6–9&amp;nbsp;g
* Super absorbency: 9–12&amp;nbsp;g
* Super Plus absorbency 12–15&amp;nbsp;g
* Ultra absorbency 15–18&amp;nbsp;g

Absorbency ratings outside the US may be different. The majority of non-US manufacturers use absorbency rating and [https://www.edana.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/tampons-code-of-practice-(english).pdf?sfvrsn=0 Code of Practice] recommended by [https://www.edana.org/ EDANA] (European Disposals and Nonwovens Association).

A piece of test equipment referred to as a Syngina (short for synthetic Vagina) is usually used to test absorbency. The machine uses a [[condom]] into which the tampon is inserted, and synthetic menstrual fluid is fed into the test chamber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahpma.co.uk/docs/EDANA_Syngina2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health aspects==
===Toxic shock syndrome===
{{main|Toxic shock syndrome}}

Toxic shock syndrome was named by Dr. James K.Todd in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=history+of+tampons#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20tampons&amp;f=false|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|last=Delaney|first=Janice|last2=Lupton|first2=Mary Jane|last3=Toth|first3=Emily|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252014529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Philip M. Tierno Jr., Director of Clinical [[Microbiology]] and [[Immunology]] at the [[NYU Langone Medical Center]], helped determine that tampons were behind [[toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) cases in the early 1980s. Tierno blames the introduction of higher-absorbency tampons in 1978, as well as the relatively recent decision by manufacturers to recommend that tampons can be worn overnight, for increased incidences of toxic shock syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/a-new-generation-faces-toxic-shock-syndrome/| work=The Seattle Times | title=A new generation faces toxic shock syndrome | date=January 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later [[meta-analysis]] found that the absorbency and chemical composition of tampons are not directly correlated to the incidence of toxic shock syndrome, whereas [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] content is associated more strongly.&lt;ref name="LanesRothman1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanes|first1=Stephan F.|last2=Rothman|first2=Kenneth J.|title=Tampon absorbency, composition and oxygen content and risk of toxic shock syndrome|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=43|issue=12|year=1990|pages=1379–1385|issn=0895-4356|doi=10.1016/0895-4356(90)90105-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RossOnderdonk2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=R. A.|last2=Onderdonk|first2=A. B.|title=Production of Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1 by Staphylococcus aureus Requires Both Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide|journal=Infection and Immunity|volume=68|issue=9|year=2000|pages=5205–5209|issn=0019-9567|doi=10.1128/IAI.68.9.5205-5209.2000|pmc=101779}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2015}}

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] suggests the following guidelines for decreasing the risk of contracting TSS when using tampons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=e-CFR: Title 21: Food and Drugs Administration |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3485cbba7d3a26b44da17b575d046ca3&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt21.8.801&amp;rgn=div5#se21.8.801_1430|website=Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=11 February 2017|location=Section 801.430: User labeling for menstrual tampons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Follow package directions for insertion
* Choose the lowest absorbency needed for one's flow (test of absorbency is approved by FDA)
* Follow guidelines and directions of tampon usage (located on box's label)
* Consider using [[cotton]] or cloth tampons rather than [[rayon]]
* Change the tampon at least every 4 to 6 hours
* Alternate usage between tampons and [[Sanitary napkin|pads]]
* Avoid tampon usage overnight or when sleeping
* Increase awareness of the warning signs of Toxic Shock Syndrome and other tampon-associated health risks (and remove the tampon as soon as a risk factor is noticed)

Cases of tampon-connected TSS are extremely rare in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. A study by Tierno also determined that all cotton tampons were less likely to produce the conditions in which TSS can grow, this was done using a direct comparison of 20 brands of tampons including conventional cotton/rayon tampons and 100% organic cotton tampons from Natracare. In fact Dr Tierno goes as far to state that "The bottom line is that you can get TSS with synthetic tampons but not with an all-cotton tampon." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/gender.uk|title=Welcome to the cotton club|first=Emma|last=Lindsey|date=6 November 2003|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sea sponge]]s are also marketed as [[menstrual]] hygiene products. A 1980 study by the [[University of Iowa]] found that commercially sold sea sponges contained [[sand]], [[Shell grit|grit]], and [[bacteria]]. Hence, sea sponges could also potentially cause toxic shock syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodrevolution.org/askjohn/49.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
===Clinical use===
Tampons are currently being used and tested to restore and/or maintain the normal microbiota of the vagina to treat [[bacterial vaginosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Statement of the Polish Gynecological Society Expert Group on the use of ellen probiotic tampon |language=Polish |journal=Ginekol. Pol. |volume=83 |issue=8 |pages=633–8 |year=2012 |pmid=23342891 |doi= |url=|author1=Zespoł Ekspertów Polskiego Towarzystwa Ginekologicznego }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are available to the public but come with disclaimers.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy of the use of these probiotic tampons has not been established.

== Environment and waste ==
Ecological impact varies according to disposal method (whether a tampon is flushed down the toilet or placed in a garbage bin - the latter is the recommended option). Factors such as tampon composition will likewise impact [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plants]] or waste processing.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2010/03/greening_the_crimson_tide.html |title=What's the environmental impact of my period? |newspaper=Slate.com| last= Rastogi |first= Nina |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average woman may use approximately 11,400 tampons in her lifetime (if she uses only tampons rather than other products).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicole|first1=Wendee|title=A Question for Women's Health: Chemicals in Feminine Hygiene Products and Personal Lubricants|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=March 2014|volume=122|issue=3|page=A71–A75|doi=10.1289/ehp.122-A70|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a70/|accessdate=24 September 2014|ref=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024110323/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a70/|archive-date=24 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tampons are made of cotton, rayon, polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, and fiber finishes. Aside from the cotton, rayon and fiber finishes, these materials are not [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]]. Organic cotton tampons are biodegradable, but must be composted to ensure they break down in a reasonable amount of time. Rayon was found to be more biodegradable than cotton &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Chung Hee|last2=Kang|first2=Yun Kyung|last3=Im|first3=Seung Soon|date=2004-09-15|title=Biodegradability of cellulose fabrics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.20879/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|language=en|volume=94|issue=1|pages=248–253|doi=10.1002/app.20879|issn=1097-4628}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Environmentally friendly alternatives to using tampons are the [[menstrual cup]], [[cloth menstrual pad|reusable sanitary pads]], [[Aquaculture of sea sponges#Menstrual sponges|menstrual sponges]] and reusable tampons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-reusable-tampons-work-in-case-youre-sick-of-your-usual-period-products-7581378|title=How Reusable Tampons Work|last=|first=|date=|work=Elite Daily|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are worn inside the vagina to collect the fluid. Reusable sanitary pads are similar to disposable sanitary pads, but differ in the sense that they can be washed and used as many times as needed by the owner. For women who cannot or don't want to use a menstrual cup, but like internal products, sea sponges inserted like tampons may be a good option. These can also be washed out and reused and when they lose their absorbency can be composted. Some women have also made reusable tampons, often pieces of knit or crocheted fabric that are rolled up and inserted into the vagina, and later washed, dried and reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~obsidian/clothpads/reusabletampon|title=Reusable Menstrual Products - www.ecomenses.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alternatives are environmentally friendly because they are reusable, and in some cases compostable, so they contribute less waste to landfills.

Alternatives also include reusable absorbent underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11648523/Period-nappies-The-only-new-sanitary-product-in-45-years.-Seriously.html|title=Period nappies: The only new sanitary product in 45 years.

The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of the environmental impact of tampons and sanitary pads. Their “cradle to grave” assessment of the raw material extraction, transportation, production, use and waste management stages took three main impact categories into consideration: human health, ecosystem quality and resource use. They found that the main environmental impact of the products was in fact caused by the processing of raw materials, particularly LDPE (low density polyethelene) – or the plastics used in the backing of pads and tampon applicators, and cellulose production. As production of these plastics requires a lot of energy and creates long-lasting waste, the main impact from the life cycle of these products is fossil fuel use, though the waste produced is significant in its own right.

==History==
Women have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book ''Everything You Must Know About Tampons'' (1981), Nancy Friedman writes, "There is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, [[Papyrus Ebers]], refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the 15th century BCE. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called [[hapu'u]]; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2252/who-invented-tampons Who invented tampons?] June 6, 2006 The Straight Dope&lt;/ref&gt;

R. G. Mayne defined a tampon in 1860 as: "a less inelegant term for the ''plug'', whether made up of portions of rag, sponge, or a silk handkerchief, where plugging the ''vagina'' is had recourse to in cases of hemorrhage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. G. |last=Mayne |title=An Expository Lexicon of the Terms, Ancient and Modern, in Medical and General Science including a Complete Medico-Legal Vocabulary |year=1860 |place=London |publisher=John Churchill |page=1249 |url=https://archive.org/stream/b21462124#page/n1275/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Earle Haas]] patented the first modern tampon, [[Tampax]], with the tube-within-a-tube applicator. Gertrude Schulte Tenderich (née Voss) bought the patent rights to her company trademark Tampax and started as a seller, manufacturer, and spokesperson in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Periods''&lt;/ref&gt; Tenderich hired women to manufacture the item and then hired two sales associates to market the product to drugstores in Colorado and Wyoming; and nurses to give public lectures on the benefits of the creation; and was also instrumental in inducing newspapers to run advertisements.

In 1945, Tampax presented a number of studies to prove the safety of tampons. A 1965 study by the Rock Reproductive Clinic stated that the use of tampons "has no physiological or clinical undesired side effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=history+of+tampons#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20tampons&amp;f=false|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|last=Delaney|first=Janice|last2=Lupton|first2=Mary Jane|last3=Toth|first3=Emily|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252014529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During her study of female anatomy, German gynecologist Dr. [[Judith Esser-Mittag]] developed a digital-style tampon, which was made to be inserted without an applicator. In the late 1940s, Dr. Carl Hahn, together with Heinz Mittag, worked on the mass production of this tampon. Dr. Hahn sold his company to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson|Johnson and Johnson]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="hahn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/johnson-johnson-history/ | title=Johnson &amp; Johnson History | publisher=Funding Universe | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Tampon tax===
{{main|Tampon tax}}
Several political statements have been made in regards to tampon use. In 2000, a 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was introduced in Australia. While lubricant, condoms, incontinence pads and numerous medical items were regarded as essential and exempt from the tax, tampons continue to be charged GST. Prior to the introduction of GST, several states also applied a luxury tax to tampons at a higher rate than GST. Specific petitions such as "Axe the Tampon Tax" have been created to oppose this tax, although no change has been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/tampon-tax-a-bloody-outrage-20130221-2etl5.html|title= Tampon tax a 'bloody outrage'|last= Orr |first= Aleisha |date= February 22, 2013 |work= [[WAtoday]] |accessdate= October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], tampons are subject to [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|value added tax]] (VAT) at a reduced rate of 5%, as opposed to the standard rate of 20% applied to the vast majority of products sold in the country.&lt;ref name="tampon tax"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31299254/why-the-tampon-tax-is-here-to-stay---for-a-while-at-least |first=Amelia |last=Butterly |title=Why the 'tampon tax' is here to stay - for a while at least |work=Newsbeat |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant [[EU]] legislation was finally changed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35834142|title=Deal reached 'to scrap tampon tax'|date=2016-03-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mortimer, |first=Caroline |date=March 21, 2016 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tampon-tax-david-cameron-announces-end-to-.vat-on-sanitary-products-in-house-of-commons-a6944371.html |title=Tampon tax: David Cameron announces end to vat on sanitary products in House of Commons |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Catriona |date=December 8, 2016 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/96d9abef-b668-42b7-a3bd-6305c42b5ff9 |title=Five women who aren't on Wikipedia but should be |work=[[BBC Three (online)]] |access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"&gt;{{cite news |last=Larimer |first=Sarah |date=January  8, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/08/the-tampon-tax-explained/ |title=The 'tampon tax,' explained |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mf920yYU?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/08/the-tampon-tax-explained/ |archive-date=December 11, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the federal government has removed the [[Goods and services tax (Canada)|Goods and services tax]] (GST) and [[Harmonized sales tax]] (HST) from tampons and other feminine hygiene products as of July 1st, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/federal-government-taking-the-tax-off-tampons-and-other-feminine-hygiene-products-effective-july-1|title=Federal government taking the tax off tampons and other feminine hygiene products, effective July 1|date=2015-05-28|work=National Post|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
Historically, the word "tampon" originated from the medieval [[French language|French]] word "[[tampion]]", meaning a piece of cloth to stop a hole, a ''stamp'', ''plug'', or ''stopper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/tampon|title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7582">[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|350px|Dragon with trencadís at the entrance of [[Parc Güell]] overlooking [[Barcelona]].]]
'''Trencadís'''  ({{IPA-va|tɾəŋkəˈðis}}), also known as '''pique assiette''', '''broken tile mosaics''', '''bits and pieces''', '''memoryware''', and '''shardware''', is a type of [[mosaic]] made from cemented-together tile shards and broken chinaware.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt; Glazed china tends to be preferred, and glass is sometimes mixed in as well, as are other small materials like buttons and shells. Artists working in this form may create random designs, pictorial scenes, geometric patterns, or a hybrid of any of these.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

Although as a folk art the method itself may be centuries old, the two most commonly used terms are both of modern origin. Trencadís, a Valencian term that means 'chopped', is the name for this method as it was revived in early 20th century [[Valencian modernism]] and [[Catalan modernism]], while pique assiette is a more general name for the technique that comes from the French language. In French, pique assiette ('plate thief') is a term for a scrounger or sponger, and thus as a name for this mosaic technique, it refers to the recycled or 'scrounged' nature of the materials.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt;

== Technique ==
Traditional mosaics, such as classical Roman floors, are made up of individual [[tesserae]], usually small cubes that are uniformly shaped and designed for their intended use. Trencadís differs in that the tesserae are nonuniform pieces broken from tiles and chinaware originally made for other uses. Trencadís is thus a form of [[bricolage]], [[found object]] art, or recycled art.

There are two main methods for trencadís. In the first, an initial design is drawn up and the ceramic fragments are carefully fitted into the design; in this case, the mosaic is only cemented together once all of the fragments have been placed. Alternatively, an artist may spontaneously arrange fragments without a prior design; here the success of the finished work depends greatly on their improvisation skills.

== Notable artists and works ==

=== Demetrio Ribes ===

The Valencian architec Demetrio Ribes used trencadís extensively for decoration in the hall of [[Valencia's|Valencia]] [[Estació del Nord (Valencia)|North Station]] in 1907.

=== Antoni Gaudí and  Josep Maria Jujol ===
The Catalan modernist architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and  [[Josep Maria Jujol]] used trencadís in many projects, among which [[Barcelona]]'s [[Parc Güell]] (1900–1914) is probably the most famous. Gaudí's first use of this technique was at the [[Güell Pavilions]], where the sinuous architecture forced him to break the tiles in order to cover the curved surfaces.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Gaudí tended to create patterns with his trencadís work, and he leaned towards brightly colored glazed ceramic shards. He often used discarded pieces of ceramic tile collected from the factory Pujol i Bausis located in [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], as well as pieces of white ceramic from broken cups and plates discarded by other Spanish manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Raymond Edouard Isadore ===
In France, the term pique assiette is most closely associated with Raymond Edouard Isadore (1900–1964) a French graveyard sweeper and folk artist. Starting in the late 1930s, he spent 30 years covering both the inside and outside of his house as well as his furniture and his garden walls with mosaics.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt; He found his materials in the surrounding fields and quarries, in the public dump, and at auctions.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt; This habit of scavenging earned him the nickname "pique assiette" later shortened to "picassiette".&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt;

Isadore, a very religious man, created many of his mosaic scenes with Christian personages and symbols.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; He also built a "sweeper's throne" and a "sweeper's tomb" covered in pique assiette.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; As the mosaics expanded, the project became more widely known, and in 1954, [[Pablo Picasso]] visited Isadore's house.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; Today, the house is a tourist attraction near [[Chartres]] known as "Maison Picassiette".&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

=== Watts Towers ===
{{Main|Watts Towers}}
The [[Watts Towers]] in Los Angeles were built over a period of 30 years by [[Simon Rodia]], a construction worker and tile mason. Begun in 1921, the 17 interconnected towers were decorated with fragments of porcelain, tile, glass, seashells and other found objects. Rodia built them without a premade plan, using damaged pieces from local tile companies and materials scavenged by neighborhood children.

=== Bridge of the Dragon ===
A contemporary example is the Bridge of the Dragon, which crosses the [[Guadaíra]] River at [[Alcalá de Guadaíra]].&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; The bridge's support structure emulates a dragon's body and is covered in trencadís.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; Designed by engineer José Luis Manzanares, it was directly inspired by Gaudí's dragon fountain in Parc Güell.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt;

=== Memory jugs ===
{{Main|Memory jug}}
A related form is the [[memory jug]], an American [[folk art]] form that memorializes the dead.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt; The memory jug is a vessel with a mosaic-like surface decoration of glass and ceramic shards, seashells, trinkets, coins and other small objects, especially objects associated with a specific dead person.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabler /&gt; Most known examples date back no further than the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 110802-A-FS865-053 - Army Master Sgt. Sean Rice gives the hand signal for 30 seconds during an airborne operation in a Casa 212 aircraft over St. Mere Eglise drop zone.jpg|thumb|An Army Master giving the hand signal for "30 seconds" during an airborne operation over a drop zone]]

Hand and arm signals for [[United States Army]] use were first laid down in [[U.S. Army Field Manuals|Field Manual]] 21-60. They were superseded in Training Circular 3-21.60. &lt;ref name="tc3-21_60"&gt;Training Circular 3-21.60 Visual Signals[http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN2747_TC%203-21x60%20FINAL%20WEB.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand and Arm signals are one of the most common forms of communication used by [[United States Army]] soldiers or group of soldiers when a [[radio silence]] is in effect or if the soldiers need to remain undetected.&lt;ref name="fm21_60"&gt;Field Manual 21-60 Visual Signs[http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/fm21_60.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the use of these signals military leaders, such as team leaders, squad leaders and platoon leaders, are able to keep [[command and control]] (C2) over their particular element. All new recruits are taught to use the proper [[hand and arm signals]] found in the FM. However, it is not uncommon for units to adopt and/or create their own signals. These signals ultimately become known as SOP or [[standard operating procedure]].&lt;ref name="fm21_60"/&gt;

[[Visual signal]]s are any means of communication that require sight and can be used to transmit prearranged messages rapidly over short distances. This includes the devices and means used for recognition and identification of friendly forces.

== Types of visual signals ==
There are a number of ways that [[visual communication]] can be executed. The most common types are: hand and arm signals, [[flag]]s, [[pyrotechnic]], chemical-lights and [[ground-to-air signal]]s. It must be known that soldiers and units are not limited to this select list. Soldiers are only limited in their choice of visual communication by their initiative and imagination, as well as the ability of others to understand what they are trying to convey.

== Limitations ==
Like all other types of signals, visual signals do have their downfalls and limitations. The first limitation one can see is the range and reliability. Within this limitation, visual communication can become greatly disrupted during periods of poor [[visibility]] or when the terrain restricts clear [[observation]]. The second limitation one can see is misunderstanding. Many units do not follow specific Army doctrine (FM), but rather adopt their own SOP's. With thousands of different units, it is highly likely that unit SOP's will begin to overlap and cross each other. The third limitation one can see is how vulnerable visual signals are to enemy interception; thus allowing the enemy to use our own signals for [[deception]] purposes.&lt;ref name="fm21_60"/&gt;

==Signals for combat formations==
[[File:Hand signal - ready to fire.jpg|thumb|The ground hand signal: "Ready to fire: clear and ready to fire, indicated by pointing down range."]]
# Leaders of dismounted units use arm and hand signals to control the movement of individuals, teams, and squads. These signals are used by infantry and also by combat support and combat service support elements organized for infantry missions. 
# Leaders of mounted units use arm and hand signals to control individual vehicles and platoon movement. When distances between vehicles increase, flags (wrapped and tied) can be used as an extension of the arm to give the signals. From some vehicles (for example, Bradley, M2), the arm and hand signals will be distorted.

==Patrolling arm and hand signals==
Patrolling is conducted by many types of units. Infantry units patrol in order to conduct combat operations. Other units patrol for reconnaissance and security. Successful patrols require clearly understood communication signals among members of a patrol.

===The Millennium Simulation===

This N-body simulation used more than 10 billion particles to trace the evolution of the matter distribution in a cubic region of the [[Universe]] over 2 billion [[light-years]] on a side. The first results that were published in 2005 in an issue of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], shows how comparing such simulated data to large observational surveys can improve the understanding of the physical processes underlying the buildup of real galaxies and black holes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1264">A '''weighting pattern''' for a [[linear dynamical system]] describes the relationship between an input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and output &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Given the [[time-variant system]] described by
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = C(t)x(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
then the output can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = y(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t T(t,\sigma)u(\sigma) d\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;T(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the weighting pattern for the system. For such a system, the weighting pattern is &lt;math&gt;T(t,\sigma) = C(t)\phi(t,\sigma)B(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[state transition matrix]].

The weighting pattern will determine a system, but if there exists a [[Realization (systems)|realization]] for this weighting pattern then there exist many that do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger W.|last=Brockett|title=Finite Dimensional Linear Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1970|isbn=978-0-471-10585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linear time invariant system==
In a [[LTI system]] then the weighting pattern is:
; Continuous
: &lt;math&gt;T(t,\sigma) = C e^{A(t-\sigma)} B&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e^{A(t-\sigma)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix exponential]].

; Discrete
: &lt;math&gt;T(k,l) = C A^{k-l-1} B&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Wycombe Museum''' (aka '''Wycombe Local History and Chair Museum''') is a free [[local museum]] located in the town of [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000412 Wycombe Museum], [[Culture24]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It is run by Wycombe Heritage and Arts Trust, as of 1 December 2016. It was previously run by [[Wycombe District Council]].

The museum is located in Castle Hill House on Priory Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artguide.org/museums.php?id=1582880M Wycombe Local History and Chair Museum, High Wycombe], [http://www.artguide.org/ Art Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406001937/http://www.artguide.org/ |date=April 6, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in an 18th-century house on a medieval site, and surrounding the museum are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gardens. The museum presents exhibitions the history of the local area, including the [[furniture]] industry, especially [[chair]]-making. There are also displays of [[Windsor chair]]s, [[lace]], [[art]] and [[natural history]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Collections==
The museum collections include:{{fact|date=December 2017}}

* Social history of the [[High Wycombe|Wycombe]] and Buckinghamshire areas.
* Furniture industry — chairs, other furniture and tools that relate to the furniture industry in and around High Wycombe, videotapes of craftsmen at work.
* Tokens and coins — including trade tokens relating to the Wycombe and Buckinghamshire areas.
* Art — oil paintings, prints, watercolours, drawings, engravings, brass rubbings and sculpture.
* Oral history tapes — recordings taken over the past 30 years.
* Archive material and photographs — sale catalogues, price lists, design books and account books of furniture companies dating back to the 19th century.
* Photographs — relating to the town and the furniture industry and trade in the Wycombe area.
* [[Wycombe Wanderers]] - showcasing memorabilia from the club, inducing the [[Wycombe Comanche]]

==Trivia==
