'''Anita Brenner''' (born '''Hanna Brenner'''; 13 August 1905 – 1 December 1974) was a transnational Jewish scholar and intellectual,&lt;ref&gt;Rick A. López, "Anita Brenner and the Jewish Roots of Mexico's Postrevolutionary National Identity," in ''Open Borders to a Revolution: culture, Politics, and Migration'', edited by Jaime Marroquín Arredondo, Adela Pineda Franco, and Magdalena Mieri. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press 2013, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote extensively in English about the [[Mexican art|art]], culture, and history of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Britton, "Anita Brenner" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 467. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in Mexico, raised and educated in the U.S., and returned to Mexico in the 1920s following the [[Mexican Revolution]]. She coined the term 'Mexican Renaissance',&lt;ref&gt;Anita Brenner, "A Mexican Renascence." ''Arts'' 12 (September 1925): 127-50&lt;/ref&gt; "to describe the cultural florescence [that] emerged from the revolution."&lt;ref&gt;López, "Anita Brenner", p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child of immigrants, Brenner's heritage caused her to experience both antisemitism and acceptance. Fleeing discrimination in Texas, she found mentors and colleagues among the European [[Jewish diaspora]] living in both Mexico and New York,&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)"/&gt; but Mexico, not the US or Europe, held her loyalty and enduring interest.&lt;ref name="Diario Judío (2014)"/&gt; She was part of the post-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolutionary]] art movement known for its [[indigenismo|indigenista]] ideology.

Brenner earned a PhD in anthropology at [[Columbia University]] and her first book, ''Idols Behind Altars'' was the first book to document the artworks, styles and artists of [[Mexico]] from Prehistory through the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Aguas/&gt; It was widely considered her most important work&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)"/&gt; and was filled with photographs by renowned photographers and interviews with the most influential and prolific artists of the period.&lt;ref name="Porter (1991)"/&gt; Her fourth published book was ''The Wind That Swept Mexico; The History of the Mexican Revolution, 1910-1942'', having in between printed a guidebook and a children's story. The first book to give a complete account in either English or Spanish on the [[Mexican Revolution]],&lt;ref name="Kolb/Wind (1999)"/&gt; it was the first to retell the events from a Mexican perspective.&lt;ref name=UT/&gt;

==Early life==
Anita Brenner was born 13 August 1905 in [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes, Mexico]] to Isador&lt;ref name=Aguas&gt;{{cite web|last=Portal de Gobierno del Estado de Aguascalientes |title=Anita Brenner (1905&amp;ndash;1974) |url=http://www.aguascalientes.gob.mx/estado/aguascalentenses/anita_brenner.aspx |accessdate=19 July 2013 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710053445/http://www.aguascalientes.gob.mx/Estado/Aguascalentenses/anita_brenner.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paula Brenner.&lt;ref name="Glusker (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glusker|first1=Susannah Joel|title=Anita Brenner: A Mind of Her Own|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-72810-7|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcz6AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her birth name was registered as Hanna.&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)"/&gt; Her father, a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] emigrant to Mexico from [[Latvia]], moved his family back and forth from Mexico to Texas during the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="Martinez del Campo (2013)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez del Campo|first1=Lynda|title=Anita Brenner: A Bridge Between Nations and Religions|url=https://mexicanmuseumsandmavens.wordpress.com/2013/08/03/anita-brenner-a-bridge-between-nations-and-religions-2/|publisher=Mexican Museums and Mavens|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 when Brenner was 11, the family settled in [[San Antonio, Texas]],&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villela|first1=Khristaan D.|title=Jazz Age Chronicles: Anita Brenner on Mexico’s Avant-Garde Art and Artists."

Frank Dobie]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. After two semesters she was able to persuade her father to let her return to Mexico,&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)"/&gt; since she felt excluded by her university peers because of their [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Cimet (1997)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cimet|first1=Adina|title=Ashkenazi Jews in Mexico: Ideologies in the Structuring of a Community|date=1997|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-3179-7|pages=23&amp;ndash;24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1vuf_EFvncC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father had secured promises from Joseph Weinberger, of [[B'nai B'rith]], a Jewish service organization, and his wife [[Frances Toor]] that they would look after her, Isador agreed to let Anita go.&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)"/&gt;

She moved to Mexico around the age of 18&lt;ref name="Monsivais (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glusker|first1=Susannah Joel|author2=Monsivais, Carlos|chapter=Forward: Anita Brenner and the Mexican Renaissance|title=Anita Brenner: A Mind of Her Own|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-72810-7|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcz6AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=Inafed&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita Brenner (1905&amp;ndash;1974)|url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM01aguascalientes/historia.html|language=Spanish|work=Enciclopedia de los Munícipios y Delegaciones de México: Aguascalientes|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Toor introduced Brenner to the community of international artists, refugees, and intellectuals then residing in the capital. Brenner became an important member of this cosmopolitan circle and was an important link among them. She was also an important voice for bringing the Mexican artistic florescence to the attention of readers in the U.S., effectively representing it north of the Mexican border.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920-1935''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert M. Joseph, "Revolutionary Encounters of the Transnational Kind: Cross-Border Collaborations, Border Thinking, and the Politics of Mexican State Formation" in ''Open Borders to a Revolution'', Jaime Marroquín et al. eds., p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in her life, Brenner felt accepted and began to explore her Jewish roots. She worked for a brief period at B'nai B'rith, meeting recent Jewish immigrants at the port of [[Veracruz]] and helping them with their paperwork and resettlement.&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)" /&gt; Brenner quickly became part of the leftist bohemian group and as a journalist was a key voice in the [[indigenismo]] movement.&lt;ref name="Deetsch (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deetsch |first1=Andrea Jeanne |title=Tina Modotti and Idols Behind Altars |journal=Master of Arts Thesis Submission |date=May 2003 |page=12&amp;ndash;13 |url=http://digital.library.louisville.edu/utils/getfile/collection/etd/id/501/filename/502.pdf |accessdate=8 March 2015 |publisher=University of Louisville |location=Louisville, Kentucky }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carleton Beals]] and [[Ernest Gruening]] were influential U.S. journalists who Brenner met in this early period of her career. Beals helped her launch her publishing career. She was Gruening's research assistant for his book,&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)" /&gt; ''Mexico and Its Heritage'', which he spent five years developing in Mexico before it was published in 1928.&lt;ref name="Hasbrouck (1930)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasbrouck|first1=Alfred|title=Book Reviews: Mexico and Its Heritage. by Ernest Gruening|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|date=February 1930|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages=71&amp;ndash;77|jstor=2506192|publisher=Duke University Press|doi=10.2307/2506192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, her first published article was "The Jew in Mexico," published by ''The Nation'',&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)" /&gt; which Gruening had edited from 1920-1923.&lt;ref name=Gruening&gt;{{cite web|title=GRUENING, Ernest Henry, (1887&amp;ndash;1974)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000508|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] (1924–28) heard about her and offered her a scholarship to participate in the cultural preservation program.&lt;ref name=Inafed /&gt; At that time in Mexico, the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Education]] (SEP) had established a cultural missions program, which began in 1923, where young people traveled the country and helped preserve indigenous culture. [[Concha Michel]], a friend of Anita's, participated in a similar program and gathered indigenous folk songs.&lt;ref name="Olcott (2005)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olcott|first1=Jocelyn|title=Revolutionary Women in Postrevolutionary Mexico|date=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, N.C.|isbn=978-0-822-33665-5|pages=93&amp;ndash;99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCvzS_e2rb0C&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, Brenner commissioned her friends [[Tina Modotti]] and [[Edward Weston]] to travel with her and take photographs for her upcoming book on Mexican decorative arts. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] was providing funding for a two-volume series in which Brenner planned to document artworks in  [[Guanajuato]], [[Jalisco]], [[Michoacan]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Puebla]] and [[Querétaro]].&lt;ref name="Deetsch (1998)" /&gt;

Modotti and Weston also took personal photographs of Brenner. The differences between them point to the different aesthetics of the photographers. Weston was known for the abstract qualities of his highly focused and "precisely composed black-and-white images of semi-abstract nudes, landscapes, and organic forms". His photographs of Brenner's back&lt;ref name=Weston&gt;{{cite web|title=Nude Study II (Anita Brenner), Mexico, 1925|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/edward-weston-nude-study-ii-anita-brenner-mexico|website=www.artsy.net|publisher=Edwynn Houk Gallery|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are devoid of human interest and a study of form. In Modotti's images she attempted to capture scenes and personality, and social context over form were emphasized. Her photographs of Brenner show her dressed in a man's suit and [[fedora]].&lt;ref name="Adams (2009)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Rachel|title=Continental divides: Remapping the Cultures of North America|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-00551-5|page=137|edition=Kindle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aN4pX2o6TiEC&amp;lpg|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though feminists of later decades saw these photographs as uninhibited gender expression, Brenner was discreet about her sexuality&lt;ref name="UT Press 2010" /&gt; and like most of the female artists of the period was not a feminist.&lt;ref name="Glusker (1998)" /&gt; Their works questioned their personal restrictions, but not as a feminist statement for society.&lt;ref name="Olcott (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olcott|first1=Jocelyn|title="Take off That Streetwalker's Dress" Concha Michel and the Cultural Politics of Gender in Postrevolutionary Mexico|journal=Journal of Women’s History|date=2009|volume= 21|issue= 3|pages=37–38|url=https://fds.duke.edu/db/attachment/1196|accessdate=28 February 2015|doi=10.1353/jowh.0.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York years==
In 1927, Brenner left Mexico for New York to attend [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="MacMasters (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacMasters|first1=Merry|title=Los diarios de Anita Brenner se presentarán en México el próximo febrero|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/12/09/cultura/a05n1cul|accessdate=8 March 2015|language=Spanish|publisher=La Jornada|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had served as translator and editor for [[Manuel Gamio]], a leading Mexican anthropologist and was encouraged to pursue a doctorate by [[Franz Boas]], the "founding father of American anthropology".&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolb|first1=Charles C.|title=Review of Glusker, Susannah Joel, Anita Brenner: A Mind of Her Own.|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3039|publisher=H-LatAm H-Net Reviews|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, she was finally able to publish her book on Mexican artwork, but instead of the two volumes originally planned, she published one volume entitled ''Idols Behind Altars'', with the New York trade publisher, [[Harcourt, Brace]]. The main premise of the book was that behind the Spanish "altars", visible Hispanic, Catholic culture, lay the "idols", invisible authentic culture of the real Mexico, which the "Mexican Renaissance" was rediscovering.&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)" /&gt; It was well received and is considered her most important work.&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)" /&gt; It was the first attempt to permanently record art throughout the country, as well as analyze the works, styles and artists of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Diario Judío (2014)" /&gt; According to [[Katherine Anne Porter]]'s review, it reads like a "who's who" of the Mexican art scene of the 1920s, including [[Abraham Ángel]], [[Adolfo Best Maugard|Adolfo Best-Maugard]], [[Jean Charlot]], [[Xavier Guerrero]], [[Carlos Mérida]], Gerardo Murillo Cornado (aka [[Dr. Atl]]), [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and explains the intricate interlacing of their community of foreigners, second generation emigrants, and native born artists who have restored the "Indian" imagery of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Porter (1991)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Katherine Anne|title=This Strange, Old World and Other Book Reviews|date=1991|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=0-8203-1331-9|pages=85&amp;ndash;86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5A4KYNX_50C&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she never finished a bachelor's or master's degree, nor done field work at the site&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)" /&gt; in 1930, Brenner submitted her PhD dissertation in anthropology on the ancient site of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Colhuacan]].&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)" /&gt; After her successful defense of her thesis, she completed her degree and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1930 to study the geographical extent of [[Aztec]] art in Mexico and at various museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)" /&gt; In her travels throughout Europe she wrote articles for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and served as a war correspondent during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Inafed /&gt;

Brenner's travels through Mexico with the fellowship resulted in a travel book entitled ''Your Mexican Holiday'' which was published in 1932. The next decade of her life was spent in the publication of hundreds of articles which appeared in "''The Nation'' (seventeen articles) and the ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' (twenty articles), ... ''Mademoiselle'', and ... the ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'' (fifty articles),&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)" /&gt; as well as stories of Mexican art, culture, refugees and politics which were chronicled in the Jewish press – the ''Menorah Journal'', the ''Jewish Morning Journal'', ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', and the ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency''.&lt;ref name="Villela (2012)" /&gt;

During this period, Brenner helped many of Mexico's artists navigate the U.S. audiences. She introduced [[José Clemente Orozco]] to [[Alma Reed]] who helped plan his first New York showing and guided his career.&lt;ref name="Delpar (1992)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delpar|first1=Helen|title=The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920&amp;ndash;1935|date=1992|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-0582-3|pages=83&amp;ndash;93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=es_GBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Orozco later had a falling out.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Enormous Vogue'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote reviews and helped with the translation of [[Mariano Azuela]]'s ''The Underdogs,'' which sold 3,000 copies, she promoted [[Diego Rivera]], though they at times had a contentious relationship, as well as [[Carlos Mérida]]&lt;ref&gt;Delpar (1992) p 179, p 85, pp 123&amp;ndash;128, p 142&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemingway |first1=Andrew |title=American Communists View Mexican Muralism: Critical And Artistic Responses|journal=Cronícas: El muralismo, producto de la revolución mexicana, en América|date=2002|volume= 8-9|pages=13–42|url=http://revistas.unam.mx/index.php/cronicas/article/download/17245/16423|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many of the Mexican artists of the post-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolutionary]] decades accepted that the government endorsement of using art to educate the largely uneducated public was a tacit approval to produce art heavily reflecting communist ideology.&lt;ref name="Kenny (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenny|first1=John|title=The Chicano Mural Movement of the Southwest: Populist Public Art and Chicano Political Activism|journal=University of New Orleans Theses and Dissertations|date=December 2006|pages=50&amp;ndash;55|url=http://scholarworks.uno.edu/td/492|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary themes and communism combined in many works of the period. But the 1930s were turbulent times, [[Mexican Communist Party|Mexican communists]] were sometimes embraced and sometimes not embraced by their [[Communist Party USA|US]] and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] counterparts. Brenner was a sympathizer, like others of Mexican ''avant–garde'', who were sometimes Communist Party members and sometimes not. In 1926 when the journal ''New Masses'' was launched, Brenner was classed as a [[fellow traveler]], but not a party member.&lt;ref name="Hemingway (2002)" /&gt;

As an independent reporter in Spain, Brenner evaluated the Russian role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. She found evidence that the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie]] (GPU), the Russian secret police, intimidated anarchists and socialists in an effort to silence critics of the [[Comintern]] and she criticized Stalin's move away from helping workers and into [[Marxist]] [[Sectarianism|factionalism]]. In the view she supported, Stalin would be the only one who would benefit from the adoption of Communism by the Spanish Government.&lt;ref name="Kutulas (1983)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutulas|first1=Judy|title=The 'Scientific Morality': Independent Marxists and Stalin's Russia, 1935&amp;ndash;1940|journal=UCLA Historical Journal|date=1983|volume= 4|pages=66–91|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8qj908ss|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Anita and 24 others signed an open letter on their anti-Stalin stance and received negative reviews from  ''New Masses'', which had become the leading Communist journal, branding her a Trotskyist.&lt;ref name="Wald (1987)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wald|first1=Alan M.|authorlink=Alan M.

Brenner occasionally wrote under a pseudonym "Jean Mendez" for [[Troskyist]] newspapers.&lt;ref name="Wald (1987)" /&gt;
In 1936, it was Brenner who sent a telegram from New York to Diego Rivera asking him to use his influence to find [[Leon Trotsky]] a safe haven in Mexico. Trotsky had been in exile for nine years, and Norway was in the process of expelling him. Brenner, on behalf of the Trotskyite Fourth International, asked Rivera to assist in the crisis and secure asylum. Rivera immediately contacted President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and secured the necessary agreement.&lt;ref name="Richardson (1988)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=William Harrison|title=Mexico through Russian eyes, 1806&amp;ndash;1940|date=1988|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=0-8229-3824-3|pages=197&amp;ndash;198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUfzWF6A2i8C&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Mexico==
Brenner, her husband and two children emigrated to Mexico in 1940,&lt;ref name="Deacon (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deacon|first1=Desley|title=Anita Brenner: Transational Cultural Interpreter Across the Mexican-US Border 1920-1940|url=http://anclas.anu.edu.au/event/seminar/anita-brenner-transational-cultural-interpreter-across-mexican-us-border-1920-1940|publisher=Australian National Centre for Latin American Studies School of Politics &amp; International Relations|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the farm in Aguascalientes her family had left when they moved to Texas. She re-established it for specialty agricultural produce and grew asparagus and garlic.&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)"/&gt;

Brenner continued to publish in the U.S. and renewed her lifelong friendship with [[Jean Charlot]] to collaborate on several children's books.&lt;ref name="González (2014)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=González|first1=Omar|title=El fantasma tímido: Cómo forrarse de oro y no morir en el intento |url=http://notasomargonzalez.blogspot.mx/2012/11/el-fantasma-timido.html|language=Spanish|publisher=notasomargonzalez|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 she published her fourth book, ''The Wind That Swept Mexico'', for which she wrote the text, with George R. Leighton, publishing the vivid photos.&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)"/&gt; which was the first complete account in either the English–language or Spanish recounting the events that occurred during the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kolb/Wind (1999)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolb|first1=Charles C.|title=Review of Anita Brenner, George R.

It was also the first telling in English that gave a Mexican perspective of the conflict. Many versions of the events of the war had been printed in the US, but mainly those were journalism pieces which negatively reported on events in Mexico. In particular, pieces by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s papers were designed to arouse anti-Mexican feeling to protect his own land holdings in Mexico. Brenner defended Mexico's right to determine its own path without foreign intervention.&lt;ref name=UT&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita Brenner A Mind of Her Own - Excerpts|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/gluani#tabs-3|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely acclaimed at the time, and was received well when it was reprinted in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Diario Judío (2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolb/Wind (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolbert (1944)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolbert|first1=Robert Gale|title=The Wind That Swept Mexico By Anita Brenner|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/107612/anita-brenner/the-wind-that-swept-mexico|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=January 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|work=Kirkus Review|title=THE WIND THAT SWEPT MEXICO By Anita Brenner|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/anita-brenner-3/the-wind-that-swept-mexico/|publisher=Harper|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Brenner established a monthly publication, ''Mexico/This Month''. Her familiarity with both sides of the border gave her the expertise to make Mexico known to an English-speaking public.&lt;ref name=UT /&gt; When the Mexican government awarded her the Order of the  [[Aztec Eagle]], the highest honor Mexico can award a non-national, she refused it, on the grounds that she was Mexican by birth.&lt;ref name="Lopez (2013)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Rick A.|editor1-last=Arredondo|editor1-first=Jaime Marroquín|editor2-last=Franco|editor2-first=Adela Pineda|editor3-last=Mieri|editor3-first=Magdalena|title=Chapter 7: Anita Brenner and the Jewish Roots of Mexico's Post-Revolutionary National Identity|journal=Open Borders to a Revolution|date=2013|pages=123–130|url=http://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Lopez%2520Brenner%2520Jewish%2520Roots.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2015|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT /&gt; She did accept a citation as a distinguished tourism pioneer awarded by former president [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=UT /&gt;

==Personal life==
In July, 1930 Brenner married David Glusker,&lt;ref name=Author!&gt;{{cite news|title=Author! Author!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c5EcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tI4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3025%2C1433328|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|date=13 July 1930|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; from whom she separated in 1951 ten years prior to his death in 1961.&lt;ref name="Kolb (1999)"/&gt; She was survived by two children, her daughter, Susannah Joel Glusker, who teaches at the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] in [[Mexico City]], and her son, Dr. Peter Glusker, a physician with a medical practice in [[Fort Bragg, California]].&lt;ref name="Glusker (1998)"/&gt;

Two posthumous volumes were released after Brenner's death, by Susannah Joel Glusker, Brenner's daughter. ''Avant-Garde Art &amp; Artists in Mexico, 2-Volume Set: Anita Brenner's Journals of the Roaring Twenties'' was prepared using diaries and notes Brenner had made and span the period from 1925 until her marriage in 1930 and photographs from Brenner's files. Some of the photographs were taken by Modotti and Weston for ''Idols behind Altars'' and also some images by Máximo Pacheco and Orozco which had not previously been published.&lt;ref name="UT Press 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avant-Garde Art and Artists in Mexico|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/gluava#tabs-3|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susannah Glusker wrote a biography of her mother entitled ''Anita Brenner: A Mind of Her Own'' &lt;ref&gt;Susannah Joel Glusker, ''Anita Brenner: A Mind of her Own''.  Austin:[[University of Texas Press]]: 1998; {{ISBN|978-0-292-72810-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Brenner remains an important figure in post-Revolutionary art and history in Mexico, an enthusiast for Mexican art and culture and an active advocate for its importance to a U.S. audience.  A prolific scholar and journalist herself, she has been the subject of studies by Mexicanist scholars.  The [[Skirball Cultural Center]] in Los Angeles plans an exhibition focusing on Brenner in 2017-18, entitled "Another Promised Land: Anita Brenner's Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skirball.org/exhibitions/another-promised-land-anita-brenners-mexico|title=Another Promised Land: Anita Brenner's Mexico|date=2016-10-05|work=Skirball Cultural Center|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charcoal pile''' is a carefully arranged pile of [[wood]], covered by turf or other layer, inside which a fire is lit in order to produce [[charcoal]]. The pile is tended by a [[charcoal burner]]. It is similar to a [[charcoal kiln]], but the latter is usually a permanent structure made of materials such as stone.

'''Charles Whibley''' (1859–1930) was an English literary journalist and author. Whibley's style was described by Matthew as "often acerbic high-[[tory]] commentary".&lt;ref&gt;H.C.G.

Arundel &amp; Co. which evolved into Pacific Islands Company and later the Pacific Phosphate Company, which commenced [[phosphate mining in Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island]] (Ocean Island).

Whibley worked for three years in the editorial department of [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell &amp; Co]], publishers. He shared a house with his brother [[Leonard Whibley]], [[William Ernest Henley]], and [[George Warrington Steevens]].&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Leonard Whibley, by Sydney C. Roberts, Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Reference 36852&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Paris==
In 1894 Charles became the Paris correspondent for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. This [[Tory]] evening paper conformed with Whibley's conservative political views.

In Paris Charles moved in the [[symbolist]] circles with [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Marcel Schwob]], and [[Paul Valéry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], reference 36851&lt;/ref&gt; He was a witness at the wedding of [[Marcel Schwob]] and [[Marguerite Moreno]] in England on 12 September 1900.

==Marriage to Ethel Birnie Philip==
In 1896 Charles married [[Ethel Whibley|Ethel Birnie Philip]] in the garden of the house occupied by [[James McNeill Whistler]] at n° 110 [[Rue du Bac, Paris]]. The photographs of the wedding were taken by Louis Edmond Vallois,&lt;ref&gt;wedding photo credited to E. Vallois held by Library of the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Special Collections]], GB 0247 Whistler PH1/165&lt;/ref&gt; who had a studio at 99 rue de Rennes, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Collection Jean David, puis Edmond Vallois L’Institution Jeanne d’Arc d’Étampes http://www.corpusetampois.com/cpa-es-david.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ethel Birnie Philip was the daughter of the sculptor [[John Birnie Philip]] and Frances Black. Before her marriage Ethel Whibley worked during 1893–4 as secretary to James McNeill Whistler. Whistler painted a number of full-length portraits of Ethel Whibley, including ''Mother of Pearl and Silver: The Andalusian'', and portraits and sketches of her titled as Miss Ethel Philip or Mrs Ethel Whibley.&lt;ref name="UOEW"/&gt;

Hartrick (1939) describes Whibley as "an obviously English type, and therefore something of a red rag to Whistler".&lt;ref&gt;Hartrick, Archibald, ''A Painter's Pilgrimage Through Fifty Years'', Cambridge, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; As the brother-in-law of James McNeill Whistler, Whibley was part of Whistler's intimate family circle, referred to as "Wobbles" in Whistler's correspondence. On one occasion Whistler mocked Whibley for describing himself as [[Flâneur|"something of a boulevardier"]] during his time in Paris.&lt;ref name="UOGCW"/&gt; In 1897 Whistler created the cover design for Whibley's volume of essays ''A Book of Scoundrels''.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;''A Book of Scoundrels'' by Charles Whibley, Project Gutenberg, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1632&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career as a writer==
His wife, Ethel, died in 1920, and in 1927 Charles married Philippa Raleigh, the daughter of [[Walter Raleigh (professor)|Walter Raleigh]], Chair of English Literature at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;'RALEIGH, Sir Walter', Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, 1920–2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U201955, accessed 1 April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whibley contributed to the London and Edinburgh magazines, including ''[[The Pall Mall Magazine]]'', ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]'', and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. As a writer on ''Blackwood's Magazine'', he was a prominent conservative columnist, as well as an influential literary figure, recruited by its editor William Blackwood III.&lt;ref&gt;Julie F. Codell, ''Imperial Co-histories: National Identities and the British and Colonial Press'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a persistent critic of the system of [[state education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Pearce (journalist)|Edward Pearce]], ''Lines of Most Resistance'' (1999), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[open secret]] that Whibley contributed anonymously, to the Magazine, his ''Musings without Methods'' for over twenty-five years. T. S. Eliot described them as "the best sustained piece of literary journalism that I know of in recent times".&lt;ref&gt;H. C. G. Matthew, '[[Whibley, Charles]] (1859–1930)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Whibley was friends with [[William Ernest Henley]] and contributed to the ''[[National Observer (UK)|Scots Observer]]'' (published in Edinburgh) and also to the [[National Observer (UK)|National Observer]] (published in London) under Henley's editorship.&lt;ref name="EHCS"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Edited by Atkinson, Damian.|first1= |authorlink1= |title= The Letters of William Ernest Henley to Charles Whibley, 1888–1903|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume=1 &amp; 2 |year=2013|month= |origyear= |publisher= Edwin Mellen Press|location= |language= |isbn= 0-7734-4365-7|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Chestnut Street Theatre''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] was the first theater in the United States built by entrepreneurs solely as a venue for paying audiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Chestnut Street Theatre Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Theatre (First Chestnut Street Theatre)==
[[File:Chestnut Street Theatre advertistment, July 1853.png|thumb|left|225px|Advertisement for plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre, July 1853]]

The Chestnut Street Theatre (originally named the New Theatre) was the brainchild of [[Thomas Wignell]] and [[Alexander Reinagle]] who in 1791 convinced a group of Philadelphia investors  to build a theater suitable for Wignell’s company to perform in. Wignell had not yet formed his company when the New Theatre was being set up to be built, but as the New Theater was being built, Wignell was in England recruiting actors to be a part of his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=Thomas|title=The Philadelphia Theatre in the Eighteenth Century|year=1968|publisher=Greenwood Press, Publishers|location=New York|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Theater's design, modeled after the [[Theatre Royal, Bath]],  was made possible by [[John Inigo Richards]], Wignell's brother-in-law, who obtained architect Thomas Greenway’s original plans.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"&gt;Oxford Companion to American Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; The New Theatre was built on Chestnut Street near the corner of Sixth Street across from [[Congress Hall]]. $30,000 was raised for the construction of the building and the finale touches were not completed until 1805 under architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The stage ran with a depth of seventy-one feet and had a width of thirty feet. The three tiers of boxes could hold nine hundred people; the theatre itself was able to hold an audience of two thousand. There were multiple dressing rooms, two green rooms, and for the first time in America a large well-stocked wardrobe. There were two different entrances from the street for the theatre patrons, those going to the pit and those headed to the boxes. The entryway to the pit was only eighteen inches wide, a death trap in the event of a fire. Like English theatres the New Theatre on Chestnut Street had all the essentials. A proscenium with proscenium doors in the proscenium walls with a balcony overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolcott|first=John|title=Theatre History on the Web|publisher=VideOccasions|accessdate=23 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after its construction the New Theatre was often referred to as one of the Seven Wonders of America.&lt;ref&gt;Early Opera in America By Oscar George Theodore Sonneck&lt;/ref&gt; A [[yellow fever]] epidemic spoiled the theater’s debut in 1793, and its first regular season did not begin until the following year when the inaugural night’s entertainment offered a double feature, John O'Keeffe's ''Castle of Andalusia'' and Hannah Cowley's ''Who's the Dupe?''&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre" /&gt; Over the following twenty-seven years the theater would become a showcase for works by local and national dramatist of the day. In 1816 the New Theatre became the first American theater to be illuminated by gas fixtures rather than candlelight or oil lamps. Four years later a suspicious fire destroyed the theater along with its library, music, scenery and costumes. The cause of the fire remained a mystery since the building had been vacant for several days while the company was engaged in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Philadelphia in 1830--1: or, A brief account of the various institutions and Public Objects in the Metropolis – 1830&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Chestnut Street Theatre==
Two years later, the second Chestnut Street Theatre rose from the ashes of the first. It was built in the customary design of the day by architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] with triple tiers of boxes making a horseshoe around the orchestra and apron of the stage that accommodated about 2,000 theatergoers. The façade was made of Italian-style marble with an arcade supported by a row of composite columns with a plain entablature. The entrance stood between two wings whose niches held statues of Tragedy and Comedy by [[William Rush]]. Below the statues were semi-circular recesses containing basso relievos of tragic and comic muses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884, Volume 2 By [[John Thomas Scharf]], Thompson Westcott 1884&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Chestnut Street Theatre11.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Third Chestnut Street Theatre on the right ({{circa}}1860s)]]

The Chestnut Street Theatre was once again consumed in a fire in 1856 and would not see another curtain rise for six years.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"/&gt;{{clear left}}

==Third Chestnut Street Theatre==
The third Chestnut Street Theatre was built in 1862, seven blocks to the west of its original location, where once again it found favor with Philadelphia audiences as a fashionable night spot. Tragic actress [[Jean Hosmer]] was among those who starred at the debut of the third theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sh5LAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=actress+jean+hosmer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zPF_UkAzNx&amp;sig=dr4mNpjm-4eJLOOWwwYE8TBBi8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-unww6TaAhWkxYMKHfx2BwMQ6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=actress%20jean%20hosmer&amp;f=false|title=The Theatre|date=1890|publisher=Wyman &amp; Sons|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It closed its doors for the last time in 1913 after the curtain fell on the final act of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'', and the building was demolished soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Life and Times of Actress EJ Phillips&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the discipline==
The new economic history originated in 1958 with ''The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South'' by American economists [[Alfred H. Conrad]] and [[John R. Meyer]], which caused a firestorm of controversy with its claim, based on statistical data, that slavery, being economically efficient and highly profitable for slaves owners, would not have ended in the absence of the U.S. Civil War.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Economics of Slavery in the Ante Bellum South |first=Alfred H. |last=Conrad |first2=John R. |last2=Meyer |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |year=1958 |pages=95–130 |jstor=1827270 |doi=10.1086/258020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new economic history revolution actually began in the mid-1960s and was resisted because many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Cliometrics became better known when [[Douglass North]] and William Parker became the editors of the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'' in 1960. The Cliometrics Meetings began to be held around this time at [[Purdue University]] and are still held annually in different locations. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'', ''[[Explorations in Economic History]]'', the ''[[European Review of Economic History]]'', and ''[[Cliometrica]]''.

According to cliometric economist [[Claudia Goldin]], the success of the cliometric revolution had as an unintended consequence the disappearance of economic historians from history departments. As economic historians started using the same tools as economists, they started to seem more like other economists. In Goldin's words, "the new economic historians extinguished the other side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other side nearly disappeared altogether, with only a few remaining in history departments and business schools.  However, some new economic historians did, in fact, begin research around this time, among them were Kemmerer and Larry Neal (a student of [[Albert Fishlow]], a leader of the cliometric revolution) from Illinois, Paul Uselding from [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], Jeremy Atack from Indiana, and Thomas Ulen from Stanford.

A group to encourage and further the study of cliometrics, [[The Cliometric Society]], was founded in 1983.

Cliometrics was introduced to Germany by American-born and -educated [[Richard H. Tilly]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghi-dc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1015:helmut-schmidt-prize-lecture-2009&amp;catid=97:lectures-2009&amp;Itemid=908#pics|title=Verleihung des Helmut-Schmidt-Preises 2009 an Richard Hugh Tilly|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193517/http://www.ghi-dc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1015:helmut-schmidt-prize-lecture-2009&amp;catid=97:lectures-2009&amp;Itemid=908#pics#pics|archive-date=2013-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a revival in 'new economic history' since the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The number of papers on economic history published in the top economics journals has increased in the last decades, comprising 6.6% of articles in the [[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]] and 10.8% of articles in the [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] for the period 2004-2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 1993, the Swedish National Bank awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] to [[Robert William Fogel]] and [[Douglass Cecil North]] "for having renewed research in economic history".  The Academy noted that "they were pioneers in the branch of economic history that has been called the 'new economic history,' or cliometrics".&lt;ref name="nobelpress"&gt;The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1993, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1993/press.html Press Release], October 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel and North received the prize for turning the theoretical and statistical tools of modern economics on the historical past: on subjects ranging from slavery and railroads to ocean shipping and property rights.

Fogel is often described as the father of modern econometric history and Neohistoricals.&lt;ref name="nobelpress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebolt|first=Claude|last2=Haupert|first2=Michael|date=2017-10-28|title=A cliometric counterfactual: what if there had been neither Fogel nor North?|journal=Cliometrica|volume=12|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/s11698-017-0167-8|issn=1863-2505}}&lt;/ref&gt; He's especially noted for using careful empirical work to overturn conventional wisdom.  North, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, was honored as a pioneer in the "new" institutional history. In the Nobel announcement,&lt;ref name="nobelpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebolt|first=Claude|last2=Haupert|first2=Michael|date=2017-01-01|title=A Cliometric Counterfactual: What if There Had Been Neither Fogel nor North?|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/ulpsbbeta/2017-04.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific mention was made of a 1968 paper on ocean shipping, in which North showed that organizational changes played a greater role in increasing productivity than did technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=North |first=Douglass C. |year=1968 |title=Sources of Productivity Change in Ocean Shipping, 1600-1850 |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=953–970 |jstor=1830031 |doi=10.1086/259462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Cliometrics has had sharp critics. Boldizzoni summarized a common critique by arguing that cliometrics is based on the false assumption that the laws of neo-classical economics always apply to human activity. Those laws, he says, are based on rational choice and maximization as they operate in well-developed markets, and do not apply to economies other than those of the capitalist West in the modern era. Instead, Boldizzoni argues that the workings of economies are determined by social, political and cultural conditions specific to each society and time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francesco |last=Boldizzoni |title=The Poverty of Clio: Resurrecting Economic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780691144009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Diebolt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11698-015-0136-z | volume=10 | title=Cliometrica after 10 years: definition and principles of cliometric research | journal=Cliometrica | pages=1–4|year = 2016|last1 = Diebolt|first1 = Claude}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that cliometrics is mature and well accepted by scholars as an "indispensable tool" in economic history. He says most scholars agree that economic theory, combined with new data as well as historical and statistical methods are necessary to formulate problems precisely, to draw conclusions from postulates and to gain insight into complicated processes. At the applied level, cliometrics is accepted as the way to measure variables and estimate parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claude |last=Diebolt |title=Where Are We Now in Cliometrics? Kliometrie: wo stehen wir heute? |journal=Historical Social Research |year=2012 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=309–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of Cliometrics by [[Joseph T. Salerno]], based on the perspective of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, especially that of [[Ludwig von Mises]], can be found in his Introduction to [[Murray N. Rothbard]]'s ''A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing cliometrics and cliodynamics==
Cliometrics and [[cliodynamics]] share the scientific ambition of using quantitative tools and historical data to test general historical principles. Both fields endeavor to gather large amounts of historical data across big samples. However, the two fields also differ in several important ways. [[Cliodynamics]], unlike cliometrics, maintains a close relationship with the natural sciences, often employing dominant methods from the natural sciences such as differential-equation models, power-law relations, and agent-based models. Evolutionary game theory and social network analysis are also frequently employed by cliodynamicists, but not cliometricians. Cliodynamicists also tend to include factors associated with ecological context and biological determinants in their models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mejía|first=Javier|date=2015|title= The Evolution of Economic History since 1950: From Cliometrics to Cliodynamics|ssrn= 2708321|journal=Tiempo &amp; Economia|volume=2|issue=2|pages=79–103|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deal toy''' (also '''deal gift''', '''lucite tombstone''' or '''financial tombstone''') is a customized memento or gift that is intended to mark and commemorate the closing of a business deal in [[finance]] or [[investment banking]]. These plaques or other types of trophies are typically presented at the closing ceremony or dinner to the issuer and senior third-party advisers of the major financial transactions as a souvenir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q82TBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Memento+%22Deal+toy%22 |page=314 |title=IPO: A Global Guide |edition=Second |first=Philippe |last=Espinasse |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=2014 |isbn=9789888083190 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The deal toy is the marriage of a design with the [[Tombstone (financial industry)|tombstone advertisement]], a term that dates to the late 19th century, when printers used it to refer to "column-width newspaper ads run without any illustration or typographical ornamentation,". After the [[crash of 1929]], the [[Securities Act of 1933]] placed strict requirements on the advertisements that banks were allowed to run. Those restrictions meant that the tombstone ad became the format that companies and banks used to publicize financial transactions such as [[initial public offering]]s. From at least the late 1960s, law firms and banks produced [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)#Artistic and aesthetic uses|Lucite]] slabs that encased the tombstone ads announcing new partner classes. By the late 1960s, banks were commemorating their new partner classes by embedding the partnership announcements in Lucite. The first deal toy was created in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Leah McGrath (25 February 2008). [http://www.ft.com/cms/0a92a5ee-e40c-11dc-8799-0000779fd2ac.html ''Financial Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The chronology of the deal toy continues to be elusive. In 1973 the merger of [[Drexel Burnham Lambert|Drexel Firestone]] with Burnham &amp; Co was commemorated with a rather risqué deal toy featuring two brass balls, made by an unknown company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/13159237/1/the-history-of-ma-and-dealmaking-encased-in-a-tiny-plastic-toy.html|title=The History of M&amp;A and Dealmaking, Encased in a Tiny, Plastic Toy|last=Marcus|first=David|date=2015-05-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also in 1973 Ad man Don McDonald created one of the first Lucite deal toys for a school friend who became an investment banker. Sensing an opportunity, McDonald quit his job at an advertising agency and founded Don McDonald &amp; Associates, which went on to "create its own production facility, open multiple offices abroad" and make as many as 5,000 toys a year in the mid-1990s. McDonald's son Michael followed him into the business, which is now part of Altrum Honors Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Marcus|first =David|title=Tracing the History of 'Deal Toys' from Lucite to Brass Balls |url= https://www.thestreet.com/story/13006275/1/tracing-the-history-of-deal-toys-from-lucite-to-brass-balls.html |website=TheStreet |date=10 January 2015 |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of the [[banking crisis of 2008]], investment banks closed fewer deals, and deal toy budgets were reined in accordingly.&lt;ref name=CNBCdealtoy&gt;{{cite news|last=Little |first=Katie |title=Wall Street 'Toy' Indicator Flashes a Bullish Sign |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/100523251 |work=CNBC |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Deal toys by Altrum Honors.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deal toys from various industries]]
Deal toys are designed to commemorate a financial transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_BZdg8GIuikC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Deal+toy |page=111 |title=Business Jargon |first=Ron |last=Sturgeon |publisher=M. French Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=9780971703117 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This memento is described as an ad hoc creation to a financial offering or other major investment banking transaction and is most often presented at the closing ceremony of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lK0cNusTsugC&amp;pg=SL201-PA40&amp;lpg=SL201-PA40&amp;dq=memento+ad+hoc+creation+to+offering+or+other+investment+banking+transaction |page=GL-40 |title=Capital Markets Handbook |editor-first=John C. |editor-last=Burch |editor-first2=Bruce S. |editor-last2=Foerster |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=9780735550322 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This souvenir typically includes the names or logos of the firms for which the transaction is completed (the recipients), description of the transaction (type, size and, date of the deal) as well as the names and or [[logo]]s of the key financial advisors and financiers involved in that transaction. Because the recipients of the award are the clients of the advisors and [[financier]]s, the award also acts as a marketing tool for the presenter long after the transaction has passed.

As deal toys became used within investment banking industry, they also became a point of pride—and competition-with firms frequently seeking to outdo each other with creative and elaborate designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Wall Street Casualty: The Art of the 'Deal Toy |first=Ianthe Jeanne |last=Dugan |date=11 February 2009 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url= https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123431574025671015 |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking crisis of 2008 caused many financial firms to rein in spending generally, and on deal toys specifically.&lt;ref name=CNBCdealtoy/&gt; Though many{{which|date=January 2017}} financial firms have recently eased restrictions on tombstone budgets, they largely have not been restored to pre-crisis levels. Average order size, which had ranged between 50-60 pieces prior to 2008, had by 2013 stabilized at around 20-30. Order quantities can still reach approximately 50 or 60 for larger transactions.&lt;ref name=CNBCdealtoy /&gt;

==Materials==
There are many ways to make deal toys, the most common material used is [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] due to its versatility and price; however, [[crystal]], [[resin]], faux or real stone, wood, metal, and [[glass]] are used. Prices of these deal toys vary based on size, type of material(s) used and the amount of customization.

One of the exclusive characteristics of acrylic is that it is one of the most optically clear materials available, even more so than glass, and it weighs about half as much as glass. Acrylic is resistant to many elements, including sunlight, rain, snow, pollutants and many chemicals. And because it’s a thermoplastic, it can be heated and formed into many different shapes.

Embedding in solid acrylic is a popular practice employed to showcase various objects. Different materials can be embedded, including paper, clear acetate, computer chips or even cast metal objects. Custom molds provide the acrylic block with its form. The liquid acrylic is poured into the mold. The objects are then placed in the acrylic. Various shapes are available, such as rectangular, cube, triangular, etc.

== 3D printing ==
Deal toys can be manufactured by [[3D printing]], which allows the creation of beautiful and complex tombstones compared with more conventional materials. The materials used for 3D printing a deal toy are [[polyamide]] and [[resin]].{{fact|date=September 2018}} These are often used in combination with other materials like, wood, stone, steel or [[acrylic resin|acrylic]].
[[File:Altrum-3D prints.jpg|thumb|3D prints with different painted finishes]]

==Status==
Deal toys are generally considered to be prized by the recipient, indicating achievement. Deal toys possessed by an individual can also serve as a reflection of his or her [[social status|status]], as they indicate the number of transactions with which they have been involved. They are displayed to help [[marketing|persuade]] potential  clients to work with a firm on their transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toys for Titans: How Wall Street Celebrates Its Deals |first=Suzanne |last=McGee |date=17 March 2014|journal=The Fiscal Times |url= http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/03/17/Toys-Titans-How-Wall-Street-Celebrates-Its-Deals |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green cadres (paramilitary)''' ({{lang-bs|Zeleni kadar}}) was a [[Bosniak]] nationalist paramilitary force during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Cadres paramilitary force|url=https://books.google.ba/books?id=TfQEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=Ne%C5%A1ad+Top%C4%8Di%C4%87&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vJ_M-svte_&amp;sig=QclXOwThzkms-INWwlMMQgkbztQ&amp;hl=bs&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YosRVb6ULY31aKnHgPgN&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=green&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were founded in early December 1941 as a reaction to a massacre on Bosniak men and women carried out in Foča by the Serb [[Chetniks]]. The organisation was formed in poor conditions and was not so supported at first by the Croatian puppet government. They rose to power after the Partisans started to burst deeper into [[Bosnia]]. Their leader was Nešad Topčić.

==History==
On 5 December 1941 the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] in agreement with the [[Chetnik]] commander Sergej Mihailović gave the city of [[Foča]] under Chetnik control, the Bosniak populated parts of the town started organizing their own "Muslim Defense Force". The poorly armed defense units couldn't prevent the massacres of Bosniaks in the [[Podrinje]] area of Bosnia.  After several attacks and massacres mainly against the civilians of that area, the prominent Bosniak leaders held a conference in [[Sarajevo]] on 28 August 1942 at which it was made clear that the [[NDH]] government was not doing anything in the defense of the Bosniak population in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genocide of Bosniaks in WWII|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/144030718/Genocid-nad-Muslimanima-1941-1945ocr|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That's why the prominent Bosniak leader Muhamed ef. Pandža made a statement where an immediate action of the NDH government is needed. They founded and proclaimed the "'''People's Committee of the National Salvation of Bosniaks'''" and the first tasks of the committee were to found the first Bosniak defense force after the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|fall of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=294&amp;walk_ID=57 |title= 'The History of Bosnia', for the European Stability Initiative |publisher=Esiweb.org |date= |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the conference led by Topčić went to Berlin to request from the Germans the establishment of an autonomous Bosnia and Herzegovina. Another two meetings were held but didn't get any successful result and the situation of the Bosniak population in NDH remained desperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rijaset.ba|title=Nešad Topčić, ef.

==Statute==
The conference also confirmed the statute of the defense forces. The statute contained many points but the main 4 that were related to the Green Cadres were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Cadres paramilitary force|url=https://books.google.ba/books?id=TfQEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=Ne%C5%A1ad+Top%C4%8Di%C4%87&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vJ_M-svte_&amp;sig=QclXOwThzkms-INWwlMMQgkbztQ&amp;hl=bs&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YosRVb6ULY31aKnHgPgN&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=green&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Protection of Bosniak populated areas in Bosnia
# Controlling the movement of Orthodox population in these areas
# The planning and preparations of action of the Green cadres need to be done with strict confidentiality.
# Traitors will be executed.

==1943 reorganization==
After the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] carried out several attacks in northeast Bosnia and suffered big losses in men, the key officials supporting the militia left it and joined side with the Partisans or the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]] army. The biggest reason for the reorganization was the death of [[Muhamed Hadžiefendić]] and the destruction of his "Muslim-Volunteer" legion. The Green cadres did not intend to be on any side but they were occasionally gifted with supplies which made them carry on.
The organisation was present in most towns in Bosnia and its main purpose still was to protect the civilian population from the [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] Chetnik forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001517.php |title=Jeremy Black's review of 'Genocide and Resistance' for the Social Affairs Unit |publisher=Socialaffairsunit.org.uk |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the war==
With the rapid advance of Tito's partisans in 1945 it was clear that the NDH government together with other [[Axis powers|Axis]] factions would collapse with the capitulation of Germany in May 1945. Most of the Green Cadres units which still were under control of some town councils took over control in agreement with the Partisans. Some of the units of the Green Cadres joined the Partisans and together liberated some areas in Bosnia. Most famously was the help in the liberation of [[Sarajevo]] were parts of the Green Cadres were incorporated into the 16th Partisan Muslim Brigade.

[[File:Hengist and Horsa.jpg|thumb|350px|The brothers in [[Edward Parrott]]'s ''Pageant of British History'' (1909)]]
'''Hengist''' and '''Horsa''' are [[legend|legendary]] brothers said to have led the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] in their invasion of Britain in the 5th century. Tradition lists Hengist as the first of the Jutish kings of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]].

According to early sources, Hengist and Horsa arrived in Britain at [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet|Ebbsfleet]] on the [[Isle of Thanet]]. For a time, they served as mercenaries for [[Vortigern]], [[King of the Britons]], but later they turned against him (British accounts have them betraying him in the [[Treachery of the Long Knives|Treachery
of the Long Knives]]). Horsa was killed fighting the Britons, but Hengist successfully conquered Kent, becoming the forefather of its kings.

A figure named Hengest, who may be identifiable with the leader of British legend, appears in the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'' and in ''[[Beowulf]]''. 

Legends of horse-associated founding brothers are attested among other [[Germanic peoples]] and appear in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures. As a result, scholars have theorized a [[Germanic mythology|pan-Germanic mythological]] origin for Hengist and Horsa, stemming originally from [[divine twins]] found in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. Other scholars, including [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], have argued for a historical basis for Hengist and Horsa.

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] names ''Hengest'' {{IPA-ang|hendʒest|}} and ''Horsa'' {{IPA-ang|horsɑ|}} mean "stallion" and "horse" respectively.&lt;ref name=MALLORY135&gt;Mallory (2005:135).&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Old English word for a horse was ''[[Ehwaz|eoh]]''. ''Eoh'' derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base ''*ekwo'', hence [[Latin]] ''equus'' which gave rise to the modern English words ''equine'' and ''equestrian''. ''Hors'' is derived from the Proto-Indo-European base ''*kurs'', to run, which also gave rise to ''hurry, carry'' and ''current'' (the latter two are borrowings from [[French language|French]]). ''Hors'' eventually replaced ''eoh'', fitting a pattern elsewhere in Germanic languages where the original names of sacred animals are abandoned in favour of adjectives; for example, the word ''[[Bear#Etymology|bear]]''. While the ''Ecclesiastical History'' and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' refer to the brother as ''Horsa'', in the ''History of the Britons'' his name is simply ''Hors''. It has been suggested that ''Horsa'' may be a pet form of a compound name with the first element "horse".&lt;ref name=TOLKEIN173&gt;Tolkien (2006:173).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Hengest'' is derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''hangistaz'' ("horse", "stallion"), from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''ḱanḱest-'' ("horse"). It is [[cognate]] with [[Modern German]] ''Hengst'', "stallion."

==Attestations==

===''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''===
In his 8th century ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Bede]] records that the first chieftains among the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in England were said to have been Hengist and Horsa. He relates that Horsa was killed in battle against the Britons and was thereafter buried in East Kent, where at the time of writing a monument still stood to him. According to Bede, Hengist and Horsa were the sons of [[Wictgils]], son of [[Witta, son of Wecta|Witta]], son of [[Wecta]], son of [[Woden]].&lt;ref name=SHERLEY-PRICE63&gt;Shirley-Price (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===
The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which exists in nine manuscripts and fragments, compiled from the 9th to the 12th centuries, records that in the year 449 Hengist and Horsa were invited to Britain by Vortigern to assist his forces in fighting the [[Picts]]. They landed at Eopwinesfleot (Ebbsfleet), and went on to defeat the Picts wherever they fought them. Hengist and Horsa sent word home to Germany describing "the worthlessness of the Britons, and the richness of the land" and asked for assistance. Their request was granted and support arrived. Afterward, more people arrived in Britain from "the three powers of Germany; the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes". The Saxons populated [[Essex]], [[Sussex]], and [[Wessex]]; the Jutes Kent, the [[Isle of Wight]], and part of [[Hampshire]]; and the Angles [[East Anglia]], [[Mercia]], and [[Northumbria]] (leaving their original homeland, [[Angeln]], deserted). The Worcester Chronicle (Chronicle D, compiled in the 11th century), and the Peterborough Chronicle (Chronicle E, compiled in the 12th century), include the detail that these forces were led by the brothers Hengist and Horsa, sons of Wihtgils, son of Witta, son of Wecta, son of Woden, but this information is not included in the A, B, C, or F versions.&lt;ref name=INGRAM13-14&gt;Ingram (1823:13-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the entry for the year 455 the ''Chronicle'' details that Hengist and Horsa fought with Vortigern at [[Battle of Aylesford|Aylesford]] and that Horsa died there. Hengist took control of the kingdom with his son [[Oisc of Kent|Esc]]. In 457, Hengist and Esc fought against British forces in [[Crayford]] "and there slew four thousand men". The Britons left the land of Kent and fled to London. In 465, Hengest and Esc fought again at the [[Battle of Wippedesfleot]], probably near Ebbsfleet, and slew twelve British leaders. In the year 473, the final entry in the ''Chronicle'' mentioning Hengist or Horsa, Hengist and Esc are recorded as having taken "immense booty" and the Britons having "fled from the English like fire".&lt;ref name=INGRAM15-16&gt;Ingram (1823:15-16).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''History of the Britons''===
[[File:Hengest and Horsa Verstegan.jpg|thumb|Hengist and Horsa arriving in Britain, by [[Richard Rowlands]] (1605)]]
The 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'', attributed to the Briton [[Nennius]], records that, during the reign of Vortigern in Britain, three vessels that had been exiled from Germany arrived in Britain, commanded by Hengist and Horsa. The narrative then gives a genealogy of the two: Hengist and Horsa were sons of Guictglis, son of Guicta, son of Guechta, son of Vouden, son of Frealof, son of Fredulf, son of Finn, son of Foleguald, son of Geta. Geta was said to be the son of a god, yet "not of the omnipotent God and our Lord Jesus Christ," but rather "the offspring of one of their idols, and whom, blinded by some demon, they worshipped according to the custom of the heathen." In 447 AD, Vortigern received Hengist and Horsa "as friends" and gave to the brothers the Isle of Thanet.&lt;ref name=GUNN18&gt;Gunn (1819:18).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Saxons had lived on Thanet for "some time" Vortigern promised them supplies of clothing and other provisions on condition that they assist him in fighting the enemies of his country. As the Saxons increased in number the Britons became unable to keep their agreement, and so told them their assistance was no longer needed and they should go home.&lt;ref name=GUNN22&gt;Gunn (1819:22).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern allowed Hengist to send for more of his countrymen to come over to fight for him. Messengers were sent to "[[Scythia]]", where "a number" of warriors were selected, and, with sixteen ships, the messengers returned. With the men came Hengist's beautiful daughter. Hengist prepared a feast, inviting Vortigern, Vortigern's officers, and Ceretic, his translator. Prior to the feast, Hengist enjoined his daughter to serve the guests plenty of wine and ale so that they would become drunk. At the feast Vortigern became enamored with her and promised Hengist whatever he liked in exchange for her betrothal. Hengist, having "consulted with the Elders who attended him of the Angle race," demanded Kent. Without the knowledge of the then-ruler of Kent, Vortigern agreed.&lt;ref name=GUNN22-23&gt;Gunn (1819:22–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist's daughter was given to Vortigern, who slept with her and deeply loved her. Hengist told him that he would now be both his father and adviser and that he would know no defeat with his counsel, "for the people of my country are strong, warlike, and robust." With Vortigern's approval, Hengist would send for his son and his brother to fight against the Scots and those who dwelt near the wall. Vortigern agreed and [[Octa of Kent|Ochta]] and Ebissa arrived with 40 ships, sailed around the land of the Picts, conquered "many regions," and assaulted the Orkney Islands. Hengist continued to send for more ships from his country, so that some islands where his people had previously dwelt are now free of inhabitants.&lt;ref name=GUNN23-24&gt;Gunn (1819:23–24).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern had meanwhile incurred the wrath of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre]] (by taking his own daughter for a wife and having a son by her) and had gone into hiding at the advice of his counsel. But at length his son [[Vortimer]] engaged Hengist and Horsa and their men in battle, drove them back to Thanet and there enclosed them and beset them on the western flank. The war waxed and waned; the Saxons repeatedly gained ground and were repeatedly driven back.&lt;ref name=GUNN29&gt;Gunn (1819:29).&lt;/ref&gt; Vortimer attacked the Saxons four times: first enclosing the Saxons in Thanet, secondly fighting at the river [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent]], the third time at [[Battle of Aylesford|Epsford]], where both Horsa and Vortigern's son [[Catigern]] died, and lastly "near the stone on the shore of the Gallic sea," where the Saxons were defeated and fled to their ships.

After a "short interval" Vortimer died and the Saxons became established, "assisted by foreign pagans." Hengist convened his forces and sent to Vortigern an offer of peace. Vortigern accepted, and Hengist prepared a feast to bring together the British and Saxon leaders.&lt;ref name=GUNN30-31&gt;Gunn (1819:30–31).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he instructed his men to conceal knives beneath their feet. At the right moment, Hengist shouted ''nima der [[seax|sexa]]'' (get your knives) and his men massacred the unsuspecting Britons. However, they spared Vortigern, who ransomed himself by giving the Saxons Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, and other unnamed districts.&lt;ref name=GUNN31-32&gt;Gunn (1819:31–32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanus of Auxerre was acclaimed as commander of the British forces. By praying, singing [[hallelujah]] and crying to God, the Saxons were driven to the sea.  Germanus then prayed for three days and nights at Vortigern's castle and fire fell from heaven and engulfed the castle. Vortigern, Hengist's daughter, Vortigern's other wives, and all other inhabitants burned to death.

[[File:Hamilton Vortigern &amp; Rowena.jpg|thumb|Vortigern and Rowena, by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]] (1793)]]
In his pseudo-historical twelfth century work ''[[The History of the Kings of Britain]]'', [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] adapted and greatly expanded the account in the ''History of the Britons''. Hengist and Horsa appear in books 6 and 8:

====Book 6====
Geoffrey records that three [[brigandines]] or long galleys arrived in Kent, full of armed men and commanded by two brothers, Hengist and Horsa. Vortigern was then staying at Dorobernia ([[Canterbury]]), and ordered that the "tall strangers" be received peacefully and brought to him. When Vortigern saw the company, he immediately observed that the brothers "excelled all the rest both in nobility and in gracefulness of person." He asked what country they had come from and why they had come to his kingdom. Hengist ("whose years and wisdom entitled him to precedence") replied that they had left their homeland of Saxony to offer their services to Vortigern or some other prince, as part of a Saxon custom in which, when the country became overpopulated, able young men were chosen by lot to seek their fortunes in other lands. Hengist and Horsa were made generals over the exiles, as befitted their noble birth.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON116-117&gt;Thompson (1842:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern was aggrieved when he learned that the strangers were pagans, but nonetheless rejoiced at their arrival, since he was surrounded by enemies. He asked Hengist and Horsa if they would help him in his wars, offering them land and "other possessions." They accepted the offer, settled on an agreement, and stayed with Vortigern at his court. Soon after, the Picts came from [[Alba]] with an immense army and attacked the northern parts of Vortigern's kingdom. In the ensuing battle "there was little occasion for the Britons to exert themselves, for the Saxons fought so bravely, that the enemy, formerly victorious, were speedily put to flight."&lt;ref name=THOMPSON117-118&gt;Thompson (117–118).&lt;/ref&gt;

In gratitude Vortigern increased the rewards he has promised to the brothers. Hengist was given "large possessions of lands in [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] for the subsistence of himself and his fellow-soldiers." A "man of experience and subtilty," Hengist told Vortigern that his enemies assailed him from every quarter, and that his subjects wished to depose him and make [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] king. He asked the king to allow him to send word to Saxony for more soldiers. Vortigern agreed, adding that Hengist could invite over whom he pleases and that "you shall have no refusal from me in whatever you shall desire."&lt;ref name=THOMPSON118-119&gt;Thompson (1842:118–119).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist bowed low in thanks, and made a further request, that he be made a consul or prince, as befitted his birth. Vortigern responded that it was not in his power to do this, reasoning that Hengist was a foreign pagan and would not be accepted by the British lords. Hengist asked instead for leave to build a fortress on a piece of land small enough that it could be encircled by a leather thong.  Vortigern granted this and ordered Hengist to invite more Saxons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON118-119&gt;Thompson (1842:118–119).&lt;/ref&gt;

After executing Vortigern's orders, Hengist took a bull's hide and made it into a single thong, which he used to encircle a carefully-chosen rocky place (perhaps at [[Caistor]] in Lindsey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of King Arthur|last=Ashley|first=Michael|date=2005|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nBWeBAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson]]|isbn=1472107659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he built the castle of ''Kaercorrei'', or in Saxon ''Thancastre'': "thong castle."&lt;ref name=THOMPSON119&gt;Thompson (1842:119).&lt;/ref&gt;

The messengers returned from Germany with eighteen ships full of the best soldiers they could get, as well as Hengist's beautiful daughter [[Rowena]]. Hengist invited Vortigern to see his new castle and the newly arrived soldiers. A banquet was held in Thancastre, at which Vortigern drunkenly asked Hengist to let him marry Rowena. Horsa and the men all agreed that Hengist should allow the marriage, on the condition that Vortigern gave him Kent.&lt;ref name=THOMPSOIN120-121&gt;Thompson (1842:120–121).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern and Rowena were immediately married and Hengist was given Kent. The king was delighted with his new wife, but he incurred the hatred of his nobles and of his three sons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON121&gt;Thompson (1842:121).&lt;/ref&gt;

As his new father-in-law, Hengist made further demands of Vortigern:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:As I am your father, I claim the right of being your counsellor: do not therefore slight my advice, since it is to my countrymen you must owe the conquest of all your enemies. Let us invite over my son Octa, and his brother Ebissa, who are brave soldiers, and give them the countries that are in the northern parts of Britain, by [[Hadrian's wall|the wall]], between [[Deira]] and Alba. For they will hinder the inroads of the barbarians, and so you shall enjoy peace on the other side of the [[Humber]].&lt;ref name=THOMPSON121-122&gt;Thompson (1842:121–122).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vortigern agreed. Upon receiving the invitation, Octa, Ebissa, and another lord, [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cherdich]], immediately left for Britain with three hundred ships. Vortigern received them kindly, and gave them ample gifts. With their assistance, Vortigern defeated his enemies in every engagement. All the while Hengist continued inviting over yet more ships, adding to his numbers daily. Witnessing this, the Britons tried to get Vortigern to banish the Saxons, but on account of his wife he would not. Consequently, his subjects turned against him and took his son Vortimer for their king. The Saxons and the Britons, led by Vortimer, met in four battles. In the second, Horsa and Vortimer's brother, Catigern, slew one another. By the fourth battle, the Saxons had fled to Thanet, where Vortimer besieged them. When the Saxons could no longer bear the British onslaughts, they sent out Vortigern to ask his son to allow them safe passage back to Germany. While discussions were taking place, the Saxons boarded their ships and left, leaving their wives and children behind.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON122-123&gt;Thompson (1842:122–123).&lt;/ref&gt;

The victorious Vortimer was poisoned by Rowena, and Vortigern returned to the throne.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON123&gt;Thompson (1842:123).&lt;/ref&gt; At his wife's request he invited Hengist back to Britain, but instructed him to bring only a small retinue. Hengist, knowing Vortimer to be dead, instead raised an army of 300,000 men. When Vortigern caught word of the imminent arrival of the vast Saxon fleet, he resolved to fight them. Rowena alerted her father of this, who, after considering various strategies, resolved to make a show of peace and sent ambassadors to Vortigern.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON124-125&gt;Thompson (1842:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambassadors informed Vortigern that Hengist had only brought so many men because he did not know of Vortimer's death and feared further attacks from him. Now that there was no threat, Vortigern could choose from among the men the ones he wished to return to Germany. Vortigern was greatly pleased by these tidings, and arranged to meet Hengist on the first of May at the monastery of Ambrius.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON125&gt;Thompson (1842:125).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the meeting, Hengist ordered his soldiers to carry long daggers beneath their clothing. At the signal ''Nemet oure Saxas'' (get your knives), the Saxons fell upon the unsuspecting Britons and massacred them, while Hengist held Vortigern by his cloak. 460 British barons and consuls were killed, as well as some Saxons whom the Britons beat to death with club and stones. Vortigern was held captive and threatened with death until he resigned control of Britain's chief cities to Hengist. Once free, he fled to [[Cambria]].&lt;ref name=THOMPSON125-126&gt;Thompson (1842:125–126).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book 8====
In Cambria, [[Merlin]] prophesied to Vortigern that the brothers [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon]], who had fled to [[Armorica]] as children after Vortigern killed their brother and father, would return to have their revenge and defeat the Saxons. They arrived the next day, and, after rallying the dispersed Britons, Aurelius was proclaimed king. Aurelius marched into Cambria and burned Vortigern alive in his tower, before setting his sights upon the Saxons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON149&gt;Thompson (1842:149).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist was struck by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the approach of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not to be afraid of Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near [[Sheffield]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=English |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Maisbeli: A Place-Name Problem from Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/11.short?rss=1 |journal=Notes &amp; Queries |volume=259 |pages=11–13 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON149/&gt;

As they marched to meet the Saxons, [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester|Eldol]], Duke of [[Gloucester]] told Aurelius that he greatly wished to meet Hengist in combat, noting that "one of the two of us should die before we parted." He explained that he had been at the Treachery of the Long Knives, but had escaped when God threw him a stake to defend himself with, making him the only Briton present to survive. Meanwhile, Hengist was placing his troops into formation, giving directions, and walking through the lines of troops, "the more to spirit them up."&lt;ref name=THOMPSON150-151&gt;Thompson (1842:150–151).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the armies in formation, battle began between the Britons and Saxons, both sides shedding "no small loss of blood." Eldol focused on attempting to find Hengist, but had no opportunity to fight him. "By the especial favour of God," the Britons took the upper hand, and the Saxons withdrew and made for Kaerconan ([[Conisbrough]]). Aurelius pursued them, killing or enslaving any Saxon he met on the way. Realizing Kaerconan would not hold against Aurelius, Hengist stopped outside the town and ordered his men to make a stand, "for he knew that his whole security now lay in his sword."&lt;ref name=THOMPSON151-152&gt;Thompson (1842:151–152).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurelius reached Hengist, and a "most furious" fight ensued, with the Saxons maintaining their ground despite heavy losses. They came close to winning before a detachment of horses from the Armorican Britons arrived. When [[Gorlois]], Duke of [[Cornwall]] arrived, Eldol knew the day was won and grabbed Hengist's helmet, dragging him into the British ranks. The Saxons fled. Hengist's son Octa retreated to [[York]] and his kinsman Eosa to Alclud ([[Dumbarton]]).&lt;ref name=THOMPSON153&gt;Thompson (1842:153).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the battle, Aurelius called together a council of principal officers to decide what would be done with Hengist. Eldol's brother Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Though all should be unanimous for setting him at liberty, yet would I cut him to pieces. The prophet [[Samuel (bible)|Samuel]] is my warrant, who, when he had [[Agag]], king of [[Amalek]], in his power, hewed him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do therefore the same to Hengist, who is a second Agag.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154&gt;Thompson (1842:154).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Consequently, Eldol drew Hengist out of the city and cut off his head. Aurelius, "who showed moderation in all his conduct," arranged for him to be buried and for a [[Tumulus|mound]] to be raised over his corpse, according to the custom of pagans.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154/&gt; Octa and Eosa surrendered to Aurelius, who granted them the country bordering Scotland and made a firm covenant with them.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154-155&gt;Thompson (1842:154–155).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
Hengist is briefly mentioned in ''[[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue]]'', the first book of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the 13th century. In ''Prologue'', a [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of Germanic history is given, including that Woden put three of his sons in charge of Saxony. The ruler of eastern Saxony was Veggdegg, one of whose sons was Vitrgils, the father of Vitta, the father of Hengist.&lt;ref name=FAULKES4&gt;Faulkes (1995:4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horse-head gables==
On farmhouses in [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]], horse-head [[gable]]s were referred to as "Hengst und Hors" as late as around 1875. [[Rudolf Simek]] notes that these horse heads gables can still be seen today, and says that the horse-head gables confirm that Hengist and Horsa were originally considered mythological, horse-shaped beings.&lt;ref name=SIMEK139&gt;Simek (2007:139).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] comments that the horse heads may have been remnants of pagan religious practices in the area.&lt;ref name=WEST190&gt;West (2007:190).&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations in (or originating in) the [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen|Raiffeisen]] farmers' co-operative movement use designs based on the horse-head gable in their trade-marks.

==Theories==
===''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''===
A Hengest appears in line 34 of the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'', which describes the legendary [[Battle of Finnsburg]]. In ''[[Beowulf]]'', a [[scop]] recites a composition summarizing the Finnsburg events, including information not provided in the fragment. Hengest is mentioned in lines 1082 and 1091.&lt;ref name=CHICKERINGJR111AND113&gt;Chickering Jr. (2006:111 and 1113).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have proposed that the figure mentioned in both of these references is one and the same as the Hengist of the Hengist and Horsa accounts, though Horsa is not mentioned in either source. In his work ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', Tolkien argued that Hengist was a historical figure, and that Hengist came to Britain after the events recorded in the ''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''. [[Patrick Sims-Williams]] is more skeptical of the account, suggesting that Bede's Canterbury source, which he relied on for his account of Hengist and Horsa in the ''Ecclesiastical History'', had confused two separate traditions.&lt;ref name=WALLACE-HADRILL215&gt;Wallace-Hadrill (1993:215).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic twin brothers and divine Indo-European horse twins===
Several sources attest that the Germanic peoples venerated a divine pair of twin brothers. The earliest reference to this practice derives from [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] (c. 345 – c. 250 BC). Timeaus records that the Celts of the [[North Sea]] were especially devoted to [[Interpretatio graeca|what he describes as]] [[Castor and Pollux]]. In his work  ''Germania'', [[Tacitus]] records the veneration of the [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]], whom he identifies with Castor and Pollux. Germanic legends mention various brothers as founding figures. The 1st- or 2nd-century historian [[Cassius Dio]] cites the brothers [[Raos and Raptos]] as the leaders of the [[Hasdingi|Astings]]. According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th century ''[[History of the Lombards]]'', the [[Lombards]] migrated southward from Scandinavia led by [[Ibur and Aio]], while [[Saxo Grammaticus]] records in his 12th century ''[[Gesta Danorum|Deeds of the Danes]]'' that this migration was prompted by [[Aggi and Ebbi]]. In related Indo-European cultures, similar traditions are attested, such as the [[Dioscuri]]. Scholars have theorized that these divine twins in Indo-European cultures stem from divine twins in prehistoric Proto-Indo-European culture.&lt;ref name=PROTO-INDO&gt;Simek (2007:59–60) and Mallory (2005:135).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. P. Mallory]] comments on the great importance of the horse in Indo-European religion, as exemplified "most obviously" by various mythical brothers appearing in Indo-European legend, including Hengist and Horsa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Some would maintain that the ''premier'' animal of the Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse. We have already seen how its embedment in Proto-Indo-European society lies not just in its lexical reconstruction but also in the proliferation of personal names which contain "horse" as an element among the various Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, we witness the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins "horsemen," the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of [[Macha]], born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.&lt;ref name=MALLORY135/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Uffington White Horse===
[[File:White horse from air.jpg|thumb|The [[Uffington White Horse]]]]
In his 17th century work ''Monumenta Britannica'', [[John Aubrey]] ascribes the [[Uffington White Horse]] [[hill figure]] to Hengist and Horsa, stating that "the White Horse was their Standard at the Conquest of Britain". However, elsewhere he ascribes the origins of the horse to the pre-Roman Britons, reasoning that the horse resembles certain Iron Age British coins. As a result, advocates of a Saxon origin of the figure debated with those favoring an ancient British origin for three centuries after Aubrey's findings. In 1995, using [[optically stimulated luminescence]] dating, David Miles and Simon Palmer of the [[Oxford Archaeology|Oxford Archaeological Unit]] assigned the Uffington White Horse to the late [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=SCHWYZER45AND56&gt;Schwyzer (1999:45 and 56).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aschanes===
The [[Brothers Grimm]] identified Hengist with [[Aschanes]], mythical first King of the Saxons, in their notes for legend number 413 of their ''German Legends''.&lt;ref&gt;''The German Legends of the Brothers Grimm'' volume 2, edited and translated by Donald Ward, Millington Books, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Editor and translator Donald Ward, in his commentary on the tale, regards the identification as untenable on linguistic grounds.

==Modern influence==
Hengist and Horsa have appeared in a variety of media in the modern period. Written between 1616 and 1620, [[Thomas Middleton]]'s play ''[[Hengist, King of Kent]]'' features portrayals of both Hengist and Horsa (as ''Hersus'').&lt;ref name=TAYLORLAVAGNINO1448&gt;Taylor. Lavagnino (2007:1148).&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 6, 1776, the first committee for the production of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] convened. One of three members of the committee, [[Thomas Jefferson]], proposed that one side of the seal feature Hengist and Horsa, "the Saxon chiefs from whom we claim the honor of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we assumed".&lt;ref name=MERILL98&gt;Merill (1970:98).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hengist and Horsus" appear as antagonists in [[William Henry Ireland]]'s play ''[[Vortigern and Rowena]]'', which was touted as a newly discovered work by [[William Shakespeare]] in 1796, but was soon revealed as a hoax.&lt;ref name="CamelotProject"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/ireland.htm|title= Vortigern |work= The Camelot Project|publisher= University of Rochester|date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair have plaques in the [[Walhalla Temple]] at [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], which honours distinguished figures of German history.&lt;ref name=EVERILL12&gt;Everill (1845:12).&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[World War II]], two British [[military glider]]s took their names from the brothers: the [[Slingsby Hengist]]&lt;ref name=NIGL19&gt;Nigl (2007:19).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Airspeed Horsa]].&lt;ref name=FREDERIKSEN14&gt;Frédriksen (2001:14).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century American poet [[Robinson Jeffers]] composed a poem titled ''Ode to Hengist and Horsa''.&lt;ref name=HUNT423&gt;Hunt (1991:423).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, [[Prince George Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Georg of Denmark]] came to [[Pegwell Bay]] in Kent to dedicate the longship ''[[Hugin (longship)|Hugin]]'', commemorating the landing of Hengest and Horsa at nearby Ebbsfleet 1500 years earlier in 449 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WME8QE_Beginning_of_English_History_Commemoration_Stone_Pegwell_Bay_Kent_UK | title = Beginning of English History" Commemoration Stone - Pegwell Bay, Kent, UK - UK Historical Markers on Waymarking.com | accessdate = 2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hengist and Horsa are not referenced in the medieval tales of [[King Arthur]], some modern Arthurian tales do link them. For example, in [[Mary Stewart (novelist) |Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[Merlin Trilogy]]'' it is King Arthur who kills Hengist. In [[Alfred Duggan]]'s ''[[Conscience of the King]]'', Hengist plays a major role in the early career of [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic Elesing]], legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex.

[[File:MochePortrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|Moche Portrait pot. This fine pot appears to represent a good-humored Moche man.]]
'''Huaco''' or '''Guaco''' is the generic name given in [[Peru]] mostly to earthen vessels and other finely made [[ceramic art|pottery artworks]] by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] found in [[pre-Columbian]] sites such as burial locations, sanctuaries, temples and other ancient ruins. Huacos are not mere [[earthenware]] but notable pottery specimens linked to ceremonial, religious, artistic or aesthetic uses in central [[Andes|Andean]], pre-Columbian civilizations.

The [[Huari culture|Huari]] (Wari), along with the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], the [[Moche culture|Moche]] and others, were among the major creators of figurines who passed down through history their unique skills in ceramics. The Incas, who absorbed all the cultures in the time of its expansion, also produced huacos.

==Etymology==
Since the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], these types of pieces have been found in pre-Columbian sites like [[temple]]s, [[Grave (burial)|graves]] and burials, as well as other kinds of [[ruin]]s. These sites, especially if they are of a sacred meaning, are called generic '''[[huaca]]''' or ''waqa'' in native [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], where it is likely that the figurines take their name. In Peru, a '''huaquero''' is a person that digs in ancient [[pre-Columbian]] ruins illegally in order to get valuable pieces of artwork, usually destroying the structure.

==Variety of styles and colors==
The bridge handles are characteristic of some cultures; some used many colors, while others used black and dull red or few colors.  [[Inca Empire]] adopted all sorts of shapes, styles and qualities. The term "huaco" was reserved for any copies not reserved for daily use but the luxury or ritual.

Normally these ceramic pieces are associated with notable features. Sculptured figurines depict complex, stylized volumes, including cultural scenes, buildings, and naturalistic volumes such as portrait ceramics representing human faces (for example, the [[Moche Portrait Ceramic]]) or body parts by way of [[votive offering]], erotica, tools, various fruits and foods, animals, etc.

When the pieces are sculptural ceramics, huacos are characterized by pictorial richness. There are many kinds of pots and containers covered with gaudy polychrome motifs, usually anthropomorphic representations of animals or mythological, erotica, etc. Two-toned [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery is characterized by complex painted scenes detailing a narrative level. Examples of erotic huacos ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''huacos eróticos''), make the Moche's 800-year period (''c.'' 200 BC to ''c.'' 600 AD) the longest unbroken erotic ceramics tradition in the world, unique in the history of mankind.&lt;ref name="SexPot"&gt;{{Cite book | last= Mathieu | first= Paul |author2=Catherine Hess | title= Sex Pots: Eroticism in Ceramics | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q6oP8nM5EoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | accessdate= 1 December 2009 | origyear= 2003 | year= 2003 | publisher=  Rutgers University Press | location= New Brunswick, New Jersey | isbn=0-8135-3293-0 | page =22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s during the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo]] and his clerical advisers worked to destroy many erotic huacos, though some extant artifacts have survived.

In both cases the huaco is associated with ceramic complexity (in its volume or decoration) and not with regular use as a container on account of  its physical dimensions. The slender Incan vessels known as ''aryballos'', even opulently created examples, are not usually considered ''huacos'' since their utilitarian character is too pronounced.

==Museum exhibits==
The [[National Museum of the Archaeology, Anthropology, and History of Peru]] in [[Lima, Peru]] houses a large number of ceramic artifacts. The nearby [[Larco Museum]] houses a large collection of Moche ceramics and is well known for its collection of erotic pottery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28846">The '''Indigo Era''', or "Indigo economies", is a concept first publicized in early 2016 by international businessman [[Mikhail Fridman]], the co-founder of [[LetterOne]], an international investment business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/contributor/mikhail-fridman/ "Mikhail Fridman"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Retrieved 13 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe what he views as an emerging new era of economies and economics based on ideas, innovation, and creativity, which he sees as replacing economies which are based on the possession of [[natural resources]]. The word "indigo" was initially chosen based on the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.

He describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is "a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer [[resource rent]] but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt; But, according to Fridman – based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns – it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.

In late 2016 LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere [[GDP]] as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to "stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt;

==Indigo Era==
The economic term "Indigo Era" was publicized in early 2016 by [[Mikhail Fridman]], the co-founder of the international investment business [[LetterOne]].&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He used the term to describe the new economic era based on ideas, innovation, and creativity – which he theorizes is replacing the previous era which he sees as defined by the struggle for [[natural resources]] and land that contains them, and which is measured by [[GDP]]. The word "indigo" was adopted from the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.&lt;ref name=realclear&gt;Fridman, Mikhail.

''[[Times of Israel]]''. 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' website adds that the indigo symbolism "embodies a breaking of the norm, something that is highly reflective of the new era that we are entering into, one that lacks convention and is driven by innovation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/symbolism-of-indigo/ "Symbolism of Indigo"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2016 article in ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', retitled and reprinted in May 2016 in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', and reprinted in November 2016 under the original title in LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal, Fridman wrote:

{{quote|We are entering a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity. A new generation of curious, strong-willed and talented individuals is unhindered by convention or the past. This new “Indigo” generation is now shaping tomorrow's economy and creating national wealth. I use the term Indigo because it has been used to refer to children with special or unusual abilities.

===Analysis===
In a series of articles published in 2016, Fridman cites the recent extreme volatility in markets,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; and worldwide political change and instability,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; as signs of an emerging global shift.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya/mir/319431-pokolenie-indigo-vkhod-svobodnyi "Поколение индиго. Вход свободный"] (in Russian). ''[[Forbes]]''. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admission&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/the-indigo-generation-admission-free/ "The Indigo Generation. Admission Free"]. ABH Holdings. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; He notes two frequently cited prominent indicators of an economic shift: the sharp decline in prices of natural resources including oil, and the slowing of China's economic growth despite this decline in the cost of natural resources.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/fundamentals-of-a-strong-economy/ "Fundamentals of a strong economy"]. ABH Holdings. 30 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

He and other commentators also note the rise of populism and populist leaders and candidates, both right-wing and left-wing, as these changes occur.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;[[Stanley Greenberg|Greenberg, Stanley]]. [http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/we-need-a-new-progressive-era-of-renewal/ "We Need a New Progressive Era of Renewal"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Meanwhile, companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] – digital and technological companies he calls "Indigo companies" – have replaced longterm traditional natural-resource or manufacturing companies such as [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] as the world's largest companies.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;

Fridman observes that throughout history innovations, alternatives, and technologies have always overcome any perceived shortages of any natural resource.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt; He therefore posits that the new "Indigo era", fueled by digital and technological resources, will be marked by a shift away from the struggle for natural resources and their perceived scarcity, to a reliance on ideas, innovation, and creativity and on supporting the intellectual and creative potential of each human being:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; "The world has entered a new era where the source of a nation's wealth is no longer natural resources. Intellectual capacity has now replaced land, raw materials and trade routes as the biggest source of wealth."&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;

According to Fridman, three interconnected factors are needed for successful Indigo companies and an Indigo economy:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;
*intuitive individual talent and a high level of education, plus the ability to form a team of equally educated and gifted people 
*a sophisticated and complex ecosystem, which includes not only legal systems that protect physical and intellectual property rights and protection from takeover by larger companies, but also  thousands of suppliers and subcontractors to supply high-quality services which range from venture capital to marketing to web design and other technologies and services
*a global digital infrastructure to distribute new products and accumulate customer data and customer-behavior insight

He notes that most emerging economies have focused on building physical structures (roads, buildings, cities, physical infrastructure) rather than the complex legal, political, and social systems, institutions, and changes that will support an effective free and innovative intellectual-resource economy.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; The freedoms, protections, and political and legal frameworks of developed Western countries rest on centuries-long histories, socio-political traditions, and mindsets, and therefore will be difficult to replicate quickly in emerging economies.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman singles out India as an emerging country that has adequate legal infrastructure and freedom to probably survive the Indigo shift.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

Fridman considers the growth of Indigo economies to be a paradigm shift; he states that the pace at which technology is developing is creating worldwide tectonic shifts, and predicts huge global change over the next five to ten years.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He and other analysts predict that the growing economic gap between free, creative economies and groups in contrast to repressive, authoritarian, totalitarian, or tradition-bound economies or groups will widen and create resentment and hostilities – whether this is between nations or within nations.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/editorial/ "Editorial"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Those left behind may be either emerging countries, or the average person – as opposed to the intellectual elites – within developed Western countries.&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

Authoritarian leaders and authoritarianism often rise during periods of uncertainty and insecurity and economic deprivation.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman maintains however that in this ever-changing new economic era, the main source of wealth in a country or region will no longer be a natural resource, but a social infrastructure that will allow everyone to realise their intellectual and creative potential.&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;&lt;ref name=forsal/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt; Therefore, he asserts that "The future Indigo economy is an economy of free people. And this means that the world will become more and more free."&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

In November 2016 [[LetterOne]] launched a journal, ''Global Perspectives'', as a platform to explore "the new emerging economic era, the Indigo era, from different perspectives, including education, religion, politics, economics, history and business" and to examine "global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letterone.com/insight/the-global-perspectives-journal "The Global Perspectives Journal examines global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world"].

==Indigo Index and Indigo Score==
The November 2016 inaugural issue of ''Global Perspectives'' also published an Indigo Index,&lt;ref name=score&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/indigo-score/ "Indigo Score"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/news_2016_en.html "''Global Perspectives'' publishes the Indigo Score"].

==Indigo Prize==
In July 2017, LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal announced the Indigo Prize, to stimulate discussion towards finding a new way of measuring the economy in the 21st century that moves beyond the limitations of mere GDP measurements.&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched&gt;[http://www.letterone.com/media/news/2017/major-new-economics-competition-launched-100000-indigo-prize "Major new economics competition launched - £100,000 Indigo Prize"].

'''John Bennett Black''' (1883–1964) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[historian]] whose primary topic of study was of [[Elizabethan England]]. He was Professor of History at the [[University of Aberdeen]] where a prize is awarded each year in his name. He wrote ''The Reign of Elizabeth'' the second volume of the [[Oxford History of England]] series to appear (although it was Volume 8 in the 15-volume series). His 1926 work [[The Art of History]], though now superseded, was the first important scholarly consideration of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[historiography]] of the twentieth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8079">'''Jan Gijsbert Pieter Best''' (born 29 August 1941, [[Grou]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[prehistory|pre-]] and [[protohistory|protohistorian]], comparative linguist, archaeologist, and author. For about 30 years, he was a Professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he taught [[ancient history]], and Mediterranean prehistory and protohistory.

==Education==
In 1966, Best passed his graduate examinations in Classical Languages, achieving a major in Ancient History, along with minors in Greek and Latin. In 1969, he attained the doctorate with his thesis ''Thracian Peltasts and their Influence on Greek Warfare''. Afterwards, he succeeded in his graduate examination in Archaeology, with a major in Cultural Pre- and Protohistory, and minors in Classical Archaeology and Provincial Roman Archaeology. In all of these three graduate programs, he graduated ''cum laude''.

==Experience==
From 1962 to 1991, Best worked in the University of Amsterdam, respectively as assistant classical archaeology, associate professor ancient history and coordinator of the study Mediterranean Pre- and Protohistory.

===Dyadovo===
Best also conducted several additional projects. These include his role, from 1975 to 1979, as a co-leader of the excavation of the settlement at [[Dyadovo]] (Djadovo, [[:bg:Дядово]]), which is a Dutch-Bulgarian-Japanese [[UNESCO]] project in [[Bulgaria]]. According to Best, the excavations at this site showed that, around 3200 BC, a layer with a culture of matriarchal character (many 'goddess figurines' were found) was destroyed by fire. Then, over above an undisturbed natural deposition layer 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm deep, a settlement of livestock-herding nomadic culture-bearers from the steppes has been identified. This created a fusion of these two peoples, as is evident in the findings from the [[Varna Necropolis|cemetery of Varna]]; this may have been the genesis of the ancient [[Thracian]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jangpbest.nl/etnogenese-van-thraciers.php The ethnogenesis of the Thracians] (in Dutch) www.jangpbest.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dyadovo Tell is one of the largest settlement mounds in Southeastern Europe. The excavations here started in 1977–1978. Since then, the Bulgarian and the Dutch archaeological teams continued the excavations; a Japanese team from [[Tokai University]] also participated later. The results revealed that the tell had been inhabited through most archaeological periods, including the Middle Ages, the Early Byzantine Period, the Roman Period, the Early Iron Age, the Bronze Age and the Copper Age.&lt;ref&gt;Boris D. Borisov, [https://www.academia.edu/2160018 Dyadovo. Vol. 2. The Sanctuary of the Thracian Horseman and The Early Byzantine fortress.] 2010. Varna&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 until 1984, Best was professor-secretary of the International Committee of [[Thracology]] 'Wilhelm Tomaschek' with the 'Association Internationale des Études Sud-Est-Européens'&lt;ref&gt;Association Internationale des Études Sud-Est-Européens is nowadays the CISH, Comité International des Sciences Historiques (International Committee of Historical Sciences)&lt;/ref&gt; (Unesco-comité AIESEE).

During the eighties he was general advisor of the exhibitions 'The Gold of the Thracians' in [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] (1984) and 'The Thracian Royal Treasure' in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)]] (1989).

==Deciphering ancient scripts== 
Best is one of the initiators of [[Alverna Research Group]] which specialises in deciphering of so-far unknown scripts.

With the already known Egyptian [[hieroglyphs]], his reconstruction of [[Linear A]] and [[Cretan hieroglyphs|Cretan hieroglyphic]], Jan Best is convinced to have deciphered the [[Byblos syllabary|Byblos script]] successfully after 40 years of research.&lt;ref&gt;''Ugarit-Forschungen 40 (2009)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of his 2010 book ''Het Byblosschrift ontcijferd'' (''The Byblos Script deciphered'') were somewhat mixed. Best proposed that the syllabic Linear A Script from Crete has a number of Semitic characteristics. Yet this idea encountered some resistance among those scholars who specialise in Ancient Greek. These scholars tend to believe that Crete is linked with the origins of the Hellenistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwtonline.nl/00/nt/nl/0/product/61192/index.html   NWT Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724162628/http://www.nwtonline.nl/00/nt/nl/0/product/61192/index.html |date=2011-07-24 }} en [http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/article/detail/982518/2010/05/29/Amsterdamse-archeoloog-kraakt-oud-Byblos-schrift.dhtml   Volkskrant, Frank van Kolfschooten, 29 mei 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
In 1991 Best was co-founder and director of Najade Press, a publishing company issuing the international magazine ''Thamyris, Mythmaking from Past to Present''. From 2001 onwards it is edited by publishing company Rodopi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodopi.nl/   website Rodopi]&lt;/ref&gt; in the new series ''Thamyris, Intersecting, Place, Sex and Race''.
Best is an author since 1992. He writes travel books for Gottmer Publishers Group. In October 2010 his book ''Het Byblosschrift ontcijferd'' (''The Byblos Syllabary deciphered'') appeared with publishing company Bert Bakker.

{{Events leading to World War II}}
The '''Japanese invasion of Manchuria''' began on 19 September 1931, when the [[Kwantung Army]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Manchuria]] immediately following the [[Mukden Incident]]. After the war, the Japanese established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]]. Their occupation lasted until the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] launched the [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] in 1945.

The eastern parts of Manchuria and most of the [[Korean Peninsula]] were already under the control of the Japanese empire since the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=River |first1=Charles |title=The invasion of Manchuria and the rape of Nanjing |asin=B01IMNDLUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's ongoing industrialization and militarization ensured his growing dependence on oil and metal imports from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Michael |title=The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew (Modern War Studies) |isbn=978-0700623754}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American sanctions which prevented trade with the United States (which had occupied the [[First Philippine Republic|Philippines]] around the same time) resulted in Japan furthering their expansion in the territory of China and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Michael |title=In Manchuria: A Village Called Wasteland and the Transformation of Rural China |isbn=978-1620402887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial annexation==
The Chinese–Japanese dispute in July 1931 known as the [[Wanpaoshan Incident]] was followed by the [[Mukden Incident]]. On 18 September 1931 the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]], which had decided upon a policy of localizing the incident, communicated its decision to the [[Kwantung Army]] command. However, Kwantung Army [[commander-in-chief]] General [[Shigeru Honjō]] instead ordered his forces to proceed to expand operations all along the [[South Manchuria Railway]]. Under orders from Lieutenant General [[Jirō Tamon]], troops of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Division]] moved up the rail line and captured virtually every city along its 730-mile length in a matter of days, occupying [[Anshan]], [[Haicheng, Liaoning|Haicheng]], [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning|Kaiyuan]], [[Tieling|Tiehling]], [[Fushun]], [[Siping (city)|Szeping-Chieh]], [[Changchun]], [[Huadian, Jilin|Kuanchengtzu]], [[Yingkou]], [[Dandong|Antung]], and [[Benxi|Penhsihu]].

Likewise on 19 September, in response to General Honjō's request, the Joseon army in [[Korea]] under General [[Senjūrō Hayashi]] ordered the [[IJA 20th Division|20th Infantry Division]] to split its force, forming the [[39th Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)|39th Mixed Brigade]], which departed on that day for Manchuria without authorization from the [[Hirohito|Emperor]].

Between 20 September and 25 September, Japanese forces took [[Xiongyuecheng|Hsiungyueh]], [[Changtu]], [[Liaoyang]], [[Liaoyuan|Tungliao]], [[Tiaonan]], [[Jilin|Kirin]], [[Jiaohe, Jilin|Chiaoho]], [[Huangkutun]] and [[Xinmin, Liaoning|Hsin-min]]. This effectively secured control of [[Liaoning]] and Kirin provinces and the main line of rail communications to Korea.

Tokyo was shocked by the news of the Army acting without orders from the central government. The Japanese civilian government was thrown into disarray by this act of [[gekokujo|"gekokujō" insubordination]], but as reports of one quick victory after another began to arrive, it felt powerless to oppose the Army, and its decision was to immediately send three more [[infantry division]]s from Japan, beginning with the 14th Mixed Brigade of the [[IJA 7th Division]].{{when|date=November 2013}} During this era, the elected government could be held hostage by the Army and Navy, since Army and Navy members were [[Meiji Constitution|constitutionally necessary]] for the formation of cabinets. Without their support, the government would collapse.

==Secession movements==
After the Liaoning Provincial government fled Mukden, it was replaced by a "Peoples Preservation Committee" which declared the [[secession]] of Liaoning province from the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Other secessionist movements were organized in Japanese-occupied Kirin by General [[Xi Qia]] head of the [[Manchukuo Imperial Army|"New Kirin" Army]], and at Harbin, by General [[Zhang Jinghui|Chang Ching-hui]]. In early October, at [[Taonan]] in northwest Liaoning province, General [[Zhang Haipeng]] declared his district independent of China, in return for a shipment of a large number of military supplies by the Japanese Army.

On 13 October, General Chang Hai-peng ordered three regiments of the [[Manchukuo Imperial Army|Hsingan Reclamation Army]] under General [[Xu Jinglong]] north to take the capital of Heilongjiang province at [[Qiqihar]]. Some elements in the city offered to peacefully surrender the old walled town, and Chang advanced cautiously to accept. However his advance guard was attacked by General [[Dou Lianfang]]'s troops, and in a savage fight with an engineering company defending the north bank, were sent fleeing with heavy losses. During this fight, the Nenjiang railroad bridge was dynamited by troops loyal to General [[Ma Zhanshan]] to prevent its use.

==Resistance to the Japanese invasion==
{{Main|Resistance at Nenjiang Bridge|Jiangqiao Campaign}}
Using the repair of the Nen River Bridge as the pretext, the Japanese sent a repair party in early November under the protection of Japanese troops. Fighting erupted between the Japanese forces and troops loyal to the acting governor of Heilongjiang province Muslim General Ma Zhanshan, who chose to disobey the Kuomintang government's ban on further resistance to the Japanese invasion.

Despite his failure to hold the bridge, General Ma Zhanshan became a national hero in China for his resistance at Nenjiang Bridge, which was widely reported in the Chinese and international press. The publicity inspired more volunteers to enlist in the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]].

The repaired bridge made possible the further advance of Japanese forces and their armored trains. Additional troops from Japan, notably the [[4th Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)|4th Mixed Brigade]] from the [[IJA 8th Division|8th Division]], were sent in November.

On 15 November 1931, despite having lost more than 400 men and 300 left wounded since 5 November, General Ma declined a Japanese ultimatum to surrender Tsitsihar. On 17 November, in subzero weather, 3,500 Japanese troops, under the command of General [[Jirō Tamon]], mounted an attack, forcing General Ma from Tsitsihar by 19 November.

==Operations in Southern Northeast China==
{{Main|Jinzhou Operation}}
In late November 1931, General Honjō dispatched 10,000 soldiers in 13 armored trains, escorted by a squadron of bombers, in an advance on [[Jinzhou|Chinchow]] from Mukden. This force had advanced to within {{convert|30|km}} of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw. The operation was cancelled by [[Ministry of War of Japan|Japanese War Minister]] General [[Jirō Minami]], due to the acceptance of modified form of a [[League of Nations]] proposal for a "neutral zone" to be established as a buffer zone between [[China proper]] and Manchuria pending a future Chinese-Japanese peace conference by the civilian government of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] Baron [[Wakatsuki Reijirō|Wakatsuki]] in Tokyo.

However, the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement. The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]]. Further negotiations with the [[Kuomintang]] government failed, the Japanese government authorized the reinforcement of troops in Manchuria. In December, the rest of 20th Infantry Division, along with the 38th Mixed Brigade from the [[IJA 19th Division|19th Infantry Division]] were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade from the [[IJA 10th Division|10th Infantry Division]] was sent from Japan. The total strength of the Kwantung Army was thus increased to around 60,450 men.

With this stronger force, the Japanese Army announced on 21 December the beginning of large-scale [[Pacification of Manchukuo#Bandits|anti-bandit operations]] in Manchuria to quell a growing resistance movement by the local Chinese population in Liaoning and Kirin provinces.

On 28 December, a new government was formed in China after all members of the old Nanjing government resigned. This threw the military command into turmoil, and the Chinese army retreated to the south of the [[Great Wall]] into [[Hebei]] province, a humiliating move which lowered China's international image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorne |first1=Christopher |title=The Limits of Foreign Policy |date=1973 |publisher=Capricorn |location=New York |isbn=978-0399111242 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forces occupied Chinchow on 3 January 1932, after the Chinese defenders retreated without giving combat. The following day the Japanese occupied [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] completing their military takeover of southern Manchuria.

==Occupation of northeast China==
{{Main|Defense of Harbin}}
With southern Manchuria secure, the Japanese turned north to complete the occupation of Manchuria. As negotiations with Generals Ma Zanshan and Ting Chao to defect to the pro-Japanese side had failed, in early January Colonel [[Kenji Doihara]] requested collaborationist General Qia Xi to advance his forces and take Harbin.

The last major Chinese regular force in northern Manchuria was led by General Ting Chao who organized the defense of Harbin successfully against General Xi until the arrival of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 2nd Division]] under General [[Jirō Tamon]]. Japanese forces took Harbin on 4 February 1932.

By the end of February Ma had sought terms and joined the newly formed [[Manchukuo]] government as governor of Heilongjiang province and Minister of War.

On 27 February 1932, Ting offered to cease hostilities, ending official Chinese resistance in Manchuria, although combat by [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and irregular forces continued as Japan spent many years in their [[Pacification of Manchukuo|campaign to pacify Manchukuo]].

==Homefront, Japan==
The conquest of Manchuria, a land rich in natural resources, was widely seen as an economic "lifeline" to save Japan from the effects of the [[Great Depression]], generating much public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Luise |title=Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |asin=B00719LN54 |pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian Louise Young described Japan from September 1931 to the spring of 1933 as gripped by "war fever" as the conquest of Manchuria proved to be an extremely popular war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Luise |title=Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |asin=B00719LN54 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor of a "lifeline" suggested that Manchuria was crucial to the functioning of the Japanese economy, which explains why the conquest of Manchuria was so popular and why afterwards Japanese public opinion was so hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Luise |title=Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |asin=B00719LN54 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it later became, and Young noted: "Had they wished, it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Luise |title=Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |asin=B00719LN54 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal journal ''[[Kaizō]]'' criticized the war with the journalist Gotō Shinobu in the November 1931 edition accusing the Kwangtung Army of a "two-fold coup d'état" against both the government in Tokyo and against the government of China.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Voices like ''Kaizō'' were a minority as mainstream newspapers like the ''[[Asahi Shimbun|Asahi]]'' soon discovered that an anti-war editorial position hurt sales, and so switched over to an aggressively militaristic editorial position as the best way to increase sales.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Japan's most famous pacifist, the poet [[Akiko Yosano]] had caused a sensation in 1904 with her anti-war poem "Brother Do Not Give Your Life", addressed to her younger brother serving in the Imperial Army that called the war with Russia stupid and senseless.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Luise |title=Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |asin=B00719LN54 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the extent of "war fever" in Japan in 1931 that even Akiko succumbed, writing a poem in 1932 praising ''[[bushidō]]'', urging the Kwantung Army to "smash the sissified dreams of compromise" and declared that to die for the Emperor in battle was the "purest" act a Japanese man could perform.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==External impact==
The Western media reported on the events with accounts of atrocities such as bombing civilians or firing upon shell-shocked survivors.&lt;ref name="herries161"&gt;Meirion and Susie Harries, ''Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army'' p 161 {{ISBN|0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aroused considerable antipathy to Japan, which lasted until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="herries161"/&gt;

When the [[Lytton Commission]] issued a report on the invasion, despite its statements that China had to a certain extent provoked Japan, and China's sovereignty over Manchuria was not absolute, Japan took it as an unacceptable rebuke and withdrew from the already declining [[League of Nations]], which also helped create international isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Meirion and Susie Harries, ''Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army'' p 163 {{ISBN|0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manchurian Crisis had a significant negative impact on the moral strength and influence of the [[League of Nations]]. As critics had predicted, the League was powerless if a strong nation decided to pursue an aggressive policy against other countries, allowing a country such as Japan to commit blatant aggression without serious consequences. [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] were also aware of this, and within three years would both follow Japan's example in aggrandization against their neighbors: in the case of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|against Abyssinia]]; and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Munich Agreement|against Czechoslovakia]] and [[Invasion of Poland|Poland]].&lt;ref name="benwalsh247"&gt;Ben Walsh, ''GCSE Modern World History - second edition'' 2001, p 247 {{ISBN|978-0719577130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4381">'''Jean-Fernand Brierre''' (23 September 1909 &amp;ndash; 1992) was a [[Haiti]]an poet, dramatist, journalist, and diplomat. He is recognized "as one of the most brilliant Haitian writers," and has produced a significant body of poetry to his credit.&lt;ref name="Schutt-Ainé"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schutt-Ainé | first = Patricia | title = Haiti: A Basic Reference Book | publisher = Librairie Au Service de la Culture | year = 1994 | location = Miami, Florida | isbn = 0-9638599-0-0 | page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as [[Hait]]i's ambassador to [[Argentina]].

==Early years==
Brierre was born in [[Jérémie]] and was the son of Fernand Brierre and Henriette Desrouillère. He descended from a French settler, François Brierre, who had bought at auction, in [[Saint-Domingue]] (Haiti) a black [[Dahomey|Dahomean]] woman, named Rosette, sister of Marie-Cssette Dumas, who also gave birth to the general [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]] in Jérémie, who later fathered great French novelist, [[Alexandre Dumas]].&lt;ref name="Nouvelliste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/79992/Jean-Brierre-lhomme-et-loeuvre |title=Jean Brierre: l'homme et l'oeuvre |editor=Press |date=26 May 2010 |publisher=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Brierre became the Director of [[École normale de Chatard]] (France) at age nineteen of rural teachers in 1928. Brierre was appointed thereafter, at 21 year old, as Secretary of Legation in Paris where he took courses in political science. In 1931, he began studying law and completed his courses in 1935. He was head of Cultural Division of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Director of the Tourist Bureau and then Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Tourism. Brierre was also member of the Government Council and was named Ambassador of Haiti to [[Buenos Aires]]. Brierre worked as a politician and diplomat. He emerged in the 1930s as a poet and militant in the backlash against the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] (1915–34).&lt;ref name="Schutt-Ainé"/&gt; His epic verse celebrated the heroes of [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian independence]] and the black race. His Black Soul (1947) and La Source (1956) are well-known Haitian examples of the poetry of [[négritude]].&lt;ref name="Schutt-Ainé"/&gt; In 1932, Brierre founded the newspaper "La Bataille", where its criticism against the regime of [[Stenio Vincent]] and the American occupation earned him two years of closed detention in the national penitentiary.&lt;ref name="Nouvelliste"/&gt;

Brierre was also an educator and diplomat until his exile in 1962, after nine months of prison under the regime of [[François Duvalier]]. He lived most of his exile in [[Senegal]], and returned to Haiti after the fall of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], the son. Brierre died in [[Port-au-Prince]] on the night of December 24 to 25, 1992, at the age of 83. Jean-François Brierre remains with [[Etzer Vilaire]], as one of the most famous poets of Jérémie; nicknamed "The City of Poets."&lt;ref name="Nouvelliste"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0YJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+City+of+Poets+jeremie&amp;dq=The+City+of+Poets+jeremie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwip69G_7IfJAhVDQSYKHUV-Amc |title=Haiti |editor=Press |page=1930 |year=1963 |publisher=Pan American Union.

'''''Jidaimono''''' (時代物) are Japanese [[kabuki]] or [[bunraku|jōruri]] plays that feature historical plots and characters, often famous samurai battles. These are in contrast to ''[[sewamono]]'' (世話物), contemporary plays, which generally focus on commoners and domestic issues. ''Jidaimono'' is usually translated as "period plays".  Film and television productions in this mode are called ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (時代劇), and share many of the same features.

==Overview==
As the stereotypical audience for jōruri and kabuki were commoners (''[[chōnin]]''), stories involving court nobles and heroic samurai were of a more distant subject matter than those that dealt with contemporary, urban commoner themes. Even though many of the viewers may have been samurai, the [[Edo period]] in which these plays were largely composed and performed was a period of peace, and so the notion of fierce battles and heroic sacrifices was still something of a romanticized escape for these samurai, just as historical dramas are for us today.

Stories were almost always derived from classic epics (''[[monogatari]]'') or from other historical sources, and it was not at all uncommon for elements to be changed. Characters might be invented, or elements of their histories changed, to make the story more interesting or to otherwise serve the author's purposes. Though most of these stories derive originally from historical fact, the sources used by the playwrights were more legend than accurate narratives, and fantastic or magical elements were further added by the playwrights. ''[[Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura]]'' serves as a good example of this. The play revolves around actual historical figures of the [[Genpei War]], including [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]] and his retainer [[Benkei]]. But the historically false conceit that certain [[Taira clan]] generals survived and remain in hiding is central to the plot, and the ''[[kitsune]]'' (fox-spirit) character [[Genkurō]] is of course also invented.

In addition, though ''jidaimono'' almost always take place in the distant past, they often were intended to make reference to contemporary events. For much of the Edo period, the depiction of contemporary events, in particular, depictions of the ''[[shōgun]]s'' and criticism of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], were strictly banned. As a result, plays were designed to use historical or literary references as metaphors for current events. The famous play ''[[Chūshingura|Kanadehon Chūshingura]]'', also known as the tale of the [[Forty-seven rōnin]], is a fine example of this. Though the actual forty-seven rōnin and the events surrounding their attempts at revenge for their lord took place in the early 18th century, only a few decades before the play debuted, it was depicted onstage as taking place in the 14th century, and the names of all the principal figures involved were changed.

In many other plays, the [[Minamoto clan]], from whom the Tokugawa ''shōguns'' claimed descent, were used to represent the shogunate. The Taira clan, who lost the Genpei War to the Minamoto in the 1180s, commonly were represented as oppressed or wronged, and symbolized the playwrights' (and perhaps the actors') criticisms of the Tokugawa government. The same ''Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura'' mentioned earlier is an excellent example of this, as is ''[[Battles of Coxinga]]'', which tells of the [[Ming Dynasty]] loyalist [[Coxinga]] who fought against the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the late 17th century.

Generally speaking, many of the most flamboyant and bombastic kabuki plays are ''jidaimono'', as they tend to feature over-the-top representations of samurai heroes and villains, ''[[kami]]'', and some of the most famous figures in Japanese history. Commoners, the protagonists of ''sewamono'', by contrast, are usually portrayed fairly plainly. Of course, where samurai, [[oiran|courtesans]], [[geisha]] and the like appear in ''sewamono'', they too can have quite elaborate costumes and appearances.

==Terminology==
*''Sekai'', "vertical plot" / ''shuko'', "horizontal plot"
*''[[Katsureki]]'', a subgenre of living history plays meant to be accurate, not romanticized

'''John Dunmore''' [[New Zealand Order of Merit|CNZM]] (born 1923) is a prominent New Zealand academic, historian, author, playwright, and publisher.

Dunmore was born in [[Trouville-sur-Mer]], France, lived in [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|Jersey under German Occupation]] during [[World War II]], and then in England, where he received a BA from the [[University of London]]. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1950. He completed a PhD under historian [[John Cawte Beaglehole|J C Beaglehole]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in 1962, studying the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration#Maritime exploration in the Age of Enlightenment|French contribution to the exploration of the Pacific Ocean in the 18th century]]. He was Professor of French, Head of the Department of Modern Languages, and [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Humanities at [[Massey University]], from which he retired in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;These facts are from pp. 9–11 of ''Pacific Journeys''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dunmore's main field of history is the exploration of the Pacific, particularly by French navigators. He has written two major biographies of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Pérouse]], and translated and edited his journals (which he rediscovered after they had been misfiled in the [[French National Archives]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Journeys'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has written biographies and edited the journals of both [[Jean-François-Marie de Surville|de Surville]] and of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]]. His biography of de Surville, ''The fateful voyage of the St. Jean Baptiste'', won the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards|Wattie Book of the Year]] award in 1970.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2006/Massey_News/issue-06/stories/05-06-06.html Massey News Article – Champion of the Humanities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504000143/http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2006/Massey_News/issue-06/stories/05-06-06.html |date= 4 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His work is highly regarded by scholars as well as by the public:
* "John Dunmore has done more than anyone to bring our attention to the achievements of eighteenth and nineteenth century French explorers of the Pacific"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu219.htm#84 CCS – Book Reviews Part 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunmore has written a variety of other books, including a series of thrillers under the pseudonym "Jason Calder".&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Journeys'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has produced a book of 18th-century recipes, ''Mrs [[James Cook|Cook]]'s book of recipes for mariners in distant seas''. Some of the recipes were derived from the logs of explorers of the day. He has also written plays,&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Journeys'', p. 13.

In his capacity as professor of French, Dunmore was president of the New Zealand Federation des [[Alliance Francaise|Alliances Francaises]].

He established two separate publishing firms, the '''Dunmore Press''' (1969–1984) and '''Heritage Press''' (1985–2004).&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Journeys'', p. 13.

'''Kathleen Freeman''' (22 June 1897 – 21 February 1959) was a British classical scholar and (under the pseudonym '''Mary Fitt''') author of detective novels. She was a lecturer in Greek at the [[Cardiff University|University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff]] between 1919 and 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;For a brief note on Liliane Clopet, her career and her writings see [http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~irwin/KathleenFreeman/KathleenFreeman.htm Biography and bibliography] by M. Eleanor Irwin and [http://edithorial.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-conceal-female-scholar-or.html How to Conceal a Female Scholar; or, the Invisible Classicist of Cardiff] by Edith Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and academic career==

Kathleen Freeman was born in [[Yardley, Birmingham]], and was the daughter of a commercial traveller (Charles H Freeman) and Catherine (Mawdesley). She attended the [[Cardiff University|University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff]], where she studied with Professor [[Gilbert Norwood]]. Following her graduation in 1918 (when she was awarded a BA), she remained there and was appointed Lecturer in Greek in 1919 and earned further degrees (MA 1922, DLitt 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2004), 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

From early in her career, Freeman worked to bring Greek texts and ideas to the general public through her work in translating texts and presenting her ideas to general audiences. Freeman featured on [[BBC]] radio in 1926 presenting the works of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/a5d95adff0624710aeea039ab55c0d51|title=Issue 162|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War Freeman delivered lectures on Greece to the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and in the National Scheme of Education for HM Forces in South Wales and Monmouthshire. She further contributed to the war effort with her selections of translations from Greek authors which featured in [[Western Mail (Wales)|The Western Mail]], a Cardiff-based newspaper. These were later published as the book, ''It Has All Happened Before: What the Greeks Thought of their Nazis'' (1941). Her publications ''Voices of Freedom'' (1943), ''What They Said at the Time: A Survey of the Causes of the Second World War'' (1945) and her work with the [[Philosophical Society of England]], where she acted as Supervisor of Studies from 1948 to 1952 before becoming the Chairman in 1952, are further testimony to her desire to make Greek ideas accessible through translation. Freeman resigned from the university in 1946 in order to pursue her research and writing.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2004), 343-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fiction-writing career ==
Freeman enjoyed success as  a writer of fiction and wrote under the pseudonyms '''Mary Fitt''' (1936–60), '''Stuart Mary Wick''' (1948; 1950), '''Clare St. Donat''' (1950) and '''Caroline Cory''' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin (2004), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, in addition to her study ''The Work and Life of Solon'', Freeman published a collection of short stories ''The Intruder and Other Stories'' and her first novel ''Martin Hanner. A Comedy''. In 1936 she chose the pseudonym Mary Fitt for her mysteries, writing 27 books and a number of short stories, many of which feature detective Inspector (later Superintendent) Mallett. She also wrote a number of children's stories and ''T'other Miss Austen'' (1956), a study of [[Jane Austen]].&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive list of Freeman's writings see [http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~irwin/KathleenFreeman/KathleenFreeman.htm Biography and bibliography] by M. Eleanor Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years Freeman's work has been re-assessed and new editions of her short stories are planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.awwe.org/uploads/3/9/0/7/3907975/awwe_2016_programme.pdf|title=The Association for Welsh Writing in English Annual Conference 2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 Jun 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/765877-deininger-michelle|title=Dr Michelle Deininger - People - Cardiff University|work=Cardiff University|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Carpentier''' was created in January 1940 by Mad Maltezos and Suzie Carpentier right after Madeleine [[Vionnet]], their former employer, closed in 1939. They stayed open during [[World War II]] and were very popular in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="fashionencyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Le-Ma/Mad-Carpentier.html |title=Mad Carpentier - Fashion Designer Encyclopedia - women, new, body, history, collection, dresses, look |publisher=Fashionencyclopedia.com |date=1948-04-14 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fashion history and for lots of clients, Mad Carpentier represented a continuation of [[Vionnet]]'s bias cut and elegance. In the late 1940s, Mad Carpentier was celebrated for the evening dresses and its remarkable and popular coats in 1940s and 1950s  breaking with the [[Vionnet]] tradition.&lt;ref name="fashionencyclopedia1"/&gt;

{{National Literary "Matters"}}
The '''Matter of France''', also known as the '''Carolingian cycle''', is a body of literature and legendary material associated with the history of [[France]], in particular involving [[Charlemagne]] and his associates. The cycle springs from the [[Old French]] ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'', and was later adapted into a variety of art forms, including [[Renaissance]] epics and [[opera]]s. Together with the [[Matter of Britain]], which concerned [[King Arthur]], and the [[Matter of Rome]], comprising material derived from and inspired by [[classical mythology]], it was one of the great [[literary cycles]] that figured repeatedly in [[medieval literature]].

==Three Matters==
The Matter of France was one of the "Three Matters" repeatedly recalled in [[medieval literature]]. It was contrasted with the [[Matter of Britain]], the legendary history of [[Great Britain]], [[Brittany]] and [[King Arthur]]; and the [[Matter of Rome]], which represented the medieval poets' interpretations of [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] mythology and history.&lt;ref name="Classen, 2015"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Classen|editor1-first=Albrecht|title=Handbook of Medieval Culture: Fundamental Aspects and Condutions of the European Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh5pCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA893|accessdate=17 July 2016|volume=Volume 2|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-11-037763-7|page=893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three names were first used by the twelfth-century French poet [[Jean Bodel]], author of the ''[[Chanson de Saisnes]]'', a ''[[chanson de geste]]'' in which he wrote:

==Description==
About 1215 [[Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube]], in the introductory lines to his [[Girart de Roussillon|''Girart de Vienne'']], set out a subdivision of the Matter of France into three cycles, which have been adopted by many modern critics as a useful means of grouping the ''chansons de geste''. These are his words:

{{quote|
At Saint-Denis, in the great abbey, we find it written (I don't doubt) in a book of noble lineage that there have been only three gestes in well-defended France (I think no-one will argue with me now).

The lordliest is that of the kings of France.

The next, it is right to say, was of Doon of the white beard, he of Mainz who had many lands. In his lineage were fierce and rugged people; they would have had the lordship of all of France, its power, its knighthood, but they were proud and jealous. Of that lineage, so full of treachery, was Ganelon who by his treason caused great sorrow in well-defended France when he committed in Spain the great felony that caused the death in pagan land of the Twelve Peers of France. You have heard tell in many a song that from the geste that came from Ganelon many a great knight was descended, fierce and bold and of very great fame. They would have been lords of the whole realm of France, but there was pride and treason in them. Through pride (we tell you truly) many a high-placed man has been thrown to earth, as were the angels in heaven (we know it in truth) who, for their crime, were thrown into the prison of hell where they will feel nothing but eternal pain. They lost the holy mansion of heaven by their pride and folly. Just so were Ganelon's kin, who would have been so powerful and famous if they had not been so full of treason. Of this lineage, which did nothing but evil, was the second geste.

The third geste, which was much to be praised, was that of Garin de Monglane of the fierce countenance. In his lineage I can well testify that there was not a single coward or good-for-nothing or traitor or vile flatterer; rather they were wise and bold knights and good fighters and noble warriors. Not once did they wish to betray a king of France; they strove to help their true lord and to advance his honour everywhere. They promoted Christendom and destroyed and confounded Saracens. This Garin of the fierce countenance had four sons; never were there bolder knights, I think, so that in a whole day one could not describe their prowess. The first son (I will not lie to you) was the fierce Hernaut of Beaulande. The second, as I have heard tell, was the praiseworthy Milon of Apulia. The third was Renier of Geneva, and the fourth was lord Girart the warrior. 
|(''Girart de Vienne'' lines 8–67; translation after J. J. Duggan)}}

The cycles can be outlined as follows:&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=75e5RRqIhMQC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Durendal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wz-SVImML8SgNuXngsgG&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Durendal&amp;f=false Ross, D.J.A., "Old French", ''Traditions of Heroic and Epic Poetry'', ([[Arthur Thomas Hatto]] ed.), Modern Humanities Research Association, 1980] {{ISBN|9780900547720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Geste du roi'', whose chief character is Charlemagne, seen as champion of Christianity.  This cycle contains the best known of the ''chansons'', the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]''.
* The ''[[Geste de Garin de Monglane]]'', whose central character was [[William of Gellone|Guillaume d'Orange]], identifiable with William, Count of Toulouse.  These dealt with knights who were typically younger sons, not [[heir]]s, and who seek land and glory through combat with the Infidels. The twenty-four poems of this ''geste'' belong to the generation after Charlemagne, during the reign of an ineffectual Louis. The ''Chanson de Guillaume'' is one of the oldest poems of this ''geste''.
* The ''Geste de [[Doon de Mayence]]'', in which the hero, as in the ''Geste de Guillaume'', often suffers from royal injustice, but is goaded into rebellion.

Central figures of the Matter of France include [[Charlemagne]] and his [[paladin]]s, especially [[Roland]], hero of ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', and his companion [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]], who was frequently cast in conflict with the [[Islam|Muslim]] champion [[Fierabras]]. Originally, the Matter of France contained tales of war and martial valour, being focused on the conflict between the [[Franks]] and [[Saracen]]s or [[Moors]] during the period of [[Charles Martel]] and Charlemagne. The ''Chanson de Roland'', for example, is about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] during the Moorish invasion of southern France.  As the genre matured, elements of [[fantasy]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] tended to accrue to the tales.  The magic horse [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]], for example, is a recurring figure in many of the tales.

The fundamental character of the "Matter of France" is feudal and Christian (in a crusading form). Although viewed as idolators, the Saracens were not necessarily depicted as un-chivalrous. The earliest ''gestes'' were likely sung by a ''[[jongleur]]'', accompanied by a fiddle. It is apparent that the authors were ignorant of the fact that Islam is monotheistic.&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt; D.J.A. Ross says that people of the Middle Ages appear to have regarded the ''gestes'' as generally historical.

Einhard's ''Vita Caroli'' describes the Basque ambush at Roncevaux as driving the Frankish rearguard down the valley. The poet who wrote the ''Chanson de Roland'' did not hesitate to update the military tactics to a set-piece cavalry charge on the part of the Saracens, although retaining a landscape unsuitable for couched lances.&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt;

==List of works==

For a list of ''chansons'' that can be attached to each of these cycles, see [[Chanson de geste]].

==In later literature==
After the period of the ''chanson de geste'', the Matter of France lived on. Its most well known survival is in the [[Italian language|Italian]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]s by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and a number of lesser authors who worked the material; their tales of ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' ("Roland in Love")'' and [[Orlando furioso]]'' ("Roland Gone Mad") were inspired by the ''chansons de geste''. These works, in turn, inspired [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Gerusalemme liberata]]'' and [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/matter-of-france/ Giardina, Henry. "Mad with Desire (Kind Of)", ''The Paris Review'', June 24, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; although these latter works have been separated from the Matter of France and put in the respective settings of the [[First Crusade]] and an imaginary faerie land.

Tales of the Matter of France were also found in [[Old Norse]], where the ''[[Karlamagnus Saga]]'' was written in the thirteenth century in [[Norway]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://bartleby.com/211/1306.html Ker, W.P., "Metrical Romances, 1200–1500", ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'' Vol. I, (1907–21)]&lt;/ref&gt; it contains a synopsis of the main stories of the cycle. Indeed, until a major revival in the 19th century breathed new life into the Arthurian cycle, the Matter of France had enjoyed similar renown to the Matter of Britain.

Modern fantasy literature has used the Matter of France far less than the Matter of Britain, although [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]] set one of their [[Harold Shea]] stories (''[[The Castle of Iron]]'') in the world of the Matter of France, and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' references the Matter of France. Through Anderson's book, the Matter of France also had some influence on the popular ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game. [[Italo Calvino]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Nonexistent Knight]]'' also takes place in this world.

The '''Maya Research Program''' is a US-based non-profit organization (501C3) that sponsors archaeological and ethnographic research in Middle America. Each summer since 1992, they have sponsored archaeological fieldwork at the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Blue Creek (Maya site)|Blue Creek]] in northwestern [[Belize]].

The Program's goal is, first and foremost, to conduct research that adds to the body of scholarly knowledge and helps to better understand the past of the complex ancient societies of the Americas. Many affiliated scholars are internationally recognized as leaders in their fields. Recent support has come from the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, the [[Heinz Foundation]], and the American Council of Learned Societies. In addition, the Blue Creek field school has been certified by the Registry of Professional Archaeologists.

== Current Excavations ==
=== Understanding the Classic Collapse ===
{{Main|Classic Maya collapse}}
What happened to Classic Maya civilization? Why did the entire society collapse—region wide—during a short crisis in the mid-ninth century A.D.? Was it persistent warfare? Agricultural or environmental collapse? Overpopulation? Drought? Or some combination . . . of some other factors altogether? Because of the extent of the Blue Creek site (from Middle Preclassic to the Terminal Classic collapse) and because of the length of time and extent of our studies, MRP is in a unique position to analyze a wealth of data that may provide critical insights into this mystery. This is an overarching focus of research over the coming years, into which all of our new projects will feed. This is at the vanguard of scholarship, impacting the debate about the Classic Maya collapse among scholars and institutions around the world.

=== Nojol Nah ===
Equally exciting is a newly discovered center of monumental architecture in our survey area. This may represent a suburban center connected to an allied polity of Blue Creek or even an entirely separate city-state. There is much to be learned from this new, major discovery in the context of a well-studied site like Blue Creek, and it will be a focus of MRP's work at the Blue Creek Field Station for years to come. Mapping of the new site by Blue Creek staff and volunteers began in the 2008 excavation season and will continue in 2011.

=== Chum Balam-Nal ===
Current efforts at Blue Creek are focused on excavation of the Chum Balam-Nal, and elite residential zone on the Bravo Escarpment, just south of Blue Creek’s main plaza. This effort began in 2009 and will continue for several years and is revealing a great deal about the relationships among the elites living in the city center and the "sub-elites" living some distance away. What was going on here as the Classic period drew to a close and Maya civilization began to collapse?

=== Wetlands Agriculture ===
Led by Sheryl &amp; Tim Beach, continues long term investigations of ancient wetlands agricultural systems at Blue Creek and elsewhere in northern Belize.

=== Bedrock ===
In 2008,  a wonderfully preserved, deeply buried Early Classic midden was discovered at the Bedrock site. Excavations of this group will continue in 2011.

== The Site of Blue Creek ==
[[File:Blue Creek Ruins.gif]]

=== A Middle Preclassic through Terminal Classic Sequence ===
The earliest deposits discovered so far at Blue Creek come from a complex midden in front of and beneath the Temple of the Masks. During the 1995, 1996 and 1997 seasons, a large portion of the midden was excavated. By the [[Preclassic_Maya#Middle_Preclassic_.281000BC00BC.29|Middle Preclassic period]], Blue Creek was apparently a nucleated village engaged in complex communal ritual. No structural remains have yet been found from this period. The ceramics from the period exhibit a close affinity in the Middle Preclassic to those of coastal Belize rather than the Belize Valley.

The midden deposits at the Temple of the Masks also include a rich record of Late Preclassic activity. Moreover, it now appears that, by no later than the end of the Late Preclassic, the fundamental form of the Main Plaza was in place. Early phases of Structures 1, 4 and 6 were erected. An early phase of Str. 5 also probably existed (Pastrana 1995). However, it is believed that this building was raised at a later date. While most of these buildings were unimposing at this time, Structure 1 rose 8 meters above the plaza.

As at many sites, [[Cerros]] for example, this period saw the instatement of a royal lineage at Blue Creek. Overt indications of complex society include the creation of public and sacred space at Blue Creek marked by a major bloodletting cache which dedicates the Late Preclassic version of Structure 4. This cache was placed immediately in front of the basal step of Structure 4 and consisted of seven chert (Colha) bifaces, fragments of jade and coral, two jade earflares, five jade beads, a number of marine shells, 425 obsidian blades and flakes, and 27 obsidian cores. These were all compactly located and a fragment of preserved cloth found underneath them. This cache is the result of a ceremony which included large scale bloodletting and placement of a cotton bag of bloodletting paraphernalia and other offerings in front of the building.

This ceremony marked the dedication of Structure 4 and the establishment of central authority at Blue Creek. Once established, the centralized authority at Blue Creek grew rapidly and grew wealthy. Buildings on the Main Plaza were greatly expanded in the Early Classic. Structure 4, for example, was remodeled to an order of magnitude larger than its Late Preclassic counterpart. The final version of Structure 5 was built. This 50 meter long, six meter tall range building defined the west side of the Main Plaza. Structure 6 was converted from a low platform to a small, but significant range building, immediately west of the towering Structure 1.

==== Structure 1 ====
The special nature of Structure 1 is clear not only from its Early Classic expansion, but from the nature of its superstructure. On top of this tall temple was not a typical southern lowlands temple, but an open colonnaded building (Driver 1995, 1996). The facade consisted of 16 round, masonry and marl columns and each end was open. The only similar structure in the region which may date from this period is Structure V at [[Kohunlich]] (Andrews 1987), but even this is uncertain. The existence of these structures indicates that the origin of columned buildings may be a southern lowlands innovation which was incorporated into later northern lowlands architecture, rather than an indicator of Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic interaction, as some have argued.

==== Structures 2 &amp; 3 ====
These two buildings define the east side of the Main Plaza at Blue Creek. They are virtually identical and were placed on a north-south line. It is believed that this is a regional variant of a E-Group Complex which is an astronomical observatory named after Group E at [[Uaxactun]]. From a point near the middle of the plaza, an observer would see the sun rise over the top of Structure 2 on the morning of the Summer Solstice and over the top of Structure 3 on the morning of the Winter Solstice. Of course, at the Spring and Fall Equinox, the sun would rise exactly at the midpoint between the two buildings. There are no accurate construction dates for these buildings, but they were probably built during the Early Classic period.

==== Structure 4 ====
===== The Ritual Event =====
At about AD 500, a major ritual act occurred at Structure 4 on the south end of the Main Plaza. Not only does this event underscore the wealth of Blue Creek, but it marked a turning point in the history of the community. Much of the data regarding this deposit comes from the work of Pamela Weiss, who excavated the material (Guderjan and Weiss 1995; Weiss 1995)

In preparation for the ritual, a large part of the center of the penultimate stage of Structure 4 was removed to accommodate the construction of a masonry lined shaft, where later the sacrificial deposits would be made. Since the construction fill of Structure 4 is composed of loosely laid, large boulders, a large excavation was necessary to safely construct the shaft. This preparatory excavation was dug immediately outside of the superstructural building of Structure 4-2nd and reached a depth of 4.3&amp;nbsp;meters with a north-south dimension of 4.6&amp;nbsp;meters. On the eastern side a retaining wall was built to secure the excavation from wall collapse. The western limit of the prehistoric excavation is still being investigated.

After the initial excavation, the shaft was constructed, probably a few courses at a time, and the excavation refilled around the shaft. The shaft was stone lined, with a diameter of approximately 50&amp;nbsp;cm. and a depth of more than 3&amp;nbsp;meters. During the refilling around the shaft, numerous caches of pottery vessels were placed around the shaft. In total, more than 100 vessels were cached. Nearly all of them were of the type called "Blue Creek Orange". Blue Creek Orange is similar to but yet distinctive from types such as Garbut Creek Red. The caches were placed both in nested arrangements of three inverted vessels or laid down as rim-to-rim caches. All of the caches from this area were surrounded with small irregular disks of burned limestone, often called "hamburger stones". These are largely associated with Late Preclassic Termination Rituals at Cerros (Garber 1989:34). In addition to the pottery, fractured and complete jade beads, a stingray spine, and a bird leg bone was recovered from these caches (Guderjan and Weiss 1995).

The majority of the pottery vessels are low, outflaring-sided vessels with a matte orange slipped surface (Aquilla Orange). Some darkening occurring from firing is evident. Also, a blotchy post-fire darkening is apparent on some of the vessels. It appears that artifacts were placed in the bottom of the vessels. The vessels placed in, rather than around, the shaft were covered with incense which was burnt long enough to darken the vessels before their deposition. Also, several cylindrical censers were recovered which are similar to those later placed in the shaft.

The ritual which occurred after the shaft was constructed included a complex placement of individual caches. However, the ritual seems to have occurred over a short period of time, probably during a single day. This is evidenced by sherds from partially reconstructable vessels scattered throughout the fill of the shaft.

Three distinct deposits were sequentially placed in the shaft during the event. The lower portion of the shaft contained the bulk of the artifacts in caches 9A, 9B, 9C, 10 and 11. Included in this area were worked jades, ceramics, shells, a [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|chert eccentric]], and human finger bone. The second segment was separated from the first by a marl "cap" and contained ceramic sherds from a number of partially reconstructable vessels. The upper segment of the shaft contained only burnt organic material.

The first cache placed in the lowest portion of the shaft was Cache 12. This consisted of a large, cruciform, chert eccentric (Figure 4) and a small, unslipped, pinch pot. The chert eccentric was oriented to the cardinal directions and its north and south tips were broken off. The chert eccentric normally could be considered to be a symbol of creation and the world tree. However, its broken tips may negate its life-giving aspect (Weiss 1995). The complexity and planning involved in the entire process is seen in the placement of two other caches immediately outside of the shaft at this level. Each consisted of two vessels (Blue Creek Orange) placed rim-to-rim. Cache 13, containing an offering of mollusks, was placed on the north side, and Cache 14, containing a food residue, was placed on the south side of the shaft, so that the broken tips of the eccentric were pointing to these caches.

About a meter above Cache 12 within the shaft was Cache 11, which held multiple vessels of Blue Creek Orange. While the number of vessels has not been determined, the minimum number of vessels is 21. Cache 10 was another rim-to-rim placement containing 46 shells of 3 freshwater and terrestrial species. It was placed only a few centimeters above Cache 11.

About a meter above Cache 10, the shaft fill was capped with marl. The shaft fill in this area included diverse ceramic sherds and partially burnt wood and the remains of what was probably burning incense. While no intact vessels are present, multiple sherds from a number of vessels were recovered.

Cache 9B, placed on top of this marl surface, was the most dramatic of the individual caches found. It consisted of a rim-to-rim placement of two pottery vessels containing 356 artifacts, mostly jade beads (Figure 5). Cache 9C was another rim-to-rim placement containing four artifacts: a 10 x 4&amp;nbsp;cm, anthropomorphic, tubular bead, an anthropomorphic head pendant with an extended tongue and two other beads (Figure 6). This was placed directly south of Cache 9B on the same marl surface.

The climax of the ritual event was to cap the entire deposit with the massive limestone bannerstone, 74&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter with a central opening fashioned by grinding and exhibiting polish from use, and an uncarved stela, 1.48&amp;nbsp;meters in length, that laid prone over the northern portion of the bannerstone. The smoke of the burning incense wafted out of the deposit and around the prone stela (Figure 7). The ritual event was ended by the snuffing of the incense when additional construction material was used to bury the shaft opening.

===== Dating the Event =====
The dating of this ritual event is based upon ceramic comparative analysis, two radiocarbon samples from within the shaft and two radiocarbon samples from the area around the shaft which was excavated to accommodate the shaft and then refilled. Dos Arroyos Orange-Polychromes associated with the shaft and other Manik ceramic complex (Tikal) material fix a date of approximately AD 250-550. In addition, a few Teotihuacan sherds were found in the shaft.

Radiocarbon dates from within the shaft were selected from quite different elevations. One was retrieved from the uppermost carbonized organic deposit and was separated from the rest of the ritual by a marl cap. The other sample came from the lowest level of the shaft. The corrected dates are 10 years from one another: 1440 +/- 110 BP (Beta-75432) and 1450 +/- 100 BP (Beta-76278). When the samples were cleaned in preparation for analysis, a large amount of wood was extracted from the completely organic sample indicating that the fire had been quickly extinguished.

The radiocarbon dates from caches in the fill around the shaft generally corroborate this date. One corrected date from Cache 21 was 1870 +/- 50 (Beta-82949) and a corrected AMS date from Cache 14 was 1950 +/- 50. These Late Preclassic dates are clearly much too early, as the building itself is definitively Early Classic in style with supporting ceramic evidence. However, the dated material could have come from recycled fill from the earlier version of Str. 4.

Consequently, the information has been interpreted to indicate that the ritual filling of the shaft occurred about 1450 BP (500 AD). However, it is possible that the shaft was in place somewhat earlier. One piece of information which makes this dubious is the relative placement of Caches 12, 13, and 14. The chert eccentric in Cache 12 was clearly placed with full knowledge of the precise location (outside of tmjmhe shaft) of Caches 13 and 14. It seems unlikely that their locations could be that precisely known if such a substantial period of time had elapsed since their placement.

==== Structure 5 ====
This is a long "Range Building" which was excavated by Dale Pastrana in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The top or superstructure of the building consists of a single, 75-meter-long, vaulted (stone-roofed) room with 7 doors and open ends. This room is accessed via a 13-step central staircase. Built in the Early Classic period, Pastrana argues that it functioned as a viewing gallery for events in the Main Plaza.

==== Structure 6 ====
It was originally believed that this small Range Building was a late addition to the Main Plaza architecture. However, excavations by Dale Pastrana in 1995 showed that this was originally built during the Late Preclassic period with much of the other architecture at the site. A carved stela stood in front of Structure 6 until the 1970s when looting occurred at the site.

==== Structure 7 - Ballcourt ====
The Ballcourt was built at the same time as the very large platform underneath it. However, it is not yet known when this occurred. The presence of a ballcourt at Blue Creek may reflect the community's status as an independent polity. The rest of the Ballcourt Platform may have been used for specialized craft activities in support of the royalty.

==== Structure 9 ====
At the southern end of Area B is the Temple of the Masks (Structure 9), another dramatic statement as to the nature of Blue Creek in the Early Classic period (Haines 1995). The earliest phase of the building (Str. 9-I) dates to the Late Preclassic and is built on top of Middle and Late Preclassic midden deposits. However, by the mid-Early Classic, architecture of the temple is typical of [[Peten Basin|Petan]] temples, with a single room superstructure on top of a steeply inclined substructure. Access to the superstructure was gained by a broad central staircase. Unlike most such buildings in the Peten, though, the Temple of the Masks has a large staircase outset, near the top of the stairs. Similar outsets are seen are [[Altun Ha]] (Pendergast 1979, 1982) and Kakabish (Guderjan 1996).

The facade of the outset is adorned with a complex five paneled, deep relief stucco frieze which included at least two and probably three anthropomorphic masks. Two of these are in excellent condition but the left face has been destroyed. Despite their Early Classic style, these were originally dated these to the Late Classic based on confusing ceramics from an associated cache and argued that this was an archaizing trait (Grube, et al. 1995). However, after the 1995 season, it was recognized that this was not correct and that these masks actually date to the Early Classic period.

Both faces have chin straps or bib motifs. The center image has closed eyes, hollowed cheeks, a slack jaw and a protruding tongue. The face is wearing an elaborate head-dress decorated with volutes shaped like an Ahaw glyph. The volutes represent smoke or foliation and may be the Early Classic form of the phonetic symbol ya (Thompson's T126) Grube (1990) has shown the Ahaw sign, when not used as a day sign, is a logogram for the word nik or "flower". This was interpreted as marking the building as a nikteil na or "flower house" (Grube, et al. 1995). These are specific houses for dancing and counsels (Freidel, et al. 1993: 257-263) and may have also served as accession houses for rulers.

Another element of the stucco facade supports this interpretation as well. A single glyph is located above the recessed panel between the two masks. This is interpreted as representing a sky or earth band with the phonetic value ki, meaning "heart" or "center" (Grube, et al. 1995). This glyph may represent the axis mundi (Grube et al. 1995), which Freidel (1992:127) associates with Ahaw (kingship) and political authority.

The presence of a nikteil na at Blue Creek is strong evidence that the community was ruled by an independent, local royal lineage. This is distinctly contrary to Adams' interpretation that the region was subsumed under a macro-state based at [[Tikal]] at the time (Adams 1995). Instead, Blue Creek and probably other medium-sized sites are fundamentally independent and self-governing. At Blue Creek, it would appear that an independent royal lineage was established in the latter part of the Late Preclassic Period which then flourished economically and politically in the Early Classic period. However, all of this came to an abrupt end sometime during the first half of the sixth century.

==== Structure 13 ====
Dramatically reflecting the changes which occurred in the Late Classic is the Str. 13 Courtyard (Gilgan 1996). In the Early Classic, this courtyard was a small plaza consisting of Structures 10, 12 and 13. Normally, such sacred space could not be converted to other uses by the same population. Nevertheless, the addition of Structures 11 and 14 did exactly that in the Late Classic. Structure 14 was a large vaulted, single room and Structure 11 was partially vaulted and partially a ramada-type room. The construction of these structures violated the normal rules of sacredness of plaza space by enclosing part of the plaza and secularizing it into elite residential space. This act underscores the transition of Blue Creek from a regional power to what was probably an outpost of another kingdom.

==== Structure 15 ====
Structure 15 is a low set of vaulted rooms. Excavations by Bob Baker and David Bianco show that building was constructed in the Late Classic Period and that the back wall of the building fell off the steep platform edge. This building may have been constructed when the Str. 13 Courtyard was converted from sacred, open space to a secular, elite residence.

==== Structure 19 Courtyard. ====
The Str. 19 Courtyard is a Yucatecan style, patio-quad residence. Built in the Early Classic period, the courtyard underwent repeated remodellings for several hundred years. Excavations by Bob Lichtenstein have shown that the residents buried at least six individuals ate different times in a bench in a small east side room of the complex. It is not known who these individuals were. However, this was, arguably, the residence of the king of Blue Creek. So, these may be family members.

==== Structure 24, The Temple of the Obsidian Warrior. ====
We have done almost no work at this building. However, in the 1970s, the building was very badly looted. Mary Neivens was working at another site at the time and came to visit Blue Creek. She documented several hundred flakes of obsidian, probably associated with a tomb which was destroyed by looters.

A '''medina quarter''' ({{lang-ar|المدينة القديمة}} {{transl|ar|''al-madīnah al-qadīmah''}} "the old city") is a distinct city section found in a number of [[North Africa]]n and [[Fortifications of Malta|Maltese]] cities. A medina is typically walled, with many narrow and [[maze|maze-like]] streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|work=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/medina?q=medina|entry=Medina definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[wikt:medina|medina]]" ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:مدينة|مدينة]]}} {{transl|ar|''madīnah''}}) itself simply means "[[city]]" or "[[town]]" in modern-day Arabic although it was borrowed from an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word (also "medina") referring to a city or populated area.

==Description==
Medina quarters often contain historical [[fountain]]s, [[palace]]s, [[mosque]]s, and sometimes churches.

Because of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from [[car]] traffic, and in some cases even [[motorcycle]] and [[bicycle]] traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of [[Fes]], or [[Fes el Bali]], is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Mother Nature Network|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-car-free-cities/the-medina-of-fes-al-bali-morocco-pop-156000|title=7 car-free cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">'''Mose Janashvili''' ({{lang-ka|მოსე ჯანაშვილი}}) (March 19, 1855 – April 19, 1934) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian, ethnographer, and linguist. He was born into a Georgian [[Saingilo|Ingilo]] community at [[Qakh]] (now [[Azerbaijan]]). Educated at [[Tbilisi]] and [[Kutaisi]], he worked as a teacher for several years, from 1875 to 1920, and later served as a professor at the [[Tbilisi State University]]. He mostly engaged in study of medieval Georgian chronicles and hagiographic literature. As a linguist, Janashvili subscribed to the theory that linked Georgian with the [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.nplg.gov.ge/ic/DGL/work/Ocherki_istorii_gruzii/Ocherki_istorii_gruzii_V/16/1/5.htm Очерки истории Грузии: В 8-и т. / АН ГССР, Ин-т ист., археол. и этнографии - Тб.: Мецниереба: Тип.

'''Mushahid Hussain Syed''' (Urdu: مشاہد حسین سید‬; b. 1953) is a [[Pakistan]]i politician, and journalist who is currently the [[List of senators of Pakistan|Pakistan Senator]] from the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] on the platform of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]], since 3 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=761|title=Senate of Pakistan|website=www.senate.gov.pk|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/957311/mushahid-hussain-elected-chairman-of-cpec-parliamentary-committee/|title=Mushahid Hussain elected chairman of CPEC parliamentary committee  - The Express Tribune|date=2015-09-15|newspaper=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/events/lecture-by-senator-mushahid-hussain-of-pakistan|title=Lecture by Senator Mushahid Hussain of Pakistan|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12159">According to [[Franz Brentano]], [[intentionality]] refers to the "aboutness of mental states that cannot be a physical relation between a mental state and what is about (its object) because in a physical relation each of the relata must exist whereas the objects of mental states might not.

Several problems arise for features of intentionality, which are unusual for materialistic relations.  Representation is unique. When 'x represents y' is true, it is not the same as other relations between things, like when 'x is next to y' or when 'x caused y' or when 'x met y', etc. Representation is different because, for instance, when 'x represents y' is true, y need not exist. This isn't true when say 'x is the square root of y' or 'x caused y' or 'x is next to y'. Similarly, when 'x represents y' is true, 'x represents z' can still be false, even when y = z.  Intentionality encompasses relations that are both physical and mental. In this case, "Billy can love Santa and Jane can search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no unicorns."

==History==
'''[[Franz Brentano]]''', the nineteenth century philosopher, spoke of mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our thoughts.  This idea encompasses his belief that one cannot desire something unless they actually have a representation of it in their minds.

'''[[Dennis Stampe]]''' was one of the first philosophers in modern times to suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of reliable causes.

'''[[Fred Dretske]]'''{{'}}s book, ''Knowledge and the Flow of Information'' (1981), was a major influence on the development of informational theories, and although the theory developed there is not a teleological theory, Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later produced an informational version of [[teleosemantics]].  He begins with a concept of carrying information that he calls "indicating", explains that indicating is not equivalent to representing, and then suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function of indicating

==Related theories==

'''Teleosemantics''', also known as biosemantics, is used to refer to the class of theories of mental content that use a teleological notion of function. Teleosemantics is best understood as a general strategy for underwriting the normative nature of content, rather than any particular theory. What all teleological theories have in common is the idea that semantic norms are ultimately derivable from functional norms.

Attempts to naturalize semantics began in the late 1970s.  Many attempts were and still are being made to bring natural-physical explanations to bear on minds and, specifically, to the question of how minds acquire content.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Adams, Fred. "Thoughts and Their Contents: Naturalized Semantics." In Philosophy of Mind 143.&lt;/ref&gt;   This is an interesting question; it is no surprise that it takes center stage in the philosophy of mind.  Indeed, it is certainly an interesting question how minds, thought by those in the natural camp to be "natural physical objects",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; could have developed intentional properties.  In the mid-1980s, with the works of Ruth Millikan and David Papineau (Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories and "Representation and Explanation", respectively) teleosemantics, a theory of mental content that attempts to address the question of content and intentionality of minds, was born.

Ruth Millikan is perhaps the most vocal supporter of the teleosemantic program. Millikan's view differs from other teleosemantic views in myriad ways, but perhaps its most unusual characteristic is its distinction between the mechanisms that produce mental representations from those that consume mental representations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Macdonald, G, and Papineau, D. "Prospects and Problems for Teleosemantics," in Teleosemantics 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a representational function as a whole, at a composite level; and there are two "sub-functions",&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Nicholas. "Millikan's Contribution to Materialist Philosophy of Mind," 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  the producer-function and the consumer-function.  In terms that are easy to understand, let's take Millikan's own example of beavers splashing their tails.  One beaver alerts other beavers to the presence of danger by splashing its tail on the surface of water.  The splashing of the tail tells, or represents to, the other beavers that there is danger in the environment, and the other beavers dip into the water to avoid the danger.  The splashing of the beaver's tail produces a representation; the other beavers consume the representation.  The representation that the beavers consume guides their behavior in ways that relate to their survival.

Of course, the foci of the teleosemantic program is internal representations, and not just representational states of affairs between two (or more) distinct, external  entities.  How does the picture of the producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations?  Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying "The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   The consuming mechanisms are those that "use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   Here, we have a picture similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system.  One sub-function produces mental representations while the other sub-function consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition.  The representations consumed by the consumer sub-function guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival.  This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait.  Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation.  But that is a matter of how.  Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place.

'''The theory of asymmetric dependence''', from Fodor, who says that his theory "distinguishes merely informational relations on the basis of their higher-order relations to each other: informational relations depend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. He gives an example of this theory when he says, "if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by horses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then they carry information about horses, etc. If however, such tokens are caused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they are caused by horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or property horse).

==Alternative theories==

===Indeterminacy of translation===

20th century American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] believed that linguistic terms do not have distinct meanings that accompany them because there are no such entities as "meanings". In his books, ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960) and ''[[Ontological Relativity]]'' (1968), Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate an unknown language in order to outline his thesis. His thesis, the [[indeterminacy of translation]], notes that there are many different ways to distribute purpose and meanings among words. Whenever a theory of translation is made it is commonly based upon context. An argument over the correct translation of an unidentified term depends on the possibility that the native could have spoken a different sentence. The same problem of indeterminacy would appear in this argument once again since any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language. Quine uses as an example the word "gavagai" spoken by a native upon seeing a rabbit. One can go the simplest route and translate the word to "Lo, a rabbit", but other possible translations such as "Lo, food" or "Let's go hunting" are completely reasonable given what the linguist knows. Subsequent observations can rule out certain possibilities as well as questioning the natives. But this is only possible once the linguist has mastered much of the [[natives']] grammar and vocabulary. This is a big problem because this can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language, which admit multiple interpretations, as we have seen.

===The intentional stance===

[[Daniel C. Dennett]]'s theory of mental content, the intentional stance, tries to view the behavior of things in terms of mental properties. According to Dennett: 
"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do."

Dennett's thesis has three levels of abstraction:
# The most tangible is the physical stance, which is at the level of physics and chemistry. This level is concerned with things such as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. 
# Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, which is at the level of biology and engineering. This level is concerned with things such as purpose, function and design. 
# Most abstract is the intentional stance, which is at the level of software and minds. This level is concerned with things such as belief, thinking and intent.

Dennett states that the more concrete the level, the more accurate is in principle our predictions. Though if one chooses to view an object through a more abstract level, he will gain greater computational power by getting a better overall picture of the object and skipping over any extraneous details. Also, switching to a more abstract level has its risks as well as its benefits. If we applied the intentional stance to a thermometer that was heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, trying to understand it through its beliefs about how hot it is and its desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no useful information. The problem would not be understood until we dropped down to the physical stance to comprehend that it has been melted. Whether to take a particular stance should be decided by how successful that stance is when applied. Dennett argued that it is best to understand human beliefs and desires at the level of the intentional stance.

'''Partage''', from the French word "partager" meaning “to share,” was a system put in place to divide up ownership of excavated artifacts during the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Cuno /&gt;  This system was mostly notably employed in [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]] and [[Afghanistan]].

Under ''partage'', foreign-led excavation teams provided the expertise and material means to lead excavations and in return were allowed to share the finds with the local government’s archaeological museums. It was through this system that the collections of archaeological museums at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] Universities were built up.

'''Paul Forman''' (born 1937) is an historian of science and is the retired curator of the Division of Medicine and Science at the [[National Museum of American History]].  Forman's primary research focus has been the [[history of physics]], in which he has helped pioneer the application of [[cultural history]] to scientific developments.

Forman is especially known for two controversial historical theses.  The first (often called "the Forman thesis") regards the influence of German culture on early interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]]; Forman argued that the [[Weimar culture|culture of Weimar Germany]], through its emphasis on acausality, individuality and visualizability (''Anschaulichkeit''), contributed to the acceptance and interpretation of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Weimar culture, causality, and quantum theory: adaptation by German physicists and mathematicians to a hostile environment," ''Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences'', Vol. 3, pp 1-115.  1971.
Forman expanded on his original argument in: Forman, Paul.  "''Kausalität'', ''Anschaullichkeit'', and ''Individualität'', or How Cultural Values Prescribed the Character and Lessons Ascribed to Quantum Mechanics," in ''Society and Knowledge'', eds. Nico Stehr and Volker Meja.  Transaction Books, 1984: pp 333-347.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman's second thesis regards the influence of military funding on the character and course of scientific research; he argued that during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]], the massive scale of defense-related funding prompted a shift in physics from basic to applied research, spurring considerable historical research on the effects of the [[military funding of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, 1987, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman's recent work focuses on "characterization of the modern/postmodern transition in science, society, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;See "The Primacy of Science in Modernity, of Technology in Postmodernity, and of Ideology in the History of Technology," "History and Technology", Vol. 23, No. 1/2, pp. 1-152, March/June 2007 [http://americanhistory.si.edu/about/pubs/forman.pdf National Museum of American History: Paul Forman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630193257/http://www.americanhistory.si.edu/about/pubs/forman.pdf |date=2011-06-30 }}, accessed September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forman thesis==
Forman (1971) argued the remarkable scientific achievements in quantum physics in [[Weimar Germany]] in the 1920s involved the cross-product of the hostile intellectual atmosphere whereby many scientists rejected Weimar Germany as an illegitimate state and in which there were intellectual revolts against [[causality]], [[determinism]] and [[materialism]]. The scientists adjusted to the intellectual environment by dropping [[Causality (physics)|Newtonian causality]] from quantum mechanics, thereby opening up an entirely new and highly successful approach to physics.  Forman links the emergence of quantum mechanics, and [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]'s [[Copenhagen interpretation]] in particular, to the postwar revolt against rationalist and causal-realist [[philosophies of science]]. Many intellectuals felt those philosophies somehow contributed to the crisis of European (more specifically German) national identity. Forman concludes that: 
:"If the physicist were to improve his public image he had first and foremost to dispense with causality, with rigorous determinism, that most universally abhorred feature of the physical world picture. And this, of course, turned out to be precisely what was required for the solution of those problems in atomic physics which were then at the focus of the physicist’s interest."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]], ''Quantum Theory and the Flight from Realism: Philosophical Responses to Quantum Mechanics'' (2000) p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Forman Thesis" has generated an intense debate for and against among historians of science.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kraft et al. "Adaptation of Scientific Knowledge to an Intellectual Environment. Paul Forman's 'Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory, 1918-1927': Analysis and Review," ''[[Centaurus (journal)|Centaurus]]'', Jan 1984, Vol. 27 Issue 1, pp 76-99&lt;/ref&gt; In support of Forman, [[Max Jammer]] and others cite anti-rationalist movements such as [[existentialism]], [[pragmatism]], and [[logical empiricism]] as showing a post-war cultural climate that was receptive to the kinds of argument advanced by Bohr, [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Max Jammer, ''The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as many scholars have challenged the Forman thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh, ''Quantum generations: a history of physics in the twentieth century'' (2002) ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phagomimicry''' is a [[defensive behaviour]] of [[sea hare]]s, in which the animal ejects a mixture of chemicals, which [[Mimicry|mimic]] food, and overwhelm the senses of their predator, giving the sea hare a chance to escape.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kicklighter|first=Cynthia E.|last2=Shabani|first2=Shkelzen|last3=Johnson|first3=Paul M.|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|title=Sea Hares Use Novel Antipredatory Chemical Defenses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205002228|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=6|pages=549–554|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shabani|first1=Shkelzen|last2=Yaldiz|first2=Seymanur|last3=Vu|first3=Luan|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|date=2 October 2007|title=Acidity enhances the effectiveness of active chemical defensive secretions of sea hares, Aplysia californica, against spiny lobsters, Panulirus interruptus|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=193|issue=12|pages=1195–1204|doi=10.1007/s00359-007-0271-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nusnbaum|first1=Matthew|last2=Derby|first2=Charles D.|date=May 2010|title=Ink secretion protects sea hares by acting on the olfactory and nonolfactory chemical senses of a predatory fish|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1067–1076|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.01.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical defence response of the sea hare to a predator is to release two chemicals - [[Cephalopod ink|ink]] from the ink gland and [[opal]]ine from the opaline gland. While ink creates a dark, diffuse cloud in the water which disrupts the sensory perception of the predator by acting as a smokescreen and as a decoy, the opaline, which affects the senses dealing with feeding, causes the predator to instinctively attack the cloud of chemicals as if it were indeed food.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; This ink is able to mimic food by having a high concentration of amino acids and other compounds that are normally found in food, and the attack behaviour of the predator allows the sea-hares the opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NUSNBAUM|first=MATTHEW|last2=DERBY|first2=CHARLES D.|date=2010|title=Effects of Sea Hare Ink Secretion and Its Escapin-Generated Components on a Variety of Predatory Fishes|jstor=27822920|journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=218|issue=3|pages=282–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inking behaviour ==
The inking behaviour exhibited in phagomimicry is in response to predator threat. [[Anaspidea|Sea hares]] have many natural predators such as [[starfish]], [[lobster]]s, and other [[crustacean]]s. When threatened by a predator, phagomimicry behaviour begins. An ink solution is released from both the [[Opaline gland|opaline]] and ink glands individually, then the compounds mix in the mantle of the sea hare to form the ink mixture. When ink is released it creates a smoke-screen like [[Anti-predator adaptation|defense mechanism]] allowing the sea hares time to escape while also affecting the [[Olfaction|olfactory]] and [[Taste|gustation]] senses of their predator.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Predators are tricked into thinking that they have captured their prey due to the specific chemical composition of the ink released. This induces feeding behaviours in the predator, and again gives the sea hares a better chance of escaping predation.

=== Opaline gland ===
The opaline gland is a structure resembling a bundle of grapes attached to a central canal which is composed of [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells. Synthesis of the opaline substance happens in the opaline vesicles themselves, as there are only opaline vesicles and muscle cells in the opaline gland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prince|first=Jeffrey S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Opaline gland ultrastructure in Aplysia californica (Gastropoda: Anaspidea)|url=http://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/73/2/199/978441/Opaline-gland-ultrastructure-in-Aplysia|journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies|language=en|volume=73|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1093/mollus/eym016|issn=0260-1230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gland is innervated by three separate [[motor neuron]]s, and is composed of single large cells and vesicle cells, all of which have enlarged nucleus. These cells are inclosed in an external layer of muscle. When a [[sensory neuron]] detects a predator threat, dopamine is released onto one of the three motor neurons. The dopamine release causes a gland contraction, which then causes the expulsion of the opaline substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunelli|first=M.|last2=Castellucci|first2=V.|last3=Kandel|first3=E. R.|date=1976|title=Synaptic Facilitation and Behavioral Sensitization in Aplysia: Possible Role of Serotonin and Cyclic AMP|jstor=1743647|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1178–1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ink gland ===
The ink gland is smaller in size than the opaline gland, and is composed of two cell types: Rough endoplasmic recticlum (RER) and granulate cells. The cells are surrounded by a layer of muscle, to contraction and expelling their contents. The RER is the formation site of the anti-predator protein, the granulate cells are for extra pigment storage. Pigment is dependent on the amount of red algae available to the sea hares, the higher the red algal consumption, the darker the colour of their ink.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamio|first=Michiya|last2=Grimes|first2=Tiphani V.|last3=Hutchins|first3=Melissa H.|last4=Dam|first4=Robyn van|last5=Derby|first5=Charles D.|title=The purple pigment aplysioviolin in sea hare ink deters predatory blue crabs through their chemical senses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347210001338|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=1|pages=89–100|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixing can cause another chain of reactions between the compounds that have further implications on the effect that the ink secretion has on predators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ink chemical composition ==
Both the opaline and ink gland secrete different substances that when mixed together form the ink released during phagomimicry. The secretion is very acidic (ink having a pH of 4.9 and opaline having a pH of 5.8) and contains high levels of bioactive molecules that can serve as feeding stimulants, feeding deterrents, and aversive compounds. Feeding stimulants can be found in both the ink and opaline secretions in the form of [[amino acid]]s (such as [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]), and serve to trick predators into thinking that the ink secretion is a food source.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derby|first=Charles D.|last2=Kicklighter|first2=Cynthia E.|last3=Johnson|first3=P.

== Physical properties of Ink ==
The ink released from the ink gland is dark purple in colour, the colour depends on the type of algae consumed by the sea-hare.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt; The opaline ink is white in colour, and when it mixes with the ink gland ink they form a compound that suspends itself in the water ([[Dispersity|polidisperse]] suspension), creating a smoke-screen defence mechanism.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; The particle density of the ink is similar to that of species such as [[cuttlefish]], the particles range in size from 80–150&amp;nbsp;nm, with a density of 1.27&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;small&gt;-3,&lt;/small&gt; which allows for the inks suspension in water &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soto-Gómez|first=Diego|last2=Pérez-Rodríguez|first2=Paula|last3=López-Periago|first3=J.

'''Princess Marcella Borghese''', born '''Marcella Fazi''' (1911– January 19, 2002), was a manufacturer of cosmetics.

== History ==
Marcella Fazi was born in [[Umbria]] in 1911. In 1937 she became the second wife of the widowed nobleman [[Paolo Borghese (born 1904)|Paolo Borghese]], Duke of Bomarzo and Prince of Sant’ Angelo of San Paolo, and acquired the title of Princess.  She gave birth to twin boys, Francesco and Livio, the same year. She also had two daughters, Rosanna and Anita Mauritzi, from a previous marriage. She had two grandchildren from her first marriage, Sylvia and Valentina. From her second marriage she had five grandchildren; Scipione, Ilaria and [[Lorenzo Borghese|Lorenzo]] from Francesco's side and from Livio's side, Luca and Matteo.

The fashion-conscious princess had toiletries, including makeup, made specifically for her using the natural ingredients found around the [[Villa Borghese]] in Rome, where the family lived. She wanted to create a line of lipsticks in a wider variety of shades than what was available at the time, and once [[Pope Pius XII]] gave the cosmetics his blessing,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifeinitaly.com/beauty/borghese.asp&lt;/ref&gt; pushed forward with the idea.

Princess Marcella Borghese died in 2002 in her home in [[Montreux, Switzerland]]. She was 90 years old, and was buried in the family crypt at the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/08/business/marcella-borghese-princess-90-began-a-line-of-cosmetics.html "Marcella Borghese; Princess, 90, Began A Line of Cosmetics"], February 08, 2002, ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
In 1956, Borghese met cosmetics magnate, [[Charles Revson]], the founder of [[Revlon]]. The two struck up a lifelong friendship, as he helped her to create her cosmetics line, which Revlon then licensed under the Princess Marcella Borghese brand name.&lt;ref name=Goad&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8YkwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k_sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6672,7230744 "Princess fashions"], by Kimberly Goad, ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', published in ''[[Lakeland Ledger]]'', Jun 15, 1987. Retrieved from [[Google News]] 2013-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Princess Marcella Borghese's first collections included brightly colored lipsticks and nail colors to match the vivid colors of her fashion designer friend, [[Emilio Pucci]]'s knitwear. Her Montecatini Cosmetic line, named after her favorite spa (and an ancient town in Tuscany), used the purported healing properties of the [[Montecatini Terme|Terme di Montecatini]] mud and the mineral waters.&lt;ref name=Goad/&gt; The Princess was one of the first people to create a skincare line which was based on the natural therapies of a spa.

In 1992 Revlon sold the Borghese brand to Halston Borghese International Limited,&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2010cv05552/365709/138/0.pdf?1358259244&amp;chrome=true] See p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; a new company set up in New York by four Saudi investors (all brothers) to buy and hold Revlon’s Halston and Princess Marcella Borghese divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/Revlon-Sells-Borghese-Halston-Lines-to-Saudi-Investors/id-b838ce0d26a0654e0955c6e4ebc27bb8 ‘Revlon sells Borghese, Halston Lines to Saudi Investors’], Associated Press News Archive, Jan 20, 1992 5:02 PM ET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Groom, ''The New Perfume Handbook'', 2nd edn (London: Blackie Academic &amp; Professional, 1997), p. 150 {{ISBN|9780751404036}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Borghese remained involved in the line named after her until her death. 

Today, the company is known as simply Borghese and is based in New York City. It has been run by CEO [[Georgette Mosbacher]] since 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">'''Robert Thomas Jenkins''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (31 August 1881 &amp;ndash; 11 November 1969) was a Welsh historian and academic.

==Life==
Jenkins was born on 31 August 1881 in [[Liverpool]].  He moved with his family to [[Bangor, Gwynedd]] when his father was appointed clerk to the registrar of the newly established [[University College of North Wales]].  However, both of his parents had died by 1888 and he was then brought up by his maternal grandparents in [[Bala, Gwynedd]].  He was baptised by [[Thomas Charles Edwards]] and studied at Bala grammar school before winning a [[scholarship]] to the [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]], obtaining a first-class degree in English in 1901.  He then studied history and English at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] before teaching in [[Llandysul]] (1904), in [[Brecon]] (1904 to 1917) and at the [[Cardiff High School|City of Cardiff High School for Boys]] (1917 to 1930). Whilst he was a teacher, his interest in history deepened and he began to start writing articles on historical topics.

In 1928, he published a history of Wales in the 18th century, with further books following in 1930, the year that he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Wales Bangor.  He was assistant editor, then joint editor, of ''{{lang|cy|Y Bywgraffiadur Cymreig}}'' and its English-language counterpart, ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography|The Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'', writing over 600 entries. He was appointed to a professorship at Bangor in 1945 and retired from the university in 1948, although he continued to work.

He co-wrote a history of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] in 1951, the year of its 200th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=R.T. |last1=Jenkins |first2=Helen M. |last2=Ramage |title=A History of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and of the Gwyneddigion and Cymreigyddion Societies (1751-1951) |place=London |publisher=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion |series=Y Cymmrodor |volume=50 |year=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was awarded the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1956.

'''Snailbeach Countryside Site''' is an industrial archeology site in [[Shropshire]]. It is located three {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of the village of [[Pontesbury]] and around {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the county town of [[Shrewsbury]]. At peak of production during the 19th century, it was reputed to be extracting the largest volume of [[lead]] per [[acre]] in Europe.

== History and importance ==
Once the biggest lead mine in the county of Shropshire, the site is conserved as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name="council"&gt;Shropshire Council.(Unknown).[http://shropshire.gov.uk/outdoor-recreation/parks-and-countryside-sites/snailbeach-countryside-site/ "Snailbeach Countryside Site"]. Last accessed 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead mining may have taken place here since [[Mining in Roman Britain#Lead mining|Roman times]] and, at peak of production in the 1840s and '50s, it is reputed to have extracted the largest volume of lead per acre in Europe. Lead mining ceased at the site in 1955.&lt;ref name="snailbeach"&gt;Snailbeach Lead Mine.(Unknown).

{{Marxian economics |Concepts}}

In the theoretical works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] and subsequent [[Marxist]] writers, '''socialization''' (or the '''socialization of production''') is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor. With the development of capitalism, production becomes centralized in firms and increasingly mechanized in contrast to the pre-capitalist modes of production where the act of production was a largely solitary act performed by individuals. Socialization occurs due to centralization of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in industries where there are [[increasing returns to scale]] and a deepening of the division of labor and the specialization in skills necessary for increasingly complex forms of production and value creation. Progressive socialization of the forces of production under [[capitalism]] eventually comes into conflict with the persistence of relations of production based on private property; this contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation of the social product forms the impetus for the socialization of property relations (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marx's critique of political economy, as capitalism develops a contradiction emerges between the increasingly socialized act of production and the private ownership and appropriation of surplus value. Classical Marxist theory posits that this contradiction will intensify to a point where socialization of surplus value appropriation in the form of [[social ownership]] of the means of production will be necessitated, resulting in a transition from capitalism to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Karl Marx defined socialization as a general phenomenon where the labor process comes to embody the capabilities and constraints developed in society as opposed to private experiences, with objective socialization of the forces of production being the deepening of the social division of labor including specialization of skills and deepening interdependence between industries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Marxist theory ==
Socialization is a process that begins to take place in capitalism as large-scale manufacturing based on a vertical [[division of labour]] displaces "cottage industry" - the small-scale production shops, guilds and family-run businesses that existed in [[Feudalism|feudal economies]]. This process transforms the act of production into an increasingly social and collective process involving planning and greater coordination among producers, but appropriation of the social product in the form of private profit continues to be a private affair by investors and owners of the enterprise. Furthermore, exchange of the commodities produced is the private act of a small group of capitalists or an individual owner. As the process of socialization expands, a contradiction between the socialized nature of production and the individual nature of appropriation of the surplus product arises, coinciding with the obsolescence of the functions performed by the capitalists (the private owners).

The socialization and centralization of industry and capital under capitalism lays the foundations for a socialist economy. Socialism entails ownership of the socialized means of production by the workers engaged in the production either in the form of [[Worker cooperative|worker ownership]] or [[social ownership]] by all of society. The establishment of social ownership over the means of production resolves the contradiction between social production and private exchange/appropriation under capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', by Engels, Friedrich. From "Part III: Historical Materialism": "Capitalist Revolution - transformation of industry, at first be means of simple cooperation and manufacture. Concentration of the means of production, hitherto scattered, into great workshops. As a consequence, their transformation from individual to social means of production — a transformation which does not, on the whole, affect the form of exchange. The old forms of appropriation remain in force. The capitalist appears. In his capacity as owner of the means of production, he also appropriates the products and turns them into commodities. Production has become a social act. Exchange and appropriation continue to be individual acts, the acts of individuals. The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves, and which modern industry brings to light."&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Marx envisioned socialization under socialism as involving an expansion of [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] on the part of workers over their work processes, in contrast to the rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy that characterizes traditional capitalist enterprises. As workers gain more autonomy, they also gain more collective decision-making power and control over their work processes. Socialization of the ownership of the means of production is different from [[nationalization]], which can, but usually does not imply the socialization of the workplace. In a capitalist economy, socialization is limited because the socialized enterprise continues to operate in a commodity economy under the capitalist laws of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialisation&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization therefore takes a different form in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] than in the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]].

A '''strophe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|oʊ|f|iː}}) is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the [[ode]] in [[Ancient Greek tragedy]], followed by the [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]]. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing [[stanza]]s of varying line length. Strophic poetry is to be contrasted with poems composed line-by-line non-stanzaically, such as Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poems]] or English [[blank verse]], to which the term ''[[stichic]]'' applies.

In its original Greek setting, "strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of [[stanza]] framed only for the music," as [[John Milton]] wrote in the preface to ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', with the strophe chanted by a [[Greek chorus]] as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
Strophe (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:στροφή|στροφή]], "turn, bend, twist") is a concept in [[poetry|versification]] which properly means a turn, as from one [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] to another, or from one side of a chorus to the other.

==Poetic structure==
In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of [[stanza]]s of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical with the stanza in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character. But the Greeks called a combination of verse-periods a system, giving the name "strophe" to such a system only when it was repeated once or more in unmodified form.

A simple form of Greek strophe is the Sapphic strophe. Like all Greek verse, it is composed of alternating long and short syllables (symbolized by '''—''' for long, '''u''' for short and '''x''' for either long or short) in this case arranged in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;William S. Annis. Introduction to Greek Meter. Aoidoi.org January 2006. [http://www.aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf. Page 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — x — u u — —'''

Far more complex forms are found in the odes of [[Pindar]] and the choral sections of [[Greek drama]].

In choral poetry, it is common to find the strophe followed by a metrically identical [[antistrophe]], which may – in Pindar and other [[epinician]] poets – be followed in turn by a metrically dissimilar [[epode]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D. Floyd. "Some more or less technical observations on Greek rhythm." class material for University of Pittsburgh: Classics 1130. http://www.pitt.edu/~edfloyd/Class1130/strophe.html accessed January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; creating an ''AAB'' form.

==Origins and development==
It is said that [[Archilochus of Paros|Archilochus]] first created the strophe by binding together systems of two or three lines. But it was the [[Greece|Greek]] ode-writers who introduced the practice of strophe-writing on a large scale, and the art was attributed to [[Stesichorus]], although it is likely that earlier poets were acquainted with it. The arrangement of an [[ode]] in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] was carried to its height by [[Pindar]].

==Variant forms==
With the development of Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]], various peculiar strophe-forms came into general acceptance, and were made celebrated by the frequency with which leading poets employed them. Among these were the ''Sapphic,'' the ''Elegiac,'' the ''Alcaic,'' and the ''Asclepiadean'' strophe, all of them prominent in Greek and Latin verse. The briefest and the most ancient strophe is the ''dactylic distych,'' which consists of two verses of the same class of rhythm, the second producing a melodic counterpart to the first.

==Reproductions==
The forms in modern English verse which reproduce most exactly the impression aimed at by the ancient odestrophe are the elaborate rhymed stanzas of such poems as [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[wikisource:Ode to a Nightingale|Ode to a Nightingale]]'' or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[wikisource:The Scholar-Gipsy|The Scholar-Gipsy]]''.

A strophic form of poetry called [[Muwashshah]] developed in [[Andalucia]] as early as the 9th century C.E, which then spread to North Africa and the Middle East. Muwashshah was typically in classical Arabic, with the refrain sometimes in the local dialect.

==Contemporary usage==
The term strophe is used in modern and post-modern criticism, to indicate "long non-isomorphic units".&lt;ref&gt;Page 1360, Entry 'STROPHE', The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition, edited by Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, Paul Rouzer&lt;/ref&gt; The term "stanza [is used] for more regular ones" (ibid). This appropriation of the ancient term is useful, as contemporary poetry is a frequent turns (the original meaning of Strophe), and it avoids relying upon the invention of new terminology such as 'word clumps'.

[[File:3pillars originofpoliticalorder.gif|thumb|The three components/pillars of a stable state according to Fukuyama]]
'''''The Origins of Political Order''''' is a 2011 book by [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] about what makes a state stable. It uses a comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, a stable state needs to be modern and strong, to obey the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}

{{toclimit|2}}

==Series of books==
The book is the first of two books on the development of [[Political system|political order]]. This book goes from its origins to the [[French Revolution]]. The next book ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day]]'', published in September 2014, starts with the French Revolution and carries the analysis to the present day.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=furedi/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewson&gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy]]''. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why states and institutions fail==
The book is an attempt to understand why modern statebuilding and the building of institutions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia have failed to live up to expectations.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|loc=Preface}}

In the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US administration seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=13}}

The book is about "getting to Denmark," in other words creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and honest societies.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|title=''How To Get to the End of History or "getting to Denmark"'' review|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/05/how_to_get_to_the_end_of_history.html |work=Slate|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama points out that at the time of writing ninety contemporary 'primitive' societies had been engaged in war,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=73}} suggesting that political order is preferable to primitive social structures if stability is to be achieved. The author describes how attempts at shaping countries outside the western world into western type democracies failed, and that this book was an attempt to find out why, by trying to find the true origins of political order, by tracing the histories of China, India, Europe and some Muslim countries from the point of view of three components.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312}}

==Aims==
Since the aim of the book is to understand how institutions and states develop in different countries, it is also a book on [[comparative historical research]].

It is an extension of [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Political Order in Changing Societies]]'' and similar in scope to [[Jared Diamond]]’s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name=sailer&gt;{{cite web|title= Fukuyama's World  |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fukuyamas-world/ |work=The American Conservative|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama develops his argument with respect to the history of China, India and the Middle East before focusing on the way European countries developed in a variety of directions.&lt;ref name=blackburn&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Robert|title=''The Origins of Political Order'' review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution-by-francis-fukuyama-2283020.html |work=The Independent|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From pre-human origins to states==

===From chimpanzee hunting groups to tribes===
In his quest for the origins of political order, he first looks at the social order among chimpanzees, notes that the war-like hunting group, rather than the family, was the primary social group, and claims the same for humans. Humans went further: to survive they formed tribes, whose armies were superior to hunting groups by their sheer size.&lt;ref name= hewson &gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=
https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marq&gt;{{cite web|title= Review|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2011/06/fukuyama-order-state-india |work=New Statesman|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burl&gt;{{cite web|title=  A dense study of global political development |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8540907/The-Origins-of-Political-Order-by-Francis-Fukuyama-review.html |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He uses recent work in sociobiology and other sources to show that sociability built on kin selection and reciprocal altruism is the original default social state of man and not any isolated, presocial human as suggested by [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Michael|title=''Francis Fukuyama's Theory of the State'' review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-origins-of-political-order-by-francis-fukuyama.html?pagewanted=all |work=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=439}} He suggests that Hobbes and Locke present a fallacy when they argue humans developed cooperative ability only as a result of the invention of the state. This is because chimps, the genetic ancestors to humans, engage in kin relations based on cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Waal|first1=Frans|title=Chimpanzee Politics|date=2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Hobbes and Locke must be suggesting humans were once sociable, lost this instinct and then regained it due to the state.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=34}}

===Challenge of tribes on the road towards the state===
The next step was to escape beyond tribalism and the "tyranny of cousins", to join tribes into larger coalitions&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt; towards states, again due to the advantage of larger armies. This was done with the aid of religion.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt; This was because as groups grew in size, maintaining cooperation became more difficult as face-to-face interactions with much of society became difficult. Religion offered a way of providing a combining social force to hold society together .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=37}} For example, Fukuyama cites [[Mohammed]] as an example of what Weber labels a "[[charismatic leader]]" because he used the idea of an '[[umma]]' (community of believers) to bind together the territory that he ruled over .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=87}} This challenge to transcend tribalism partly remains today in many parts of the world that is outside Western civilization, for example in Afghanistan and in Somalia.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt;

====Restrictions on marriage and inheritance as a strategy against corruption====
Loyalty to the tribe or the family, rather than to the state, leads to corruption and weakening of the state. Various strategies were used to overcome the corruption. One such strategy was restrictions against marriage among the ruling official class to make sure that loyalties would not lie with family or tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarins or [[Scholar-official]]s, who were the ruling class of China, were not allowed to pass on the lands given to them by the emperor to their own children and were restricted as to whom they were allowed to marry.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=116,367}}

[[Mamluk]] slaves, the ruling class of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, were told which slaves to marry while their children could not inherit from them.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=198}}[[Jannissary|Jannisarries]] were originally forced into celibacy or and prohibited from having a family.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=219}}{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=225}}

[[Pope Gregory VII]] forced Catholic priests in Europe to become celibate and they were prohibited from having a family for the same reason.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=264}}

Spanish administrators in South America were restricted from to marrying local women and from establishing family ties in the territories they were sent to.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=367}}

==Three components of political order==
The books develops the idea of the development of the three components of a modern political order, which are,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}
# '''[[State (polity)#The modern state|State building]]'''
# '''[[Rule of law]]'''
# '''Accountable government'''

[[China]], [[India]], the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and Europe each developed these three components of political organization in different order, in different ways and to different degrees. Denmark and the United Kingdom arrived first at a modern balance of the three components in a single package, follow by others by the nineteenth century, as the Netherlands and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}

China is described as having the first modern state,&lt;ref name=econom1&gt;{{cite web|title=''The good, the great and the gelded'' review|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18483257 |work=The Economist|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the definition given, since it established an educated Mandarin bureaucracy, although Hewson objects to this conclusion since the Mandarin bureaucracy was not modern.&lt;ref name=hewson/&gt; China used extreme violence on its population (especially during the influence of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=120}}), but had a weak rule of law and the emperor had no accountability to anyone.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

===India===
India is contrasted with China. India could not use extreme force on its population due to the traditional power of the [[brahmin]] [[priestly caste]], who protested violence against the populace and war against neighboring states, by refusing to perform ancestral rituals for the [[Raja]] leaders. The power of the Brahmins weakening the state's power over its people, and effectively forced a strong accountability on its leaders to the population of India via its priestly class.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=158-167}} An example Fukuyama gives of the influence religion had on early Indian rulers is [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) of the [[Maurya Dynasty]], who under the influence of Buddhism (rather than Brahmanism) came to regret his conquests in the Kalinga War. He vowed to end his empire, and eventually the entire political system collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=182}}

===Muslim states===
Certain Muslim states developed the practice of making imported slaves as the ruling class, as with the [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt and the Janissaries of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, a process which started around the 8th century. Since these ruling class slaves were neither beholden to family nor to any tribe, but dependent only on the state, it ensured their loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=218-219}} A later example would be the 16th-century Ottoman Empire practice of seeking out intelligent Christian children for high civil service or military positions, who were cut off from their family for their training.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=190}}

===Europe===
In 11th-century Europe, instead of the state having the upper hand as in China, or the Brahmins having the upper hand as in India, there was a power conflict between state and church, the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266}}

The papal party started to search for sources of law to strengthen its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. They rediscovered the Justinian Code, the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]], in a library near Bologna in northern Italy in 1072, leading later to the student body called a "universitas", first in Bologna, and soon after in Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen studying the code and displacing particularistic Salic law.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=268-269}} The laws gave the Gregory the authority to [[excommunicate]] Henry IV, who was forced to [[walk to Canossa]] from Germany to Italy, stand barefoot{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=168}} in the snow for three days{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=265}} outside Canossa and to ask forgiveness from the pope on his knees.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=268}} The [[Concordat of Worms]] ended the struggle between popes and emperors in 1122. It created balance between royal power and religious tradition not seen anywhere else before.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

Catholic leaders became accountable to the clergy and to the pope, who historically frequently objected to violence and wars, just as their counterparts in India had done, but in Europe the clergy did not weaken the states as much as Brahmins had done in India. The papal intercessions against wars between Catholic countries also led to the survival of small states in Europe, similar to India, but in contrast to what had happened in China. The existence of small states who were restricted by the church from recruiting mass armies waging wars costly in casualties, as had been the case in China, combined with the existence of independent university scholars, led to military innovations on land and sea to empower fewer soldiers to wield wars effectively and later gave these relatively small countries a military advantage large enough to conquer colonies in the rest of the world. Western Europe began getting the best of both worlds. In England, the rise of common law also strengthened the rule of law. With the reformation, the Lutheran priest N.F.S. Grundtvig in Denmark advocated general literacy since they believed that every Christian should read the bible and established schools throughout the country, leading to voting rights 1849.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;434}} In Denmark this led to the state gradually being more accountable to the general population, since they could now vote and read. In England and Denmark a balance was finally struck between the three components of political order.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;269}}

==Balance between the components==
A successful modern liberal democracy balances all three components to achieve stability.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=6,188}}

In China a strong modern state came to power first and the state subjugated any potential agents that might have demanded the other two components. In China, the priestly class did not develop into an organized independent religion, as the priests were in the service of the Emperor. Numerous times, therefore, imperial dynasties collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=151}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In India, the Brahmins became organised into a strong upper caste of India and the warrior/state caste was held to account by a rule of law as interpreted by the Brahmins. Because of the state was weakened by this limitation, attempts at unifying India under one rule did not last very long.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=183}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In Europe, there was a long period when the emperors and popes were in conflict, creating a balance of power between them,&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; and ultimately leading to a situation where some small states developed a stable balance between the three components in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

The Greenland colony lasted until the 15th century, but the settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] is the only known [[Norsemen|Norse]] villages in North America outside of Greenland.  This was estimated to have endured less than a decade.

{{further information|History of gunpowder}}

This is a timeline of the history of [[gunpowder]] and related topics such as weapons, warfare, and industrial applications. The timeline covers the history of gunpowder from the first hints of its origin as a [[Taoist]] [[alchemical]] product in China until its replacement by [[smokeless powder]] in the late 19th century.

'''''The Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites''''' is a set of guidelines, drawn up in 1964 by a group of conservation professionals in Venice, that provides an international framework for the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] of historic buildings.&lt;ref name="Erder" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/erder.pdf |title=Erdem, C. The Venice Charter under Review. (1977). Ankara. |format=PDF |date= March 1977 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the document is now seen as outdated, representing Modernist views opposed to reconstruction. Reconstruction is now cautiously accepted by UNESCO in exceptional circumstances if it seeks to reflect a pattern of use or cultural practice that sustains cultural value, and is based on complete documentation without reliance on conjecture. The change in attitude can be marked by the reconstruction in 2015 of the Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World Heritage Site in Mali after their destruction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Christina''Reconstruction: changing attitudes'', UNESCO[https://en.unesco.org/courier/july-september-2017/reconstruction-changing-attitudes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic background==

===Athens Charter===
The development of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense.&lt;ref name="hx" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/history.pdf |title=ICOMOS. (2004). The History of the Venice Charter. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings. The conference resulted with the [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] for the Restoration of Historic Monuments. This consisted of a manifesto of seven points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/charters-and-texts?id=167:the-athens-charter-for-the-restoration-of-historic-monuments&amp;catid=179:charters-and-standards |title=The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments.

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored.
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

The Athens Charter proposed the idea of a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/research_resources/charters/charter02.html|title= The GETTY Conservation Institute. Cultural Heritage Policy Documents: General Conclusions of the Athens Conference 1931 |format=Web page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter.

===First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
With the concern that listing and safeguarding historic buildings was not enough, in 1957 architectural specialists arranged a congress in Paris called The First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings. At its conclusion, the congress published seven recommendations:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
# the countries which still lack a central organization for the protection of historic buildings provide for the establishment of such an authority,
# the creation of an international assembly of architects and specialists of historic buildings should be considered,
# a specialized professional training of all categories of personnel should be promoted so as to secure highly qualified workmanship and that remuneration should be commensurate with such qualifications,
# the hygrometric problems relating to historic buildings should be discussed in a symposium,
# contemporary artists should be requested to contribute to the decoration of monuments,
# close cooperation should be established among architects and archeologists,
# architects and town-planners cooperate so as to secure integration of historic buildings into town planning.

The Congress agreed to have its second meeting in Venice and Piero Gazzola, who was to serve as the chairman of the Venice Charter, was invited to hold the Venice Congress.&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

===Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
In 1964, at the Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 13 resolutions were adopted of which the first was the Venice Charter and the second was creation of [[ICOMOS|ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites)]].&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

The Venice Charter consisted of seven main titles and sixteen articles. The concept of historic monuments and sites was interpreted as the common heritage, therefore safeguarding them for the future generations with authenticity was defined as the common responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/hommedecin.pdf|title= IInd International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments Committee. (1964). Decisions and Resolutions. Venice. |format=PDF |date= 1964-03-31|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text is the original 1964 text agreed on by the representatives of the participating [[nation]]s mentioned at the end of the [[Charter]].

==Venice Charter Text==

===Definitions===
'''Article 1.''' The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.

'''Article 2.''' The conservation and restoration of monuments must have recourse to all the sciences and techniques which can contribute to the study and safeguarding of the architectural heritage.

===Aim===
'''Article 3.''' The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence.

===Conservation===
'''Article 4.''' It is essential to the conservation of monuments that they be maintained on a permanent basis.

'''Article 5.''' The conservation of monuments is always facilitated by making use of them for some socially useful purpose. Such use is therefore desirable but it must not change the lay-out or decoration of the building. It is within these limits only that modifications demanded by a change of function should be envisaged and may be permitted.

'''Article 6.''' The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed.

'''Article 7.''' A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance.

'''Article 8.''' Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed from it if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation.

===Restoration===
'''Article 9.''' The process of restoration is a highly specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical study of the monument.

'''Article 10.''' Where traditional techniques prove inadequate, the consolidation of a monument can be achieved by the use of any modern technique for conservation and construction, the efficacy of which has been shown by scientific data and proved by experience.

'''Article 11.''' The valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected, since unity of style is not the aim of a restoration. When a building includes the superimposed work of different periods, the revealing of the underlying state can only be justified in exceptional circumstances and when what is removed is of little interest and the material which is brought to light is of great historical, archaeological or aesthetic value, and its state of preservation good enough to justify the action. Evaluation of the importance of the elements involved and the decision as to what may be destroyed cannot rest solely on the individual in charge of the work.

'''Article 12.''' Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.

'''Article 13.''' Additions cannot be allowed except in so far as they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, its traditional setting, the balance of its composition and its relation with its surroundings.

===Historic Sites===
'''Article 14.''' The sites of monuments must be the object of special care in order to safeguard their integrity and ensure that they are cleared and presented in a seemly manner. The work of conservation and restoration carried out in such places should be inspired by the principles set forth in the foregoing articles.

===Excavations===
'''Article 15.''' Excavations should be carried out in accordance with scientific standards and the recommendation defining international principles to be applied in the case of archaeological excavation adopted by UNESCO in 1956.
Ruins must be maintained and measures necessary for the permanent conservation and protection of architectural features and of objects discovered must be taken. Furthermore, every means must be taken to facilitate the understanding of the monument and to reveal it without ever distorting its meaning.

All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori." Only anastylosis, that is to say, the reassembling of existing but dismembered parts can be permitted. The material used for integration should always be recognizable and its use should be the least that will ensure the conservation of a monument and the reinstatement of its form.

===Publication===
'''Article 16.''' In all works of preservation, restoration or excavation, there should always be precise documentation in the form of analytical and critical reports, illustrated with drawings and photographs. Every stage of the work of clearing, consolidation, rearrangement and integration, as well as technical and formal features identified during the course of the work, should be included. This record should be placed in the archives of a public institution and made available to research workers. It is recommended that the report should be published.

== Outcome ==
The Venice Charter is the most influential document on conservation since 1964. However the following aspects are not covered in the Venice Charter:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
* The concept of site which also applies to historic landscapes and gardens
* The concept of reversibility in restoration
* The social and financial issues

In the years after the publishing, the purpose of the charter a number of symposiums took place in order to improve common understandings and awareness of it by those involved in the conservation and restoration works of the historic buildings. How it was applied in different countries varied according to their social, economic and cultural conditions, as well as the technical qualifications of those applying it.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt; Translation mistakes and misunderstandings of the Charter also led to differences in its application.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The Venice Charter and its subsequent interpretations have attracted criticism, especially by those who perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Younés has written: "The Charter’s abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction – with its implicit fear of "false history" – reflects the Modernist theory of [[historical determinism]], rather than the idea of a living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and building crafts skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories."&lt;ref name="Revisit"&gt;Hardy, Matthew (Ed.) ''The Venice Charter Revisited: Modernism, Conservation and Tradition in the 21st Century'', foreword by HRH The Prince of Wales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue is taken particularly with the words in Article 9: "Any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and ''must bear a contemporary stamp."''  This declaration has had a major impact on the management of historic buildings globally. In the U.S., for example, it shaped the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard #9 so it stated "...new work shall be differentiated from the old". It has been commonly interpreted to mean that interventions and additions have to be in Modernist styles, rather than being discreetly indicated by such devices as dated cornerstones and descriptive plaques. Many popular reconstructions now considered intrinsic to their locations, such as the 1912 rebuilding of the [[St Mark's Campanile|Campanile di San Marco]] in Venice, would violate the Venice Charter’s dictum: “All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori".&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Because of concern over the damage being to historic settings by the Venice Charter's misapplication, in 2006 another conference was held in Venice under the auspices of INTBAU (the [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism]]). Its principal objective was to provide a theoretical framework that would enable new buildings and additions to be in greater harmony with their historic surroundings.&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Critics of the Venice Charter point to the 2005 Charleston Charter as providing preferred guidelines for dealing with historic areas. It states: “New construction in historic settings, including alterations and additions to existing buildings, should not arbitrarily impose contrasting materials, scales, or design vocabularies, but clarify and extend the character of the place, seeking always continuity and wholeness in the built environment.”&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

==Revisions==

Beginning with the [[World Heritage Convention]] (1972), some of the limited explanations in the Venice Charter were revised. The understanding of cultural heritage, which was expressed as historic monuments, was categorized as monuments, groups of buildings and sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. (1972). 
|format=Web Page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petzet" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/petzet.pdf|title= Petzet, M. .(2004). Principles of Preservation: An introduction to the International Charters for Conservation and Restoration 40 years after the Venice Charter.|format=Web Page |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/events/documents/event-833-3.pdf The Nara Document on Authenticity] (1992) carried out the responsibility to clarify the authenticity related issues which were expressed in the articles 6 and 7 of the Venice Charter.&lt;ref name="Petzet" /&gt;

In the Naples ICOMOS meeting on 7 November 1995; the question  [http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf ‘Should there be a review of the Venice Charter?’] was discussed with participation of Raymound Lemaire, the reporter of the Venice Charter in 1964. Thirty years after the Venice Charter, Lemaire declared that: "Charters are fashionable. They are considered to contribute to directing action. However they never contain more than the minimum on which the majority has agreed. Only exceptionally do they cover the whole of the issue which concerns them. This is the case with the Venice Charter."&lt;ref name="Lemaire"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf|title= ICOMOS Scientific Journal: Raymond Lemaire: ICOMOS - un regard en arrière, un coup d'oeil en avant. (1995). Paris. |format=PDF |date=1995-11-07|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated his opinions about the present understanding of monuments and their restoration. He pointed out the necessity of a new document, or an effective adaptation, with consideration of the need "to be addressed with caution and wisdom, with respect for all cultures and above all with ethical and intellectual discipline."&lt;ref name="Lemaire" /&gt;

The Venice Charter has itself become an historic document. While some of its guidelines are considered to have proven their worth by both its supporters and critics, there are now plans for it to be rewritten.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

He studied at the [[Perm Theological Seminary]], but eventually decided against becoming a priest. He graduated from the Kazan Veterinary Institute in 1912 and then from the [[Moscow Archaeological Institute]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="shgpi"/&gt; He became an archaeologist. For two years he studied at the [[Russian State Agricultural University]], attended classes at the [[Tomsk State University]] since the end of 1919.

In 1910 Vladimir Biryukov organized a museum in Pershinskoye, the first village museum in the area. The museum was transferred to [[Shadrinsk]] and now called the [[Shadrinsk Local History Museum|Shadrinsk Local History Museum named after V. P. Biryukov]]. Since 1920 he headed the Museum of Antiquities under the [[Perm State University]]. Since 1923 he was an active member of [[the Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], participating in conferences and plenary meetings. From the 1920s to 1933 he edited the Academy of Sciences's ''Russian Language Dictionary''. When in the mid-1930s [[Sverdlovsk Publishing House]] decided to publish the collection ''Prerevolutionary Folklore of [[Ural (region)|the Urals]]'', he was offered to make such a collection.&lt;ref name="Blazhes7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blazhes|first=Valentin |authorlink = Valentin Blazhes|year=2003|title= K istorii sozdanija bazhovskih skazov|script-title = ru:К истории создания бажовских сказов |trans-title=About the creation history of Bazhov's stories |journal=Izvestiya of the Ural State University|publisher=The [[Ural State University]] |volume=28 |url=http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/24155/1/iurg-2003-28-01.pdf|language=Russian |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1930 to 1938 he worked in Sverdlovsk, in the regional bureau that studied local culture, then lived in Shadrinsk and then in Sverdlovsk again. He became the member of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1955. He died and was buried in Sverdlovsk.

As a military chaplain he witnessed the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515.

Most of Steiner's writing was not printed during his lifetime and survives in manuscript form, some of which were edited by his descendants in the 17th century.

'''Wuppertal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvʊpɐtaːl|-|Wuppertal.ogg}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], in and around the [[Wupper]] valley, east of [[Düsseldorf]] and south of the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr]]. With a population of approximately 350,000, it is the largest city in the [[Bergisches Land]]. Wuppertal is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and its [[suspension railway]], the [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway|Wuppertal Schwebebahn]]. It is the greenest city of Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Wupper valley was one of the largest industrial regions of continental Europe. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops encouraged the expansion of the nearby ''[[Ruhr]]gebiet''. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, [[metallurgy]], chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment.

[[Aspirin]] originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by [[Bayer]], as is the Vorwerk-Kobold [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref name="110 Jahre Aspirin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geschichtspuls.de/art1294-markenjubilaum-110-jahre-aspirin-kopfschmerzmittel|title=110 Jahre Aspirin|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=GeschichtsPuls|author=Marvin Brendel|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobold vacuum cleaner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|title=Official website Vorwerk - Kobold vacuum cleaners|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wuppertal Institute|Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] and the [[European Institute for International Economic Relations]] are located in the city.&lt;ref name="EIIW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiiw.eu/index.php?id=3619&amp;L=1|title=Official website European Institute for International Economic Relations|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] with the communities [[Vohwinkel, Wuppertal|Vohwinkel]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]], [[Langerfeld]] and [[Beyenburg]]. The initial name '''Barmen-Elberfeld''' was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (“Wupper Valley”). The new city was administered as part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]].

Uniquely for Germany, it is a "[[linear city]]", owing to the steep hillsides along the river [[Wupper]]. Its highest hill is the [[Lichtscheid]], which is 351 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, “Wupper-Town” became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Ruhr area]], all with a more favourable topography.

From July 5, 1933 to January 19, 1934, the [[Kemna concentration camp]] was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps]], created by the [[Third Reich]] to [[incarcerate]] their political opponents after the [[Nazi Party]] first gained power in 1933. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper  in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.
Wuppertal is famous as an important place of resistance in Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]] or the Theological Declaration of Barmen was a document adopted by Christians in Nazi Germany who opposed the ''[[German Christians|Deutsche Christen]]'' philosophy. In the opinion of the delegates to the Synod that met in Wuppertal-Barmen in May 1934, the German Christians had corrupted church government by making it subservient to the state and had introduced Nazi ideology into the German Protestant churches that contradicted the Christian gospel.

During [[World War II]], about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres. However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:

* Ölberg, literally “Oil mountain”, Germany’s largest original working class district, is protected as a [[historic monument]]. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name "Ölberg" refers to the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].
* [[Wuppertal-Brill|Brill]] is one of Germany’s largest districts of [[Gründerzeit]] villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.

The US [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on April 16, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Wuppertal became a part of the [[British Zone of Occupation]], and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in [[West Germany]].

==Main sights==
In total, Wuppertal possesses over 4,500 buildings classified as national monuments, most exemplifying styles such as [[Neoclassicism]], [[Eclecticism]], [[Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]]/[[Jugendstil]] and [[Bauhaus]].

Main sights include:

* [[Schwebebahn Wuppertal|'''Schwebebahn or ''floating tram''''']]. One of the city’s greatest attractions is the globally unique suspended [[monorail]] ''Wuppertaler Schwebebahn'', which was established in 1901. The tracks are {{convert|8|m|2|abbr=on}} above the streets and {{convert|12|m|2|abbr=on}} above the Wupper. In 1950, a young elephant named [[Tuffi]] was forced to ride the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (monorail), as a promotion for the Althoff Circus. The swinging tram upset the elephant, and she trumpeted, charged, and plummeted 40 feet into the river below. Tuffi suffered minor injuries; she lived until 1989. In 1999, the ''Schwebebahn'' had its thus far [[1999 Wuppertal Suspension Railway accident|only fatal accident]].

==Sports==

=== Association football ===
In '''[[Association football|football]]''', Wuppertal's most popular club is '''[[Wuppertaler SV]]''' who currently play in the [[Regionalliga West]], the fourth tier of the [[German football league system]]. Playing their home games at the city's [[Stadion am Zoo]], the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the [[2009–10 3. Liga|2009–10 season]], looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs ''SSV 04 Wuppertal'' and ''TSG Vohwinkel 80''. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the [[Bundesliga]], which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the [[1973–74 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by [[Poland|Polish]] side [[Ruch Chorzów]] and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.

During 2004, the club merged with local rivals ''SV Borussia Wuppertal'' to form ''Wuppertaler SV Borussia'', though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club's colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional "Borussia" was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans' demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.

Another noteworthy Wuppertal football club is '''Cronenberger SC''' from the district of [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]]. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 [[German amateur football championship]] final which they lost 5–2 against [[BSV 07 Schwenningen|VfR Schwenningen]]. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the [[Oberliga Nordrhein]].

Famous players include [[Günter Pröpper]] who scored 39 of WSV's 136 Bundesliga goals and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] international [[Horst Szymaniak]], as well as Cronenberg's [[Herbert Jäger]] who represented [[Germany Olympic football team|Germany]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] during his stay with the club.

=== Team handball ===
In '''[[team handball|handball]]''', Wuppertal's most successful team is '''[[Bergischer HC]]''', playing in the top-tier [[Handball-Bundesliga]] which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the [[2013–14 Handball-Bundesliga|2013–14 campaign]] and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. ''BHC'' originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby [[Solingen|city of the same name]]. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire [[Bergisches Land]] region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal's ''[[Uni-Halle]]'' (3,200 seats) and Solingen's ''Klingenhalle'' (2,600 seats).

Wuppertal's past most successful club are the aforementioned '''LTV Wuppertal'''. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with ''Wuppertaler SV's'' handball section in 1996 to form ''HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal''. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed ''HC Wuppertal'', to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.

=== Volleyball ===
In '''[[volleyball]]''', '''SV Bayer Wuppertal''' was one of Germany's leading men's teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in [[Leverkusen]] and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to [[Greece|Greek]] side [[Olympiacos S.C.]] in the 1995-96 [[CEV Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], losing the final in five sets.

After the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name ''Wuppertal Titans'' and later ''A!B!C Titans Berg. Land''. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.

=== Basketball ===
Perhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the '''[[women's basketball]]''' team of '''[[Wuppertal Wings|Barmer TV]]''' (known as ''BTV Wuppertal'' between 1994 and 2000, ''BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal'' between 2000 and 2002 and ''Wuppertal Wings'' internationally). An 11-time [[List of German basketball champions#German champions (women)|German champion]] and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During [[1995–96 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup|1996]], they even won the [[EuroLeague Women|European Cup]] as the first and so far only German side, beating [[Italy|Italy's]] [[SFT Como]] in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to [[France|French]] side [[CJM Bourges]] in the [[1997 EuroLeague Women|newly christened EuroLeague's]] final.

In  2002, the club withdrew from the Bundesliga due to financial troubles, their then-main sponsor ''Gold-Zack Werke'' filing for insolvency a year later. After a decade-long stay in amateur divisions, Barmer TV returned to the second-tier 2nd Bundesliga North in 2014.

Wuppertal co-hosted the [[1998 FIBA World Championship for Women]] as one of seven host cities.

=== Roller hockey ===
In '''[[Roller hockey (Quad)|roller hockey]]''' (also known as ''rink hockey''), Wuppertal club '''RSC Cronenberg''' are one of the most successful German teams, having won the [[Rink Hockey Bundesliga|German championship]] and the German Cup in both men's and women's competitions. In total, the men won 13 German championships and nine cups, the women ten championships and nine cups. Both teams play their home games at ''Alfred-Henckels-Halle''.

Wuppertal hosted several international tournaments, including the World Championship in [[1997 Roller Hockey World Cup|1997]] ([[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup|men]]) and [[2004 Ladies Rink Hockey World Championship|2004]] ([[FIRS Women's Roller Hockey World Cup|women]]) and the European Championship in [[1992 Rink Hockey European Championship|1992]], [[2010 Rink Hockey European Championship|2010]] ([[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|men]]) and [[CERH Women's Euro 2011|2011]] ([[CERH European Women's Roller Hockey Championship|women]]).

==Education==
Four institutions of [[higher education]] are in Wuppertal.
* [[University of Wuppertal]] (Bergische Universität Wuppertal)
* [[FOM University of Applied Sciences for Economics and Management|FOM University of Applied Sciences]]
* [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln|Cologne University of Music, section Wuppertal]]
* College of Theology, Wuppertal/Bethel (Theologische Zentrum Wuppertal)

The privately financed ''Junior Uni'' is an in Germany uniquely initiative to educate youth from the age of 4 to 18 years in science outside the school program.&lt;ref name="Junior Uni Wuppertal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioruni-wuppertal.de|title=Official website Junior Uni Wuppertal - Bergisches Land|language=german|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

===Railways===

Wuppertal is well connected to the rail network. The town lies on the Cologne–Hagen and the Düsseldorf–Hagen railway lines, and is a stop for long-distance traffic. The [[Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof|central station]] is located in the district of Elberfeld. [[Regionalbahn]] trains and some [[Regional-Express]] trains also stop at [[Wuppertal-Oberbarmen station|Oberbarmen]], [[Wuppertal-Barmen station|Barmen]], [[Wuppertal-Ronsdorf station|Ronsdorf]] and [[Wuppertal-Vohwinkel station|Vohwinkel]]. There are also S-Bahn stations in [[Wuppertal-Langerfeld station|Langerfeld]], [[Wuppertal-Unterbarmen station|Unterbarmen]], [[Wuppertal-Steinbeck station|Steinbeck]], [[Wuppertal-Zoologischer Garten station|Zoologischer Garten]] and [[Wuppertal-Sonnborn station|Sonnborn]].

The rail services that operate on the [[Elberfeld–Dortmund railway|mainline through the valley]] are the RE 4 ([[Wupper-Express]]), RE 7 ([[Rhein-Münsterland-Express]]), RE 13 ([[Maas-Wupper-Express]]), RB 48 ([[Rhein-Wupper Bahn]]) and four [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]] services: the [[S7 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 7]], [[S8 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 8]], [[S9 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 9]] and [[S68 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 68]] (peak hours only). Every 30 minutes, it is served by a long-distance ([[Intercity-Express]], [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|InterCity]], [[EuroCity in Germany|EuroCity]] or [[City Night Line]]) service in each direction.

With the exception of the [[Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen railway|line from Wuppertal to Solingen]] (operated as the S 7) and the [[Wuppertal-Vohwinkel–Essen-Überruhr railway|Prince William Railway]] to Essen (now S-Bahn line S 9), all of the branch lines connecting to main line in the city of Wuppertal are now closed. This includes, among others, the [[Düsseldorf-Derendorf–Dortmund Süd railway]] (the ''Wuppertaler Nordbahn''), the [[Burgholz Railway]], the [[Wuppertal-Wichlinghausen–Hattingen railway]], the [[Wupper Valley Railway]] and [[Solingen–Wuppertal-Vohwinkel railway|the Corkscrew Railway]]. Thus, there were once 31 stations in the Wuppertal area, including nine stations on the mainline. Nowadays only ten are serviced any more.

There is also the [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway]]

== Controversy ==
In July 2014, three Germans of Palestinian descent tried to burn down the Wuppertal synagogue with [[molotov cocktail]]s. A year later, a court found them guilty of attempted [[arson]], but decided the crime was not motivated by [[anti-Semitism]], and sentenced the men to 200 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Benjamin| last=Weinthal| title=German Judge: Torching of Synagogue Not Motivated by Anti-Semitism| newspaper=[[The  Jerusalem Post]]| url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/German-Judge-Torching-of-Synagogue-not-motivated-by-anti-Semitism-390294| date=February 7, 2015| accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said the three men wanted to draw “attention to the Gaza conflict” with Israel. In January 2017, a regional appeals court upheld the decision, calling the arson attempt a justified expression of criticism of Israel’s policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=German Court Calls Synagogue Torching An Act to Criticize Israel| newspaper=The Jerusalem Post| url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/German-court-calls-synagogue-torching-an-act-to-criticize-Israel-478330| date=January 13, 2017| first=Benjamin| last=Weinthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yemen Model''' has been the rubric for the Obama Administration's attempts to neutralize foreign terrorist groups hostile to the United States.

==Strategy==
President Obama has often cited the Yemen Model as his vision for dealing with insurgent groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-obama-iraq-yemen-20140622-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/01/20/four-months-ago-obama-called-yemens-war-on-terror-a-success-now-the-yemeni-government-may-fall/&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Yemen Model, the United States provides weapons, logistics, transportation and cash to a local proxy force, while committing no or few US troops.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-yemen-model-wont-work-in-iraq-syria/2014/07/17/ba0ae414-0d18-11e4-8341-b8072b1e7348_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The United States will also carry out air strikes and [[targeted killing]]s of suspected opposition leaders. Occasionally, intelligence sharing and cruise missile strikes will also come from America.

==Naming==
{{See also|al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen}}
[[File:Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]], President of Yemen from 2012-2015 and America's man in [[Sana'a]]]]
The model was named after the conduct of the America's continuing conflict in [[Yemen]]. America needed to minimize the ability of the powerful [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] group to attack the American homeland, while at the same time, the Obama Administration wanted to commit as few resources to the fight as possible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8309797/obama-yemen-model&lt;/ref&gt;

The US picked a proxy force (in this case, tribes allied with government leader [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]]), armed and trained them, and used them as a ground force against Al-Qaeda factions in exchange for US aid to the regime, totaling more than $600 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/12/obama-s-yemen-model-for-the-war-on-isis-in-yemen-it-s-a-wreck.html&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also conducted [[Terrorism in Yemen#US air attacks|a significant low-tempo air and drone campaign starting in 2009]]. The US also occasionally launched commando raids inside Yemen and did base some military personnel in and around al-Annad air base in the south of the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/22/us-yemen-security-fighting-idUSKBN0MH0F820150322&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration has often defended its actions in Yemen as effective, and a model for other conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-obama-iraq-yemen-20140622-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/12/obama-s-yemen-model-for-the-war-on-isis-in-yemen-it-s-a-wreck.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-continues-back-yemen-model-successful-counterterrorism/story?id=29901029&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other American conflicts==
During the early stages of the current American conflict in Iraq, Obama cited the Yemen Model as the inspiration for the conduct of the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-obama-iraq-yemen-20140622-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-continues-back-yemen-model-successful-counterterrorism/story?id=29901029&lt;/ref&gt; He went so far as to mention Yemen as a model for success during his first speech about the new war in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/01/20/four-months-ago-obama-called-yemens-war-on-terror-a-success-now-the-yemeni-government-may-fall/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration has also defended its efforts in Somalia as an outgrowth of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/29/white-house-calls-yemen-model-for-isis-fight-as-security-deteriorates/&lt;/ref&gt;
