The '''1946 KLM Douglas DC-3 Amsterdam accident''' was the crash of a [[KLM|KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] flight from London to Amsterdam on 14 November 1946. The accident occurred as the [[Douglas DC-3]] was attempting to land at Amsterdam's airport in poor weather. All 26 passengers and crew on board were killed in the accident.

==Accident==
The DC-3 (actually an ex-military [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] converted for civil use) was on a scheduled flight from London, England to [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="TBW"/&gt; The crew was cleared to land the aircraft at Schiphol Airport in poor weather. The first attempt to land failed and the crew had to perform a [[go-around]]. The second approach to land also failed. On the third approach to land the aircraft made a sudden turn to the left, apparently trying to line up with the runway.&lt;ref name="TBW"/&gt; During this turn the Douglas DC-3 struck the ground and crashed. The aircraft caught fire on impact, killing all 21 passengers and five crew on board.&lt;ref name="TBW"/&gt;

At the time it happened, the 1946 KLM Amsterdam accident was the worst aviation accident in the history of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="TBW"&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19461114-0 Aircraft accident Douglas C-47A-90-DL PH-TBW Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport]&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days earlier another KLM DC-3 operating on the same route in the opposite direction, crashed on approach to London's [[Croydon Airport]] in poor weather. There were no fatalities in the London crash but the aircraft was written off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19461106-0 Aircraft accident Douglas C-47A-90-DL PH-TBO near Shere, 6 November 1946] retrieved 8 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the term "'''bent'''" can be applied to certain [[molecule]]s to describe their [[molecular geometry]]. Certain atoms, such as oxygen, will almost always set their two (or more) [[covalent bond]]s in non-collinear directions due to their [[electron configuration]]. [[Water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is an example of a bent molecule, as well as [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|its analogues]].  The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms is approximately 104.45°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. L.|last1=Miessler|first2=D. A.|last2=Tarr|title=Inorganic Chemistry|edition=3rd|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|ISBN=0-13-035471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonlinear geometry is commonly observed for other triatomic molecules and ions containing only main group elements, prominent examples being [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dichloride]] (SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Carbene|methylene]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

This geometry is almost always consistent with [[VSEPR theory]], which usually explains non-[[collinearity]] of atoms with a presence of [[lone pair]]s. There are several variants of bending, where the most common is AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where two covalent bonds and two lone pairs of the central atom (A) form [[Octet rule|a complete 8-electron shell]]. They have central angles from 104° to 109.5°, where the latter is consistent with a simplistic theory which predicts the [[tetrahedral]] symmetry of four sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridised orbitals. The most common actual angles are 105°, 107°, and 109°: they vary because of the different properties of the peripheral atoms (X).

Other cases also experience [[orbital hybridisation]], but in different degrees. AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, such as [[tin(II) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], have only one lone pair and the central angle about 120° (the centre and two vertices of an [[equilateral triangle]]). They have three sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals. There exist also sd-hybridised AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds of [[transition metal]]s without lone pairs: they have the central angle about [[right angle|90°]] and are also classified as bent.

A '''bimorph''' is a [[cantilever]] used for actuation or sensing which consists of two active layers. It can also have a passive layer between the two active layers. In contrast, a piezoelectric [[unimorph]] has only one active (i.e. piezoelectric) layer and one passive (i.e. non-piezoelectric) layer.

==Piezoelectric bimorph==
The term bimorph is most commonly used with [[piezoelectric]] bimorphs. In [[actuator]] applications, one active layer contracts and the other expands if voltage is applied, thus the bimorph bends. In [[sensor|sensing]] applications, bending the bimorph produces voltage which can for example be used to measure displacement or acceleration. This mode can also be used for [[energy harvesting]].&lt;ref name="Al-Ashtari2013"&gt;{{citation |url=https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/mud/publications/download/Al-Ashtari2013b.pdf|title=Characteristics of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters in Autonomous Systems.

==Bimetal bimorph==
A [[bimetal]] could be regarded as a thermally activated bimorph. The first theory about the bending of thermally activated bimorphs was given by Stoney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoney|first1=G.

'''Biogen UK Ltd''' is a leading UK designer, builder, owner and operator of [[anaerobic digestion]] plants based in Bedfordshire. It is responsible for the construction of 22 plants to date and currently operates eight food waste anaerobic digestion plants in England, Scotland and Wales.

==History==
Biogen’s anaerobic digestion business was established in 2005 with investment from Bedfordia Group. The company’s Twinwoods anaerobic digestion (AD) plant, at [[Milton Ernest]] in [[Bedfordshire]] was completed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal approval for Bedfordshire anaerobic digester |url=http://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/royal-approval-for-bedfordshire-anaerobic-digester|work=LetsRecycle.com |date=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recycle food waste along with animal slurry from Bedfordia Farms. In 2008 Biogen acquired technology and engineering company Greenfinch Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biogen acquires Greenfinch engineering company |url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/business/biogen-acquires-greenfinch-engineering-company.htm|work=Farmer's Weekly |date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenfinch was set up in 1993, initially constructing AD plants for the waste water industry and for farmers as a form of managing their livestock waste. In 2012 Biogen secured £24m of investment from construction, property and services company [[Kier Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kier invests £24m in renewables JV |url=http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/kier-invests-24m-in-renewables-jv|work=The Construction Index |date=2 August 2012}}[]&lt;/ref&gt; making them joint venture partners alongside Bedfordia Group. Since 2006 Biogen’s main focus has been on providing a sustainable food waste treatment service for local authorities, retailers, pubs, restaurants, hotels, offices and food manufacturers. The company employs 100 people across the UK and has its head office in Milton Ernest, Bedfordshire.
In April 2017 the company was bought for an undisclosed sum by Ancala Bioenergy Ltd, an infrastructure investment vehicle managed by Ancala Partners LLP, to provide an established platform for Ancala to expand into the waste-to-energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recyclingwasteworld.co.uk/news/ancala-bioenergy-acquires-biogen/153924/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Biogen’s AD plants recycle 250,000 tonnes of food waste each year and can generate 11MW of green electricity for the national grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogen.co.uk/The-Biogen-Difference/Our-Industry-Experience] Biogen website&lt;/ref&gt; The anaerobic digestion process also produces is a liquid rich in [[nitrogen]], [[potash]], [[phosphate]] and other trace elements that can be stored on site until spreading time and returned to the land as a nutrient rich biofertiliser to grow more crops, completing a [[closed ecological system|closed loop]] system.

[[File:The Blarney Stone.jpg|thumb|The Blarney Stone]]
The '''Blarney Stone''' ({{lang-ga|Cloch na Blarnan}}) is a block of [[Carboniferous limestone]]&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/16/mystery-blarney-stone-heritage-solved|title=Mystery of Blarney Stone's heritage finally solved|date=16 March 2014|accessdate=16 March 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; built into the [[battlement]]s of [[Blarney Castle]], [[Blarney]], about {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with ''the [[wikt:gift of the gab|gift of the gab]]'' (great [[eloquence]] or skill at [[flattery]]). The stone was set into a tower of the castle in 1446. The castle is a popular tourist site in Ireland, attracting visitors from all over the world to kiss the stone and tour the castle and its gardens.

The word ''[[wikt:blarney|blarney]]'' has come to mean "clever, flattering, or coaxing talk". Irish politician [[John O'Connor Power]] defined it this way: "Blarney is something more than mere flattery. It is flattery sweetened by humour and flavoured by wit. Those who mix with Irish folk have many examples of it in their everyday experience."&lt;ref&gt;'Irish Wit and Humour', John O'Connor Power, Time, 1890, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] described its contemporary meaning in an article entitled 'Blarney Castle' in 1832.

==Origins==
[[File:Blarney Stone from below.jpg|thumb|View of the Blarney Stone from the ground]]
A number of stories attempt to explain the origin of the stone and surrounding legend. An early story involves the goddess [[Clíodhna]].&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford. pp. 43–44, 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan, ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. New York: Facts On File. 2004. pp. 48, 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cormac Laidir McCarthy]], the builder of Blarney Castle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/MacCarthyMuskry.php Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy, Lords of Muskry] #119&lt;/ref&gt; being involved in a lawsuit in the 15th century, appealed to Clíodhna for her assistance. She told McCarthy to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart "the ability to deceive without offending". MacCarthy then incorporated it into the [[parapet]] of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marsh, Elan Penn, Frank McCourt, ''The Legends &amp; Lands of Ireland''. Penn Publishing. pp. 107–110&lt;/ref&gt;

The proprietors of Blarney Castle list several other explanations of the origins of the stone on their website.&lt;ref name=BlarneyCastle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |title=The Blarney Stone |work=Blarney Castle website |accessdate=11 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830230658/http://www.blarneycastle.ie/pages/stone |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these suppose that the stone had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314.&lt;ref name=BlarneyCastle/&gt; The stories listed include one suggesting that the stone was presented to Cormac McCarthy by [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] in 1314 in recognition of his support in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].&lt;ref name=BlarneyCastle/&gt; This legend holds that this was a piece of the [[Stone of Scone]] and was installed at McCarthy's castle of Blarney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castleden |first1=Rodney |title=Castles of the celtic lands: the historic castles of Ireland, Scotland and Wales |year=2006 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=0-7607-7937-6 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Varner |first1=Gary R. |title=Menhirs, dolmen, and circles of stone: the folklore and magic of sacred stone |year=2004 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=0-87586-349-3 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that the stone was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn, and modern analysis suggests that the stone is not related to the Stone of Scone.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Ritual==
[[File:Kiss the Blarney Stone.jpg|thumb|Person kissing the Blarney Stone]]
The ritual of kissing the Blarney Stone, according to the castle's proprietors, has been performed by "millions of people", including "world statesmen, literary giants [and] legends of the [[silver screen]]".&lt;ref name=BlarneyCastle/&gt; The kiss, however, is not casually achieved. To touch the stone with one's lips, the participant must ascend to the castle's peak, then lean over backwards on the parapet's edge. This is traditionally achieved with the help of an assistant. Although the parapet is now fitted with [[wrought-iron]] guide rails and protective crossbars, the ritual can still trigger attacks of [[acrophobia]], an extreme or irrational fear of heights.

[[File:Kissing the Blarney Stone 1897.jpg|thumb|Kissing the stone in 1897, before the safeguards were installed.]]
Before the safeguards were installed, the kiss was performed with real risk to life and limb, as participants were grasped by the ankles and dangled bodily from the height.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sherlock Holmes]] radio dramatisation "The Adventure of the Blarney Stone" (first broadcast on 18 March 1946), a man attempting to kiss the Blarney Stone falls to his death. Holmes' investigation reveals this as a murder as the man's boots having been surreptitiously greased before the attempt.

[[William Henry Hurlbert]] wrote in 1888 that the legend of the stone seemed to be less than a hundred years old at that time, suggesting the tradition began late in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ireland Under Coercion: The Diary of an American |first=William Henry |last=Hurlbert |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1888 |edition=2nd |page=232 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQMwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend of the Blarney Stone was described in ''A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue'' by Francis Grose, printed 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Grose, Francis [https://books.google.com/books?id=zLAJs0_prpwC&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=%22blarney+stone%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7icUTfyHPNCjnQfRpbnWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blarney%20stone%22&amp;f=false "A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue"] S. Hooper, London, 1785. Retrieved 23 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
It is claimed that the synonymy of "blarney" with "empty flattery" or "beguiling talk" derives from one of two sources. One story involves the goddess Clíodhna and Cormac Laidir MacCarthy (see "Origins" above). Another legend suggests that [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] requested [[Cormac Teige McCarthy]], the Lord of Blarney, be deprived of his traditional land rights. Cormac travelled to see the queen, but was certain he would not persuade her to change her mind as he wasn't an effective speaker. He met an old woman on the way who told him that anyone who kissed a particular stone in Blarney Castle would be given the gift of eloquent speech. Cormac went on to persuade the queen that he should not be deprived of his land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishindeed.com/page.htm?pg=BLARNEY%20STONE|title=Irish Blessings - Legend of the Blarney Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoing the supposed power of the stone, an Irish bard of the early 19th century, [[Francis Sylvester Mahony]], added a number of (humorous) lines to Richard Alfred Millikin's "''The Groves of Blarney''" (right).

In 1909, the first CONEXPO was held in Columbus, Ohio, and the first CON/AGG was held in Detroit Michigan in 1928. In 1994 the two show merged, creating CONEXPO-CON/AGG. The first joint show was held in 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CONEXPO-CON/AGG has gone on to become the western hemisphere's largest show for the construction and construction materials industries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exhibitcitynews.com/glimpse-tradeshow-history-5/|title=A glimpse of tradeshow history  {{!}} Exhibit City News|website=www.exhibitcitynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27962">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Darcy friction factor formulae''' are equations that allow the calculation of the Darcy friction factor, a [[dimensionless quantity]] used in the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]], for the description of friction losses in [[pipe flow]] as well as [[open-channel flow]].

The Darcy friction factor is also known as the ''Darcy–Weisbach friction factor'', ''resistance coefficient'' or simply ''friction factor''; by definition it is four times larger than the [[Fanning friction factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Oilfield Processing of Petroleum.

See page 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==

In this article, the following conventions and definitions are to be understood:
* The [[Reynolds number]] Re is taken to be Re = ''V'' ''D'' / ν, where ''V'' is the mean velocity of fluid flow, ''D'' is the pipe diameter, and where 
* ν is the [[kinematic viscosity]] μ / ρ, with μ the fluid's viscosity, and ρ the fluid's density. 
* The pipe's relative [[surface roughness|roughness]] ε / ''D'', where ε is the pipe's effective roughness height and ''D'' the pipe (inside) diameter. 
* ''f'' stands for the [[Darcy friction factor]]. Its value depends on the flow's Reynolds number Re and on the pipe's relative roughness ε / ''D''.
* The log function is understood to be base-10 (as is customary in engineering fields): if ''x'' = log(''y''), then ''y'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The ln function is understood to be base-e: if ''x'' = ln(''y''), then ''y'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Flow regime==
Which friction factor formula may be applicable depends upon the type of flow that exists:
*Laminar flow
*Transition between laminar and turbulent flow
*Fully turbulent flow in smooth conduits
*Fully turbulent flow in rough conduits
*Free surface flow.

===Transition flow===
Transition (neither fully laminar nor fully turbulent) flow occurs in the range of Reynolds numbers between 2300 and 4000.  The value of the Darcy friction factor is subject to large uncertainties in this flow regime.

===Turbulent flow in smooth conduits===
The Blasius correlation is the simplest equation for computing the Darcy friction
factor. Because the Blasius correlation has no term for pipe roughness, it
is valid only to smooth pipes. However, the Blasius correlation is sometimes
used in rough pipes because of its simplicity. The Blasius correlation is valid
up to the Reynolds number 100000.

===Turbulent flow in rough conduits===
The Darcy friction factor for fully turbulent flow (Reynolds number greater than 4000) in rough conduits can be modeled by the Colebrook–White equation.

===Free surface flow===
The last formula in the ''Colebrook equation'' section of this article is for free surface flow.  The approximations elsewhere in this article are not applicable for this type of flow.

==Choosing a formula==
Before choosing a formula it is worth knowing that in the paper on the [[Moody chart]], Moody stated the accuracy is about ±5% for smooth pipes and ±10% for rough pipes. If more than one formula is applicable in the flow regime under consideration, the choice of formula may be influenced by one or more of the following:
*Required accuracy
*Speed of computation required
*Available computational technology:
**calculator (minimize keystrokes)
**spreadsheet (single-cell formula)
**programming/scripting language (subroutine).

=== Colebrook–White equation ===
The phenomenological Colebrook–White equation (or Colebrook equation) expresses the Darcy friction factor ''f'' as a function of Reynolds number Re and pipe relative roughness ε / ''D''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, fitting the data of experimental studies of [[turbulent]] flow in smooth and rough [[Pipe (material)|pipes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal    | title = Experiments with Fluid Friction in Roughened Pipes

The equation can be used to (iteratively) solve for the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy–Weisbach]] friction factor ''f''.

For a conduit flowing completely full of fluid at Reynolds numbers greater than 4000, it is expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= -2 \log \left( \frac { \varepsilon} {3.7 D_\mathrm{h}} + \frac {2.51} {\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= -2 \log \left( \frac{\varepsilon}{14.8 R_\mathrm{h}} + \frac{2.51}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* [[Hydraulic diameter]], &lt;math&gt;D_\mathrm{h}&lt;/math&gt; (m, ft) – For fluid-filled, circular conduits, &lt;math&gt;D_\mathrm{h}&lt;/math&gt; = D = inside diameter
* [[Hydraulic radius]], &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{h}&lt;/math&gt; (m, ft) – For fluid-filled, circular conduits, &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{h}&lt;/math&gt; = D/4 = (inside diameter)/4

Note: Some sources use a constant of 3.71 in the denominator for the roughness term in the first equation above.&lt;ref name=VDI&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=VDI Gesellschaft|title=VDI Heat Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t-HrUf1aHEC |year=2010 |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-77876-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solving===
The Colebrook equation is usually solved numerically due to its implicit nature. Recently, the [[Lambert W function]] has been employed to obtain explicit reformulation of the Colebrook equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}},  b=\frac{\varepsilon}{14.8R_h},  a= \frac{2.51}{Re} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x=-2\log(ax+b) &lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt; 10^{-\frac{x}{2}}= ax+b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; p=10^{-\frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

will get:
: &lt;math&gt; p^x = ax + b  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; x = -\frac{W(-\frac{\ln p}{a}\,p^{-\frac{b}{a}})}{\ln p} - \frac{b}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

then:

: &lt;math&gt; f = \frac{1}{(\frac{2W(\frac{\ln 10}{2a}\,10^{\frac{b}{2a}})}{\ln 10} - \frac{b}{a})^2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Expanded forms===
Additional, mathematically equivalent forms of the Colebrook equation are:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= 1.7384\ldots -2 \log \left( \frac { 2 \varepsilon} {D_\mathrm{h}} + \frac {18.574} {\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
::where:
:::1.7384... = 2 log (2 &amp;times; 3.7) = 2 log (7.4)
:::18.574 = 2.51 &amp;times; 3.7 &amp;times; 2
and
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= 1.1364\ldots + 2 \log\left (D_\mathrm{h} / \varepsilon\right) -2 \log \left( 1 + \frac { 9.287} {\mathrm{Re} (\varepsilon/D_\mathrm{h}) \sqrt{f}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:or
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= 1.1364\ldots  -2 \log \left( \frac {\varepsilon}{D_\mathrm{h}} + \frac {9.287} {\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::where:
:::1.1364... = 1.7384... &amp;minus; 2 log (2) = 2 log (7.4) &amp;minus; 2 log (2) = 2 log (3.7)
:::9.287 = 18.574 / 2 = 2.51 &amp;times; 3.7.

The additional equivalent forms above assume that the constants 3.7 and 2.51 in the formula at the top of this section are exact.  The constants are probably values which were rounded by Colebrook during his [[curve fitting]]; but they are effectively treated as exact when comparing (to several decimal places) results from explicit formulae (such as those found elsewhere in this article) to the friction factor computed via Colebrook's implicit equation.

Equations similar to the additional forms above (with the constants rounded to fewer decimal places, or perhaps shifted slightly to minimize overall rounding errors) may be found in various references.  It may be helpful to note that they are essentially the same equation.

===Free surface flow===
Another form of the Colebrook-White equation exists for free surfaces. Such a condition may exist in a pipe that is flowing partially full of fluid. For free surface flow:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2 \log \left(\frac{\varepsilon}{12R_\mathrm{h}} + \frac{2.51}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation is valid only for turbulent flow. Another approach for estimating ''f'' in free surface flows, which is valid under all the flow regimes (laminar, transition and turbulent) is the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellos|first=Vasilis|last2=Nalbantis|first2=Ioannis|last3=Tsakiris|first3=George|date=December 2018|title=Friction Modeling of Flood Flow Simulations|url=https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001540|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|language=en|volume=144|issue=12|pages=04018073|doi=10.1061/(asce)hy.1943-7900.0001540|issn=0733-9429}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;f=\left ( \frac{24}{Re_h} \right )
\left [ \frac{0.86e^{W(1.35Re_h)}} {Re_h} \right ]^{2(1-a)b}
\left \{ \frac{1.34}{\left [ \ln{12.21\left ( \frac{R_h}{\epsilon} \right )} \right ]^2} \right \}^{(1-a)(1-b)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is:

&lt;math&gt;a= \frac{1}{1+\left ( \frac{Re_h}{678} \right )^{8.4}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''b'' is:

&lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1}{1+\left ( \frac{Re_h}{150\left ( \frac{R_h}{\epsilon} \right )} \right )^{1.8}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Re&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is Reynolds number where ''h'' is the characteristic hydraulic length (hydraulic radius for 1D flows or water depth for 2D flows) and ''R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hydraulic radius (for 1D flows) or the water depth (for 2D flows). The Lambert W function can be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;W(1.35Re_h)=\ln{1.35Re_h}-\ln{\ln{1.35Re_h}}+\left ( \frac{\ln{\ln{1.35Re_h}}}{\ln{1.35Re_h}} \right )+
\left ( \frac{\ln{[\ln{1.35Re_h}]^2-2\ln{\ln{1.35Re_h}}}}{2[\ln{1.35Re_h}]^2} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;   

==Approximations of the Colebrook equation==

===Haaland equation===
The ''Haaland equation'' was proposed in 1983 by Professor S.E. Haaland of the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|Norwegian Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Haaland|first = SE|title = Simple and Explicit Formulas for the Friction Factor in Turbulent Flow|journal = Journal of Fluids Engineering |volume = 105|pages = 89–90|year = 1983|issue = 1|doi=10.1115/1.3240948|url=http://fluidsengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleID=1425795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to solve directly for the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy–Weisbach]] friction factor ''f'' for a full-flowing circular pipe.  It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data.

The Haaland equation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Massey|first=Bernard Stanford |title=Mechanics of fluids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQNEAQAAIAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=978-0-412-34280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is expressed:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt {f}} = -1.8 \log \left[ \left( \frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} \right)^{1.11} + \frac{6.9}{\mathrm{Re}} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Swamee–Jain equation===
The Swamee–Jain equation is used to solve directly for the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy–Weisbach]] friction factor ''f'' for a full-flowing circular pipe.  It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Swamee|first1= P.K. |last2=Jain|first2= A.K. | year = 1976 | title = Explicit equations for pipe-flow problems | journal = Journal of the Hydraulics Division | volume = 102 | issue = 5 | pages = 657–664}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{0.25}{\left[\log\left (\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + \frac{5.74}{\mathrm{Re}^{0.9}}\right)\right]^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Serghides's solution===
Serghides's solution is used to solve directly for the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy–Weisbach]] friction factor ''f'' for a full-flowing circular pipe.  It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation. It was derived using [[Steffensen's method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Serghides|last= T.K |year=1984|title=Estimate friction factor accurately|journal=Chemical Engineering Journal|volume=91|issue=5|pp=63–64|issn=0009-2460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution involves calculating three intermediate values and then substituting those values into a final equation.

: &lt;math&gt; A = -2\log\left( \frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + {12\over \mathrm{Re}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B = -2\log \left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + {2.51 A \over \mathrm{Re}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C = -2\log \left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + {2.51 B \over \mathrm{Re}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = A - \frac{(B - A)^2}{C - 2B + A} &lt;/math&gt;

The equation was found to match the Colebrook–White equation within 0.0023% for a test set with a 70-point matrix consisting of ten relative roughness values (in the range 0.00004 to 0.05) by seven Reynolds numbers (2500 to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Goudar–Sonnad equation===
Goudar equation is the most accurate approximation to solve directly for the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy–Weisbach]] friction factor ''f'' for a full-flowing circular pipe.  It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation. Equation has the following form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goudar|first1= C. T|first2=J.

: &lt;math&gt; a = {2 \over \ln(10)}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; b = \frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; d = {\ln(10)\mathrm{Re}\over 5.02} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; s = {bd + \ln(d)} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; q = {{s}^{s/(s+1)}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; g = {bd + \ln{d \over q}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; z = {\ln{q \over g}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; D_{LA} = z{{g\over {g+1}}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; D_{CFA} = D_{LA} \left(1 + \frac{z/2}{(g+1)^2+(z/3)(2g-1)}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;    \frac{1}{\sqrt {f}} = {a\left[ \ln\left( d / q \right) + D_{CFA} \right] } &lt;/math&gt;

===Brkić solution===

Brkić shows one approximation of the Colebrook equation based on the Lambert W-function&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt {f}} = -2\log \left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.71} + {2.18 S \over \mathrm{Re}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
The equation was found to match the Colebrook–White equation within 3.15%.

===Blasius correlations===
Early approximations for smooth pipes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=B. S.|title=Mechanics of Fluids|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Chapter 7 eq 7.5|isbn=0-415-36205-9|page=254|edition=8th|ref=Equation 7.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius]] in terms of the Moody friction factor are given in one article of 1913:&lt;ref name="Trinh"&gt;{{citation|title=On the Blasius correlation for friction factors|first=Khanh Tuoc|last= Trinh|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1007/1007.2466.pdf |arxiv=1007.2466|bibcode=2010arXiv1007.2466T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = 0.316 \mathrm{Re}^{-{1 \over 4}}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Johann Nikuradse]] in 1932 proposed that this corresponds to a [[power law]] correlation for the fluid velocity profile.

Mishra and Gupta in 1979 proposed a correction for curved or helically coiled tubes, taking into account the equivalent curve radius, R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Bejan|first1=Adrian |last2=Kraus|first2=Allan D. |title=Heat Transfer Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cgNG_IUq8C|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-39015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

with,
:&lt;math&gt;R_c = R\left[1 + \left(\frac{H}{2 \pi R} \right)^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is a function of:
* Pipe diameter, ''D'' (m, ft)
* Curve radius, ''R'' (m, ft)
* Helicoidal pitch, ''H'' (m, ft)
* [[Reynolds number]], ''Re'' (dimensionless)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9952">In biochemistry, '''docosanoids''' are [[lipid signaling|signaling molecules]] made by the metabolism of twenty-two-carbon fatty acids (EFAs), especially the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid) by [[lipoxygenase]], [[cyclooxygenase]], and [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes. Other docosanoids are metabolites of n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid), n-6 DHA (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid, and docosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosatetraenoic acid, DTA, or adrenic acid). Prominent docosanoid metabolites of DHA and n-3 DHA are members of the specialized proresolving mediator class of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] metabolites that possess potent anti-[[inflammation]], tissue healing, and other activities (see [[specialized proresolving mediators]]).

==Prominent docosanoids==

===Specialized proresolving mediator docosanoids===
Potently bioactive agents of the specialized proresolving mediator class include:
*DHA-derived [[Resolvins]] (Rv's) of the D series: RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, RvD6, AT-RvD1, AT-RvD2, AT-RvD3, AT-RvD4, AT-RvD5, and AT-RvD6 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Resolvins]]).
*n-3 DPA-derived Rvs of the D series (RvD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, RvD2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and RvDD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the T series (RvT1, TvT2, RvT3, and RvT4) (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins]]).
*DHA-derived [[Neuroprotectin]]s, also termed protectins: PD1, PDX, 17-epi PD1, and 10-epi-DHA1 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins]]).
*n-3 DPA derived protectins: RD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; and RvD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins]])(see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3|DPA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins]]. 
*DHA derived [[Maresins]]: MaR1, MaR2, 7-epi-Mar1, Mar-L1, and Mar-L2 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Maresins]]).
*n-3 DPA-derived maresins: Mar1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, Mar2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mar3&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived maresins]]).

These DHA metabolites possess anti-[[inflammation]] and tissue-protection activities in animal models of inflammatory diseases; they are proposed to inhibit [[innate immune response]]s and thereby to protect from and to resolve a wide range of inflammatory responses in animals and humans. These metabolites are also proposed to contribute to the anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids by being metabolized to them.&lt;ref name="pmid25149823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calder PC | title = Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 469–84 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25149823 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25359497"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J, Levy BD | title = Lipid mediators in the resolution of inflammation | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016311 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25359497 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016311 | pmc=4315926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26655290"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barden AE, Mas E, Mori TA | title = n-3 Fatty acid supplementation and proresolving mediators of inflammation | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26655290 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0000000000000262 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26545300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balas L, Durand T | title = Dihydroxylated E,E,Z-docosatrienes.

===Neurofuran docosanoids===
DHA can be converted non-enzymatically by free radical-mediated peroxidation to 8 different [[neurofuran]] regio[[isomers]] termed neuroprostanes and neurofuranes including 4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, 14-, 17-, and 20-series neurofurans/neuroporstanes for a total of 128 different racemic compounds. The most studied DHA-derived of these products are members of the 4-series, neurofuran 4-F&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;neuroprostane and 4(''RS'')-ST-Δ6-8-neurofurane. These metabolites have been used mainly as [[biomarker]]s of [[oxidative stress]] that are formed in nerve tissues of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="pmid17954232"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arneson KO, Roberts LJ | title = Measurement of products of docosahexaenoic acid peroxidation, neuroprostanes, and neurofurans | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 433 | issue = | pages = 127–43 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17954232 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)33007-3 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25184341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung KS, Galano JM, Durand T, Lee JC | title = Current development in non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation products, isoprostanoids and isofuranoids, in novel biological samples | journal = Free Radical Research | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 816–26 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25184341 | doi = 10.3109/10715762.2014.960867 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroxy-docosanoids===
Cells metabolize DHA to 17''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HpDHA) and then rapidly reduce this hydroperoxide to  17''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HDHA) and similarly metabolize DHA to 13''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HpDHA) and then to 13''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HDHA). 17-HDHA exhibits potent in vitro as well as in vivo (animal model) anti-inflammatory activity while 17-HpDHA and to a lesser extent 17-HDHA inhibit the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22618200"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu CY, Gomolka B, Dierkes C, Huang NR, Schroeder M, Purschke M, Manstein D, Dangi B, Weylandt KH | title = Omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid modulate macrophage function and alleviate experimental colitis | journal = Inflammation Research| volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 967–76 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22618200 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-012-0489-8 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23029040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Hu Y, Wooten RE, Horita DA, Samuel MP, Thomas MJ, Sun H, Edwards IJ | title = 15-lipoxygenase metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = e45480 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23029040 | pmc = 3447860 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045480 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other SPM docosanoids, e.g. RvD1 and RvD2, have anti-growth effects against cancer cells in animal models.&lt;ref name="pmid25857211"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J | title = The resolution code of acute inflammation: Novel pro-resolving lipid mediators in resolution | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–15 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25857211 | pmc = 4515371 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxo-docosanoids===
Cells can metabolize DHA to products that possess an oxo (i.e. [[ketone]]) residue. These products include 13-oxo-DHA (termed EFOXD6) and 17-oxo-DHA (termed 18-EFOXD6).  Both oxo metabolites  possess anti-inflammatory activity as assesses in in vitro systems (see [[Specialized proresolving mediators#Oxo-DHA and oxo-DPA metabolites]]).&lt;ref name="pmid26546723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2015 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme sketches the charged colloidal particles screened by the electrolyte ions.]] '''Double layer forces''' occur between charged objects across liquids, typically water. This force acts over distances that are comparable to the [[Debye length]], which is on the order of one to a few tenths of [[Nanometre|nanometers]]. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the [[surface charge]] density (or the electrical surface potential). For two similarly charged objects, this force is repulsive and decays exponentially at larger distances, see figure. For unequally charged objects and eventually at shorted distances, these forces may also be attractive. The theory due to [[DLVO theory|Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO)]] combines such double layer forces together with [[Van der Waals force]]s in order to estimate the actual interaction potential between colloidal particles.&lt;ref name=russel&gt;W. B. Russel, D. A. Saville, W. R. Schowalter, Colloidal Dispersions. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Double layer (interfacial)|electrical double layer]] develops near charged surfaces (or another charged objects) in aqueous solutions. Within this double layer, the first layer corresponds to the charged surface. These charges may originate from tightly adsorbed ions, dissociated surface groups, or substituted ions within the crystal lattice. The second layer corresponds to the diffuse layer, which contains the neutralizing charge consisting of accumulated counterions and depleted coions. The resulting potential profile between these two objects leads to differences in the ionic concentrations within the gap between these objects with respect to the bulk solution. These differences generate an osmotic pressure, which generates a force between these objects.

These forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap. Adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged, and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. These forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems, and may be responsible for their stability, formation of colloidal crystals, or their rheological properties.

==Poisson–Boltzmann model==
[[File:Double Layer Forces Scheme Plates 1.png|thumb|right|250px|Pictorial representation of two interacting charged plates across an electrolyte solution. The distance between the plates is abbreviated by ''h''.]]
The most popular model to describe the electrical double layer is the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model. This model can be equally used to evaluate double layer forces. Let us discuss this model in the case of planar geometry as shown in the figure on the right. In this case, the electrical potential profile ''ψ''(''z'') near a charged interface will only depend on the position ''z''. The corresponding [[Poisson's equation]] reads in [[International System of Units|SI units]]
: &lt;math&gt; 
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dz^2} = - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ'' is the charge density per unit volume, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, and ''ε'' the [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of the liquid. For a symmetric electrolyte consisting of cations and anions having a charge ±''q'', the charge density can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; 
\rho = q (c_+ - c_-)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;/''V'' are the concentrations of the cations and anions, where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; are their numbers and ''V'' the sample volume. These profiles can be related to the electrical potential by considering the fact that the [[chemical potential]] of the ions is constant. For both ions, this relation can be written as
: &lt;math&gt; 
\mu_\pm = \mu_+^{(0)} + kT \ln c_\pm \pm q \psi
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \mu_\pm^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; is the reference chemical potential, ''T'' the absolute temperature, and ''k'' the Boltzmann constant. The reference chemical potential can be eliminated by applying the same equation far away from the surface where the potential is assumed to vanish and concentrations attain the bulk concentration ''c''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. The concentration profiles thus become
: &lt;math&gt; 
c_\pm = c_{\rm B} e^{ \mp \beta q \psi}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''β'' = 1/(''kT''). This relation reflects the [[Boltzmann distribution]] of the ions with the energy ±''qψ''. Inserting these relations into the Poisson equation one obtains the [[Poisson–Boltzmann equation|PB equation]]&lt;ref name=israelachvili&gt;J. Israelachvili, Intermolecular and Surface Forces. Academic Press: London, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dz^2} = \frac{q c_{\rm B}}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon}
[e^{+\beta q \psi} - e^{-\beta q \psi}]
&lt;/math&gt;
The potential profile between two plates is normally obtained by solving this equation numerically.

Once the potential profile is known, the force per unit area between the plates expressed as the disjoining pressure Π can be obtained as follows. The starting point is the [[Gibbs–Duhem equation|Gibbs–Duhem relation]] for a two component system at constant temperature&lt;ref name=israelachvili /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 
-V d\Pi + N_+ d\mu_+ + N_- d\mu_- = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
Introducing the concentrations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; and using the expressions of the chemical potentials ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; given above one finds 
: &lt;math&gt; 
d\Pi = kT(dc_+ + dc_-) + q(c_+ - c_-) d \psi
&lt;/math&gt;
The concentration difference can be eliminated with the Poisson equation and the resulting equation can be integrated from infinite separation of the plates to the actual separation ''h'' by realizing that 
: &lt;math&gt; 2 (d^2 \psi / dz^2) d\psi = d (d\psi / dz)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
Expressing the concentration profiles in terms of the potential profiles one obtains 
: &lt;math&gt; 
\Pi = kT c_{\rm B}(e^{+\beta q \psi} +  e^{-\beta q \psi} - 2) - \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon}{2} \left(\frac{d \psi}{dz} \right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
From a known electrical potential profile ''ψ''(''z'') one can calculate the disjoining pressure from this equation at any suitable position ''z''. Alternative derivation of the same relation for disjoining pressure involves the stress tensor.&lt;ref name=russel /&gt;

==Debye-Hückel model==

When the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high, the PB equation can be simplified to the [[Debye–Hückel theory|Debye-Hückel]] (DH) equation. By expanding the exponential function in the PB equation into a Taylor series, one obtains
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 \psi}{dz^2} = \kappa^2 \psi &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \;  \;  \; \kappa^2 = \frac{2 \beta q^2 c_{\rm B}}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is referred to as the [[Debye length]], and some representative values for a monovalent salt in water at 25°C with ''ε'' ≃ 80 are given in the table on the right. In non-aqueous solutions, Debye length can be substantially larger than the ones given in the table due to smaller dielectric constants. The DH model represents a good approximation, when the surface potentials are sufficiently low with respect to the limiting values
: &lt;math&gt;
\beta q \psi \ll 1 \;\;\; {\rm or} \;\;\; \psi \ll
\frac{kT}{q} \simeq 26 \; {\rm mV}
&lt;/math&gt;
The numerical value refers to a monovalent salt and 25°C. In practice, the DH approximation remains rather accurate up to surface potentials that are comparable to the limiting values given above. The disjoining pressure can be obtained from the PB equation given above, which can also be simplified to the DH case by expanding into Taylor series. The resulting expression is
: &lt;math&gt;
\Pi = \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon}{2} \left[ \kappa^2 \psi^2 - \left(\frac{d \psi}{dz} \right)^2 \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
The substantial advantage of the DH model over the PB model is that the forces can be obtained analytically. Some of the relevant cases will be discussed below.

==Superposition approximation==
[[File:Double Layer Forces Superposition 1.png|thumb|left|300px|Electrostatic potential across an electrolyte solution within the superposition approximation. Dashed lines correspond to the contributions from individual plates.]] When the surfaces are sufficiently far apart, the potential profiles originating from each individual surface will not be much perturbed by the presence of the other surface. This approximation thus suggests that one can simply add ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) the potentials profiles originating from each surface as illustrated the figure. Since the potential profile passes through a minimum at the mid-plane, it is easiest to evaluate the disjoining pressure at the midplane. The solution of the DH equation for an isolated wall reads
: &lt;math&gt;
\psi(z) = \psi_{\rm D} e^{-\kappa z}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''z'' is the distance from the surface and ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; the surface potential. The potential at the midplane is thus given by twice the value of this potential at a distance ''z'' = ''h''/2. The disjoining pressure becomes&lt;ref name=russel /&gt;&lt;ref name=evans&gt;D. F. Evans, H. Wennerstöm, The Colloidal Domain, John Wiley-VCH, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\Pi = 2 \epsilon \epsilon_0 \kappa^2 \psi_{\rm D}^2 e^{-\kappa h}
&lt;/math&gt;
The electrostatic double layer force decays in an exponential fashion. Due to the screening by the electrolyte, the range of the force is given by the [[Debye length]] and its strength by the surface potential (or [[surface charge]] density). This approximation turns out to be exact provided the plate-plate separation is large compared to the Debye length and the surface potentials are low.

This result can be simply generalized to highly charged surfaces, but only at larger separations. Even if the potential is large close to the surface, it will be small at larger distances, and can be described by the DH equation. However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; with the effective potential ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;. Within the PB model, this effective potential can be evaluated analytically, and reads&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\psi_{\rm eff} = \frac{4}{\beta q} \tanh (\beta q \psi_{\rm D} )
&lt;/math&gt;
The superposition approximation can be easily extended to asymmetric systems. Analogous arguments lead to the expression for the disjoining pressure
: &lt;math&gt;
\Pi(h) = 2 \epsilon \epsilon_0 \kappa^2 \psi^{(1)}_{\rm eff} \psi^{(2)}_{\rm eff} e^{-\kappa h}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the super-scripted quantities refer to properties of the respective surface. At larger distances, oppositely charged surfaces repel and equally charged ones attract.

==Charge regulating surfaces==
While the superposition approximation is actually exact at larger distances, it is no longer accurate at smaller separations. Solutions of the DH or PB equations in between the plates provide a more accurate picture at these conditions. Let us only discuss the symmetric situation within the DH model here. This discussion will introduce the notion of ''charge regulation'', which suggests that the [[surface charge]] (and the surface potential) may vary (or regulate) upon approach.

The DH equation can be solved exactly for two plates.&lt;ref name=russel /&gt;&lt;ref name=carnie&gt;S. L. Carnie, D. Y. C. Chan, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 161 (1993) 260-264.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary conditions play an important role, and the surface potential and surface charge density 
&lt;math&gt; \bar{\psi}_{\rm D} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \bar{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt; become functions of the surface separation ''h'' and they may differ from the corresponding quantities ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and ''σ'' for the isolated surface. When the surface charge remains constant upon approach, one refers to the ''constant charge'' (CC) boundary conditions. In this case, the diffuse layer potential will increase upon approach. On the other hand, when the surface potential is kept constant, one refers to ''constant potential'' (CP) boundary condition. In this case, the surface charge density decreases upon approach. Such decrease of charge can be caused by adsorption of desorption of charged ions from the surface. Such variation of adsorbed species upon approach has also been referred to as ''proximal adsorption''.&lt;ref&gt;V. Subramanian, W. Ducker, J. Phys. Chem. B 105 (2001) 1389-1402.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of the surface to regulate its charge can be quantified by the regulation parameter
: &lt;math&gt;
p = \frac{C_{\rm D}}{C_{\rm I}+C_{\rm D}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  ''ε κ'' is the diffuse layer capacitance and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; the inner (or regulation) capacitance. The CC conditions are found when ''p'' = 1 while the CP conditions for ''p'' = 0. The realistic case will be typically situated in between. By solving the DH equation one can show that diffuse layer potential varies upon approach as
: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{\psi}_{\rm D} = \frac{1}{1-p+p\tanh(\kappa h / 2)} \psi_{\rm D}
&lt;/math&gt;
while the surface charged density obey a similar relation 
: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{\sigma} = \frac{\tanh(\kappa h / 2)}{1-p+p \tanh(\kappa h / 2)} \sigma
&lt;/math&gt;
The swelling pressure can be found by inserting the exact solution of the DH equation into the expressions above and one finds
: &lt;math&gt;
\Pi = 2 \epsilon \epsilon_0 \kappa^2 \psi_{\rm D}^2 \frac{e^{-\kappa h}}{[1+(1-2p)e^{-\kappa h}]^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
Repulsion is strongest for the CC conditions (''p'' = 1) while it is weaker for the CP conditions (''p'' = 0). The result of the superposition approximation is always recovered at larger distances but also for ''p'' = 1/2 at all distances. The latter fact explains why the superposition approximation can be very accurate even at small separations. Surfaces regulate their charge and not infrequently the actual regulation parameter is not far away from 1/2. 
The situation is exemplified in the figure below. From stability considerations one can show that ''p'' &lt; 1 and that this parameter may also becomes negative. These results can be extended to asymmetric case in a straightforward way.&lt;ref name=carnie /&gt;

[[File:Double Layer Forces Regulation 1.png|thumb|center|650px||Charge regulation within the DH model for ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 mV and a monovalent salt of a concentration ''c''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 mM. From left to right: Dependence upon the separation distance of the surface change density, diffuse layer potential, and the disjoining pressure. Constant charge (CC, ''p'' = 1) and constant potential (CP, ''p'' = 0) boundary conditions, and superposition approximation (''p'' = 1/2).]]

When surface potentials are replaced by effective potentials, this simple DH picture is applicable for more highly charged surfaces at sufficiently larger distances. At shorter distances, however, one may enter the PB regime and the regulation parameter may not remain constant. In this case, one must solve the PB equation together with an appropriate model of the surface charging process. It was demonstrated experimentally that charge regulation effects can become very important in asymmetric systems.&lt;ref name=popa&gt;I. Popa, P. Sinha, M. Finessi, P. Maroni, G. Papastavrou, M. Borkovec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 (2010) 228301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions to other geometries==

Interactions between various objects were studied within the DH and PB models by many researchers. Some of the relevant results are summarized in the following.

'''Non-planar geometries''': Objects of other than planar geometries can be treated within the [[Derjaguin approximation]],  provided their size is substantially larger than the Debye length. This approximation has been used to estimate the force between two charged colloidal particles as shown in the first figure of this article. The exponential nature of these repulsive forces and the fact that its range is given by the [[Debye length]] was confirmed experimentally by direct force measurements, including [[surface forces apparatus]],&lt;ref name=israelachvili /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Pashley, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 83 (1981) 531-546.&lt;/ref&gt; [[colloidal probe technique]],&lt;ref name=popa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Kane, P. Mulvaney, Langmuir 14 (1998) 3303-3311.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[optical tweezers]].&lt;ref name=gutsche&gt;C. Gutsche, U. F. Keyser, K. Kegler, F. Kremer, Phys. Rev. E 2007, 76, 031403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dobnikar&gt;J. Dobnikar, M. Brunner, H. H. von Grünberg, C. Bechinger, Phys. Rev. E 69 (2004) 031402.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interaction free energy involving two spherical particles within the DH approximation follows the [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa]] or screened Coulomb potential&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Y. Levin, Rep. Prog. Phys. 65 (2002) 1577-1632.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 
U = \frac{Q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{e^{\kappa a}}{1+\kappa a} \right)^2
\frac{e^{-\kappa r}}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the center-to-center distance, ''Q'' is the particle charge, and ''a'' the particle radius. This expression is based on the superposition approximation and is only valid at large separations. This equation can be extended to more highly charged particles by reinterpreting the charge ''Q'' as an effective charge. To address the interactions in other situation, one must resort to numerical solutions of the DH or PB equation.

'''Non-uniform or patchy charge distribution''': Interaction between surfaces with non-uniform and periodic charge distribution has been analyzed within the DH approximation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Richmond, J. Chem. Soc. Farad. Trans. II 70 (1974) 1066-1073.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miklavic&gt;S. J. Miklavic, D. Y. C. Chan, L. R. White, T. W. Healy, J. Phys. Chem. 98 (1994) 9022-9032.&lt;/ref&gt; Such surfaces are referred to have a mosaic or patch-charge distribution. One important conclusion from these studies is that there is an additional attractive electrostatic contribution, which also decays exponentially. When the non-uniformities are arranged in a quadratic lattice with spacing ''b'', the decay length ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of this additional attraction can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; 
q^2 = \kappa^2 + \left( \frac{2 \pi}{b} \right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
At high salt levels, this attraction is screened as the interaction between uniformly charged surfaces. At lower salt levels, however, the range of this attraction is related to the characteristic size of the surface charge heterogeneities.

'''Three-body forces''': The interactions between weakly charged objects are pair-wise additive due to the linear nature of the DH approximation. On the PB level, however, attractive three-body forces are present.&lt;ref name=dobnikar /&gt; The interaction free energy between three objects 1, 2, and 3 can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; 
F_{123} = F_{12} + F_{12} + F_{12} + \Delta F_{123}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the pair free energies and ''ΔF''&lt;sub&gt;''123''&lt;/sub&gt; is the non-additive three-body contribution. These three-body contributions were found to be attractive on the PB level, meaning that three charged objects repel less strongly than what one would expect on the basis of pair-wise interactions alone.

==Beyond Poisson-Boltzmann approximation==
More accurate description of double layer interactions can be put forward on the ''primitive model''. This model treats the electrostatic and hard-core interactions between all individual ions explicitly. However, it includes the solvent only in a "primitive" way, namely as a dielectric continuum. This model was studied in much detail in the theoretical community.&lt;ref name=levin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Guldbrand, B. Jonsson, H. Wennerstrom, P. Linse, J. Chem. Phys. 80 (1984) 2221-2228; R. Kjellander, S. Marcelja, Chem. Phys. Lett. 112 (1984) 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=primitive&gt;R. Kjellander, T. Akesson, B. Jonsson, S. Marcelja, J. Chem. Phys. 97 (1992) 1424-1431.&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit expressions for the forces are mostly not available, but they are accessible with computer simulations, integral equations, or density functional theories.

The important finding from these studies is that the PB description represents only a mean-field approximation. This approximation is excellent in the so-called ''weak coupling regime'', that is for monovalent electrolytes and weakly charged surfaces. However, this description breaks down in the ''strong coupling regime'', which may be encountered for multivalent electrolytes, highly charged systems, or non-aqueous solvents.&lt;ref name=primitive /&gt; In the strong coupling regime, the ions are strongly correlated, meaning that each ion has an exclusion hole around itself. These correlations lead to strong ion adsorption to charged surfaces, which may lead to charge reversal and crystallization of these ions on the surface. These correlations may also induce attractive forces. The range of these forces is typically below 1&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Like-charge attraction controversy==

Around 1990, theoretical and experimental evidence has emerged that forces between charged particles suspended in dilute solutions of monovalent electrolytes might be attractive at larger distances.&lt;ref&gt;I. Sogami, N. Ise, J. Chem. Phys. 81 (1984) 6320-6332; J. C. Crocker, D. G. Grier, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 (1996) 1897-1900.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence is in contradiction with the PB theory discussed above, which always predicts repulsive interactions in these situations. The theoretical treatment leading to these conclusions was strongly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeek G.,  J. Chem. Phys. 87 (1987) 4406-4408; J. Z. Wu, D. Bratko, J. M. Prausnitz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95 (1998) 15169-15172.&lt;/ref&gt;  The experimental findings were mostly based on video-microscopy, but the underlying data analysis was questioned concerning the role of impurities, appropriateness of image processing techniques,&lt;ref name=gutsche /&gt; and the role of hydrodynamic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Squires, M. P. Brenner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 (2000) 4976-4979.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the scientific community remains skeptical concerning such like-charge attractions and advocates the classical PB approach discussed above.

==Relevance==

Double layer interactions are relevant in a wide number of phenomena.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt; These forces are responsible for swelling of [[clay]]s. They may also be responsible for the stabilization of [[colloid|colloidal suspension]] and will prevent [[particle aggregation]] of highly charged colloidal particles in aqueous suspensions. At low salt concentrations, the repulsive double layer forces can become rather long-ranged, and may lead to structuring of colloidal suspensions and eventually to formation of [[colloidal crystal]]s. Such repulsive forces may further induce blocking of surfaces during [[particle deposition]]. Double layer interactions are equally relevant for surfactant aggregates, and may be responsible to the stabilization of cubic phases made of spheroidal [[micelle]]s or lamellar phases consisting of [[surfactant]] or [[lipid bilayer]]s.

It began with the publication of [[O sertanejo]] of [[José de Alencar]] (1876), and lasted until the first decade of the twentieth century. The main characters of the drought cycle literature are [[bandits]], [[human migration|migrants]] and [[blesseds]]. In the cycle stand the [[Ceará]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=97NoYRx96ZAC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1996-09-19|isbn = 9780521410359|first = Roberto Gonzalez|last = Echevarría}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "[[Os Sertões|Os sertões]] was a landmark, work of sociology, literature and war story, written by [[Euclides da Cunha]] with obvious admiration for the country people, understanding their struggles against nature and protest against the contempt with which handles the federal government."
[[Gilberto Freyre]] was influenced by this literary tendency. Other relevant authors are [[Rachel de Queiroz|Raquel de Queirós]], [[José Lins do Rego]], [[Jorge Amado]], [[Graciliano Ramos]], [[Antônio Callado]], until [[João Guimarães Rosa|Guimarães Rosa]].

The '''economics of plastics processing''' is determined by the type of process. [[Plastics]] can be processed with the following methods: machining, [[compression molding]], [[transfer molding]], [[injection molding]], [[extrusion]], [[rotational molding]], [[blow molding]], [[thermoforming]], casting, forging, and [[foam molding]]. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials (5th ed)|last = Kalpakjian|first = Serope|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-13-227271-1|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458|pages = 657–658|first2 = Steven|last2 = Schmid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam [[Molding (process)|molding]] has high equipment and tooling cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.

==Aspects of plastic processing==

=== Degradable plastics ===
[[Oxo-degradable]] plastics:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxodegradable plastics: degradation, environmental impact and recycling|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270465953|journal = Proceedings of the ICE - Waste and Resource Management|pages = 133–140|volume = 165|issue = 3|doi = 10.1680/warm.11.00014|first = Noreen L.|last = Thomas|first2 = Andrew R.|last2 = McLauchlin|first3 = Stuart G.|last3 = Patrick|first4 = Jane|last4 = Clarke|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are petroleum-based plastics with additives such as transition metals and metals salts that promote the process of fragmentation of the plastic when exposed to a particular environment, such as high temperature or oxygen rich one, for a prolonged period of time. Fragmentation exposes a larger surface area of the plastic to colonies of bacteria that eventually decompose the polymer into its lower energy state components: carbon dioxide and water.

Some aspects to take into account regarding this method to dispose of end-of-life plastics are:
* The type of polymer: experiments conducted by Chiellini ''et al.'' confirmed that bacteria are only able to decompose low molecular weight polymers (at least at a rate that can be appreciated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparative Study of the Degradability and Recyclability of Different Classes of Degradable Polyethylene|journal = Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part A|date = 1995-04-01|issn = 1060-1325|pages = 709–730|volume = 32|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/10601329508010283|first = S.|last = Al-Malaika|first2 = S.|last2 = Chohan|first3 = M.|last3 = Coker|first4 = G.|last4 = Scott|first5 = R.|last5 = Arnaud|first6 = P.|last6 = Dabin|first7 = A.|last7 = Fauve|first8 = J.|last8 = Lemaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental conditions: the time for fragmentation/degradation varies according to conditions which aren’t always controllable. 
* Material’s potential to be recycled: this characteristic will be compromised, since the polymer’s durability or strength will be affected by the additives that accelerate fragmentation.
Classifying a polymer as [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] requires specifications regarding these aspects.

Important economic aspects that need to be considered when disposing of degradable polymers include:
* Waste landfill costs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-07-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2873020|pmid = 19528059|pages = 2115–2126|volume = 364|issue = 1526|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|first = Jefferson|last = Hopewell|first2 = Robert|last2 = Dvorak|first3 = Edward|last3 = Kosior}}&lt;/ref&gt; if plastics represent a significant percentage of waste in a particular region, manufacturing plastics with bio-degradable properties may be more profitable and ecologically friendly than merely disposing of a non-degradable plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2004.02.018|title = Municipal solid waste management from a systems perspective|journal = Journal of Cleaner Production|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 241–252|year = 2005|last1 = Eriksson|first1 = O.|last2 = Carlsson Reich|first2 = M.|last3 = Frostell|first3 = B.|last4 = Björklund|first4 = A.|last5 = Assefa|first5 = G.|last6 = Sundqvist|first6 = J.-O.|last7 = Granath|first7 = J.|last8 = Baky|first8 = A.|last9 = Thyselius|first9 = L.|url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-8913}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using degradable polymers, costs due to waste transportation, landfill maintenance, new landfill excavation and environmental hazard control can be avoided. 
* Lost end-of-life plastic potential:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; processes such as [[energy recovery]] of the plastic by incineration or biological treatment and material recovery by recycling have to be taken into account when assessing the feasibility of manufacturing degradable polymers.

=== Reusable plastic containers ===

The implementation of [[Reuse|reusable]] [[plastic container]]s arises as a consequence of concerns with sustainability and [[environmental impact]]. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.12.014|title = Economic and environmental assessment of reusable plastic containers: A food catering supply chain case study| journal=International Journal of Production Economics| volume=152| pages=88–101|year = 2014|last1 = Accorsi|first1 = Riccardo| last2=Cascini| first2=Alessandro| last3=Cholette| first3=Susan| last4=Manzini| first4=Riccardo| last5=Mora| first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers all the way to the use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.

===Incineration of plastics===

[[plastics recycling|Recycling plastics]] presents the difficulty of handling mixed plastics, as unmixed plastics are usually necessary to maintain desirable properties. Mixing many plastics results in diminished material properties, with even just a few percent of [[polypropylene]] mixed with [[polyethylene]] producing a plastic with significantly reduced [[tensile strength]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stein|first = Richard S.|year = 1998|title = Polymer Recycling: Thermodynamics and Economics|url =|journal = Macromolecular Symposia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to recycling of these plastics and those which can’t be easily recycled such as thermosets is to use degradation to break the polymers down into monomers of low molecular weight. The products of this process can be used to make high quality polymers however energy stored in the polymer bonds is lost during this process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative to economically dispose of plastics is to burn them in an [[incinerator]]. Incinerators capable of cleanly burning polymers exist and while they require significant capital investment, the energy produced offsets the economic impact.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 26 September 1989|title = The Environmental Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration|url =|journal = Findings of the International Symposium on Solid Waste Incineration, Symposium: Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most plastics are produced from [[petroleum]], their molecules consist exclusively or primarily of [[carbon]], oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. With proper design, an incinerator can completely combust these plastics allowing the recovery of energy stored in the original petroleum feedstock which would otherwise escape during processes such as degradation. Some polymers contain [[chlorine]] or [[nitrogen]] which can result in undesirable combustion products however the use of [[scrubber]]s can remove such products. The end result is that many polymers burn more cleanly than [[coal]] and as clean as most oils.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Eivind Aadland''' (born 19 September 1956) is a Norwegian conductor and [[violin]]ist.  He has been concert master of the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kidd | first = Vernon | title = EUROPE: FESTIVALS 2001 – The Lineup: Verdi and 20th-Century Nostalgia  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | pages = 12 | date = 2001-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eivind was Chief Conductor and Artistic Leader of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra from 2004-2010, and maintains a regular relationship with many Scandinavian orchestras, including the Oslo and Bergen Philharmonics, Stavanger Symphony and Swedish Chamber Orchestra.  At Den Norske Opera in Oslo he has conducted productions of Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro, Die Zauberflöte and Die Fledermaus.

Recent seasons have included performances with the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse, the Swedish Radio and Melbourne Symphony Orchestras, the Lausanne and Scottish Chamber Orchestras and the Symphony Orchestras of Gothenburg, the Finnish Radio, SWR Stuttgart and WDR Cologne.  Engagements during the 08/09 season included concerts with the [[Iceland Symphony Orchestra]], Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and the Queensland Orchestra, Royal Flemish Philharmonic and the Orchestre National de Belgique. 
 
Mr. Aadland’s recording output encompasses a diverse range of repertoire and he is a champion of Norwegian and Swedish composers.  These include the symphonic works of Eivind Groven, a disc of Norwegian orchestral favourites and the complete music for violin and orchestra of Arne Nordheim with the Stavanger Symphony – all for BIS records.  On the Simax label Aadland he has made discs of Irgens Jensen's works with the Bergen Philharmonic, music of Ole Bull with the Trondheim Symphony and music of Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger and Florent Schmitt with The staff band of the Norwegian Armed Forces.  Also with the Trondheim Symphony he has recorded two discs devoted to the orchestral music of Ludwig Irgens-Jensen and Gerhard Schjeldrup for CPO Records.  He has also recorded for Hyperion, ASV, IMP Classics, and Koch.

'''Electricity provider switching''' is the ability of power consumers to have an option—or the "power to choose"—their [[electricity]] provider in a [[deregulation|deregulated]] electricity market as permitted by a state public utilities governing body.

==Australia==
The Australian market has been somewhat deregulated, but still sees consumers provided with a narrow band of choices.

==Canada==
Electricity is deregulated in two Canadian provinces: [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]]. Both markets showed price spikes in the first year of dereguation, but then settled down into a volatile but reasonably stable environment. Alberta's market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such reacts more closely to the price of natural gas. Ontario's [[generation mix]] is about 50% nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Power Authority Long Term Energy Plan http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/sites/default/files/page/MEI_LTEP_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario===
The consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from one of the deregulated suppliers.   There is a large range of contract options from a variable price to 1,3 or 5 year fixed prices.   Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.   However, as of January 2010 there is a maximum termination penalty allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Energy Board http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/OEB/Consumers/Consumer+Protection/Retail+Energy+Contracts/Before+Signing+an+Energy+Contract&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important element in switching electricity providers in Ontario is understanding the Global Adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Electricity System Operator http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/siteShared/electricity_bill.asp?sid=bi&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an adjustment for some commitments government agencies have made on your behalf. It is included in the LDC Regulated Price Plan, but is an additional line item if a contract is signed.

===Alberta===
The consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from a deregulated suppliers. There are however many fewer of these in Alberta. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.

There is a [[price comparison service]] operation in Canada.

== France ==
In France, electricity market is totally deregulated and consumers have the choice between the historical formerly state-owned provider [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and several new private providers like [[Direct Énergie]].

==United Kingdom==
Electricity supply has also been deregulated in the [[United Kingdom]].  For a list of suppliers see: ''Category:Power companies of the United Kingdom'' at the foot of the page.

==United States==
In deregulated markets such as [[deregulation of the Texas electricity market|Texas]] and [[Maryland Electric Deregulation|Maryland]], the state government may require the incumbent utility energy provider to allow for unlimited competition within the marketplace, where the consumer is free to choose any electricity provider. Electricity provider switching is only practical if a customer is either buying from a utility or is at the end of a fixed-price contract with a provider.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Certain U.S. states allow for consumer choice in electricity providers, with [[Texas]] being the most-widely watched deregulatory scheme.  Many other states are surveying the [[Deregulation of the Texas electricity market|Texas deregulatory model]] in order to use its design as a model for the imposition of free market forces within such other power markets.&lt;ref&gt;

As of April 2014, 16 U.S. states and the [[District of Columbia]] have deregulated electricity markets. Along with aforementioned [[Maryland]] and Texas, electricity deregulation is current in [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Montana]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Rhode Island]]. Seven additional U.S. states began the process of electricity deregulation but have suspended efforts: [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''algebraic stress model''' arises in [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Two main approaches can be undertaken. In the first, the transport of the turbulent stresses is assumed proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy; while in the second, convective and diffusive effects are assumed to be negligible. Algebraic stress models can only be used where [[convective]] and [[diffusive]] fluxes are negligible, i.e. source dominated flows. In order to simplify the existing EASM and to achieve an efficient numerical implementation the underlying tensor basis plays an important role. The five-term tensor basis that is introduced here tries to combine an optimum of accuracy of the complete basis with the advantages of a pure 2d concept. Therefore a suitable five-term basis is identified. Based on that the new model is designed and validated in combination with different eddy-[[viscosity]] type background models.

[[File:17357 cfd-analysis3.jpg|thumb|right|CFD ANALYSIS]]

== Integrity basis==
In the frame work of single-point closures (Reynolds-stress transport models = RSTM) still provide the best representation of flow physics. Due to numeric requirements an explicit formulation based on a low number of [[tensors]] is desirable and was already introduced originally most explicit algebraic stress models are formulated using a 10-term basis:
:&lt;math&gt;b_{ij}= \sum_{\lambda=1}^{10} G^{(\lambda)} T_{ij}^{(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;
The reduction of the tensor basis however requires an enormous mathematical effort, to transform the algebraic stress formulation for a given linear algebraic RSTM into a given tensor basis by keeping all important properties of the underlying model. This transformation can be applied to an arbitrary tensor basis. In the present investigations an optimum set of basis tensors and the corresponding coefficients is to be found.

==Projection method==
The projection method was introduced to enable an approximate solution of the algebraic transport equation of the Reynolds-stresses. In contrast to the approach of the tensor basis is not inserted in the algebraic equation, instead the [[algebraic equation]] is projected. Therefore, the chosen basis tensors does not need to form a complete integrity basis. However, the projection will fail if the basis tensor are [[linear]] dependent. In the case of a complete basis the projection leads to the same solution as the direct insertion, otherwise an approximate solution in the sense is obtained.

==An example==
In order to prove, that the projection method will lead to the same solution as the direct insertion, the EASM for two-dimensional flows is derived. In two-dimensional flows only the tensors are independent.
:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij}^{(1)}=s_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij}^{(2)}=s_{ik}w_{kj} - w_{ik}s{kj}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij}^{(3)}=s_{ik}s_{kj}-s_{mk}s_{km}\frac{1}{3} \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;
The projection leads then to the same coefficients. This two-dimensional EASM is used as starting point for an optimized EASM which includes three-dimensional effects. For example the shear stress variation in a rotating pipe cannot be predicted with quadratic tensors. Hence, the EASM was extended with a cubic tensor. In order to do not affect the performance in 2D flows, a tensor was chosen that vanish in 2d flows. This offers the concentration of the coefficient determination in 3d flows. A cubic [[tensor]], which vanishes in 3d flow is: 
:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij}^{(5)}=w_{ik}s_{kl}s_{lj}-s_{ik}s_{kl}w_{lj}&lt;/math&gt;
The projection with tensors T&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, T&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, T&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; and T&lt;sup&gt;(5)&lt;/sup&gt; yields then the coefficients of the EASM.

==Limitation of '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;==
A direct result of the EASM derivation is a variable formulation of '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;.As the generators of the extended EASM where chosen to preserve the existing 2D formulation the expression of '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; remains unchanged:

:&lt;math&gt; C \mu = \frac{-A_1 g}{g^2-\frac{2}{3} A_3^2 \eta _1 -2 A^2 \eta _2} &lt;/math&gt;
A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the constants of the underlying pressure-strain model.
Since η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is always positive it might be possible that '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; becomes singular. Therefore in the first EASM derivation of a regularization was introduced, which prevent a singular by cutting the range of η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. However, Wallin et al. pointed out that the regularization deteriorated the performance of the EASM. In their model the methodology was refined to account for the coefficient.
[[File:EASM.JPG|frameless|right|Velocity Profile]]

:&lt;math&gt; g=C_1 - 2 b_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a weak [[non-linear]] conditional equation for the EASM coefficients and an additional equation for g must be solved. In 3D the equation of g is of 6th order, wherefore a closed solution is only possible in 2D flows, where the equation reduces to 3rd order. In order to circumvent the [[root]] finding of a [[polynomial equation]] quasi self-consistent approach. He showed that by using a '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;  expression of a realizable linear model instead of the EASM-'''C'''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; expression in the equation of g the same properties of g follows. For a wide range of and the quasi self-consistent approach is almost identical to the fully self-consistent solution. Thus the quality of the EASM is not affected with the advantage of no additional non-linear equation. Since in the [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]]s to determine the EASM coefficients the complexity is reduced by neglecting higher order invariants.

'''Ferroics''' is the generic name given to the study of [[ferromagnets]], [[ferroelectrics]], and [[ferroelastics]].  

==Overview==
The basis of ferroics is to understand the large changes in physical characteristics that occur over a very narrow temperature range.  The changes in physical characteristics occur when [[phase transitions]] take place around some critical temperature value, normally denoted by &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;.  Above this critical temperature, the crystal is in a nonferroic state and does not exhibit the physical characteristic of interest.  Upon cooling the material down below &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; it undergoes a spontaneous [[phase transition]].  Such a [[phase transition]] typically results in only a small deviation from the nonferroic crystal structure, but in altering the shape of the [[unit cell]] the [[point symmetry]] of the material is reduced.  This breaking of symmetry is physically what allows the formation of the ferroic phase. 

In ferroelectrics, upon lowering the temperature below &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;, a spontaneous [[Electrical polarity|dipole moment]] is induced along an axis of the unit cell.  Although individual dipole moments can sometimes be small, the effect of &lt;math&gt;10^{24}&lt;/math&gt; unit cells gives rise to an electric field that over the bulk substance that is not insignificant.  An important point about ferroelectrics is that they cannot exist in a '''centrosymmetric''' crystal.  A '''centrosymmetric''' crystal is one where a lattice point &lt;math&gt;\left (x,y,z \right )&lt;/math&gt; can be mapped onto a lattice point &lt;math&gt;\left ( -x,-y,-z \right )&lt;/math&gt;.

Ferromagnets is a term that most people are familiar with, and, as with ferroelastics, the spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnet can be attributed to a breaking of point symmetry in switching from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is normally known as the Curie Temperature.  

In ferroelastic crystals, in going from the nonferroic (or '''prototypic phase''') to the ferroic phase, a spontaneous strain is induced.  An example of a ferroelastic [[phase transition]] is when the crystal structure spontaneously changes from a [[tetragonal]] structure (a square prism shape) to a [[monoclinic]] structure (a general [[parallelepiped]]).  Here the shapes of the unit cell before and after the [[phase transition]] are different, and hence a [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] is induced within the bulk.  

In recent years a new class of ferroic materials has been attracting increased interest. These [[multiferroics]] exhibit more than one ferroic property simultaneously in a single phase.

When [[Petroleum|oil]] is brought to surface conditions it is usual for some [[natural gas]] to come out of solution.  The '''gas/oil ratio''' (GOR) is the ratio of the volume of gas that comes out of solution, to the volume of oil at standard conditions.

A point to check is whether the volume of oil is measured before or after the gas comes out of solution, since the oil volume will shrink when the gas comes out. 

In fact gas dissolution and oil volume shrinkage will happen at many stages during the path of the hydrocarbon stream from reservoir through the [[wellbore]] and processing plant to export. For light oils and rich [[gas condensate]]s the ultimate GOR of export streams is strongly influenced by the efficiency with which the processing plant strips liquids from the gas phase. Reported GORs may be calculated from export volumes which may not be at standard conditions.

The GOR is a dimensionless ratio (volume per volume) in metric units, but in field units, it is usually measured in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil or condensate....

In the states of Texas and Pennsylvania, the statutory definition of a gas well is one where the GOR is greater than 100,000 ft3/bbl or 100 Kcf/bbl.
The state of New Mexico also designates a gas well as having over 100 MCFG per barrel (http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/parts/title19/19.015.0002.htm)

The Oklahoma Geologic Survey recently published [http://ogs.ou.edu/docs/geologicmaps/GM39.pdf Map of Oklahoma Oil and Gas Fields distinguished by Oil and Gas Ratio] this map that defines a gas well as having greater than 20 MCFG per barrel of oil.  They go on to define an oil well as having a GOR of less than 5 MCFG/BBL and an oil and gas well between 5 and 20 MCFG/BBl.

In the newly proposed Information Collection Request for Oil and Gas Facilities (EPA ICR No. 2548.01, OMB Control No. 2060-NEW) the EPA has divided well types into five categories as such:
1.  Heavy Oil (GOR ≤ 300 scf/bbl)
2.  Light Oil (GOR 300 &lt; GOR ≤ 100,000 scf/bbl)
3.  Wet Gas (100,000 &lt; GOR ≤1,000,000 scf/bbl)
4.  Dry Gas (GOR &gt; 1,000,000 scf/bbl)
5.  Coal Bed Methane.

== In two-stroke engines ==
As [[two-stroke engine]]s use their [[crankcase]] to pressurize the air:fuel mixture before transfer to the cylinder, any standard [[lubricating oil]] left there (per practice with [[four-stroke engine]]s) would be swept up and burnt with the fuel. To provide cylinder lubrication, fuels supplied to two-stroke engines are often mixed with oil so that it can coat the cylinders and bearing surfaces along its path.  The ratio of gas to oil is set by the engine manufacturer but ranges from 30:1 to 50:1 per volume unit. Oil remaining in the mixture is burnt with the fuel and results in a familiar blue smoke and odor.

June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other challenges to hydraulic fracturing in Ukraine, such as a lack of a proper regulatory framework for its development, opposition of major EU partners to hydraulic fracturing which may seek to influence Ukraine (France for example has an outright ban). Ukraine's shale gas reserves are also deeper than those in the United States, and thus production is bound to be more expensive, which may make it cost-prohibitive, depending on the prevailing market prices for gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/trends/2015-2016/september-october-2015/ukraines_energy_crisis_may_invite_hydraulic_fracturing_and_regulatory_uncertainty.html American Bar Association: Ukraine’s energy crisis may invite hydraulic fracturing and regulatory uncertainty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uncertainty==
Constitutionally, Ukraine's natural resources belong to the people, with government acting as a trustee. A private investor needs to execute a production-sharing agreement, but is never entitled to 100% of its production, as it has to be shared with the state. The level of potential public opposition to hydraulic fracturing also creates uncertainty. On the positive side, Ukraine continues to vigorously pursue reforms designed to achieve energy independence, which portends well for hydraulic fracturing as a helpful option in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/trends/2015-2016/september-october-2015/ukraines_energy_crisis_may_invite_hydraulic_fracturing_and_regulatory_uncertainty.html American Bar Association: Ukraine’s energy crisis may invite hydraulic fracturing and regulatory uncertainty]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''hydronium''' is the common name for the [[aqueous]] [[cation]] {{H3O+}}, the type of [[oxonium ion]] produced by [[protonation]] of [[water]].  It is the positive ion present when an [[Arrhenius acid]] is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to the surrounding water molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

==Determination of pH==
The ratio of hydronium ions to [[hydroxide]] ions determines a solution's [[pH]].  The molecules in pure water [[self-ionization of water|auto-dissociate]] (''i.e''.: react with each other) into hydronium and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium:

:2&amp;nbsp;{{H2O-nl}} {{eqm}} {{chem|OH|-}} + {{H3O+}}

In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it is a neutral solution. At 25&amp;nbsp;°C, water has a pH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see [[self-ionization of water]]). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.

==Nomenclature==
According to [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Parent hydride cations|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]], the hydronium ion should be referred to as ''oxonium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_583.htm | title = Table 17 Mononuclear parent onium ions | publisher = IUPAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hydroxonium'' may also be used unambiguously to identify it. A draft [[IUPAC]] proposal also recommends the use of oxonium and ''oxidanium'' in organic and inorganic chemistry contexts, respectively.

An [[oxonium ion]] is any ion with a trivalent oxygen cation. For example, a protonated [[hydroxyl group]] is an oxonium ion, but not a hydronium ion.

==Structure==

Since {{chem|O|+}} and N have the same number of electrons, {{H3O+}} is [[isoelectronic]] with [[ammonia]]. As shown in the images above, {{H3O+}} has a [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]] with the oxygen atom at its apex. The H–O–H [[bond angle]] is approximately 113°,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Infrared spectroscopy of {{H3O+}}: the v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band | first1 = Jian | last1 = Tang |first2 = Takeshi | last2 = Oka | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy]] | volume = 196 | pages = 120–130 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1006/jmsp.1999.7844 | pmid = 10361062 | issue = 1| bibcode = 1999JMoSp.196..120T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the center of mass is very close to the oxygen atom. Because the base of the pyramid is made up of three identical hydrogen atoms, the {{H3O+}} molecule's symmetric top configuration is such that it belongs to the C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]]. Because of this symmetry and the fact that it has a dipole moment, the rotational selection rules are Δ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±1 and Δ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The transition dipole lies along the ''c''-axis and, because the negative charge is localized near the oxygen atom, the dipole moment points to the apex, perpendicular to the base plane.

==Acids and acidity==
Hydronium is the cation that forms from [[water (molecule)|water]] in the presence of [[hydrogen ion]]s. These [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Hydron|hydrons]] do not exist in a free state - they are extremely reactive and are [[solvation|solvated]] by water. An [[acid]]ic solute is generally the source the hydrons; however, hydroniums exist even in pure water. This special case of water reacting with water to produce hydronium (and [[hydroxide]]) ions is commonly known as the [[self-ionization of water]]. The resulting hydronium ions are few and short-lived. [[pH]] is a measure of the relative activity of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous solutions. In acidic solutions, hydronium is the more active, its excess proton being readily available for reaction with basic species.

The hydronium ion is very acidic: at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, its [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] is 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meister|first=Erich |last2=Willeke |first2=Martin |last3=Angst |first3=Werner |last4=Togni |first4=Antonio |last5=Walde| first5=Peter |date=2014 |title=Confusing Quantitative Descriptions of Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Equilibria in Chemistry Textbooks – A Critical Review and Clarifications for Chemical Educators |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hlca.201300321/abstract |journal=[[Helv. Chim. Acta]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=1–31 |doi=10.1002/hlca.201300321 |accessdate=March 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most acidic species that can exist in water (assuming sufficient water for dissolution): any stronger acid will ionize and protonate a water molecule to form hydronium. The acidity of hydronium is the implicit standard used to judge the strength of an acid in water: [[strong acid]]s must be better proton donors than hydronium, otherwise a significant portion of acid will exist in a non-ionized state (i.e.: a weak acid). Unlike hydronium in neutral solutions that result from water's autodissociation, hydronium ions in acidic solutions are long-lasting and concentrated, in proportion to the strength of the dissolved acid.

pH was originally conceived to be a measure of the [[hydrogen ion]] concentration of aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = S. P. L. | date = 1909 | title = Ueber die Messung und die Bedeutung der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration bei enzymatischen Prozessen | url = | journal = [[Biochemische Zeitschrift]] | language = de | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 131–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We now know that virtually all such free protons quickly react with water to form hydronium; acidity of an aqueous solution is therefore more accurately characterized by its hydronium concentration. In organic syntheses, such as acid catalyzed reactions, the hydronium ion ({{H3O+}}) can be used interchangeably with the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion; choosing one over the other has no significant effect on the mechanism of reaction.

==Solvation==
Researchers have yet to fully characterize the [[solvation]] of hydronium ion in water, in part because many different meanings of solvation exist. A [[freezing-point depression]] study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is approximately {{chem|H|3|O|+|(H|2|O)|6}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zavitsas | first1 = A. A. | date = 2001 | title = Properties of water solutions of electrolytes and nonelectrolytes | url = | journal = [[The Journal of Physical Chemistry B]] | volume = 105 | issue = 32| pages = 7805–7815 | doi=10.1021/jp011053l}}&lt;/ref&gt; on average, each hydronium ion is solvated by 6 water molecules which are unable to solvate other solute molecules.

Some hydration structures are quite large: the {{chem|H|3|O|+|(H|2|O)|20}} magic ion number structure (called ''magic'' because of its increased stability with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules – this is a similar usage of the word ''magic'' as in [[magic number (physics)|nuclear physics]]) might place the hydronium inside a [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hulthe | first1 = G. | last2 = Stenhagen | first2 = G. | last3 = Wennerström | first3 = O. | last4 = Ottosson | first4 = C-H. | date = 1997 | title = Water cluster studied by electrospray mass spectrometry |doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(97)00486-X | journal = [[Journal of Chromatography A]] | volume = 512 | issue = | pages = 155–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio method]] molecular dynamics simulations have shown that, on average, the hydrated proton resides on the surface of the {{chem|H|3|O|+|(H|2|O)|20}} cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iyengar | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Burnham | first3 = C. J. | last4 = Day | first4 = T. J. F. | last5 = Voth | first5 = G. A. | last6 = Voth | first6 = G.

[[Image:Zundel-cation.JPG|thumb|Zundel cation]]Two other well-known structures are the ''[[Zundel cation]]'' and the ''[[Eigen cation]]''. The Eigen solvation structure has the hydronium ion at the center of an {{chem|H|9|O|4|+}} complex in which the hydronium is strongly [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] to three neighbouring water molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zundel|first1=G. |last2= Metzger|first2=H. |date=1968|title= Energiebänder der tunnelnden Überschuß-Protonen in flüssigen Säuren.

Isolation of the hydronium ion monomer in liquid phase was achieved in a nonaqueous, low nucleophilicity [[superacid]] solution ({{chem|H|F-|Sb|F|5|S|O|2}}).  The ion was characterized by high resolution {{chem|17|O}} [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00508a040| title = Water and related systems. 1.

D. | last2 = Benedikt | first2 = G. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 calculation of the [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] and [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energies]] of the various hydrogen bonds around the hydronium cation in liquid protonated water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jp068960g|pmid=17388314|url=http://vintage.fh.huji.ac.il/~agmon/Fullpaper/JPCA111-2253.pdf| title = Structure and Energetics of the Hydronium Hydration Shells| journal = [[The Journal of Physical Chemistry A]]| volume = 111| issue = 12| pages = 2253–6| year = 2007| last1 = Markovitch | first1 = O. | last2 = Agmon | first2 = N. | bibcode = 2007JPCA..111.2253M}}&lt;/ref&gt; at room temperature and a study of the [[proton hopping]] mechanism using  [[molecular dynamics]] showed that the hydrogen-bonds around the hydronium ion (formed with the three water [[ligand]]s in the first [[solvation shell]] of the hydronium) are quite strong compared to those of bulk water.

A new model was proposed by Stoyanov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja9101826|pmc=2946644|pmid=20078058| title = The Structure of the Hydrogen Ion ({{chem|H|aq|+}}) in Water| journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]| volume = 132| issue = 5| pages = 1484–1485| date = January 15, 2010| last1 = Stoyanov | first1 = Evgenii S. | last2 = Stoyanova | first2 = Irina V. | last3 = Reed | first3 = Christopher A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[infrared spectroscopy]] in which the proton exists as an {{chem|H|13|O|6|+}} ion.  The positive charge is thus delocalized over 6 water molecules.

== Solid hydronium salts ==
For many [[strong acids]], it is possible to form crystals of their hydronium salt that are relatively stable.  These salts are sometimes called ''acid monohydrates''.  As a rule, any acid with an [[ionization constant]] of {{10^|9}} or higher may do this.  Acids whose ionization constant is below {{10^|9}} generally cannot form stable {{H3O+}} salts.  For example, [[hydrochloric acid]] has an ionization constant of {{10^|7}}, and mixtures with water at all proportions are liquid at room temperature.  However, [[perchloric acid]] has an ionization constant of {{10^|10}}, and if liquid anhydrous perchloric acid and water are combined in a 1:1 molar ratio, they react to form solid hydronium perchlorate ({{H3O+}}·{{chem|ClO|4|-}}).

The hydronium ion also forms stable compounds with the [[carborane superacid]] {{chem|H(CB|11|H(CH|3|)|5|Br|6|)}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0551335 | pmid=16464096| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7310527| title = The Nature of the {{H3O+}} Hydronium Ion in Benzene and Chlorinated Hydrocarbon Solvents.

The {{chem|[H|3|O][H(CB|11|HCl|11|)|]}} salt is also soluble in [[benzene]]. In crystals grown from a benzene solution the solvent co-crystallizes and a {{chem|H|3|O}} · (benzene)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cation is completely separated from the anion. In the cation three benzene molecules surround hydronium forming [[pi bond|pi]]-cation interactions with the hydrogen atoms. The closest (non-bonding) approach of the anion at chlorine to the cation at oxygen is 348 pm.

There are also many examples of hydrated hydronium ions known, such as the {{chem|H|5|O|2|+}} ion in {{chem|H|Cl·2|H|2|O|}}, the {{chem|H|7|O|3|+}} and {{chem|H|9|O|4|+}} ions both found in {{chem|H|Br|·4H|2|O}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydronium, on the other hand, has several transitions that make it a superior candidate for detection and identification in a variety of situations.&lt;ref name=wootten1986sih /&gt; This information has been used in conjunction with laboratory measurements of the branching ratios of the various {{H3O+}} dissociative recombination reactions&lt;ref name=neau2000drd /&gt; to provide what are believed to be relatively accurate {{chem|OH|-}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O abundances without requiring direct observation of these species.&lt;ref name=herbst1977iou&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbst | first1 = E. | last2 = Green | first2 = S. | last3 = Thaddeus | first3 = P. | last4 = Klemperer | first4 = W. | year = 1977 | title = Indirect observation of unobservable interstellar molecules | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume = 215 | issue = | pages = 503–510 | doi=10.1086/155381| bibcode = 1977ApJ...215..503H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phillips1992iha&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/171945| title = Interstellar {{H3O+}} and its Relation to the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{H2O-nl}} Abundances| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]| volume = 399| pages = 533 | bibcode = 1992ApJ...399..533P| hdl = 1887/2260| year = 1992| last1 = Phillips | first1 = T.

===Interstellar chemistry===
As mentioned previously, {{H3O+}} is found in both diffuse and dense molecular clouds. By applying the reaction rate constants (''α'', ''β'', and ''γ'') corresponding to all of the currently available characterized reactions involving {{H3O+}}, it is possible to calculate ''k''(''T'') for each of these reactions. By multiplying these ''k''(''T'') by the relative abundances of the products, the relative rates (in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) for each reaction at a given temperature can be determined. These relative rates can be made in absolute rates by multiplying them by the [{{chem|H|2}}]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=udfa&gt;{{cite web|title = {{H3O+}} formation reactions|url = http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/index.php?species=41|work = The UMIST Database for Astrochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K}} for a dense cloud and {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;K}} for a diffuse cloud, the results indicate that most dominant formation and destruction mechanisms were the same for both cases. It should be mentioned that the relative abundances used in these calculations correspond to TMC-1, a dense molecular cloud, and that the calculated relative rates are therefore expected to be more accurate at {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K}}. The three fastest formation and destruction mechanisms are listed in the table below, along with their relative rates. Note that the rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion's chemical interactions under these conditions.&lt;ref name=rauer1997ica /&gt; Finally, it should also be noted that all three destruction mechanisms in the table below are classified as [[dissociative recombination]] reactions.

It is also worth noting that the relative rates for the formation reactions in the table above are the same for a given reaction at both temperatures. This is due to the reaction rate constants for these reactions having ''β'' and ''γ'' constants of 0, resulting in {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''α''}} which is independent of temperature.

Since all three of these reactions produce either {{H2O-nl}} or OH, these results reinforce the strong connection between their relative abundances and that of {{H3O+}}. The rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion's chemical interactions under these conditions.

===Astronomical detections===

As early as 1973 and before the first interstellar detection, chemical models of the interstellar medium (the first corresponding to a dense cloud) predicted that hydronium was an abundant molecular ion and that it played an important role in ion-neutral chemistry.&lt;ref name=herbst1973fad&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbst | first1 = E. | last2 = Klemperer | first2 = W. | year = 1973 | title = The formation and depletion of molecules in dense interstellar clouds | url = | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume = 185 | issue = | page = 505 | doi=10.1086/152436| bibcode = 1973ApJ...185..505H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before an astronomical search could be underway there was still the matter of determining hydronium's spectroscopic features in the gas phase, which at this point were unknown. The first studies of these characteristics came in 1977,&lt;ref name=schwarz1977gpi&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwarz | first1 = H.A. | year = 1977 | title = Gas phase infrared spectra of oxonium hydrate ions from 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;μm | url = | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Physics]] | volume = 67 | issue = 12| page = 5525 | doi=10.1063/1.434748| bibcode = 1977JChPh..67.5525S }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by other, higher resolution spectroscopy experiments. Once several lines had been identified in the laboratory, the first interstellar detection of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was made by two groups almost simultaneously in 1986.&lt;ref name=hollis1986ilc /&gt;&lt;ref name=wootten1986sih /&gt; The first, published in June 1986, reported observation of the ''J''{{su|b=''K''|p=vt}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1{{su|b=1|p=−}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2{{su|b=1|p=+}} transition at {{val|307192.41|u=MHz}} in OMC-1 and Sgr B2. The second, published in August, reported observation of the same transition toward the Orion-KL nebula.

These first detections have been followed by observations of a number of additional H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transitions. The first observations of each subsequent transition detection are given below in chronological order:

In 1991, the 3{{su|b=2|p=+}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2{{su|b=2|p=−}} transition at {{val|364797.427|u=MHz}} was observed in OMC-1 and Sgr B2.&lt;ref name=wootten1991myx&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/186178| title = Detection of interstellar H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; – A confirming line| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]| volume = 380| pages = L79| year = 1991| last1 = Wootten | first1 = A. | last2 = Turner | first2 = B.

'''Kapitza's pendulum''' or '''Kapitza pendulum''' is a rigid [[pendulum]] in which the pivot point vibrates in a vertical direction, up and down. It is named after Russian [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Pyotr Kapitza]], who in 1951 developed a theory which successfully explains some of its unusual properties.&lt;ref name="Kapitza"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapitza P. L. | year = 1951 | title = Dynamic stability of a pendulum when its point of suspension vibrates | url = | journal = Soviet Phys. JETP | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 588–597 }}; {{cite journal | author = Kapitza P. L. | year = 1951 | title = Pendulum with a vibrating suspension | url = | journal = Usp. Fiz. Nauk | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique feature of the Kapitza pendulum is that the vibrating suspension can cause it to balance stably in an inverted position, with the bob above the suspension point. In the usual [[Pendulum (mathematics)|pendulum]] with a fixed suspension, the only stable equilibrium position is with the bob hanging below the suspension point; the inverted position is a point of [[Mechanical equilibrium|unstable equilibrium]], and the smallest perturbation moves the pendulum out of equilibrium. In [[nonlinear control theory]] the Kapitza pendulum is used as an example of a [[parametric oscillator]] that demonstrates the concept of "dynamic stabilization".

The pendulum was first described by A. Stephenson in 1908, who found that the upper vertical position of the pendulum might be stable when the driving frequency is fast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14786440809463763 | volume=15 | title=XX.On induced stability | year=1908 | journal=Philosophical Magazine |series= 6 | pages=233–236 | author=Stephenson Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet until the 1950s there was no explanation for this highly unusual and counterintuitive phenomenon. Pyotr Kapitza was the first to analyze it in 1951.&lt;ref name="Kapitza" /&gt; He carried out a number of experimental studies and as well provided an analytical insight into the reasons of stability by splitting the motion into "fast" and "slow" variables and by introducing an effective potential. This innovative work created a new subject in physics, that is vibrational mechanics. Kapitza's method is used for description of periodic processes in [[atomic physics]], [[plasma physics]] and [[cybernetical physics]]. The effective potential which describes the "slow" component of motion is described in "Mechanics" volume of the [[Lev Landau|Landau]]'s ''[[Course of Theoretical Physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting feature of the Kapitza pendulum system is that the bottom equilibrium position, with the pendulum hanging down below the pivot, is no longer stable. Any tiny deviation from the vertical increases in amplitude with time.&lt;ref&gt;Бутиков Е. И. «Маятник с осциллирующим подвесом (к 60-летию маятника Капицы»), [http://faculty.ifmo.ru/butikov/Russian/ParamPendulum.pdf учебное пособие].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parametric resonance]] can also occur in this position, and [[Chaos theory|chaotic regimes]] can be realized in the system when [[strange attractor]]s are present in the [[Poincaré section]] .

== Notation ==
[[File:KapitzaPendulumScheme.gif|thumb|240px|right|Kapitza's pendulum scheme]]
Denote the vertical axis as &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the horizontal axis as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; so that the motion of pendulum happens in the (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) plane. The following notation will be used
* &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;—frequency of the vertical oscillations of the suspension,
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; — amplitude of the oscillations of the suspension,
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{g/l}&lt;/math&gt; — proper frequency of the mathematical pendulum,
* &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; — free fall acceleration,
* &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; — length of rigid and light pendulum,
* &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; — mass.

Denoting the angle between pendulum and downward direction as &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; the time dependence of the position of pendulum gets written as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
x &amp;= l \sin \varphi\\
y &amp;= - l \cos \varphi - a \cos \nu t
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Energy ==
The [[potential energy]] of the pendulum is due to gravity and is defined by of the vertical position as

: &lt;math&gt;
E_\mathrm{POT} = - m g (l \cos \varphi + a \cos \nu t). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[kinetic energy]] in addition to the standard term &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{KIN}=m l^2 \dot \varphi^2 /2&lt;/math&gt;, describing velocity of a mathematical pendulum, there is a contribution due to vibrations of the suspension

: &lt;math&gt;
E_\mathrm{KIN}
= \frac{m l^2 }{2} \dot \varphi^2 + m a l \nu ~\sin(\nu t) \sin(\varphi)~\dot\varphi + \frac{m a^2 \nu^2}{2} \sin^2(\nu t)\;.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total energy is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies &lt;math&gt;E = E_\mathrm{KIN} + E_\mathrm{POT}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] by their difference &lt;math&gt;L = E_\mathrm{KIN} - E_\mathrm{POT}&lt;/math&gt;.

The total energy is conserved in a mathematical pendulum, so time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; dependence of the potential &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{POT}&lt;/math&gt; and kinetic &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{KIN}&lt;/math&gt; energies is symmetric with respect to the horizontal line. According to the [[virial theorem]] the mean kinetic and potential energies in harmonic oscillator are equal. This means that the line of symmetry corresponds to half of the total energy.

In the case of vibrating suspension the system is no longer a [[Closed system (thermodynamics)|closed one]] and the total energy is no longer conserved. The kinetic energy is more sensitive to vibration compared to the potential one. The potential energy &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{POT} = mgy&lt;/math&gt; is bound from below and above &lt;math&gt;-mg(l+a)&lt;E_\mathrm{POT}&lt;mg(l+a)&lt;/math&gt; while the kinetic energy is bound only from below &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{KIN}\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. For high frequency of vibrations &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the kinetic energy can be large compared to the potential energy.

== Equations of motion ==
Motion of pendulum satisfies [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s. The dependence of the phase &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of the pendulum on its position satisfies the equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=V.P. Krainov

|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]
|isbn=978-0-415-27234-6
|oclc=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot \varphi} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; reads

: &lt;math&gt;
L =  \frac{m l^2 }{2} \dot \varphi^2 + ml( g  + a~\nu^2\cos\nu t) \cos \varphi,
&lt;/math&gt;

up to irrelevant total time derivative terms. The differential equation

: &lt;math&gt;
\ddot \varphi = - (g+a~\nu^2\cos\nu t) \frac{\sin \varphi}{l},
&lt;/math&gt;

which describes the movement of the pendulum is nonlinear due to the &lt;math&gt;\sin\varphi&lt;/math&gt; factor.

== Equilibrium positions ==
Kapitza's pendulum model is more general than the [[Pendulum (mathematics)#Simple gravity pendulum|simple pendulum]]. The Kapitza model reduces to the latter in the limit &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In that limit, the tip of the pendulum describes a circle: &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2 = l^2 = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;. If the energy in the initial moment is larger than the maximum of the potential energy &lt;math&gt;E &gt; mgl&lt;/math&gt; then the trajectory will be closed and cyclic. If the initial energy is smaller &lt;math&gt;E &lt; mgl&lt;/math&gt; then the pendulum will oscillate close to the only stable point &lt;math&gt;(x,y) = (0,-l)&lt;/math&gt;.

When the suspension is vibrating with a small amplitude &lt;math&gt; a \ll l &lt;/math&gt; and with a frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu\gg \omega_0 &lt;/math&gt; much higher than the proper frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, the angle &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed as a superposition &lt;math&gt; \varphi=\varphi_0+\xi&lt;/math&gt; of a "slow" component &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0&lt;/math&gt; and a rapid oscillation &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; with small amplitude due to the small but rapid vibrations of the suspension. Technically, we perform a [[perturbative]] expansion in the "[[coupling constant]]s" &lt;math&gt; (a/l),(\omega_0/\nu) \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt; while treating the ratio &lt;math&gt; (a/l)(\nu/\omega_0)&lt;/math&gt; as fixed. The perturbative treatment becomes exact in the [[double scaling limit]] &lt;math&gt; a \to 0 ,\nu\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, the rapid oscillation &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
\xi = \frac{a}{l}\sin\varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for the "slow" component &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0&lt;/math&gt; becomes

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ddot\varphi_0 = \ddot\varphi - \ddot\xi  &amp;=  -(g+a~\nu^2\cos\nu t)\frac{\sin\varphi}{l} \\
&amp; {}\quad{} - \frac{a}{l}\left(\ddot\varphi_0 \cos \varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t -\dot\varphi_0^2\sin\varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t - 2\nu\dot\varphi_0\cos\varphi_0~\sin\nu t - \nu^2\sin \varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t \right) \\[8pt] 
 &amp;= -\frac{g}{l}\sin\varphi_0 -(g+a~\nu^2\cos\nu t) \frac{1}{l}\left(\xi\cos\varphi_0 + O(\xi^2)\right) \\
&amp; {}\quad{} - \frac{a}{l}\left( \ddot\varphi_0 \cos\varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t -\dot\varphi_0^2\sin\varphi_0 ~\cos\nu t - 2\nu\dot\varphi_0\cos\varphi_0~\sin\nu t \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Time-averaging over the rapid &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;-oscillation yields to leading order

: &lt;math&gt;
\ddot \varphi_0   = - \frac{g}{l}\sin \varphi_0 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a\nu}{l}\right)^2\sin \varphi_0 \cos \varphi_0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The "slow" equation of motion becomes

: &lt;math&gt;
 m l^2\ddot \varphi_0 = -\frac{\partial V_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\partial \varphi_0}  \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

by introducing an [[effective potential]]

: &lt;math&gt;
V_{\mathrm{eff}} = - mgl \cos \varphi_0 + m \left(\frac{a\nu}{2}\sin \varphi_0\right)^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out&lt;ref name="Kapitza" /&gt; that the effective potential &lt;math&gt; V_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt;/math&gt; has two minima if &lt;math&gt;(a\nu)^2 &gt; 2gl &lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt; (a/l)(\nu/\omega_0) &gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;. The first minimum is in the same position &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,-l)&lt;/math&gt; as the mathematical pendulum and the other minimum is in the upper vertical position &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,l)&lt;/math&gt;. As a result the upper vertical position, which is unstable in a mathematical pendulum, can become stable in Kapitza's pendulum.

== Rotating solutions ==

The rotating solutions of the Kapitza's pendulum occur when the pendulum rotates around the pivot point at the same frequency that the pivot point is driven. There are two rotating solutions, one for a rotation in each direction. We shift to the rotating reference frame using &lt;math&gt; \varphi \rightarrow \varphi^{\prime} \pm \nu t&lt;/math&gt; and the equation for &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;
\ddot \varphi^{\prime} = -\frac{1}{l} \left[ \frac{1}{2}a \nu^{2} \sin(\varphi^{\prime}) + g\sin(\varphi^{\prime} \pm \nu t) + \frac{1}{2}a \nu^{2} \sin(\varphi^{\prime} \pm 2\nu t) \right] \;.
&lt;/math&gt;

Again considering the limit in which &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is much higher than the proper frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, we find that the rapid-&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; slow-&lt;math&gt;\varphi_0^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; limit leads to the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
\ddot \varphi_0^{\prime} = -\frac{1}{2l} a \nu^2 \sin\varphi_0^{\prime} \;.
&lt;/math&gt;

The effective potential is just that of a simple pendulum equation. There is a stable equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0^{\prime} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and an unstable equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0^{\prime} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

== Phase portrait ==

Interesting phase portraits might be obtained in regimes which are not accessible within analytic descriptions, for example in the case of large amplitude of the suspension &lt;math&gt;a \approx l&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.

Arbitrary parameters of the system can be used and can be inserted manually.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the amplitude of driving oscillations to half of the pendulum length &lt;math&gt;a = l/2&lt;/math&gt; leads to the phase portrait shown in the figure.

Further increase of the amplitude to &lt;math&gt;a\approx l&lt;/math&gt;) leads to full filling of the internal points of the phase space, if before some points of the phase space were not accessible, now system can reach any of the internal points. This situation holds also for larger values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

== Interesting facts ==

* Kapitza noted that a [[pendulum clock]] with a vibrating pendulum suspension always goes faster than a clock with a fixed suspension.
* [[Walking]] is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. Increased stability during walking might be related to stability of Kapitza's pendulum. This applies regardless of the number of limbs - even arthropods with six, eight or more limbs.

'''Karen Rosel Polenske''' (born March 20, 1937) is an American [[regional economist]] specialized in energy, environmental, and infrastructure analyses, and [[input-output model|input-output]] accounts and models, particularly at the subnational scale. She is currently the Peter de Florez Professor of Regional Political Economy at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).

Polenske received her undergraduate degree in Home Economics from the [[Oregon State University]] in 1959. She holds a master in Public Administration and Economics from [[Syracuse University]] and a PhD in Economics from [[Harvard University]], where she was in charge of the regional work at the Harvard Economic Research Project.  Working with [[Wassily W. Leontief]], she directed one of the most extensive multiregional input-output research studies of the U.S. economy in history.

She has been director of the multiregional planning research team at MIT since 1972. She is also past President of the [[International Input-Output Association]]. Polenske has been an advisor to international agencies, including the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and the [[World Bank]], as well as an economic consultant to the U.S. [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Department of Commerce]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.

The '''kudurru of Kaštiliašu'''' is a fragment of an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''narû'', or entitlement stele, recording the legal action taken by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king [[Kashtiliash IV|Kaštiliašu IV]] (ca. 1232–1225 BC) over land originally granted by his forebear [[Kurigalzu II]] (ca. 1332–1308 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History (MSKH 1) | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Oriental Institute | year = 1976 | page = 176 }} O.2.5&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Burna-Buriash II|Burna-Buriaš II]] to Uzub-Šiḫu or -Šipak in grateful recognition of his efforts in the war against [[Assyria]] under its king, [[Enlil-nirari]]. Along with the [[Tablet of Akaptaḫa]], these are the only extant [[kudurru]]s from this king’s short eight-year reign and were both recovered from [[Elam]]ite [[Susa]], where they had been taken in antiquity, during the French excavations under [[Jacques de Morgan]] at the end of the nineteenth century and now reside in the [[Musée du Louvre]].

==The stele==

The surviving [[kudurru]] fragment is a crescent-shaped cross-section with convex surface inscribed with [[cuneiform]] and a concave side engraved with relief images.&lt;ref name&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten | author = Ursula Seidl | publisher = Academic Press Fribourg | year = 1989 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the stele tapers to the top, it carries representations of the gods [[Sin (mythology)|Sîn]] (crescent moon), [[Shamash|Šamaš]] (solar-disc) and [[Ishtar|Ištar]] (eight-pointed star) in bas-relief. Beneath these a demon with a lion’s head, human body and short tail brandishes a knife in one hand and a club or mace in the other. This is [[Ugallu]], “Big Weather Beast”, one of the eleven monsters who were to be conquered by Marduk in the later publication, [[Enûma Eliš]], and who was to feature on apotropaic figurines of the first millennium BC. The seated dog figure of [[Nintinugga|Gula]] is carved facing the demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mémoires de la Délégation de Perse, Vol. 1 |author1=J. de Morgan |author2=G. Jéquier |author3=G. Lampre | location = Paris | year = 1900 | pages = 178–179 }} fig. 386 kudurru IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The broken text recalls that Kurigalzu had awarded an individual with the Kassite name Uzub-Šiḫu (or -Šipak, a [[Kassite deities|Ksssite deity]]) a large area of 120 &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; (around 3.75 square miles) of agricultural land for services rendered during the war against Assyria.&lt;ref name=scheil&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mémoires de la Délégation de Perse, Vol. 2 | author = V. Scheil | location = Paris | year = 1900 | pages = 93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a successful outcome in this conflict in marked contrast to the account espoused by the Synchronistic History, an Assyrian polemic chronicle inscription which boasts of Kurigalzu’s apparent defeat at the [[Kurigalzu II#Battle of Sugagu|Battle of Sugagu]], a view which was also contradicted in the Babylonian [[Chronicle P]] version of these events and also in Assyrian king [[Adad-nirari I|Adad-nārārī I]]’s own recollections of his father, Enlil-nirari’s setbacks.

The text mentions Nimgirabi-Marduk, son of Nazi-…. and Pir-Šamaš, son of Šumat-Šamaš, but their roles are uncertain.&lt;ref name=scheil/&gt; The land grant was reconfirmed by Kaštiliašu, possibly to a descendant of the original beneficiary, perhaps due to the failure to provide a sealed legal document during the earlier bequest.&lt;ref name=hinke&gt;{{ cite book | title = A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur (BE IV) | author = W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">The first use of [[3D scanner|3D laser scanning]] at Stonehenge was of the [[Bronze Age]] dagger and axes inscribed on the [[sarsen]]s, which was undertaken in 2002 by a team from [[Wessex Archaeology]] and [[Archaeoptics]]. They used a [[Minolta]] Vivid 900 scanner to analyse and record surfaces of the [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] and post-medieval [[Stone carving|carvings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehengelaserscan.org/press.html |title=Hi-tech lasers throw light on Stonehenge secrets |author=Wessex Archaeology |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317214223/http://www.stonehengelaserscan.org/press.html |archivedate=March 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bronze_Age#British_Bronze_Age|Bronze Age]] carvings of a [[dagger]] and an axehead were first discovered by [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] in 1953 on stone number 53, one of the imposing [[sarsen]] [[trilithon]]s. A contemporary survey in 1956 by Robert Newall revealed that the total number of axes on this stone totalled 14, all on the same face of the stone, looking inwards to the centre of the stone circle. Typologically, the axes have a Middle [[Bronze Age]] date. 

The surface of stone 53 containing [[Bronze_Age#British_Bronze_Age|Bronze Age]] carvings was laser scanned at a resolution of 0.5mm, resulting in hundreds of thousands of individual [[dimension|3D]] measurements known as a [[point cloud]]. These data were then processed into a meshed 3D solid model for analysis using custom software written by Archaeoptics called ''Demon3D''. 

The team pioneered some visualisation techniques to enhance the outlines of the known carvings. During this process, the faint outline of two previously unknown axes was spotted in an animation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stonehengelaserscan.org/animations.html&lt;/ref&gt; separate from the carvings recorded by Newall. Subsequent enhancement of the data confirmed that the shapes were of [[flange]]d axes, similar in shape to those clearly visible, but either badly [[Erosion|eroded]], or were originally carved much shallower than their counterparts. The larger of the two carvings&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stonehengelaserscan.org/stone53/s53newcarvings.html&lt;/ref&gt; differs slightly from the other axes in that it has two 'lugs' along its shaft, and others have interpreted that it could represent either an axe, a mushroom, or a ram's skull. 

The results of these investigations were published in an article entitled "The Stonehenge Laser Show"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Stonehenge Laser Show|journal=British Archaeology|date=November 2003|first=Thomas|last=Goskar |author2=Alistair Carty |author3=Paul Cripps |author4=Chris Brayne |author5=Dave Vickers|volume=73|issue=|pages=9–15|id= |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba73/feat1.shtml|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the November 2003 edition of [[British Archaeology]].

In 2011 English Heritage commissioned a full laser scan of the visible faces of all stones as Stonehenge in high resolution (sub-millimetre), as well as a lower resolution scan of the ground in the area known as the "Stonehenge Triangle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/stonehenge-in-high-definition/ |title=Stonehenge in High Definition |author=English Heritage |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517041359/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/stonehenge-in-high-definition/ |archivedate=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
{{Main|Paper machine}}
Magazine papers are made on paper machines from [[pulp (paper)|pulp]]. The pulp may be recycled, mechanical or chemical depending on the magazine quality. [[Publisher]]s select the type of paper that not only meets their customers' requirements, but also works well in their machinery.

==Paper grades==
Different paper grades are used in magazines:
* Machine finished specialties (MFS) is a special [[newsprint]] grade that is heavier, bulkier and brighter.
* [[Supercalendered]] papers are often used in [[rotogravure]]. These are uncoated and based on mechanical pulp.
* [[Coated paper|Coated mechanical paper]] are classified depending on the coating weight. Normally higher coating weight gives higher paper quality.
* [[Machine finished coated paper]]s are high gloss papers based on mechanical pulp.
* [[Offset paper]] is an uncoated paper based on chemical pulp suitable for [[offset printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Amely|title=Club Flyer Paper List|url=http://www.printingvip.com/products/clubflyers|publisher=VIP Printing Marketing |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Standard [[coated fine paper]]s are often used for offset printing.
* Woodfree Papers made only from [[cellulose]], usually containing less than 10% mechanical content. Coated woodfree or uncoated woodfree. Also Known as free sheet (USA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2122">The '''Murie Science and Learning Center''' is a collaboration between the [[Denali National Park and Preserve]], seven additional National Parks and several park partners.." The Murie Science and Learning Center promotes scientific research to aid park managers and provide science-based education programs and information to students, educational institutions and the visiting public.&lt;ref name=murieslc1&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.murieslc.org/category/35/about-us|work=Murie Science &amp; Learning Center|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is named after the Murie family of naturalists, who made significant, influential studies of arctic ecosystems. [[Olaus Murie]] and [[Margaret Murie]] were active in the establishment of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]]. Olaus's brother [[Adolph Murie]] was equally influential, studying wolves in Denali in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=murieslc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=muriectr1&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Murie Legacy|url=http://www.muriecenter.org/the-murie-legacy/|publisher=The Murie Center|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''natural disaster''' is a major [[disaster|adverse event]] resulting from [[natural hazard|natural processes]] of the [[Earth]]; examples are [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[tornado]]es, [[volcanic eruption]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters]&lt;/ref&gt; and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]], or ability to recover and also on the infrastructure available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=G. Bankoff, G. Frerks, D. Hilhorst (''eds.'')| year=2003| title=Mapping Vulnerability: Disasters, Development and People| isbn= 1-85383-964-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adverse event will not rise to the level of a disaster if it occurs in an area without [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=D. Alexander| year=2002| title=Principles of Emergency planning and Management| publisher=Harpended: Terra publishing| isbn= 1-903544-10-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=B.

Davis  |last-author-amp=yes | year=2004| title=At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters| publisher=Wiltshire: Routledge| isbn= 0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a vulnerable area, however, such as [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal during the 2015 earthquake]], an earthquake can have disastrous consequences and leave lasting damage, which can require years to repair.

==Geological disasters==

===Avalanches and landslides===
{{main|Landslide}}
{{see also|List of landslides}}
{{main|Avalanche}}
{{see also|List of avalanches}}

[[File:Wikipedia Landslide.jpg|thumb|A landslide in [[San Clemente, California]] in 1966]]
A [[landslide]] is described as an outward and downward slope movement of an abundance of slope-forming materials including rock, soil, artificial, or even a combination of these things.&lt;ref name="Landslides"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Highland|first1=Lynn|title=Landslide Hazard Information|url=http://geology.com/usgs/landslides/|website=Geology.com|publisher=Geology.com|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 soldiers died as a result of [[avalanche]]s during the mountain campaign in the [[Alps]] at the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Austrian-Italian]] front. Many of the avalanches were caused by artillery fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Davis (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CRzMOYIuLJEC Natural Disasters]''". Infobase Publishing. p.7. {{ISBN|0-8160-7000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/itafront/avalan.htm|title=Avalanche!|publisher=WorldWar1.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquakes===
{{main|earthquake}}
{{see also|Lists of earthquakes}}

An [[earthquake]] is the result of a sudden release of energy in the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[crust (geology)|crust]] that creates [[seismic wave]]s.  At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by vibration, shaking, and sometimes displacement of the ground. Earthquakes are caused by slippage within geological [[Fault (geology)|faults]]. The underground point of origin of the earthquake is called the ''seismic focus''. The point directly above the focus on the surface is called the ''epicenter''. Earthquakes by themselves rarely kill people or wildlife. It is usually the secondary events that they trigger such as building collapse, fires, [[tsunami]]s (seismic sea waves) and volcanoes. Many of these could possibly be avoided by better construction, safety systems, early warning and planning.

===Sinkholes===
{{main|Sinkhole}}
{{see also|List of sinkholes}}

[[File:RedLakeCroatia.JPG|thumb|The [[Red Lake (Croatia)|Red Lake]] in Croatia.]]
When natural erosion, human mining or underground excavation makes the ground too weak to support the structures built on it, the ground can collapse and produce a [[sinkhole]]. For example, the [[2010 Guatemala City sinkhole]] which killed fifteen people was caused when heavy rain from [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]], diverted by leaking pipes into a [[pumice]] bedrock, led to the sudden collapse of the ground beneath a factory building.

===Volcanic eruptions===
{{see also|Types of volcanic eruptions}}
{{see also|List of largest volcanic eruptions}}

[[File:Deccan Traps volcano.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of the volcanic eruptions that formed the [[Deccan Traps]] in India.]]

[[Volcano]]es can cause widespread destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. The effects include the [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruption]] itself that may cause harm following the explosion of the volcano or falling rocks. Secondly, [[lava]] may be produced during the eruption of a volcano, and so as it leaves the volcano the lava destroys many buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. Thirdly, [[volcanic ash]], generally meaning the cooled ash, may form a cloud, and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight but even small quantities will harm humans if inhaled. Since the ash has the consistency of ground glass it causes abrasion damage to moving parts such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is the [[pyroclastic flows]], which consist of a cloud of hot volcanic ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that [[Pompeii]] was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A [[lahar]] is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. The 1953 [[Tangiwai disaster]] was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 [[Armero tragedy]] in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.

Volcanoes rated at 8 (the highest level) on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] are known as [[supervolcano]]es. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], 75,000 to 80,000 years ago a supervolcanic eruption at what is now [[Lake Toba]] in [[Sumatra]] reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in human evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|ref= CITEREFGibbons2010|first1= Ann |last1= Gibbons|title= Human Ancestors Were an Endangered Species|newspaper= ScienceNow|date= 19 January 2010|url= http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2010/119/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and killed three-quarters of all plant life in the northern hemisphere. However, there is considerable debate regarding the veracity of this theory. The main danger from a supervolcano is the immense cloud of ash, which has a disastrous global effect on climate and temperature for many years.

==Hydrological disasters==
[[File:Limpopo.jpg|thumb|The [[Limpopo River]] during the [[2000 Mozambique flood]]]]

A violent, sudden and destructive change either in the quality of Earth's water or in the distribution or movement of water on land below the surface or in the atmosphere.

===Floods===
{{main|Flood}}
{{see also|List of floods}}

A [[flood]] is an overflow of water that 'submerges' land.&lt;ref&gt;MSN Encarta Dictionary. [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861612277 Flood.] Retrieved on 2006-12-28. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023547055729 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU [[Floods Directive]] defines a flood as a temporary covering the land with water which is usually not covered by water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:288:0027:0034:EN:PDF Directive 2007/60/EC Chapter 1 Article2]&lt;/ref&gt; In the sense of 'flowing water', the word may also be applied to the inflow of the [[tides]]. Flooding may result from the volume of water within a body of water, such as a [[river]] or [[lake]], which overflows, causing some of the water to escape its usual boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (June 2000). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=flood1 Flood.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824054504/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=flood1 |date=2007-08-24 }} Retrieved on 2009-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, it is not a significant flood unless the water covers land used by man, like a village, city or other inhabited area, roads, expanses of farmland, etc.

===Tsunami===
{{main|Tsunami}}
{{see also|List of historical tsunamis}}

A tsunami (plural: tsunamis or tsunami; from Japanese: 津波, lit. "harbour wave"; English pronunciation: /tsuːˈnɑːmi/), also known as a seismic sea wave or as a tidal wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Tsunamis can be caused by undersea earthquakes such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Boxing Day tsunami]], or by landslides such as the [[1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami|one in 1958 at Lituya Bay, Alaska]], or by volcanic eruptions such as the [[Minoan eruption|ancient eruption of Santorini]]. On March 11, 2011, a [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|tsunami occurred near Fukushima, Japan]] and spread through the Pacific Ocean.

===Limnic eruptions===
{{main|Limnic eruption}}
A [[limnic eruption]] occurs when a gas, usually [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], suddenly erupts from deep lake water, posing the threat of suffocating wildlife, livestock and humans. Such an eruption may also cause [[tsunami]]s in the lake as the rising gas displaces water. Scientists believe [[landslides]], [[volcanic]] activity, or explosions can trigger such an eruption. To date, only two limnic eruptions have been observed and recorded. In 1984, in [[Cameroon]], a limnic eruption in [[Lake Monoun]] caused the deaths of 37 nearby residents, and at nearby [[Lake Nyos]] in 1986 a much larger eruption killed between 1,700 and 1,800 people by [[asphyxiation]].

==Meteorological disasters==
[[File:Young steer after blizzard - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Young steer after a [[blizzard]], March 1966]]
{{main|Meteorological disasters}}

===Cyclonic storms===
[[Cyclone]], [[Hurricane|tropical cyclone]], [[hurricane]], and [[typhoon]] are different names for the same phenomenon, which is a cyclonic storm system that forms over the oceans. The determining factor on which term is used is based on where they originate. In the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, the term "hurricane" is used; in the Northwest Pacific it is referred to as a "typhoon" and "cyclones" occur in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.
  
The deadliest hurricane ever was the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]]; the deadliest Atlantic hurricane was the [[Great Hurricane of 1780]] which devastated Martinique, St. Eustatius and Barbados. Another notable hurricane is [[Hurricane Katrina]], which devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005.

===Blizzards===
{{main|Blizzard}}
Blizzards are severe [[winter storm]]s characterized by heavy snow and strong winds. When high winds stir up snow that has already fallen, it is known as a [[ground blizzard]]. Blizzards can impact local economic activities, especially in regions where snowfall is rare. The [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] affected the United States, when many tons of wheat crops were destroyed, and in Asia, [[2008 Afghanistan blizzard]] and the [[1972 Iran blizzard]] were also significant events. The [[1993 Storm of the Century|1993 Superstorm]] originated in the Gulf of Mexico and traveled north, causing damage in 26 states as well as Canada and leading to more than 300 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.n-d-a.org/snow-hail-storm.php|title=Natural Hazards – Snow &amp; Hail Storms|website=www.n-d-a.org|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hailstorms===
{{main|Hail}}
{{see also|List of costly or deadly hailstorms}}

Hailstorms are precipitation in the form of ice, with the ice not melting before it hits the ground. Hailstones usually measure between 0.2 inch (5 millimetres) and 6 inches (15 centimetres) in diameter. A particularly damaging hailstorm hit [[Munich]], Germany, on July 12, 1984, causing about $2 billion in [[insurance]] claims.

===Ice storms===
{{main|Ice storm}}

An [[ice storm]] is a type of winter storm characterized by freezing rain. The U.S. National Weather Service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25 inch (6.4 mm) of ice on exposed surfaces. 

===Cold waves===
{{main|Cold wave}}

A cold wave (known in some regions as a cold snap or cold spell) is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.

===Heat waves===
{{main|Heat wave}}
{{see also|List of heat waves}}

A heat wave is a period of unusually and excessively hot weather. The worst heat wave in recent history was the [[European Heat Wave of 2003]]. A summer heat wave in Victoria, Australia, created conditions which fuelled the massive [[2009 Victorian bushfires|bushfires]] in 2009. [[Melbourne]] experienced three days in a row of temperatures exceeding 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) with some regional areas sweltering through much higher temperatures. The bushfires, collectively known as "Black Saturday", were partly the act of arsonists. The [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer]] resulted in severe heat waves, which killed over 2,000 people. It resulted in hundreds of wildfires which caused widespread air pollution, and burned thousands of square miles of forest.

[[File:Cumulonimbus NOAA gov.jpg|thumb|right|A classic anvil-shaped, and clearly-developed [[Cumulonimbus incus]]]]

===Droughts===
{{main|Drought}}
{{see also|List of droughts}}

Drought is the unusual dryness of soil caused by levels of rainfall significantly below average over a prolonged period. Hot dry winds, shortage of water, high temperatures and consequent evaporation of moisture from the ground can also contribute to conditions of drought. Droughts result in crop failure and shortages of water.

Well-known historical [[drought]]s include the 1997–2009 [[2000s Australian drought|Millennium Drought]] in Australia led to a water supply crisis across much of the country. As a result, many desalination plants were built for the first time ([[List of desalination plants in Australia|see list]]). In 2011, the State of [[Texas]] lived under a drought emergency declaration for the entire calendar year and severe economic losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Table of Events]&lt;/ref&gt;  The drought caused the [[Bastrop County, Texas|Bastrop]] fires.

===Thunderstorms===
{{main|Thunderstorm}}

Severe storms, dust clouds, and volcanic eruptions can generate [[lightning]]. Apart from the damage typically associated with storms, such as winds, hail, and flooding, the lightning itself can damage buildings, ignite fires and kill by direct contact. Especially deadly lightning incidents include a 2007 strike in Ushari Dara, a remote mountain village in northwestern [[Pakistan]], that killed 30 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lightning kills 30 people in Pakistan's north | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-07-20| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/07/20/us-pakistan-lightning-idUSISL17716520070720| accessdate = July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crash of [[LANSA Flight 508]] which killed 91 people, and a fuel explosion in Dronka, [[Egypt]] caused by lightning in 1994 which killed 469.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = D | title = An appraisal of underground gas storage technologies and incidents, for the development of risk assessment methodology | page = 121 | publisher = Health and Safety Executive | work = British Geological Survey | url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr605.pdf | accessdate = 2008-08-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lightning deaths occur in the poor countries of America and Asia, where lightning is common and [[adobe]] [[mud brick]] housing provides little protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/deadly-lightning-mexico-government-failure|title=Deadly lightning strike in Mexico reveals plight of poorest citizens |author=Nina Lakhani|date=31 July 2015|accessdate=2016-03-18|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Granizo.jpg|thumb|right|A large [[hail]]stone, about 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter]]

===Tornadoes===
{{see also|List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks}}

A [[tornado]] is a violent and dangerous rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a [[cumulonimbus cloud]], or the base of a [[cumulus cloud]] in rare cases. It is also referred to as a ''twister'' or a ''cyclone'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyclone merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although the word [[cyclone]] is used in meteorology in a wider sense, to refer to any closed [[low pressure area|low pressure]] circulation. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible [[funnel cloud|condensation funnel]], whose narrow end touches the Earth and is often encircled by a cloud of [[debris]] and [[dust]].  Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than {{convert|110|mph|km/h|sigfig=3}}, are approximately {{convert|250|ft|m|sigfig=1}} across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The [[1999 Bridge Creek – Moore tornado|most extreme]] tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300&amp;nbsp;mph (480&amp;nbsp;km/h), stretch more than two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (perhaps more than 100&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="fastest wind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm|title=Doppler On Wheels|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Wurman, Joshua|publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research|date=2008-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205124033/http://www.cswr.org/dow/dow.htm|archivedate=2007-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="widest tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/archive/hallam/hallam.php|title=Hallam Nebraska Tornado|work=[[National Weather Service]]| publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2005-10-02|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|accessdate=2006-09-08|author=Roger Edwards|date=2006-04-04|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildfires==
{{main|wildfire}}
{{see also|List of forest fires}}

[[Wildfire]]s are large fires which often start in [[wildland]] areas. Common causes include [[lightning]] and [[drought]] but wildfires may also be started by human negligence or [[arson]]. They can spread to populated areas and can thus be a threat to humans and property, as well as [[wildlife]]. Notable cases of [[wildfire]]s were the 1871 [[Peshtigo Fire]] in the United States, which killed at least 1700 people, and the 2009 [[2009 Victoria bushfires|Victorian bushfires]] in Australia.

==Space disasters==
[[File:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Fallen trees caused by the Tunguska meteoroid of the [[Tunguska event]] in June 1908.]]

===Impact events and airburst===
{{main|Impact event}}

Asteroids that impact the Earth have led to several major extinction events, including one which created the [[Chicxulub crater]] 64.9 million years ago and which is associated with the demise of the dinosaurs. Scientists estimate that the likelihood of death for a living human from a global impact event is comparable to the probability of death from an airliner crash.

No human death has been definitively attributed to an impact event, but the [[1490 Ch'ing-yang event]] in which over 10,000 people may have died has been linked to a [[meteor shower]]. Even asteroids and comets that burn up in the atmosphere can cause significant destruction on the ground due to the [[air burst]] explosion: notable air bursts include the [[Tunguska event]] in June 1908, which devastated large areas of Siberian countryside, and the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] on 15 February 2013, which caused widespread property damage in the city of [[Chelyabinsk]] and injured 1,491.

===Solar flare===
{{See also|Solar storm of 1859}}
A solar flare is a phenomenon where the Sun suddenly releases a great amount of [[solar radiation]], much more than normal. Solar flares are unlikely to cause any direct injury, but can destroy electrical equipment. The potential of solar storms to cause disaster was seen during the 1859 [[Carrington event]], which disrupted the telegraph network, and the [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]] which [[Power outage|blacked out]] Quebec.

International law, for example [[Geneva Conventions]] defines [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], requires that "States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]], all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including the occurrence of natural disaster."&lt;ref&gt;Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt; And further [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] is formed by [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 44/182. People displaced due to natural disasters are currently protected under international law (Guiding Principles of International Displacement, Campala Convention of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
According to the UN, Asia-Pacific is the world's most disaster prone region.&lt;ref&gt;Asia-Pacific World’s Most Disaster-Prone Region&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ReliefWeb, a person in Asia-Pacific is five times more likely to be hit by a natural disaster than someone living in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;https://reliefweb.int/report/world/factbox-asia-pacific-worlds-most-disaster-prone-region&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political consequences==
{{quotebox|"'''Everyone is desperate for food and water. There's no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing.'''"&amp;mdash; Lian Gogali Aid worker following [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/indonesia-earthquake-tsunami-latest-updates-181003060041729.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Natural disasters can also affect political relations with countries and vice versa.{{clarifyme|date=July 2018}} Violent conflicts within states can exacerbate the impact of natural disasters by weakening the ability of states, communities and individuals to provide disaster relief. Natural disasters can also worsen ongoing conflicts within states by weakening the capacity of states to fight rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Nel and Marjolein Righarts, 2008, "National Disasters and the Risk of Violent Civil Conflict", ''International Studies Quarterly'', 52 (1): 159–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Brancati, 2007. "Political Aftershocks: The Impact of Earthquakes on Intrastate Conflict", ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 51 (5): 715–743.&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries like the US, studies find that incumbents lose votes when the electorate perceives them as responsible for a poor disaster response.&lt;ref&gt;JT Gasper, A Reeves, 2011, "Make It Rain? Retrospection and the Attentive Electorate in the Context of Natural Disasters", ''American Journal of Political Science'' 55 (2), 340–355&lt;/ref&gt;  In Chinese and Japanese history, it has been routine for [[era names]] and/or capital cities and palaces of emperors to be changed after a major natural disaster, chiefly for political reasons such as association with hardships by the populace and fear of upheaveal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/03/national/name-japans-next-era-avoid-initial-letters-used-refer-past-four-eras/&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. in East asian government chronicles, such fears were recorded in a low profile way as an unlucky name or place requiring change.)  Disasters and responses can dictate political careers; the once popular President [[Benigno Aquino III]] of Philippines, following a weak and confused response&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dw.com/en/typhoon-puts-aquinos-popularity-to-the-test/a-17237230 &lt;/ref&gt; to [[Typhoon Yolanda]] which killed over 6,000 people and survivors were [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/after-typhoon-philippines-faces-one-of-the-most-profound-resettlement-crises-in-decades/2014/01/04/2118c6a2-71f2-11e3-bc6b-712d770c3715_story.html largely left to fend for themselves], this widely accepted sentiment carried over and the President never recovered his popularity, his hand picked successor [[Mar Roxas]] lost the subsequent election to a rival party in a landslide vote.  Post-disaster mishandling can spread despair as bad news travels fast and far, and contribute to the appeal of electing a strongman out of sheer desperation.

==Recent history==
Between 1995 and 2015, according to the UN’s disaster-monitoring system, the greatest number of natural disasters occurred in America, China and India.&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|title=Weather-related disasters are increasing|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/08/daily-chart-19|work=[[The Economist]]|date=29 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, there were 905 natural disasters worldwide, 93% of which were weather-related disasters. Overall costs were US$170 billion and insured losses $70 billion. 2012 was a moderate year. 45% were meteorological (storms), 36% were hydrological (floods), 12% were climatological (heat waves, cold waves, droughts, wildfires) and 7% were geophysical events (earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). Between 1980 and 2011 geophysical events accounted for 14% of all natural catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/natural-catastrophes-2012-dominated-us-weather-extremes-0 Natural Catastrophes in 2012 Dominated by U.S. Weather Extremes] [[Worldwatch Institute]] May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on natural events require complete historical records and strategies related to obtaining and storing reliable records, allowing for both critical interpretation and validation of the sources. Under this point of view the irreplaceable role of traditional repositories (archives) can be supplemented by the use of such web sources as eBay.&lt;ref&gt;Gizzi F.T. (2009).The electronic trading site eBay as a useful tool for obtaining historical data on natural events. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 35(9), 1950–1957, doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2008.12.016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nu-Wood Decorative Millwork''' is [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] made of a specially formulated [[polyurethane]] [[polymer]]. The standard density is similar to [[Pine#Classification of Pines|white pine]]. It can be cut, sawn, shaped, routed, [[nail (engineering)|nail]]ed, [[Staple (fastener)|staple]]d, and [[screw]]ed just like wood. Profiles exist for a variety of uses, indoors and out. Advantages over wood include a surface which will not crack, flake, or blister and a product which is resistant to water, [[mold]], [[mildew]], and insects.

==Manufacturing process==
The polyurethane [[foam]] is created from two components which generate heat when combined. One component contains water and the other component reacts with water. The oxygen of the water fuels the [[exothermic]] reaction, leaving [[hydrogen]] bubbles which causes the compound to foam. Given no compression, the foam rises to fill the space allowed. Based on the mixture and the specific makeup of the two chemicals, it is possible to estimate exactly how much foam is required to fill a given space. More importantly, it is possible to determine the exact amount of mixture required to fill a defined space and achieve a specific packing ratio.

Tremendous compression is required to obtain packing equal to the density of white pine. In addition, synthetic wood needs a wood look and feel on the surface. This means the finished product must easily slide out of the mold that provides its shape. It also means the mold must be strong enough to withstand the pressure of the expanding foam. This combination of requirements creates a complex problem that is solved by a variety of techniques.

[[Silicone]] rubber is used to create [[negative space]] molds from original millwork created by expert woodworkers. The forms are polished, painted with a release agent surrounded by a box made of angled [[aluminum]] and filled with the liquid silicone rubber compound. The rubber is generally around one inch thick. Once the rubber hardens the form is removed from the standard, which is shelved for future use. At this time, the form provides a negative space with the exact dimensional and surface characteristics of the woodwork to be produced, plus a small tolerance for expected [[Wood drying#Shrinkage and swelling|shrinkage]].

The silicone form and form box pass along a bed of rollers to a paint shop where the silicone form is covered with a thin [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]] of water-based paint. The heat and pressure of the expanding foam cause the paint to transfer to the finished piece. The paint protects the silicone form from the chemicals in the polyurethane and provides a release from the piece.

While the finished polyurethane product is quite light, consisting largely of closed cells of [[hydrogen]], the silicone form and the metal and wood foam box are very heavy. The manufacturing process is difficult to automate due to the many shapes and sizes and the fact that most orders are unique. Thus, the work requires great strength and is quite hazardous to the back, hands, and feet. Competition produces pricing pressures, and labor is the most expensive component of pricing. As a result, low wages are standard.

==History==
Nu-Wood Decorative Millwork is manufactured in [[Syracuse, Indiana]]. The business was founded to serve the manufactured housing industry by [[Robert DuBois]], who later sold the company to Goshen Rubber Company. Goshen Rubber sold the company to private investors in 1998.  In 2001 Nu-Wood was acquired by the Beil Family who operated Nu-Wood building a strong presence in Indianapolis and Cincinnati.  In 2010 Nu-Wood was purchased by Len and Marci Morris who also operate Stairsupplies.com.  Nu-Wood operates delivery vehicles and serving the continental US and Canada. In early 2008 Nu_wood was purchased and is still operated by Jasper Plastic Solutions in Syracuse, Indiana.

On 6 December 2001, a worker argument resulted in the shooting death of the general manager, the wounding of six employees and the shooter's suicide. A new operations manager joined the company in 1993 and worked to create a more friendly and stress-free work environment. For more information: http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/06/indiana.shooting/

{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}

An '''outcrop'''  or  '''rocky outcrop''' is a visible exposure of [[bedrock]] or ancient [[superficial deposits]] on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, J. V., 1960, Glossary of geology and related sciences. American Geological Institute, Washington, p. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Rantakallio mänty Kivenlahti 300611.jpg|thumb|A typical shore outcrop scoured by ancient glaciers in [[Espoo]], [[Finland]].]]
Outcrops do not cover the majority of the Earth's land surface because in most places the bedrock or superficial deposits are covered by a mantle of [[soil]] and vegetation and cannot be seen or examined closely. However, in places where the overlying cover is removed through [[erosion]] or [[tectonic uplift]], the rock may be exposed, or ''crop out''. Such exposure will happen most frequently in areas where [[erosion]] is rapid and exceeds the [[weathering]] rate such as on steep hillsides, mountain ridges and tops, river banks, and [[tectonic uplift|tectonically active]] areas. In [[Finland]], [[Glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last glacial maximum (ca. 11000 BC), followed by scouring by sea waves, followed by [[Postglacial rebound|isostatic uplift]] has produced a large number of smooth coastal and littoral outcrops.

Bedrock and superficial deposits may also be exposed at the Earth's surface due to human excavations such as quarrying and building of transport routes.

==Study==
Outcrops allow direct observation and sampling of the [[bedrock]] ''[[in situ]]'' for [[Geology|geologic]] analysis and creating [[geologic map]]s. In situ measurements are critical for proper analysis of [[Historical geology|geological history]] and outcrops are therefore extremely important for understanding the [[geologic time scale]] of earth history. Some of the types of information that cannot be obtained except from bedrock outcrops or by precise drilling and coring operations, are [[structural geology]] features orientations (e.g. bedding planes, [[fold (geology)|fold]] axes, [[foliation]]), depositional features orientations (e.g. paleo-current directions, grading, [[facies]] changes), [[paleomagnetic]] orientations. Outcrops are also very important for understanding fossil assemblages, and paleo-environment, and evolution as they provide a record of relative changes within geologic [[stratum|strata]].

Accurate description, mapping, and sampling for laboratory analysis of outcrops made possible all of the geologic sciences and the development of fundamental geologic laws such as the [[law of superposition]], the [[principle of original horizontality]], [[principle of lateral continuity]], and the [[principle of faunal succession]].

==Examples==
On [[Ordnance Survey]] maps in [[Great Britain]], cliffs are distinguished from outcrops: cliffs have a continuous line along the top edge with lines protruding down; outcrops have a continuous line around each area of bare rock. An outcrop example in [[California]] is the [[Vasquez Rocks]], familiar from [[location shooting]] use in many [[movie|films]], composed of uplifted [[sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://employees.oxy.edu/jerry//vazquez.htm oxy.edu. Vazquez Rocks. access date:5/22/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parks.lacounty.gov/Parkinfo.asp?URL=cms1_033383.asp&amp;Title=Vasquez%20%20Rocks%20Natural%20Area%20and%20Center parks.lacounty.gov. Vazquez Rocks Natural Area and Nature Center. access date:5/22/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yana, India|Yana]] is another example of outcrops, located in [[Uttara Kannada]] district in [[Karnataka]], [[India]].

[[File:Blank page intentionally end of book.jpg|thumb|Pages in a book]]
A '''page''' is one side of a leaf (or sheet) of [[paper]], [[parchment]] or other material (or electronic media) in a book, magazine, newspaper, or other collection of sheets, on which text or illustrations can be printed, written or drawn, to create [[document]]s. It can be used as a measure of communicating general quantity of [[information]] ("That topic covers twelve pages") or more specific quantity ("there are 535 words in a standard page in standard font type")&lt;ref name="anycount"&gt;https://anycount.com/WordCountBlog/how-many-words-in-one-page/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word "page" comes from the [[Latin]] term ''pagina'', which means a "a written page, leaf, sheet"&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pagina#Etymology_3&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from an earlier meaning "to create a row of vines that form a rectangle."&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Souchier,  "Histoires de pages et pages d'histoire," dans L'Aventure des écritures, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, 1999 ({{ISBN|978-2-717-72072-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''pagina'' derives from the verb ''pangere,'' which means to stake out boundaries when planting vineyards.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Souchier,  "Histoires de pages et pages d'histoire," dans L'Aventure des écritures, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, 1999 ({{ISBN|978-2-717-72072-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The page in typography==
In a book, the side of a [[leaf (books)|leaf]] one reads first is called the [[recto]] page, and the back side of that leaf is called the [[verso]] page. In a [[spread (typography)|spread]], one reads the verso page first and then reads the recto page of the next leaf. In English-language books, the recto page is on the right and the verso page is on the left. By modern convention, these books start with a recto page and hence all recto pages in such books have uneven numbers.

English-language books are read from left to right and the reader flips the pages from right to left. In languages read from right to left ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Persian language|Persian]], plus [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] when written vertically), the first page is typically a recto page on the left and the reader flips the pages from left to right.

The process of placing the various text and graphical elements on the page in a visually organized way is called [[page layout]], and the relative lightness or darkness of the page is referred to as its [[type color|colour]].

In book [[typography]], a "cat hairbrush" refers to a master design of a page, designed by the [[graphic designer]] or the [[typographer]] of a book, that illustrates how similar pages in the same book can achieve a level of visual consistency. To help maintain the desired consistency, the typical page may employ a [[grid (graphic design)|grid]] system.

In a modern book, a page may contain a [[page header|header]] and a [[page footer|footer]]. Pages may or may not be numbered, but most pages are.

"...The first printed books had no title pages. As with the manuscripts of the Middle Ages which the first printers sought to imitate as clearly as possible, and with which their books had to compete for a market, the reader launched at once into the text, with no more than a curt phrase at the head of the column which read "incipit": "Here beginneth"...&lt;ref&gt;Gilcrest, Donald Bean (1947). Title Pages: A Footnote to the History of Printing. Volume III, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pages appearing before the main text of a book (including the title page, preface, table of contents, etc.) are collectively called the [[front matter]] and those appearing after the main text (appendices, [[colophon (book)|colophon]], etc.), the [[back matter]]. Placement of the copyright page varies between different typographic traditions: in English-language books it belongs to the front matter; however, in Chinese and Japanese, the copyright page is part of the back matter.

In English-language typography, the size of a page is traditionally measured in a unit called the [[Pica (typography)|pica]].

==The page in English lexicon==

Compound words:
* '''Blank Page''': Multiple meanings. "It's a blank page": An opportunity to start over a do something anew or for the first time. "He/she is a blank page": denotes either a person hard to read or easily swayed/vapid. 
* '''Page Through''': to skim something; to flip through something quickly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/page%20through&lt;/ref&gt;

==The page in library science==
In [[library science]], the number of pages in a book forms part of its physical description, coded in subfield $300a in [[MARC 21]] and in subfield $215a in [[UNIMARC]]. This description consists of the number of pages (or a list of such numberings separated by commas, if the book contains separately-numbered sections), followed by the [[abbreviation]] "p." for "page(s)". The number of pages is written in the same style ([[Hindu-Arabic numerals|Arabic]] or [[Roman numeral]]s, [[uppercase]] or [[lowercase]], etc.) as the numbering in each section. Unnumbered pages are not described.

For example,
:XI, 2050 p.
describes a book with two sections, where section one contains 11 pages numbered using uppercase Roman numerals, and section two contains 2050 pages numbered using Arabic numerals; the total number of pages is thus 2061 pages, plus any unnumbered pages.

If the book contains too many separately-numbered sections, too many unnumbered pages, or only unnumbered pages, the [[librarian]] may choose to describe the book as just "1 v." (one volume) when doing [[original cataloguing]].

==The printed page in computing==
In [[word processor]]s and [[spreadsheet]]s, the process of dividing a document into actual pages of paper is called [[pagination]]. Printing a large page on multiple small pages of paper is sometimes called [[tiled rendering|tiling]].

In early computing, computer output typically consists of [[monospace]]d text neatly arranged in equal number of columns and rows on each printed page. Such pages are typically printed using [[line printer]]s (or, in the case of personal computers, character (usually [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]]) printers) that accepts a simple code such as [[ASCII]], and the end of a printed page can be indicated by a [[control character]] called the [[form feed]].

[[Page printer]]s, [[computer printer|printers]] that print one page at a time, typically accept [[page description language]]s. In the [[PostScript]] page description language, the page being described is printed using the "showpage'’ [[operator (programming)|operator]].

===Printed page in Web===


The concept of the "page" has been carried over to the World Wide Web where we speak of web "pages." The term [[web page]] is simply a document or a computer file. It is usually written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), where users can get access by entering a URL in an internet browser.

Users can print pages in the web. Web pages can be printed by downloading to the hard disk or directly from the browser. Easiness of printing a web page depends on its length.&lt;ref name=":pagewidth"&gt;{{cite web

|last=Lynch
|first=Patrick
|accessdate=2016-11-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer web pages with infinite scrolling are harder to print as the number of unloaded pages is unknown to the user.

[[Clickbait]] makes printing a web page difficult, as the printed version contains ads. This issue can be overcome using browser extensions such as [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/print-friendly-pdf/ohlencieiipommannpdfcmfdpjjmeolj?hl=en-US Print Friendly &amp; PDF] in Google Chrome.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web

'''Photocatalytic water splitting''' is an [[artificial photosynthesis]] process with [[photocatalysis]] in a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] used for the dissociation of [[water]] into its constituent parts, [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) and [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}), using either artificial or natural [[light]]. Theoretically, only solar energy ([[photons]]), water, and a [[catalyst]] are needed.  This topic is the focus of much research, but thus far no technology has been commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Chu |first= Sheng |last2= Li |first2= Wei |last3= Hamann |first3= Thomas |last4= Shih |first4= Ishiang |last5= Wang |first5= Dunwei |last6= Mi |first6= Zetian |year= 2017 |month= |title= Roadmap on solar water splitting: current status and future prospects |journal= Nano Futures |volume= 1 |issue=  |pages= 022001 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1088/2399-1984/aa88a1 |bibcode=2017NanoF...1b2001C|url= http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-1984/aa88a1 |accessdate= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen fuel]] production has gained increased attention as [[Fossil fuel|oil]] and other [[Non-renewable resource|nonrenewable fuels]] become increasingly depleted and expensive. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are being investigated to produce hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel. Water splitting holds particular promise since it utilizes water, an inexpensive renewable resource. Photocatalytic water splitting has the simplicity of using a catalyst and sunlight to produce hydrogen out of water.  

== Concepts ==
When {{H2O}} is split into {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2}}, the stoichiometric ratio of its products is 2:1:

: &lt;math chem&gt;\begin{matrix}{\scriptstyle E\ &gt;\ 1.23~\ce{eV}}\\
\ce{2H2O &lt;=&gt; 2H2 + O2}\\
{\scriptstyle (E \text{: photon energy.})}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The process of water-splitting is a highly endothermic process (Δ''H'' &gt; 0). Water splitting occurs naturally in [[photosynthesis]] when photon energy is absorbed and converted into the chemical energy through a complex biological pathway (Dolai's S-state diagrams. Ref. Dolai, U.(2017)"Chemical Scheme of Water-splitting Process during Photosynthesis by the way of Experimental Analysis ".IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences.12(6):65-67.doi:10.9790/3008-1206026567. ISSN 2319-7676.). However, production of hydrogen from water requires large amounts of input energy, making it incompatible with existing energy generation. For this reason, most commercially produced hydrogen gas is produced from [[natural gas]].

Of the several requirements for an effective [[photocatalyst]] for water splitting, the potential difference (voltage) must be 1.23V at 0 pH.&lt;ref name="JHEAD"&gt;J. Head, J. Turner, "ANALYSIS OF THE WATER-SPLITTING CAPABILITIES OF GALLIUM INDIUM PHOSPHIDE NITRIDE (GaInPN)" U.S. Department of Energy Journal of Undergraduate Research, January 2001, 26-31. [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1051819/ Web link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the minimum band gap for successful water splitting at pH=0 is 1.23 eV, corresponding to light of 1008&amp;nbsp;nm, the electrochemical requirements can theoretically reach down into [[infrared light]], albeit with negligible catalytic activity.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} These values are true only for a completely reversible reaction at [[standard temperature and pressure]] (1 bar and 25&amp;nbsp;°C).

Theoretically, infrared light has enough energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen; however, this reaction is very slow because the wavelength is greater than 750&amp;nbsp;nm. The potential must be less than 3.0 V to make efficient use of the energy present across the full spectrum of sunlight. Water splitting can transfer charges, but not be able to avoid corrosion for long term stability. Defects within crystalline photocatalysts can act as recombination sites, ultimately lowering efficiency.

Under normal conditions due to the transparency of water to visible light photolysis can only occur with a radiation wavelength of 180&amp;nbsp;nm or shorter. We see then that, assuming a perfect system, the minimum energy input is 6.893 eV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujishima|first1=Akira|title=Electrochemical Photolysis of Water at a Semiconductor Electrode|journal=Nature|date=13 September 1971|volume=238|pages=37–38|doi=10.1038/238037a0|pmid=12635268|bibcode = 1972Natur.238...37F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials used in photocatalytic water splitting fulfill the band requirements outlined previously and typically have dopants and/or co-catalysts added to optimize their performance. A sample [[semiconductor]] with the proper band structure is [[titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|TiO|2}}). However, due to the relatively positive [[conduction band]] of {{chem|TiO|2}}, there is little driving force for {{chem|H|2}} production, so {{chem|TiO|2}} is typically used with a co-catalyst such as [[platinum]] (Pt) to increase the rate of {{chem|H|2}} production. It is routine to add co-catalysts to spur {{chem|H|2}} evolution in most photocatalysts due to the conduction band placement. Most semiconductors with suitable band structures to split water absorb mostly [[UV light]]; in order to absorb visible light, it is necessary to narrow the band gap. Since the conduction band is fairly close to the reference potential for {{chem|H|2}} formation, it is preferable to alter the [[valence band]] to move it closer to the potential for
{{chem|O|2}} formation, since there is a greater natural [[overpotential]].&lt;ref name="AKUDO"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kudo | first1 = A. | last2 = Miseki | first2 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = Heterogeneous photocatalyst materials for water splitting | url = | journal = Chem. Soc. Rev. | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 253–278 | doi = 10.1039/b800489g }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photocatalysts can suffer from catalyst decay and recombination under operating conditions. Catalyst decay becomes a problem when using a [[sulfide]]-based photocatalyst such as [[cadmium sulfide]] (CdS), as the [[sulfide]] in the catalyst is oxidized to elemental [[sulfur]] at the same potentials used to split water. Thus, [[sulfide]]-based photocatalysts are not viable without sacrificial reagents such as [[sodium sulfide]] to replenish any sulfur lost, which effectively changes the main reaction to one of hydrogen evolution as opposed to water splitting. Recombination of the [[electron-hole pair]]s needed for photocatalysis can occur with any catalyst and is dependent on the defects and surface area of the catalyst; thus, a high degree of crystallinity is required to avoid recombination at the defects.&lt;ref name="AKUDO"/&gt;

The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of photocatalysis is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy systems. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using a photovoltaic and  electrolytic system the reaction is in just one step, and can therefore be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |date=Jun 2009|last2= Álvarez Galván |first2= M.

== Method of evaluation ==

Photocatalysts must confirm to several key principles in order to be considered effective at water splitting. A key principle is that {{chem|H|2}} and {{chem|O|2}} evolution should occur in a [[stoichiometric]] 2:1 ratio; significant deviation could be due to a flaw in the experimental setup and/or a side reaction, both of which do not indicate a reliable photocatalyst for water splitting. The prime measure of photocatalyst effectiveness is quantum yield (QY), which is:

: QY (%) = (Photochemical reaction rate) / (Photon absorption rate) × 100%&lt;ref name="AKUDO"/&gt;

This quantity is a reliable determination of how effective a photocatalyst is; however, it can be misleading due to varying experimental conditions. To assist in comparison, the rate of gas evolution can also be used; this method is more problematic on its own because it is not normalized, but it can be useful for a rough comparison and is consistently reported in the literature. Overall, the best photocatalyst has a high quantum yield and gives a high rate of gas evolution.

The other important factor for a photocatalyst is the range of light absorbed; though UV-based photocatalysts will perform better per [[photon]] than visible light-based photocatalysts due to the higher photon energy, far more visible light reaches the Earth's surface than UV light. Thus, a less efficient photocatalyst that absorbs visible light may ultimately be more useful than a more efficient photocatalyst absorbing solely light with smaller wavelengths.

The utility of a material for photocatalytic water splitting will typically be investigated for one of the two redox reactions at a time. To do this, a three component system is employed: a catalyst, a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron acceptor such as persulfate when investigating water oxidation, and a sacrificial electron donor (for example triethylamine) when studying proton reduction. Employing sacrificial reagents in this manner simplifies research and prevents detrimental charge recombination reactions.

== Photocatalyst systems ==

=== {{chem|Cd|1-''x''|Zn|''x''|S}} ===
Solid solutions {{chem|Cd|1-''x''|Zn|''x''|S}}  with different Zn concentration (0.2 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 0.35) has been investigated in the production of hydrogen from aqueous solutions containing &lt;math chem&gt;\ce{SO3^2-}/\ce{S^2-}&lt;/math&gt; as sacrificial reagents under visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |last2= Ishikawa |first2= A. |last3= Domen |first3= K. |date=May 2009|last4= Villoria De La Mano |first4= J.A.|last5= Sánchez-Sánchez|first5= M.C.|last6= González|first6= I.D.|last7= Herreras|first7= S.|last8= Mota|first8= N.|last9= Rivas|first9= M.E. |title= Influence of Zn concentration in the activity of Cd1-xZnxS solid solutions for water splitting under visible light |journal= Catalysis Today |volume= 143 |issue= 1–2 |pages= 51–59 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.024 |bibcode= |ref=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Textural, structural and surface catalyst properties were determined by {{chem|N|2}}  adsorption isotherms, UV–vis spectroscopy, SEM and XRD and related to the activity results in hydrogen production from water splitting under visible light irradiation. It was found that the crystallinity and energy band structure of the {{chem|Cd|1-''x''|Zn|''x''|S}}  solid solutions depend on their Zn atomic concentration. The hydrogen production rate was found to increase gradually when the Zn concentration on photocatalysts increases from 0.2 to 0.3. Subsequent increase in the Zn fraction up to 0.35 leads to lower hydrogen production. Variation in photoactivity is analyzed in terms of changes in crystallinity, level of conduction band and light absorption ability of {{chem|Cd|1-''x''|Zn|''x''|S}}  solid solutions derived from their Zn atomic concentration.

=== {{chem|NaTaO|3}}:La ===
{{chem|NaTaO|3}}:La yields the highest water splitting rate of photocatalysts without using sacrificial reagents.&lt;ref name="AKUDO"/&gt;  This UV-based photocatalyst was shown to be highly effective with water splitting rates of 9.7&amp;nbsp;mmol/h and a quantum yield of 56%. The nanostep structure of the material promotes water splitting as edges functioned as {{chem|H|2}} production sites and the grooves functioned as {{chem|O|2}} production sites. Addition of [[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]] particles as cocatalysts assisted in {{chem|H|2}} production; this step was done by using an impregnation method with an aqueous solution of {{chem|Ni(NO|3|)|2}}•6{{chem|H|2|O}} and evaporating the solution in the presence of the photocatalyst. {{chem|NaTaO|3}} has a conduction band higher than that of [[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]], so photogenerated electrons are more easily transferred to the conduction band of [[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]] for {{chem|H|2}} evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kato | first1 = H. | last2 = Asakura | first2 = K. | last3 = Kudo | first3 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Highly Efficient Water Splitting into H and O over Lanthanum-Doped NaTaO Photocatalysts with High Crystallinity and Surface Nanostructure | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 3082–3089 | doi=10.1021/ja027751g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{chem|K|3|Ta|3|B|2|O|12}} ===
{{chem|K|3|Ta|3|B|2|O|12}}, another catalyst activated by solely UV light and above, does not have the performance or quantum yield of {{chem|NaTaO|3}}:La. However, it does have the ability to split water without the assistance of cocatalysts and gives a quantum yield of 6.5% along with a water splitting rate of 1.21&amp;nbsp;mmol/h. This ability is due to the pillared structure of the photocatalyst, which involves {{chem|TaO|6}} pillars connected by {{chem|BO|3}} triangle units. Loading with [[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]] did not assist the photocatalyst due to the highly active {{chem|H|2}} evolution sites.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kurihara, H. Okutomi, Y. Miseki, H. Kato, A. Kudo, "Highly Efficient Water Splitting over {{chem|K|3|Ta|3|B|2|O|12}}Photocatalyst without Loading Cocatalyst" Chem. Lett., 35, 274 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ({{chem|Ga|.82|Zn|.18}})({{chem|N|.82|O|.18}}) ===
({{chem|Ga|.82|Zn|.18}})({{chem|N|.82|O|.18}}) has the highest quantum yield in visible light for visible light-based photocatalysts that do not utilize sacrificial reagents as of October 2008.&lt;ref name="AKUDO"/&gt;  The photocatalyst gives a quantum yield of 5.9% along with a water splitting rate of 0.4&amp;nbsp;mmol/h. Tuning the catalyst was done by increasing [[calcination]] temperatures for the final step in synthesizing the catalyst. Temperatures up to 600&amp;nbsp;°C helped to reduce the number of defects, though temperatures above 700&amp;nbsp;°C destroyed the local structure around zinc atoms and was thus undesirable. The treatment ultimately reduced the amount of surface [[zinc|Zn]] and [[oxygen|O]] defects, which normally function as recombination sites, thus limiting photocatalytic activity. The catalyst was then loaded with {{chem|Rh|2-y|Cr|y|O|3}} at a rate of 2.5 wt % [[Rhodium|Rh]] and 2 wt% [[chromium|Cr]] to yield the best performance.&lt;ref&gt;K. Maeda, K. Teramura, K. Domen,

=== Cobalt based systems ===
Photocatalysts based on [[cobalt]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/anie.201007987| title = Splitting Water with Cobalt| year = 2011| last1 = Artero | first1 = V. | last2 = Chavarot-Kerlidou | first2 = M. | last3 = Fontecave | first3 = M. | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition| volume = 50| issue = 32| pages = 7238–7266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are tris([[bipyridine]]) cobalt(II), compounds of cobalt ligated to certain cyclic [[polyamine]]s, and certain [[cobaloxime]]s.

In 2014 researchers announced an approach that connected a [[chromophore]] to part of a larger organic ring that surrounded a cobalt atom. The process is less efficient than using a platinum catalyst, cobalt is less expensive, potentially reducing total costs. The process uses one of two supramolecular assemblies based on Co(II)-templated coordination of {{chem2|Ru(bpy)32+}} (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl) analogues as [[photosensitizer]]s and [[electron donor]]s to a cobaloxime [[macrocycle]]. The Co(II) centres of both assemblies are high spin, in contrast to most previously described cobaloximes. Transient absorption optical spectroscopies include that charge recombination occurs through multiple ligand states present within the photosensitizer modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-less-expensive-way-to-duplicate-the-complicated-steps-of-photosynthesis-in-making-fuel |title=A less-expensive way to duplicate the complicated steps of photosynthesis in making fuel |doi=10.1039/C3CP54420F |publisher=KurzweilAI |accessdate=2014-01-23|bibcode=2013PCCP...1521070M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mukherjee | first1 = A. | last2 = Kokhan | first2 = O. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. | last4 = Niklas | first4 = J. | last5 = Chen | first5 = L.

=== Bismuth vanadate===
[[Bismuth vanadate]] based systems have been demonstrated to have a record solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.2% (highest for metal-oxide photo-electrode) with the advantage of a very simple and cheap catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdi|first=Fatwa F|author2=Lihao Han |author3=Arno H.

=== Tungsten diselenide (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
Tungsten diselenide may have a role in future hydrogen fuel production, as a recent discovery in 2015 by scientists in Switzerland revealed that the compound's own photocatalytic properties might be a key to significantly more efficient electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/discovery-brightens-solars-future-energy-costs-be-cut-n385841 |title=Discovery Brightens Solar's Future, Energy Costs to Be Cut |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 2, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News from Reuters |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== III-V semiconductor systems ===
Systems based on the material class of III-V semiconductors, such as [[InGaP]], enable currently the highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of up to 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=May|first=Matthias M|author2=Hans-Joachim Lewerenz |author3=David Lackner |author4=Frank Dimroth |author5=Thomas Hannappel |title=Efficient direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion by in situ interface transformation of a tandem structure|journal=Nature Communications|date=15 September 2015|doi=10.1038/ncomms9286|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9286/full/ncomms9286.html|accessdate=24 December 2015|volume=6 |pages=8286|arxiv = 1508.01666 |bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8286M |pmid=26369620 |pmc=4579846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term stability of these high-cost high-efficiency systems does, however, remain an issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5044">{{Distinguish|Plasma parameters}}

The '''plasma parameter''' is a [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]], denoted by capital Lambda, Λ.  The plasma parameter is usually interpreted to be the argument of the Coulomb logarithm, which is the ratio of the maximum impact parameter to the classical distance of closest approach in [[Coulomb collision|Coulomb scattering]].  In this case, the plasma parameter is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Chen, F.F., Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, (Springer, New York, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = 4\pi n \lambda_D^3 &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''n'' is the number density of electrons,
:λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Debye length]].

This expression is typically valid for a plasma in which ion thermal velocities are much less than electron thermal velocities.  A detailed discussion of the Coulomb logarithm is available in the ''NRL Plasma Formulary'', pages 34–35.

Note that the word parameter is usually used in plasma physics to refer to bulk plasma properties in general: see [[plasma parameters]]. 

An alternative definition of this parameter is given by the average number of electrons in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] contained within a [[Debye sphere]] (a sphere of radius the [[Debye length]]).
This definition of the plasma parameter is more frequently (and appropriately) called the Debye number, and is denoted &lt;math&gt; N_D&lt;/math&gt;.  In this context, the plasma parameter is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; N_D = \frac {4\pi}{3} n \lambda_D^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Since these two definitions differ only by a factor of three, they are frequently used interchangeably.

Often the factor of &lt;math&gt;4\pi/3&lt;/math&gt; is dropped.  When the Debye length is given by &lt;math&gt; \lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k T_e}{n_e q_e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, the plasma parameter is given by&lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto, K., Fundamentals of Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, (Iwanami, Tokyo, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; N_D = \frac{(\epsilon_0 k T_e)^{3/2}}{q_e^3 n_e^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where
: ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]],
: ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]],
: ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron charge,
: ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron temperature.

Confusingly, some authors define the plasma parameter as :

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_p = \Lambda^{-1}\ &lt;/math&gt;.

== Coupling parameter ==

A closely related parameter is the plasma coupling &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, defined as a ratio of the Coulomb energy to the thermal one:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma = \frac{E_\mathrm{C}}{kT_e} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Coulomb energy (per particle) is

:&lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{C} = \frac{q_e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\langle r \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;,

where for the typical inter-particle distance &lt;math&gt;\langle r \rangle&lt;/math&gt; usually is taken the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]]. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma = \frac{q_e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 kT_e}\sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi n_e}{3}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, up to a numeric factor of the order of unity, 

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma \sim \Lambda^{-2/3}\ &lt;/math&gt;.

In general, for multicomponent plasmas one defines the coupling parameter for each species ''s'' separately:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_s = \frac{q_s^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 kT_s}\sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi n_s}{3}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Here, ''s'' stands for either electrons or (a type of) ions.

== The ideal plasma approximation ==

One of the criteria which determine whether a collection of charged particles can rigorously be termed an [[ideal plasma]] is that Λ&gt;&gt;1.
When this is the case, collective electrostatic interactions dominate over binary collisions, and the plasma particles can be treated as if they only interact with a smooth background field, rather than through pairwise interactions (collisions).&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Callen, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Draft Material for Fundamentals of Plasma Physics book: Collective Plasma Phenomena [http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~callen/chap1.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[equation of state]] of each species in an ideal plasma is that of an [[ideal gas]].

== Plasma properties and Λ ==

Depending on the magnitude of Λ, plasma properties can be characterized as following:&lt;ref&gt;See [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node8.html The plasma parameter] lecture notes from Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7118">A powder is an assembly of dry particles dispersed in air. If two different powders are mixed perfectly, three theoretical '''powder mixtures''' can be obtained: the random mixture, the ordered mixture or the interactive mixture.

== Different powder types ==
A [[Powder (substance)|powder]] can be free-flowing if the particles do not stick together or [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] if the particles cling to one another to form [[Particle aggregation|aggregate]]s. The likelihood of cohesion increases with decreasing size of the powder particles; particles smaller than 100 [[micrometre|µm]] are generally cohesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Bridgewater|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(76)80051-4|title= Fundamental powder mixing mechanisms|journal=Powder Technol. |pages=215–236|year=1976|volume=15|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.A. Orr  |author2=E. Shotton |lastauthoramp=yes |title= The mixing of cohesive powders|journal=Chemical engineer|volume= 269|pages=12–18|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Powder mixtures.jpg]]

== Random mixture ==
A '''random mixture''' can be obtained if two different free-flowing powders of approximately the same particle size, [[density]] and [[shape]] are mixed (see figure A).&lt;ref name="diva-portal.org"&gt;[http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_uu_diva-9292__fulltext.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only primary particles are present in this type of mixture, i.e., the particles are not cohesive and do not cling to one another. The mixing time will determine the quality of the random mixture. However, if powders with particles of different size, density or shape are mixed the [[Particle segregation|segregation]] can occur. Segregation will cause separation of the powders as, for example, lighter particles will be prone to travel to the top of the mixture whereas heavier particles are kept at the bottom.

== Ordered mixture ==
The term ''ordered mixture'' was first introduced to describe a completely [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] mixture where the two components adhere to each other to form ordered units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.A. Hersey|title= Ordered mixing: a new concept in powder mixing practice|journal=Powder Technol|volume= 11|pages=41–44|year=1975|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(75)80021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a completely homogeneous mixture is only achievable in theory and other denotations were introduced later such as adhesive mixture or interactive mixture.

== Interactive mixture ==
If a free-flowing powder is mixed with a cohesive powder an '''interactive mixture''' can be obtained. The cohesive particles adhere to the free-flowing particles (now called carrier particles) to form interactive units as shown in figure B.&lt;ref name="diva-portal.org"/&gt; An interactive mixture may not contain free aggregates of the cohesive powder, which means that all small particles must be adhered to the larger ones. The difference from an ordered mixture is instead that all carrier particles do not need to be of the same size and a different number of small particles attached to each one. A narrow size range of the carrier particles is preferred to avoid segregation of the interactive units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C.W. Yip  |author2=J.A. Hersey |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Segregation in ordered powder mixtures|journal=Powder Technol|volume= 16|pages=149–150|year=1977|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(77)85034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice a combination of a random mixture and an interactive mixture may be obtained which consists of carrier particles, aggregates of the small particles and interactive units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.N. Staniforth|title= Total mixing|journal= Int J Pharm Tech &amp; Prod Mfr|volume= 2|pages=7–12|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
The formation of interactive mixtures cannot automatically be assumed, especially if smaller carrier particles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C.C. Yeung  |author2=J.A. Hersey |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Ordered powder mixing of coarse and fine pariculate systems|journal=Powder Technol|volume= 22|pages=127–131|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(79)85015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a greater proportion of fine particles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Kulvanich  |author2=P.J. Stewart |lastauthoramp=yes |title= The effect of particle size and concentration on the adhesive characteristics of a model drug-carrier interactive system|journal= J Pharm Pharmacol|volume= 39|pages=673–678|year=1987|pmid=2890731|issue=9|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7158.1987.tb06968.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.H. de Boer |author2=P.P.

Frijlink  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Dry powder inhalation of antibiotics in cystic fibrosis therapy, part 1: development of a powder formulation with colistin sulfate for a special test inhaler with an air classifier as de-agglomeration principle|journal= Eur J Pharm Biopharm|volume=54|pages=17–24|year=2002|doi=10.1016/S0939-6411(02)00043-7|pmid=12084498|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used. If an interactive mixture is to be formed, it is necessary that enough force is exerted by the carrier particles during dry mixing to break up the aggregates formed by the fine particles. Adhesion can then be achieved if the adhesive forces exceed the gravitational forces that otherwise lead to separation of the constituents.&lt;ref name="diva-portal.org"/&gt;
     
===Applications===
Interactive mixtures for example can be used in the manufacturing of tablets&lt;ref&gt;Bredenberg, Susanne  [http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:162788 New Concepts in Administration of Drugs in Tablet Form : Formulation and Evaluation of a Sublingual Tablet for Rapid Absorption, and Presentation of an Individualised Dose Administration System].

[[File:Qt-Flash-Final.gif|thumb|Quasiturbine QT-AC]]

The '''Quasiturbine''' or '''Qurbine''' engine is a proposed [[pistonless rotary engine]] using a rhomboidal rotor whose sides are hinged at the vertices. The volume enclosed between the sides of the rotor and the rotor casing provide compression and expansion in a fashion similar to the more familiar [[Wankel engine]], but the hinging at the edges allows the volume ratio to increase. Unlike [[rotary vane pump|vane pumps]], in which vane extension is generally important and against which the pressure acts to generate the rotation, the Quasiturbine contour seals have a minimal extension and the rotation does not result from pressure against these seals.

[[Patent]]s for the Quasiturbine (in the most general AC concept with carriages) &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150622005758/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6164263 US Patent Quasiturbine AC (With Carriages) Dec. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150622005753/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6899075 US Patent Quasiturbine SC (Without Carriage) Feb. 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2013}} are held by the family of Gilles Saint-Hilaire of [[Québec]]. As well as an [[internal combustion engine]], the Quasiturbine has been proposed as a possible [[pump]] design, and a possible [[Stirling engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/ETypeStirling.htm Quasiturbine Stirling engine] Stirling engine idea on the Quasiturbine website.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated as a [[pneumatic engine]] using stored [[compressed air]], and as a [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Quasiturbine Low RPM High Torque Pressure Driven Turbine for Top Efficiency Power Modulation. Peers reviewed paper - Published in The Proceeding of Turbo Expo 2007 of the IGTI (International Gas Turbine Institute) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). [http://www.quasiturbine.com/QTPapiers/ASME2007QTMontreal.pdf Abstract] and [http://www.quasiturbine.com/Presse/QTASME2007.htm info]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least four proposed designs:
* Two-port with carriages, suitable for use as an internal combustion engine.
* Four-port without carriages, suitable for use as a pneumatic engine or [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] engine, steam engine or pump.
* Two-port without carriages, a conceptual design which is hoped to combine some of the advantages of the existing two- and four-port prototypes.
* Another conceptual design using a fixed charge of gas, with no ports and without carriages, as a Stirling engine. (But not yet referring [[Malone engine]] in spite of similar function to Stirling engine)

==Two-port with carriages==
The earliest Quasiturbine design used a three-wheeled ''carriage'' ([[French language|French]] ''chariot'', hence ''avec chariots'' or ''AC'' for ''with carriages'') to support each vertex of the rotor. The wheels of these four carriages, making twelve wheels in total, ran around the periphery of the engine chamber.

A prototype of an internal combustion engine to this design was constructed, and enthusiastically reviewed in [[European Automotive Design]] magazine September, 1999. The prototype was turned by an external engine for 40 hours.

However, ignition with fuel was never achieved. If it was attempted no results were ever released, and development work on this design was suspended.

===Photo-detonation===
The two-port design with carriages was proposed to make possible a new and superior mode of combustion, termed '''''photo-detonation''''' by the Quasiturbine inventors. This resembles [[detonation]], as used in the [[Bourke engine]], akin to knocking and pinging undesirable in common internal combustion engines. {{As of|2005}}, no research has been published supporting this claim. A related idea that '''''flame transfer''''' would be possible through special ports is similarly unsupported.

==Four-port without carriages==
[[Image:QTpt6SteamTasse900px.jpg|thumb|Quasiturbine QT-SC configured as a steam engine]]

The second Quasiturbine design is greatly simplified to eliminate the carriages (French ''sans chariots'' or ''SC''). At the same time, the ports were duplicated on the opposite side of the housing, thus converting the operation from four strokes per cycle to two and doubling the number of cycles per rotor revolution. This mechanism has been demonstrated running as a [[pneumatic]] engine using stored compressed air, and also as a [[steam engine]]. This is also the design proposed for use as a [[pump]], and particularly as a [[supercharger]].

This design uses redesigned blades, longer than those for a similar sized housing of the first type owing to the absence of the carriages, and lacking the distinctive crown contour. Only the basic rotor geometry is common with the earlier design.

A pneumatic engine of this design was demonstrated powering a go-kart in November 2004, and another powering a small car in September 2005, both vehicles using stored compressed air to power the engine. {{As of|2005}} a pneumatic [[chain saw]] driven by an air hose from a conventional external compressor is under development.

With a suitably redesigned housing to allow for thermal expansion, the same rotor design has been demonstrated as a steam engine.

Another potential variation of this design uses the two sets of ports independently, one as an engine and the other as a pump, thus potentially integrating the functions of a pump and its driving motor in one shaftless unit. One restriction of this usage is that the two fluids must be similar; It would not be possible for example to drive an integrated air pump with hydraulic fluid, as the rotor design is significantly different. {{As of|2005}} no prototype of this variation has been demonstrated.



==Two-port without carriages==
This third design combines aspects of the first two. {{As of|2005}} this design is conceptual only. It has not been built, but is used for purposes of illustration. If built it would not support photo-detonation.

Many other designs are possible within the patented Quasiturbine model, with or without carriages and with differing numbers of ports. {{As of|2005}}, which design will be used for further work on the internal combustion version has not been announced.

== History ==
Prof. J. Ignacio Martínez-Artajo (1907-1984) from [[Universidad Pontificia Comillas]] (Madrid, Spain) made sketches of an adaptative rotary compressor in the mid seventies, which led to the construction of a railway model missing of proper rotor dynamic solutions. Lately, new researches were carried out by four researchers led by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a [[thermonuclear]] [[physicist]], consisting of members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft [[turbine]] engine where the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] portion and the power portion would be in the same [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. In order to achieve this, they had to disconnect the blades from the main shaft, and chain them around in such a way that a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn, and as an engine the following quarter of a turn.

The general concept of the Quasiturbine was first patented in 1996. Small pneumatic and steam units are available from the patent holders for sale or hire for research, academic training and industrial demonstration, as is a book (largely in French) describing the concepts and development of the design. Demonstrations have been undertaken on an Air Gokart in 2004, on “APUQ Air Car” in 2005, on the University of Connecticut “Brash Steam Car” in 2010, and other products (Chainsaw and generator).

The patent holders have announced that they intend to make similar internal combustion prototypes available for demonstration.

In an electrical [[power distribution]] system, a '''ring main unit''' '''(RMU)''' is a factory assembled, metal enclosed set of [[switchgear]] used at the load connection points of a ring-type distribution network.  It includes in one unit two switches that can connect the load to either or both main conductors, and a fusible switch or [[circuit breaker]] and switch that feed a [[distribution transformer]]. &lt;ref name=SS04&gt; Stan Stewart, ''Distribution Switchgear'', [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]], 2004 {{ISBN|0852961073}},pp. 135-138 &lt;/ref&gt; The metal enclosed unit connects to the [[transformer]] either through a bus throat of standardized dimensions, or else through cables and is usually installed outdoors.  Ring main cables enter and leave the cabinet.  This type of switchgear is used for medium-voltage power distribution, from 7200 volts to about 36000 volts. 

The ring main unit was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] and is now widely used in other countries.  In North American distribution practice, often the equivalent of a ring main unit is built into a pad-mounted transformer which integrates switches and [[transformer]] into a single cabinet.

==Categories==
Ring main units can be characterized by their type of [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation]], [[air]], [[oil]] or [[gas]]. The switch used to isolate the transformer can be a fusible switch, or may be a circuit breaker using [[vacuum]] or gas-insulated interrupters.  The unit may also include [[protective relay]]s to operate the circuit breaker on a fault.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}

A '''scarf joint''' (also known as a '''scarph joint''') is a method of joining two members end to end in [[woodworking]] or [[metalworking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1995|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The scarf joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required. It is an alternative to other joints such as the [[butt joint]] and the [[splice joint]] and is often favored over these in [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] because it yields a barely visible glue line.

==The scarf joint in wood==

In woodworking, there are two distinctly different categories of scarf, based on whether the joint has interlocking faces or not. A plain scarf is simply two flat planes meeting on an angle relative to the axis of the stock being joined, and depends entirely on adhesive and/or mechanical fastening (screws, bolts, etc.) for all strength. Hooked, keyed, and nibbed scarfs are some of the many example of interlocking scarfs, offering varying degrees of tensile and compressive strength, though most still depend on mechanical fastening to keep the joint closed.

The plain scarf is not preferred when strength is required, so it is often used in decorative situations, such as the application of trim or moulding. The use of modern high-strength adhesives can greatly increase the structural performance of a plain scarf.

The keyed hook scarf is common in [[ship]] and [[Boat building|boat-building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =280 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as timber framing and wooden bridge construction. In large timbers such as these the scarf is virtually always secured with through bolts, and is frequently reinforced externally with iron or steel [[fishplate]]s, and/or strapping.

A scarf joint may also be used to fix problems caused when a board is cut too short for the application. The board can be cut in half with a tapered cut yielding a scarf joint. When the joint is glued together, the tapers are slid against each other so that the two sections are no longer in line with each other. This has the effect of making the board longer. Once the glue has set, the board can be planed down to an even thickness, resulting in a longer but thinner board.

In traditional [[timber framing]] there are many types of scarf joints used to join timbers.

==Methods==

The joint is formed by cutting opposing tapered ends on each member which are then fitted together. When working with [[wood]], this gives better [[long grain]] to long grain gluing surface, which yields a stronger joint than would be achieved with a simple butt joint. The tapers are generally cut at an angle between 1:8 to 1:10. The ends of a plain scarf are ''feathered'' to a fine point which aids in the obscuring of the joint in the finished work, while in other forms of scarf the ends are frequently cut to a blunt "nib" which engages a matching shoulder in the mating piece.

Where scarfed joints are used in the restoration of vintage aircraft most developed countries will only issue an airworthiness certificate if all such joints have used an angle no less than 1:8.

==Strength==

Determination of the maximum axial force for two pieces joined by adhesive can easily be determined using two equations that can be derived from the geometry of the problem by breaking the axial force component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the scarf joint. Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum axial force are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude of the maximum allowable axial force. The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint.

A '''solid-state transformer''' (SST), '''power electronic transformer''' (PET), or '''electronic power transformer''' is actually an [[AC-to-AC converter]], a type of [[electric power conversion|electric power converter]] that replaces a conventional [[transformer]] used in [[alternating current|AC]] [[electric power distribution]]. It is more complex than a conventional transformer operating at [[utility frequency]], but it can be smaller and more efficient than a conventional transformer because it operates at high frequency. The main types are "true" AC-to-AC converter (with no DC stages) and AC-to-DC-to-DC-to-AC converter (in which an active [[rectifier]] supplies power to a [[DC-to-DC converter]], which supplies power to a [[power inverter]]). A solid-state transformer usually contains a transformer, inside the AC-to-AC converter or DC-to-DC converter, which provides electrical isolation and carries the full power; this transformer is much smaller because it operates at high frequency. A solid-state transformer can actively regulate voltage and current. Some can convert single-phase power to three-phase power and vice-versa. Variations can input or output [[direct current|DC]] power to reduce the number of [[energy transformation|conversions]], for greater end-to-end efficiency. As a complex electronic circuit, it must be designed to withstand lightning and other surges. Solid-state transformer is an emerging technology.

'''Solid fuel''' refers to various forms of [[solid]] material that can be burnt to release energy, providing heat and light through the process of [[combustion]]. Solid fuels can be contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and [[gaseous fuel]]s. Common examples of solid fuels include [[wood fuel|wood]], [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[Hexamine fuel tablet]]s, [[wood pellets]], [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]], and other [[cereal|grains]]. Solid fuels are  extensively used in [[Solid-fuel rocket|rocketry]] as [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/solid.html|title=Solid|website=www.astronautix.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid fuels have been used throughout human history to create fire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120402162548.htm|title=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120402162548.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and solid fuel is still in widespread use throughout the world in the present day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/about/faqs/coal/|title=Coal|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Coal_consumption_statistics|title=Coal consumption statistics - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of solid fuels==

===Wood===
{{Further information|Wood fuel}}
Wood fuel can refer to several fuels such as [[firewood]], [[charcoal]], ''wood chips'' sheets, [[Wood pellets|pellets]], and [[sawdust]]. The particular form used depends upon factors such as source, quantity, quality and application. In many areas, wood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no [[tool]]s in the case of picking up dead wood, or few tools. Today, [[Combustion|burning]] of wood is the largest use of [[energy]] derived from a solid fuel [[biomass]]. Wood fuel can be used for [[cooking]] and [[heating]], and occasionally for fueling [[steam engine]]s and steam [[turbines]] that [[Electricity generation|generate electricity]]. Wood may be used indoors in a furnace, [[Wood-burning stove|stove]], or [[fireplace]], or outdoors in a furnace, [[campfire]], or [[bonfire]]. As with any [[fire]], burning wood fuel creates numerous by-products, some of which may be useful (heat and steam), and others that are undesirable, irritating or dangerous. There is debate as to whether burning wood can be considered carbon neutral, as technically the wood cannot release more carbon than was sequestered during its growth, although this does not take account of other impacts such as deforestation and rotting has on the carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004565359390440G?via=ihub|title=Greenhouse gases from biomass and fossil fuel stoves in developing countries: A Manila pilot study |language=en|access-date=2017-03-09|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(93)90440-G|volume=26|journal=Chemosphere|pages=479–505 | last1 = Smith | first1 = K.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When harvested in a sustainable fashion wood is usually considered to be a renewable solid fuel.&lt;ref name="soliftec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soliftec.com/solidfuels.htm|title=Solid Fuels|date=9 February 2014|publisher=Solid Fuel Technology Institute|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:wood.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Wood is a common example of a solid fuel.|Wood is one of the most commonly used solid fuels.]]

===Biomass===
{{Further information|Biomass}}
Although wood is a form of biomass, the term usually refers to other natural plant material that can be burnt for fuel. Common biomass fuels include waste wheat, straw, nut shells and other fibrous material.&lt;ref name="soliftec.com" /&gt;

===Peat===
{{Further information|Peat}}
Peat fuel is an accumulation of partially [[Decomposition|decayed]] [[vegetation]] or organic matter that can be burnt once sufficiently dried.

=== Coal ===
{{Further information|Coal}}
Coal is a [[combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]] usually occurring in [[Stratum|rock strata]] in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. Coal is the largest source of energy for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]] worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources of [[carbon dioxide]] releases. The extraction of coal, its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with [[Environmental impact of the coal industry|environmental]] and [[Coal worker's pneumoconiosis|health effects]] including [[climate change]]. Variations such as smokeless coal can be formed naturally in the form of [[anthracite]], a [[metamorphosed]] type of coal with a very high carbon content that gives off a smokeless flame when set alight.

=== Coke ===
{{Further information|Coke (fuel)}}
Coke is a fuel with few impurities and a high [[carbon]] content, usually made from [[coal]]. It is the solid [[carbon]]aceous material derived from [[destructive distillation]] of low-ash, low-sulfur [[bituminous coal]]. Cokes made from coal are grey, hard, and [[porous]]. While coke can be formed naturally, the commonly used form is man-made. The form known as [[petroleum coke]], or pet coke, is derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes.&lt;ref name="soliftec.com" /&gt;

=== Municipal waste ===
{{Further information|Municipal solid waste}}
Municipal solid waste commonly known as trash or garbage in the [[American English|United States]] and as rubbish in [[British English|Britain]], is a [[List of waste types|waste type]] consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. With the correct technology it can be gasified and converted to a viable fuel source. However, this is technology heavy and can only be used where the waste is known not to contain toxic materials.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[Wilson and Burgh. (2008). Energizing Our Future: Rational Choices For The 21st   	
Century. New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits/disadvantages of solid fuel==
{{Further information|Environmental impact of the coal industry
}}
Solid fuels, compared to [[liquid fuel]]s or [[gaseous]] fuels, are often cheaper, easier to extract, more stable to transport and in many places are more readily available.&lt;ref name="nwleics.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwleics.gov.uk/files/documents/guide_to_solid_fuels/solid%255Ffuels%252Epdf.pdf|title=The Guide to Solid Fuels|publisher=Solid Fuel Association|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coalproducts.co.uk/guide-solid-fuel|title=Guide To Solid Fuel|publisher=Coal Products Ltd.|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], in particular, is utilized in the generation of 38.1% of the world’s [[electricity]] because it is less expensive and more powerful than its liquid and gas counterparts. However, solid fuels are also heavier to transport, require more destructive methods to extract/burn and often have higher carbon, nitrate and sulphate emissions. With the exception of sustainable wood/biomass solid fuel is normally considered non-renewable as it requires thousands of years to form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21758">'''Superstripes''' is a generic name for a phase with spatial broken symmetry that favors the onset of [[superconducting]] or [[superfluid]] 
quantum order. This scenario emerged in the 1990s when no-homogeneous metallic [[heterostructure]]s at the [[atomic limit]] with a broken [[spatial symmetry]] have been found to favor superconductivity.&lt;ref name="superstripes1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1142/S0217979200003769| title = Superstripes| journal = International Journal of Modern Physics B| volume = 14| issue = 29n31| pages = 3289| year = 2000| last1 = Bianconi | first1 = A.| bibcode = 2000IJMPB..14.3289B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Superstripes2"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/0-306-47113-2_24| chapter = Superstripes| title = Phase Transitions and Self-Organization in Electronic and Molecular Networks| pages = 375| series = Fundamental Materials Research| year = 2002| last1 = Bianconi | first1 = A.| last2 = Di Castro | first2 = D.| last3 = Saini | first3 = N.

The superstripes show multigap superconductivity near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition where the renormalization of chemical potential at the metal-to-superconductor transition is not negligeable and the self-consistent solution of the gaps equation is required. The superstripes lattice scenario is made of puddles of multigap superstripes matter forming a superconducting network where different gaps are not only different in different portions of the [[Reciprocal space|k-space]] but also in different portions of the real space with a complex scale free distribution of [[Josephson junction]]s.

The term ''superstripes'' was introduced in 2000 at the international conference on "Stripes and High T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; Superconductivity" held in Rome to describe the particular phase of matter where a broken symmetry appearing at a transition from a phase with higher dimensionality N (3D or 2D) to a phase with lower dimensionality N-1 (2D or 1D) favors the superconducting or superfluid phase and it could increase the normal to superconducting transition temperature with the possible emergence of [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. The term ''superstripes scenario'' was introduced to make the key difference with the stripes scenario where the phase transition from a phase with higher dimensionality N (like a 2D electron gas) to the phase with broken symmetry and lower dimensionality (like a quasi 1D striped fluid) competes and suppresses the transition temperature to the superfluid phase and favors modulated striped magnetic ordering. In the broken symmetry of superstripes phase the structural modulation coexists and favors high-temperature superconductivity.&lt;ref name="superstripes1"/&gt;

==High-temperature superconductivity in heterostructures at atomic limit==
The prediction of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] transition temperatures is rightly considered to be one of the most difficult problems in theoretical physics. The problem remained elusive for many years since these materials have generally a very complex structure making unuseful theoretical modelling for a homogeneous system. The advances in experimental investigation on local lattice fluctuations have driven the community to the conclusion that it is a problem of quantum physics in complex matter. A growing paradigm for high-temperature superconductivity in superstripes is that a key term is the quantum interference effect between pairing channels, i.e., a resonance in the exchange-like, Josephson-like pair transfer term between different condensates. The quantum configuration interaction between different pairing channels is a particular case of [[shape resonance]] belonging to the group of [[Feshbach–Fano partitioning|Fano Feshbach resonances]] in atomic and nuclear physics. The critical temperature shows a suppression, due to a Fano antiresonance, when the chemical potential is tuned at a band edge where a new Fermi surface spot appears i.e., an "electronic topological transition" (ETT) or 2.5 Lifshitz transition or, a metal-to-metal topological transition. The T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; amplification is switched on when the chemical potential is tuned above the band edge in an energy region away from the band edge of the order of 1 or 2 times the energy cut off of the pairing interaction. The T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is further amplified at the shape resonance if in this range the Fermi surface of the appearing fermi surface spot changes its dimensionality (for example the Lifshitz transition for opening a neck in a tubular Fermi surface).&lt;ref name="Innocenti"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/physrevb.82.184528| title = Resonant and crossover phenomena in a multiband superconductor: Tuning the chemical potential near a band edge| journal = Physical Review B| volume = 82| issue = 18| pages = 184528| year = 2010| last1 = Innocenti | first1 = D. | last2 = Poccia | first2 = N. | last3 = Ricci | first3 = A. | last4 = Valletta | first4 = A. | last5 = Caprara | first5 = S. | last6 = Perali | first6 = A. | last7 = Bianconi | first7 = A. | bibcode = 2010PhRvB..82r4528I|arxiv = 1007.0510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The tuning of the chemical potential at the [[shape resonance]] can be obtained by changing: the charge density and/or the superlattice structural parameters, and/or the superlattice misfit strain and/or the disorder. Direct evidence for shape resonances in superstripes matter is provided by the anomalous variation of the isotope effect on the critical temperature by tuning the chemical potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0953-2048/25/12/124002| title = Anomalous isotope effect near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition in a multi-band multi-condensate superconductor made of a superlattice of stripes| journal = Superconductor Science and Technology| volume = 25| issue = 12| pages = 124002| year = 2012| last1 = Perali | first1 = A. | last2 = Innocenti | first2 = D. | last3 = Valletta | first3 = A. | last4 = Bianconi | first4 = A. | bibcode = 2012SuScT..25l4002P|arxiv = 1209.1528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All new high-temperature superconducting materials discovered in the years 2001–2013 are heterostructures at atomic limit made of the active atomic layers: honeycomb boron layer in diborides, graphene in intercalated graphite, CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atomic bbc monolayers in cobaltates, FeAs atomic fluorite monolayers in pnictides, FeSe atomic fluorite monolayers in selenides.

In these materials the joint effect of (a) increasing the lattice misfit strain to a critical value, and (b) tuning the chemical potential near a Lifshitz transition in presence of electron-electron interactions induce a lattice instability with formation of the network of superconducting striped puddles in an insulating or metallic background.

In 2017, two research groups from ETH Zurich and from MIT reported on the first creation of a supersolid with ultracold quantum gases. The MIT group exposed a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential to light beams that created an effective spin-orbit coupling. The interference between the atoms on the two spin-orbit coupled lattice sites gave rise to a density modulation that establishes a stripe phase with supersolid properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT researchers create new form of matter|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-researchers-create-new-form-matter-0302|website=news.mit.edu|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jun-Ru|last2=Lee|first2=Jeongwon|last3=Huang|first3=Wujie|last4=Burchesky|first4=Sean|last5=Shteynas|first5=Boris|last6=Top|first6=Furkan Çağrı|last7=Jamison|first7=Alan O.|last8=Ketterle|first8=Wolfgang|title=A stripe phase with supersolid properties in spin–orbit-coupled Bose–Einstein condensates|journal=Nature|date=1 March 2017|volume=543|issue=7643|pages=91–94|doi=10.1038/nature21431|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7643/full/nature21431.html|accessdate=4 March 2017|arxiv=1610.08194|bibcode=2017Natur.543...91L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23934">'''Tetrafluoroberyllate''' or '''orthofluoroberyllate''' {{chem|BeF|4|2−}} is an [[Fluoroanion|anion]] containing [[beryllium]] and [[fluorine]].  The ion has a tetrahedral shape, the same size and outer electron structure as [[sulfate]]. Therefore, many compounds that contain sulfate, have equivalents with tetrafluoroberyllate.  Examples of these are the [[Langbeinites]], and [[Tutton's salts]].

==Properties==
The Be–F distance is between 1.45 and 1.53&amp;nbsp;Å. This bond is sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and has a longer length than the sp bond in BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt; In trifluoroberyllates, there are actually BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra arranged in a triangle, so that three fluorine atoms are shared on two tetrahedra each, resulting in a formula of Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simons1954"/&gt;

In the tetrafluoroberyllates the tetrahedra can rotate to various degrees.  At room temperatures they are hindered from moving.  But as temperature increases they can rotate around the three-fold access, with a potential barrier of 12.5&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol.  At higher temperatures the movement can become isotropic with a potential barrier of 14.5&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

Similar formula compounds have magnesium or zinc in a similar position. e.g. K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; but these are not as stable.&lt;ref name="Simons1954"/&gt;

Tetrafluoroberyllate has a biological effect by inhibiting [[F-ATPase]] ATP producing enzymes in [[mitochondria]] and bacteria.  It does this by attempting to react with [[adenosine diphosphate]] because it resembles phosphate.  However once it does this it remains stuck in the F1 part of the enzyme and inhibits it from further function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lunardi|first1=Joel|last2=Dupuis|first2=Alain|last3=Garin|first3=Jerome|last4=Issartel|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Laurent|first5=Michel|last6=Peinnequin|first6=Andre|last7=Vignais|first7=Pierre|title=Fluoroaluminum and Fluoroberyllium Complexes as Probes of the Catalytic Sites of Mitochondrial F1-ATPases|work=Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signal Transduction|date=1992|publisher=UNESCO|pages=59–69|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1CH3BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|isbn=9783034873154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium tetrafluoroberyllate has several crystalline forms.  Below 220&amp;nbsp;°C it takes the same form as orthorhombic olivine, and this is called γ phase. Between 220 and 320 it is in the α' form.  When temperature is raised above 320 it changes to the hexagonal α form.  When cooled the α' form changes to β form at 110° and this can be cooled to 70° before changing back to the γ form.&lt;ref name="Holm1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holm|first=J. L.|author2=K.

Lithium tetrafluoroberyllate takes on the same crystal form as the mineral [[phenacite]]. As a liquid it is proposed for the [[molten salt reactor]], in which it is called [[FLiBe]]. The liquid salt has a high specific heat, similar to that of water. The molten salt has a very similar density to the solid.  The solid has continuous void channels through it, which reduces its density.&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be crystallised from aqueous solution using (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCl.&lt;ref name="Simons1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=J.H.|title=Fluorine Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AbqU4cI93wC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=1964-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323147248|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium tetrafluoroberyllate has the same structure as anhydrous [[potassium sulfate]], as does rubidium and caesium tetrafluoroberyllate. Potassium tetrafluoroberyllate can make solid solutions with potassium sulfate.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt; It can be used as a starting point to make the non-linear optic crystal KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which has the highest power handling capacity and shortest UV performance of any borate.&lt;ref name="Karas2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karas|first=George V.|title=New Developments in Crystal Growth Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjpWUwI7VSgC&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781594545399|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite soluble in water, so beryllium can be extracted from soil this in this form.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cosmolab/chem/fusionmethod.pdf|title=Extraction ofBeryllium-10 from Soil by Fusion|last=Stone|first=John|date=May 2004|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate decomposes on heating by losing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F vapour, progressively forming NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;BeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, then NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and finally BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

Thallium tetrafluoroberyllate can be made by dissolving [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[thallium carbonate]] together in [[hydrofluoric acid]] and then evaporating the solution.&lt;ref name="daSilva2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=da Silva|first=Iván|author2=Cristina González-Silgo |author3=Javier González-Platas |author4=Juan Rodríguez-Carvajal |author5=María Luisa Martínez-Sarrión |author6=Lourdes Mestres |year=2005|title=Powder neutron diffraction of Tl2BeF4at six temperatures from room temperature to 1.5 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section C|volume=61|issue=12|pages=i113–i116|issn=0108-2701|doi=10.1107/S010827010503249X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radium tetrafluoroberyllate is used as a standard neutron source.  The [[alpha particle]]s from the [[radium]] cause [[neutron]]s to be emitted from the beryllium. It is precipitated from a [[radium chloride]] solution mixed with potassium tetrafluoroberyllate.&lt;ref name="Simons1954"/&gt;

Magnesium tetrafluoroberyllate can be precipitated from a hot saturated solution of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate and a magnesium salt.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt; However, if the temperature reaches boiling point MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is precipitated instead.&lt;ref name="Walsh2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Kenneth A.|title=Beryllium Chemistry and Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-GbhmSfyeYC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=2009-01-01|publisher=ASM International|isbn=9780871707215|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium tetrafluoroberyllate resembles [[zircon]] in the way it melts and crystallises.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

Strontium tetrafluoroberyllate can be made in several forms. The Ύ is produced by cooling a melt of SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the β from is made by precipitating from a water solution. When melted and heated to 850-1145° Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas evaporates leaving behind molten SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

The barium tetrafluoroberyllate is very insoluble and can be used for [[gravimetric analysis]] of beryllium.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an acid that can be produced from Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and HCl. It only exists dissolved in water.&lt;ref name="EmeléusSharpe1972"/&gt;

==Double salts==

The equivalent of alums are hard to make because the trivalent ion will often form a complex with fluoride in preference to the beryllium fluoride. However the violet coloured acid and rubidium chrome alum exist at chilly temperatures for a few hours.&lt;ref name="GhoshCh1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Amiya Kanti|year=1959|title=Complex Chromic Fluoberyllates.

Tutton's salts containing magnesium with fluoroberyllate are difficult to produce, as the solutions tend to precipitate insoluble [[magnesium fluoride|MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Raytu1936"/&gt;

'''''The River''''' is a 1938 short [[documentary film]] which shows the importance of the [[Mississippi River]] to the [[United States]], and how farming and timber practices had caused topsoil to be swept down the river and into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], leading to catastrophic floods and impoverishing farmers. It ends by briefly describing how the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] project was beginning to reverse these problems.

It was written and directed by [[Pare Lorentz]] and, like Lorentz's earlier documentary ''[[The Plow That Broke the Plains]]'', was also selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", going into the registry in 1990. The film won the "best documentary" category at the 1938 [[Venice International Film Festival]].

Both films have notable scores by [[Virgil Thomson]] that are still heard as concert [[Suite (music)|suites]], featuring an adaptation of the hymn "[[How Firm a Foundation (hymn)|How Firm a Foundation]]". The film was narrated by the American baritone [[Thomas Hardie Chalmers]].  Thomson's score was heavily adapted from his own concert work ''[[Symphony on a Hymn Tune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=THOMSON, V.: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 / Symphony on a Hymn Tune |year=2000  |url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559022&amp;catNum=559022&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English |first1=Marina |last1=Ledin | last2=Ledin|first2=Victor |format=CD liner note |publisher=[[Naxos Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The River'' later served as the score for the 1983 TV movie ''[[The Day After]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stuever |first=Hank |authorlink=Hank Stuever |title='Convincing catastrophe': What The Post's TV critic wrote about 'The Day After' in 1983 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 11, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/05/11/convincing-catastrophe-what-the-posts-tv-critic-wrote-about-the-day-after-in-1983/ |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two films were sponsored by the U.S. government and specifically the [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA) to raise awareness about the [[New Deal]]. The RA was folded into the [[Farm Security Administration]] in 1937, so ''The River'' was officially an FSA production.

There is also a companion book, ''The River''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Thomas H. Stoner Jr.''' is an energy entrepreneur and writer. He has been a promoter of [[sustainable development]] for over 30&amp;nbsp;years, having built, financed, and owned and operated renewable energy projects throughout the [[Americas]]. He has led three companies in the [[clean technology]] space, including one of the original CleanTech venture funds backed by the international development banks, including the [[Multilateral Investment Fund]] (MIF), a division of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]]. In 2011, with the aid of David Schimel of the [[Jet Propulsion Lab]] (NASA) and other leading climate figures, Stoner founded Project Butterfly, a research organization that primarily advocates for the global capital markets as being a solution to climate change. In 2013, Stoner released “[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150142/http://smallchangebiggains.proj-butterfly.com/ Small Change, Big Gains: Reflections of an Energy Entrepreneur],” which contains research about transforming the global energy supply to be more reliant upon sustainable fuel sources by the end of the century.

Stoner is currently the CEO of [http://www.entelligent.com Entelligent], a provider of Smart Climate indices, predictive equity portfolio analytics, and advanced data.

== Education and personal life ==

Stoner received his Masters in [[Accounting]] &amp; [[Finance]] from the [[London School of Economics]] and a BA from [[Hampshire College]], Amherst, Massachusetts.
In 1988 he married Laurie Larsen; together they have two children.

Project Butterfly was founded in 2010 and is a collaboration among scientists, business leaders, and the global community to address the threats posed by [[climate change]], and researching opportunities that exist in mitigating it. The initiative, started by Stoner, brought together individuals from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[NASA]], the [[National Renewable Energy Lab]] (NREL), the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. The research and climate modeling performed under Project Butterfly led to the book “Small Change, Big Gains: Reflections of an Energy Entrepreneur”.

The '''Voie Sacrée wind farm''' is a wind farme located in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of [[France]]. 

It is shared between the cities of [[Beausite]], [[Raival]], Courcelles-sur-aire, Érize-la-petite, and Maurechamp, not far from the [[Voie Sacrée]]. The onshore wind farm was proposed and installed in 2007, and today contains 27 [[Gamesa]] G90/2000 wind turbines, each with a hub height of 78 meters and diameter of 90 meters. Individually, each of the Voie Sacrée [[wind turbines]] has a rated capacity of 2,000&amp;nbsp;kW, for a total capacity of 54,000&amp;nbsp;kW for the wind farm. 

In 2013, the power contribution from the Voie Sacrée wind farm accounted for approximately 0.65% of the total [[wind power in France]] (8,254 MW). The wind farm developer is SFE Française d’Eoliennes and the farm is currently owned and operated by Sorgenia France. Voie Sacrée is a contributor to French wind power Zone 55.

[[File:1947 winter troops clear rails.JPG|thumb|right|250px|British Army troops clearing snow from a [[Cutting (transportation)|railway cutting]]]]

The '''winter of 1946–47''' was a harsh European winter noted for its impact in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in economic terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.

Beginning on 21 January 1947, the UK experienced several cold spells that brought large [[Snowdrift|drifts of snow]] to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal to the electric [[power station]]s. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to nineteen hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, on top of the low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]], [[Manny Shinwell|Emanuel Shinwell]], became a [[scapegoat]]; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.

Mid-March brought warmer air to the country which [[Thaw (weather)|thawed]] the snow lying on the ground. This [[snowmelt]] rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the [[British Army]] and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10% per cent of the year's industrial production, 10 to 20% of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]]; on top of other factors. That winter is also cited as a factor in the [[devaluation]] of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80 and the introduction of the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in [[Berlin]], civil disorder in [[the Netherlands]] and business closures in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Fuel shortage ==
[[File:Emanuel Shinwel HU 059765.jpg|thumb|left|Emanuel Shinwell]]

The effects of the cold winter were exacerbated by problems in the [[Energy industry|energy sector]] which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and placed under the control of the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]], [[Manny Shinwell]]. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war.&lt;ref name="burroughs58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burroughs|1997|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM).&lt;ref name="middlemas"&gt;{{Harvnb|Middlemas|1990|p=548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period.&lt;ref name="middlemas"/&gt; The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy [[Electric heating#Convection heaters|electric fires]] to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity&amp;nbsp;– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity.&lt;ref name="burroughs58"/&gt; Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== January ===
The winter began with two periods of cold weather in December 1946 and January 1947, but the coldest period did not begin until 21&amp;nbsp;January 1947. The main cause of the cold weather was an [[anti-cyclone]] which sat over [[Scandinavia]] from 20&amp;nbsp;January. This [[high-pressure area]] blocked the progression of [[Low-pressure area|depressions]] across the Atlantic Ocean and forced them to the south of the United Kingdom, resulting in strong easterly winds which brought snow to eastern and south-eastern England before progressing across the entire country. This cold spell continued and by 30&amp;nbsp;January the [[Isles of Scilly]] were under {{Convert|7|inch|m|2}} of snow and the overnight temperature at [[Writtle]], Essex, was {{Convert|&amp;minus;20|C|F|0}}. Throughout January the highest recorded temperature in England and Wales was {{Convert|14|C|F|0}} and the minimum was {{Convert|&amp;minus;21|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Met Office   | author-link = Met Office  | title = The winter of 1946/47  | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/winter1946-47.html   | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091210010121/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/winter1946-47.html   | dead-url = yes   | archive-date = 10 December 2009   |accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== February ===
[[File:Metoffice 3 feb 47.jpg|thumb|Low pressure over the UK on 3&amp;nbsp;February]]
The easterly winds continued into February, which developed into one of the coldest months on record. At [[Kew Observatory]] there was no recorded temperature above {{Convert|5|C|F|0}} for the month and only twice was the overnight temperature above {{Convert|0|C|F|0}}.  No sunshine at all was recorded at Kew for twenty days from 2&amp;nbsp;February,&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; whilst across England and Wales the month was the second-dullest February since records began in 1929, with only 30.8 hours of sunshine or 1.1 per day.&lt;ref&gt;Met Office; [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/datasets/Sunshine/ranked/England_and_Wales.txt Monthly ranked England and Wales sunshine]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, West Scotland was near-record dry and unusually sunny,&lt;ref&gt;Met Office; [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/f/2/British_Rainfall_1947.pdf Symon's British rainfall, 1947], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; though still extremely cold. On 20&amp;nbsp;February the ferry service across the [[English Channel]] between [[Dover]] and [[Ostend]] was suspended due to [[pack ice]] off the Belgian coast.&lt;ref name="simons"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Simons  | first = Paul  | author-link =   | title =  Heavy Weather – Winter 1947 | newspaper = The Times , Times 2 Magazine  | pages = 11  | date = 1 October 2008  | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4855319.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places snow fell on 26 days out of 28 in the month and a temperature of {{Convert|&amp;minus;21|C|F|0}} was recorded at [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]], Bedfordshire, on 25&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; As a result, railways were badly affected by drifts of light powdery snow and three hundred main roads were made unusable.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marr34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several hundred villages were cut off.&lt;ref name="wainwright"&gt;{{Citation  | last =  Wainwright | first = Martin  | author-link =   |  title = The great floods of 1947  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 25 July 2007  | url =https://www.theguardian.com/weather/Story/0,,2134122,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drift ice|Ice floes]] were also seen off the coast of [[East Anglia]], causing a hazard to shipping.&lt;ref name="marr34"/&gt;

This cold weather exacerbated the fuel problem. Stockpiles of coal at the pits and depots froze solid and could not be moved.&lt;ref name="marr34"/&gt; The snow also trapped 750,000 railway [[Railroad car|wagons]] of coal and made roads unusable, further hampering transport.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; A force of 100,000 [[British Army|British]] and [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish troops]] and German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were put to work clearing snow from the railways by hand,&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; while desperate attempts were made to get fuel to power stations by [[Collier (ship)|coal-carrying ships]] which risked storms, fog and ice to reach their destinations.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; Despite such expedients, lack of fuel forced many power stations to shut down or reduce their output.&lt;ref name="marr34"/&gt; The [[Royal Navy]] launched [[Operation Blackcurrant]], which used diesel generators aboard submarines to provide supplementary power to coastal towns and dockyards.

Shinwell acted to reduce consumption of coal by cutting the electricity supply to industry completely and reducing the domestic supply to 19 hours per day across the country.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Citation  | author-link =   | title =  Panorama by Candlelight | newspaper = Time Magazine  | date = 24 February 1947 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801819-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; In consequence factories across the country were forced to shut and up to four million people claimed [[unemployment benefits]].&lt;ref name="marr34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weatheronline"&gt;{{Citation|last=Eden |first=Philip |author-link= |title=The big freeze of 1947 |date=26 January 2007 |publisher=WeatherOnline Ltd (archived) |url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/feature/2007/01/26_ne.htm |accessdate=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213172052/http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/feature/2007/01/26_ne.htm |archivedate=13 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although so many people were made redundant there was little unrest and no major public disorders.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published, and newspapers were cut in size to four pages or one sheet.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|Food rations]], still in use from the Second World War, were cut to levels lower than in the war years.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; These measures made little difference to the rate of coal consumption but served to reduce public morale.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt;

Despite Shinwell's actions the fuel supply remained insufficient and [[Power outage|blackouts]] occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even the staff at [[Buckingham Palace]], the [[Houses of Parliament]] and London's [[Central Electricity Board]] to work by candlelight.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weatheronline"/&gt; A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The public was reduced to queuing at [[gasworks]] to collect [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for use as fuel.&lt;ref name="wainwright"/&gt; Supplies of [[aspirin]] also ran low as it was then a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in [[Tooting]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27&amp;nbsp;February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

During this period there was a fear that, despite the rationing, food supplies could run out owing to the effects of the cold on vegetables, livestock and delivery vehicles. In response, the government started a largely unsuccessful campaign to popularise [[Thyrsites atun|Snoek]], an inexpensive South African variety of fish; the public found the fish unpalatable and its stocks were eventually used as cat food.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; Many winter root vegetables could not be harvested as they were frozen into the ground, and in some areas [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drills]] were used to excavate them.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; Frost destroyed {{Convert|70,000|LT|t}} of potatoes and, as a result, potatoes were rationed for the first time.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt;

=== March ===
[[File:Metoffice 10 mar 47.jpg|thumb|Milder air moving over the UK on 10&amp;nbsp;March]]

On 4–5&amp;nbsp;March came heavy snow which left [[Snowdrift|drifts]] across much of the country with some lying {{Convert|7|m|ft}} deep in the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; On 5&amp;nbsp;March one of the worst British [[blizzard]]s of the 20th century occurred.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; Food supplies were again affected by the snow-bound roads and in some places the police requested permission to break into delivery lorries stranded by the snow.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt;

On 10&amp;nbsp;March milder air of {{Convert|7|–|10|C|F|0}} began to move north across the country from the south-west, rapidly thawing the snow lying on low ground.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; However, after such a long frost the ground stayed frozen. The frozen ground caused much [[surface run off]] which resulted in widespread flooding. Further heavy snowfalls occurred as the milder air pushed northwards. On 14&amp;nbsp;March the deepest ever recorded depth of snow lying in an inhabited location of the UK was measured at [[Forest-in-Teesdale]] in County Durham at {{Convert|83|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eden|first1=Philip|title=Snow Britain: Wrong kind of snow strikes again|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/4434770/Snow-Britain-Wrong-kind-of-snow-strikes-again.html|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;March a deepening depression moved in from the Atlantic, bringing heavy rain and gales.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; It was the start of the wettest March for 300 years.&lt;ref name="weatheronline"/&gt; By 16&amp;nbsp;March winds reached {{Convert|50|kn|km/h|sigfig=1}} with {{Convert|90|kn|km/h|sigfig=2|adj=on}} gusts, causing breaches in [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] in East Anglia that resulted in the flooding of {{Convert|100|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of land,&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; and blowing many trees down. The rivers [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Lea|Lea]] [[1947 Thames flood|flooded in London]], causing the [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] borough engineer Geoffrey Baker to remark: "We could only cope if we had a spare Thames, or two."&lt;ref name="wainwright"/&gt;

Large parts of the city and surrounding areas were flooded, in which 9,000 properties and nearly a hundred industrial premises were affected&amp;nbsp;– some to first-floor height. The suburbs of [[Long Eaton]], [[West Bridgford]] and [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] suffered particularly badly.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ea1947&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/110160.aspx|title=Nottingham Left Bank Scheme|publisher=Environment Agency | accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RMS&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.rms.com/Publications/1947_UKRiverFloods.pdf |title=1947 U.K. River Floods: 60-Year Retrospective |publisher=rms.com | accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, in the lower tidal reaches of the river, the peak of the flood combined with a high [[spring tide]] to flood villages and 2,000 properties in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]].

== Legacy ==
The winter had a lasting effect on Britain's industry; by February 1947 it was already estimated that that year's industrial output would be down by 10&amp;nbsp;per cent.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The effects of the March floods added a further £250–375 million (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.250|1947|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=2}}}}–{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.375|1947|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=2}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} in damage.&lt;ref name="wainwright"/&gt; Farming was particularly badly hit with cereal and potato harvests down 10&amp;nbsp;to 20&amp;nbsp;per cent on the previous two years. Sheep farmers lost one quarter of their flocks and it would be six years before sheep numbers recovered.&lt;ref name="weatheronline"/&gt;

In Wales a disaster fund of £4,575,000 was partly allocated to assist farmers who lost about 4 million sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2012) pp 46, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The winter had political ramifications and caused the public to lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist [[Manny Shinwell]] was in charge of the coal supply. He repeatedly denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. The cabinet had to take control away from him and he became the scapegoat.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''The people's peace: British history, 1945-1990'' (1992) pp 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youngs et al. conclude that, "Probably more than anything else, the fuel crisis of 1947 led to a loss of public confidence in the Labour government."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic A. Youngs Jr, et al. ''The English Heritage - Vol. 2'' (1999) 2:425.&lt;/ref&gt;  Labour lost a large number of seats to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] but retained a slim majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 election]].&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt;

The effects of the winter came at a time of heavy government spending with 15&amp;nbsp;per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new [[National Health Service]] and post-war reconstruction.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods official exchange rate]] from $4.03 to $2.80.&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the [[Marshall Plan]] for assistance to Britain and the [[Continental Europe|continent]].&lt;ref name="simons"/&gt; In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia.&lt;ref name="morrison"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Morrison| first = Richard  | author-link =   | title =  Eerie, serene and unreal – a shivery vista that stirs old memories | newspaper = The Times , Times 2 Magazine  | pages = 3  | date = 3 February 2009  | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winter as a whole was less cold than the [[winter of 1963]] but more snow was recorded.&lt;ref name="weatheronline"/&gt;

== Outside the United Kingdom ==

The winter affected many other European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls were seen in much of Central Europe and the southern [[Baltic region]]. [[De Bilt]], near [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the [[anticyclone]] to the north of the United Kingdom, several incoming Atlantic depressions which would otherwise have hit Britain tracked south to the [[Mediterranean region]], resulting in Portugal, Spain, and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at [[Gibraltar]] was {{Convert|9.3|in|mm|sigfig=2}}, three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north and much rain in the south.&lt;ref name="weatheronline"/&gt; The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It caused schools in the Netherlands to be closed, led to a mob attack on a [[goods train]] carrying coal in [[Copenhagen]], and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

[[File:RCA Dimensia wood grain veneer cabinet.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Wood veneer [[RCA Dimensia]] console TV set]]
In [[woodworking]], '''veneer''' refers to thin slices of wood, usually thinner than 3&amp;nbsp;mm (1/8 inch),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DK Publishing|title=Woodwork: A Step-by-Step Photographic Guide to Successful Woodworking|date=2010|publisher=Penguin|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically are [[glue]]d onto core panels (typically, [[wood]], [[particle board]] or [[medium-density fiberboard]]) to produce flat panels such as doors, tops and panels for [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]], [[parquetry|parquet]] [[flooring|floors]] and parts of [[furniture]]. They are also used in [[marquetry]]. [[Plywood]] consists of three or more layers of veneer. Normally, each is glued with its [[wood grain|grain]] at right angles to adjacent layers for strength. Veneer [[bead (woodworking)|beading]] is a thin layer of decorative edging placed around objects, such as jewelry boxes. Veneer is also used to replace decorative papers in Wood Veneer HPL.  Veneer is also a type of manufactured board.

Veneer is obtained either by "peeling" the trunk of a tree or by slicing large rectangular blocks of wood known as [[flitch (wood)|flitches]]. The appearance of the [[grain (wood)|grain]] and [[figure (wood)|figure]] in wood comes from slicing through the [[growth rings]] of a tree and depends upon the angle at which the wood is sliced. There are three main types of veneer-making equipment used commercially:
* A rotary [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] in which the wood is turned against a very sharp blade and peeled off in one continuous or semi-continuous roll. Rotary-cut veneer is mainly used for plywood, as the appearance is not desirable because the veneer is cut concentric to the growth rings.
* A slicing machine in which the flitch or piece of log is raised and lowered against the blade and slices of the log are made. This yields veneer that looks like sawn pieces of wood, cut across the growth rings; such veneer is referred to as "crown cut".
* A half-round lathe in which the log or piece of log can be turned and moved in such a way as to expose the most interesting parts of the grain, creating a more textured feel and appearance; such veneer is commonly referred to as "rift cut."

Each slicing processes gives a very distinctive type of grain, depending upon the tree species. In any of the veneer-slicing methods, when the veneer is sliced, a distortion of the grain occurs. As it hits the wood, the knife blade creates a "loose" side where the cells have been opened up by the blade, and a "tight" side.

Historically veneers were also [[saw]]n, but this is more wasteful of wood. Veneering is an ancient art, dating back to at least the [[ancient Egyptians]] who used expensive and rare wood veneers over cheaper timbers to produce their [[furniture]] and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonkeedonkeexljoinery.co.uk/doors-general-information/what-is-a-wood-veneer/|title=What is a wood veneer?|website=www.wonkeedonkeexljoinery.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Roman Empire, Romans also used veneered work in mass quantities.&lt;ref name=Woodworking&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Nancy|title=Woodworking|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=782–784|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTUXAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA782&amp;pg=PA782#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 November 2015|isbn=978-1-285-70050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Producing wood veneers ==
The finest and rarest logs are sent to companies that produce veneer. The advantage to this practice is twofold. First, it provides the most financial gain to the owner of the log. Secondly, and of more importance to the woodworker, it greatly expands the amount of usable wood. While a log used for solid lumber is cut into thick pieces, usually no thinner than 1/8 of an inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm), veneers are cut as thin as 1/40 of an inch (0.6&amp;nbsp;mm). Depending on the cutting process used by the veneer manufacturer, very little wood is wasted by the saw blade thickness, known as the saw kerf. Accordingly, the yield of a rare grain pattern or wood type is greatly increased, in turn placing less stress on the resource. Some manufacturers even use a very wide knife to "slice off" the thin veneer pieces. In this way, none of the wood is wasted. The slices of veneer are always kept in the order in which they are cut from the log and are often sold this way.

== Types of veneers ==
There are a few types of veneers available, each serving a particular purpose.
* '''Raw''' veneer has no backing on it and can be used with either side facing up. It is important to note that the two sides will appear different when a finish has been applied, due to the cell structure of the wood.
* '''Paper backed ''' veneer is as the name suggests, veneers that are backed with paper. The advantage to this is it is available in large sizes, or sheets, as smaller pieces are joined together prior to adding the backing. This is helpful for users that do not wish to join smaller pieces of raw veneers together. This is also helpful when veneering curves and columns as the veneer is less likely to crack.
* '''Phenolic backed''' veneer is less common and is used for composite, or artificial wood veneers. Due to concern for the natural resource, this is becoming more popular. It too has the advantage of being available in sheets, and is also less likely to crack when being used on curves.
* '''Laid up''' veneer is raw veneer that has been joined together to make larger pieces. The process is time-consuming and requires great care, but is not difficult and requires no expensive tools or machinery. Veneers can be ordered through some companies already laid up to any size, shape or design.
* '''Reconstituted veneer''' is made from fast-growing tropical species. Raw veneer is cut from a log, and dyed if necessary. Once dyed, the sheets are laminated together to form a block. The block is then sliced so that the edges of the laminated veneer become the “grain” of the reconstituted veneer.
* '''Wood on Wood''' Also called 2-ply is a decorative wood veneer face with a utility grade wood backer applied at an opposing direction to the face veneer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oakwoodveneer.com/tips/glossary1.html|title=Glossary of Wood Veneer Terms|website=oakwoodveneer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of using veneers ==
Compared to wood, one of the primary advantages of using veneer is stability.  While solid wood can be prone to warping and splitting, because veneer is made of thin layers of wood glued together, the chances of splitting or cracking are reduced. Further, the glue used provides additional strength, making the end result stronger than natural wood.

Some projects built using wood veneer would not be possible to construct using solid lumber, owing to expansion and contraction caused by fluctuation of temperature and humidity.  Another advantage of veneer is [[sustainability]]—furniture made with wood veneer uses less wood than the same piece of furniture made with solid wood.  Further, veneer may also be more readily available than solid wood as exotic hardwood lumber can be scarce and very expensive.

== Ecological characteristics ==
* Recyclability and renewability:  Wood has the least impact on total energy use, greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, solid waste and ecological resource use. Seventy percent less energy is required in the use of wood compared with any other building materials.
* Sustainability: Using veneer extends the use of a piece of timber. The wood that might be used in one solid piece a few visible cm wide can cover a far greater area when used as a veneer.
* Toxicity: Nontoxic; veneer stores carbon and also maximises the use of harvested wood.

== Buying veneers ==
Wood veneers are typically sold by the square foot. With the ability to join veneers, even small pieces are usable, resulting in very little waste.
Many sources sell small packets of veneers that are sequence matched and are ideal for small projects. These make experimenting and practicing much more economical. It is also possible to buy plywood and other substrates with veneered faces for larger projects consisting of casework.
