'''28 Liberty Street''',&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Keiko, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-landmark-office-tower-in-lower-manhattan-reimagined-1426122301 "A Landmark Office Tower in Lower Manhattan Reimagined" (subscription)], ''Wall Street Journal'', March 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as '''One Chase Manhattan Plaza''', is a banking [[skyscraper]] located in the downtown Manhattan [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[New York City]], between Pine, Liberty, Nassau, and William Streets. Construction on the building was completed in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.som.com/projects/chase_manhattan_bank_tower_and_plaza SOM.com], Completion date&lt;/ref&gt; It has 60 floors, with 5 basement floors, and is 248 meters (813&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, making it the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|26th tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|43rd tallest in the United States]], and the 200th tallest building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com Emporis.com], Design Specs&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] president of that time, [[David Rockefeller]], the late patriarch of the [[Rockefeller family]], was the prime mover of the construction and the building's location, notably because many corporations had moved uptown, and the Financial District had languished as a result. It was begun in 1956 and completed in 1961.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;Morris, Keiko, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/downtown-tower-gets-a-symbolic-new-name-1421026854 "Downtown Tower Gets a Symbolic New Name" (subscription)], ''Wall Street Journal'', January 11, 2015. Retrieved 2017-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chase Manhattan Plaza is shaped like "an enormous steel-framed rectangle". The {{convert|813|ft|m|abbr=on}} building has about {{convert|1800000|sqft|m2}} of aboveground floor area. Another {{convert|600,000|ft2|m2}} in the basements contains "a truck entrance, mechanical equipment rooms, vaults, a &amp;#91;[[Chase (bank)|Chase]]&amp;#93; branch bank, and a cafeteria". There are [[aluminum]] panels—chosen for their durability and performance—as well as [[mullions]] and [[Column (architecture)|column]] cladding on the facade. The columns are about {{convert|3|by|5|ft|m}} thick and are about {{convert|29|ft|m}} apart from each other. The columns extend from the building on its long sides. The floors [[cantilever]] on the columns on the building's short sides.&lt;ref name=greatbuildings.com&gt;[[Carole Herselle Krinsky|Krinsky, Carole Herselle]], ''[http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Chase_Manhattan_Bank.html Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]'' (New York: The Architectural History Foundation, 1988) excerpt (pp. 72-74, 76) at ''greatbuildings.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Landmarks Preservation Commission designated One Chase Manhattan Plaza a landmark in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/ChaseManhattanReport.pdf "One Chase Manhattan Plaza (aka  16-48  Liberty  Street,  26-40  Nassau  Street,  28-44  Pine Street,  55-77  William  Street)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204916/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/ChaseManhattanReport.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Landmarks Preservation Commission, February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2013, JPMorgan sold the building to Fosun, a [[China|Chinese]] investment company, for $725 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=David M. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-18/jpmorgan-selling-chase-manhattan-plaza-in-nyc-to-china-s-fosun.html |title=JPMorgan Sells Chase Manhattan Plaza in NYC to China’s Fosun |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fosun rebranded One Chase Manhattan Plaza as '''28 Liberty Street''' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Bindelglass, Evan, [http://www.yimbynews.com/2015/05/landmarks-wants-re-think-of-re-development-at-28-liberty-street.html "Landmarks Wants Re-Think of Re-Development At 28 Liberty Street"], ''New York YIMBY'', May 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new name refers to the east-west street on which the building sits but also connects to the Statue of Liberty in the distance and to "the good fortune that, according to Chinese tradition, is bound up in the number 8 [and] 28 denotes 'double prosperity'".&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

The terms '''acid egg''' and '''montejus''' (or '''monte-jus''') are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to a device with no moving parts formerly used instead of a pump in order to transfer difficult liquids.&lt;ref name=Schaschke&gt;Carl Schaschke (2014) ''Dictionary of Chemical Engineering'' (Oxford University Press) p 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Killeffer&gt;D. H. Killeffer (1924) ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'' Vol. 16, No. 8 pp 785&amp;ndash;8 “Tools of the Chemical Engineer”&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow.  When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity.  It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an ''air displacement pump'' or ''intermittent gas-lift pump'', and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.&lt;ref name=Shell&gt;R. J. Forbes &amp; D. R. O'Beirne (1957) ''The Technical Development of the Royal Dutch/Shell: 1890-1940'' p233&lt;/ref&gt;
Its use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.

==Acid Egg==
This was specifically devised to deal with the highly corrosive [[sulfuric acid]], but was extended to other corrosive substances. It was traditionally made of ceramic (to be corrosion resistant) and spherical in shape (to withstand the pressure) thus giving its name.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;''Miriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
A cylindrical version (with hemispherical ends) was described by Swindin, being 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet long, holding 40 cubic feet of acid.&lt;ref name=Swindin&gt;Swindin, N., (1922) ''Pumps in Chemical Engineering'' (Benn, London) pp 48&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;
In principle, the vessel is part filled with liquid, which is then expelled by pumping in compressed air.  The liquid outlet is via a pipe from the top going down almost to the bottom of the vessel.  When the acid egg is emptied, connections to the compressor and the delivery pipe are closed by valves, the air pressure is vented and the vessel refilled with acid.  The cycle can then start again.&lt;ref name=Swindin/&gt;

==Montejus==
A French invention used in [[Sugar#Production|sugar production]] to move the partially processed sugar liquid up a pipe to the next stage of purification.  Hence the name “monte-jus” or “raise juice”. Unlike the acid egg, it traditionally consists of a vertical cylindrical vessel made of steel, with a pipe from the bottom turned upwards, and it is pressurized by steam.&lt;ref name=SciAm1868Ap24&gt;[[Scientific American]], April 24, 1869 pp 261&amp;ndash;2, “Beet Root Sugar part V”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family===
The House of [[Thurn und Taxis]] is a German family whose fortune derives from the appointment of an ancestor, Leonhard von Taxis, as hereditary [[postmaster general]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1595.&lt;ref name="ghda"/&gt; Albert's father preceded him as the [[House of Thurn and Taxis line of succession|head of this family]], which has several branches.&lt;ref name="ghda"/&gt; The family of Thurn und Taxis remains well known as owners of breweries&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thurnundtaxisbiere.de&lt;/ref&gt; and former builders of castles.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt;

His father, [[Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Johannes Erbprinz von Thurn und Taxis, By Academy of Achievement|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/johannes-erbprinz-von-thurn-und-taxis/id439163091?mt=2 |publisher=''iTunes Preview'' |date=2011 |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an internationally renowned [[Flâneur|''boulevardier'']], died in 1990 when he was seven years old, leaving Albert to inherit a US$3 billion fortune and US$500 million in debts.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt; His mother, [[Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis|Gloria]] (''née'' Countess von [[House of Schönburg#Counts of Schönburg-Glauchau (1700)|Schönburg-Glauchau]]), a popular media figure since marriage to his 53-year-old father as a 20-year-old, was instrumental in preserving the family fortune until Albert became of legal age to take over its management.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt; He has two older sisters: [[Princess Maria Theresia of Thurn and Taxis (b. 1980)|Princess Maria Theresia]] and [[Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis|Princess Elisabeth]].&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt;

===Education===
Thurn und Taxis completed his high school education in Rome and then, after his military service, he studied economics and theology at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. 

===Media attention===
[[File:Albert Thurn Und Taxis 20080629 Norisring 660x990.jpg|thumb|Prince Albert in 2008]]
In 2008 Albert was included as 11th on the list of the Forbes Magazine's List of The 20 Hottest Young Royals as compiled by ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

===Motorsport===
He is an enthusiastic racing driver, vice-champion (2007/2008) and champion (2010) of the German GT Championship [[ADAC GT Masters]] with the German Team [[Reiter Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adac-gt-masters.de/uk/fahrerportrait-2011/albert-von-thurn-und-taxis-1635/&lt;/ref&gt;

He embarked on a career in rallying in 2009, competing in the [[European Rally Championship]] since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ewrc-results.com/profile/12891-albert-von-thurn-und-taxis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles, styles and honours==
Since former hereditary titles are only recognised in [[German law]] as part of the surname, in accordance with the [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919, family members include the title as an integral part of their name in the form, ''Prinz von Thurn und Taxis''. According to family tradition Albert Prinz von Thurn und Taxis followed his father, in accordance with the rules of the legal affairs committee of the Association of German Nobility (''[[:de:Deutscher Adelsrechtsausschuß|Deutscher Adelsrechtsausschuß]]''), in the nominal succession as "head" of the former German princely House of [[Thurn and Taxis]]. As such, he is sometimes styled by the traditional title, ''[[Fürst]] von Thurn und Taxis'' (Prince of Thurn and Taxis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">The '''authorized capital''' of a company (sometimes referred to as the authorized share capital, registered capital or nominal capital, particularly in the United States) is the maximum amount of share capital that the company is authorized by its constitutional documents to issue (allocate) to shareholders. Part of the authorized capital can (and frequently does) remain unissued. The authorized capital can be changed with [[shareholder]]s' approval. The part of the authorized capital which has been issued to shareholders is referred to as the [[issued share capital]] of the company.

The device of the authorized capital is used to limit or control the ability of the directors to issue or allot new shares, which may have consequences in the control of a company or otherwise alter the balance of control between shareholders. Such an issue of shares to new shareholders may also shift the profit distribution balance, for example if new shares are issued at face value and not at market value.

The requirement for a company to have a set authorized capital was abolished in Australia in 2001, and in the United Kingdom, it was abolished under the Companies Act 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 2006, note 843 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/notes/division/10/17/2 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The business model of this company usually involves sending promotional email to invite attendees and speakers, at the same time, registration fee will be provided based on different levels of speakers in relevant fields. Unlike traditional model of scientific congresses in which abstracts are usually submitted and [[peer reviewed]] before being accepted for presentation, speakers are guaranteed a speaking role as long as the attendance fees are paid. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Warpedtourpass.jpg|thumb|203px|Warped Tour 2006 All Access Pass]]
A '''backstage pass''' is an employee pass which allows its bearer access to employees-only areas at a performance venue. They are most commonly associated with [[rock music]] groups.

Such passes are usually a laminated paper worn on a lanyard, or on chain link or key chain holder at the belt, or a simpler "stick-on" applied to one's clothing. Plastic or paper wristbands may also be used.  However, some elaborately designed backstage passes have been used by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] Productions/Winterland, Beaver Productions and many other regional and local promoters.  To deter counterfeiting, passes often include holograms or color-shifting properties.

At any one concert or event there are about 200 to 400 backstage passes available. Again, mainly these are for the performers, stage crews, roadies, security guards,
performer's agents. Sometimes relatives or close friends of performers, stage crew, promoters, etc. 
will get backstage passes to concerts. 

Some venues (including the [[House of Blues]] venues and Irving Plaza in New York) require their own passes to be worn, even by laminate holders for the tour.  Large music festivals, such as [[Ozzfest]] and the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] also usually issue their own passes.

Backstage passes sometimes become [[memorabilia]] sold to die-hard fans, especially when the pass is signed by a performer.

In media, the term "Backstage Pass" may be used to signify the presence of expanded coverage of certain musical groups.

==Types of passes==
There are a number of different types of backstage passes:

*All Access passes allow the bearer unlimited access to the performance venue. Such passes are generally restricted to the performers, their crew and management, and management of the venue.
*Stage Crew passes are used by those who set up the stage. If used by local, temporary help, such passes are usually valid only during this part of day, and not for during or after the show.
*Other employee passes for people who work specific jobs in support of the act, such as catering, security, and merchandising personnel.
*Passes for media, such as press reporters and photographers.
*Limited Access passes are usually intended for specially selected fans that get to "meet and greet" the performers, and can also be used for guests of the band in order to give them VIP status. Sometimes these passes will actually have VIP printed on them. These passes are often issued for afterparties.
*Backstage passes are also given out by the band and band's manager to selected fans who want to hang out with the band. These passes are commonly associated with [[groupies]], and are frequently issued for afterparties.

Otto Printing (in Kentucky) and PERRi Entertainment (in Reno, NV) helped establish the industry and were two of the largest manufactures and designers of passes up until 2003. When PERRi folded, the current leading printer of backstage passes emerged: [http://www.accesseventsolutions.com ACCESS Event Solutions.] Reno has become the largest source for backstage pass printing. Otto is still printing passes and is the oldest printer of backstage passes.  While currently Reno and Otto Printing produce the largest amount of back stage passes, there are many companies looking to surpass them in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcreator.com/back-stage-passes|date=June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways to get backstage passes. One way is to get employed for the venue. 
Some backstage passes are given as prizes by official fan clubs. Sometimes local radio stations and/or local music shops will obtain one or a few from the concert promoters or their agents and will give away as a type of promotional prize.

'''Bank payment obligation''' ('''BPO''') is a class of settlement solution in international [[supply chain]] finance.

The solution is championed by [[SWIFT]] and the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) Banking Commission as a means to move away from [[letter of credit]] schemes toward "support[ing] the development of a globally accepted standardised environment and establishment of the BPO as a neutral industry-wide practice".

==History==
The ''[[International Chamber of Commerce]] (Banking Commission) Bank Payments Obligation Working Group'' (ICC-BPO) held its first meeting in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in March 2011 with the participation of nine banks. The ICC Banking Commission and SWIFT developed the ''Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations'' (URBPO), which were launched on 24 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Articles/2013/Dubai-Chamber-and-ICC-regional-launch-of-BPO-rules/ | title=Dubai Chamber and ICC regional launch of BPO rules | date =24 June 2013 | publisher  =ICC | accessdate =10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy in Ireland applies only to [[natural person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;It might be noted that bankruptcy applies to partners in partnerships as a partnership does not have a separate legal personality to that of its members.&lt;/ref&gt; Other insolvency&lt;ref&gt;It might be noted that insolvency is not a precondition to bankruptcy in Ireland and unwillingness to pay debts may suffice see:

 | accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for the mandatory [[vesting]] of all of the bankrupt's assets and property in the [[Official Assignee]] (OA). Under the supervision of the Court, the OA will realise the bankrupt's assets and distribute the assets according to law among the bankrupt's creditors.

The essence of bankruptcy is that the debtor's assets are transferred to an official who administers and realises them for the benefit of all creditors. The purpose is to release the bankrupt from an unsustainable debt burden and to distribute his assets amongst all creditors equally (although certain types of creditor enjoy priorities). The bankrupt person is subject to restrictions and disabilities on trading and on obtaining credit while a bankrupt but leaves the process with their debts forgiven.

The Official Assignee in bankruptcy can challenge and set aside pre-bankruptcy transactions by the bankrupt to make the assets, the subject of those transactions, available to the creditors.

The classic definition of bankruptcy is that:
"it is a law for the benefit and relief of creditors and their debtors, in cases in which the latter are unable or unwilling to pay their debts."&lt;ref&gt;US House of Representatives debate on a bankruptcy bill 1818, quoted in ''United States v. Pusey'' 5 Am. L. Times Rep. 122 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant recent comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;ref name=ACTOF2011&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has started this process and the government has committed to [[#Recent Reform and Further Proposals for Reform|further reform]].

==When bankruptcy arises in Ireland==

While bankruptcy is commonly considered to arise where a person is insolvent,in Ireland a person can be adjudicated bankrupt where he has committed any act of bankruptcy

An act of bankruptcy is defined as:

''"an act of default, voluntary or involuntary, committed by a debtor, which is either evidence of intent to deprive creditors of their rights through fraudulent assignment or is an implication of insolvency."''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of bankruptcy===
The following situations are considered to be acts of bankruptcy pursuant to section 7 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988:

# where an individual makes a conveyance or assignment of all or substantially all of his property to a trustee(s) for the benefit of his creditors generally;
# where an individual makes a [[fraudulent preference]] —&lt;br /&gt;this is a transfer of property made in favour of a particular creditor, with a view to giving such a creditor priority over other creditors;
# where an individual makes a [[fraudulent disposition]] —&lt;br /&gt;this is the transfer of property between persons with the intent to defraud creditors or potential creditors generally;
# where an individual leaves the state or his dwelling house and stays away with the intent of defeating, delaying or evading his creditors;
# where an individual files a declaration of insolvency in court;
# where a creditor presenting a petition, who is due at least €1,900,&lt;ref&gt;Amended from £1,500 in the Bankruptcy Act 1988 by the {{cite web
 | title=Bankruptcy Act 1988 (Alteration of Monetary Limits) Order 2000
 | url =http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0595.html
 | accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has served a bankruptcy summons on the debtor and he does not within 14 days after service thereof pay the sum due;
# if a debtor fails to comply with a debtors summons served pursuant to Section 21(6) of the Bankruptcy (Ireland) Amendment Act 1872.

The most common act of bankruptcy is where a bankruptcy summons has been served on the debtor and he has failed to pay.&lt;ref&gt;It is important to note in the decision of {{cite case
 | litigants =Harrahill v. Cuddy
 | reporter =Unreported ''[[ex tempore]]''
 | court =Supreme Court
 | opinion = Geoghegan J
 | date = February 2009}} where the Supreme Court stated that the practice which had developed in the High Court whereby an unsatisfied judgment and a return of no goods
 was required before a bankruptcy summons would issue, was incompatible with the Bankruptcy Act. This judgment has the effect of shortening the time frame in which bankruptcy proceedings can be brought, and reducing the costs of bringing bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors can now proceed to issue a bankruptcy summons as long as they have complied with requirements of the Act. See {{cite book

==Objectives of bankruptcy legislation==

Bankruptcy law is aimed at achieving the following.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | place = Dublin
  | publisher = The Stationery Office

&lt;/ref&gt;
#securing equality of distribution and to prevent any one creditor obtaining an unfair advantage over the others;
#protecting bankrupts from vindictive creditors by freeing them from the balance of their debts where they are unable to pay them in full, and to help to rehabilitate them;
#protecting creditors, not alone from debtors who, prior to bankruptcy, prefer one of more creditors to others, and from the actions of fraudulent bankrupts; and
#punishing fraudulent debtors.

==Legal effects of bankruptcy==
When a debtor is adjudicated bankrupt, the most notable effects on his personal situation are as follows:

# all the debtor's assets and property vest automatically in the OA&lt;ref&gt;Section 44 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 subject to certain exceptions set out in s 45 thereof.&lt;/ref&gt; but see [[#Excepted articles|excepted articles]] below;
# the bankrupt must disclose to the OA any property acquired after being adjudicated bankrupt;
# any payment or any transfer of property by the bankrupt to a creditor in preference over other creditors that took place in the 1-year period prior to being adjudicated bankrupt shall be deemed to have been fraudulently done and may be undone or otherwise dealt with by the Court;&lt;ref&gt;Section 57 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, as amended by Section 57 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
# any sale of property at an under value that the bankrupt carried out in the one-year period prior to being adjudicated bankrupt may be avoided and undone by the OA;&lt;ref&gt;Section 58 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, as amended by Section 57 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
# any person who is known or suspected to have in his possession or control any property of the bankrupt or to have disposed of any property of the bankrupt or who is supposed to have indebtedness to the bankrupt or any person who is capable of giving information relating to the trade, dealings, affairs or property of the bankrupt may be summonsed by a Court;
# the bankrupt's salary is likely to be attached in favour of the OA;&lt;ref&gt;Section 65 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Court may make such allowances as the Court thinks proper, in any special circumstances brought to its attention, to the bankrupt out of his or her estate;&lt;ref&gt;Section 71 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
# certain of the bankrupt's post may be re-directed to the OA;&lt;ref&gt;Section 72 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
# it is an offence for the bankrupt to act as an officer of or directly or indirectly take part or be concerned in the promotion, formation or management of any Irish company or of any foreign company which has an established place of business in Ireland;&lt;ref&gt;Section 183 of the Companies Act 1963 as substituted by Section 169 of the Companies Act 1990 [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0033/sec0169.html#sec169]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the bankrupt cannot obtain credit over €650 without disclosing his status as a bankrupt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 129(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 as amended by the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Act 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the bankrupt is restricted from participation in a range of bodies set up by statute;&lt;ref Name =SH /&gt;{{rp|91}}&lt;ref&gt;See the statute establishing any specific body where the bankrupt is or may become involved.&lt;/ref&gt;
# after five years the bankrupt may be discharged;&lt;ref&gt;Section 30(h) of the Civil (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
# after twelve years the bankrupt will be discharged; and&lt;ref&gt;Section 30(h) of the Civil (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 is commenced.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the [[Revenue Commissioners]] are obliged to provide information on request to the Official Assignee.&lt;ref&gt;Section 18A of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 as inserted by s. 30 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
#until the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2014, undischarged bankrupts were not eligible to stand in [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] other than [[Local elections in the Republic of Ireland|local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0008/index.html|title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2014|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/law-change-will-overturn-ban-on-bankrupts-running-for-dail-seats-30146856.html|title=Law change will overturn ban on bankrupts running for Dail seats|last=Downing|first=John|date=2 April 2014|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041000017?opendocument|title=Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2014: Second Stage (Continued)|date=10 April 2014|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|page=17|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bankrupt commits a criminal offence if he does not disclose all his property to the Court or conceals any part of his estate or if he obtains by false representation any property or credit.

Offences carry the penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding €634.87 or up to 12 months prison or both and on indictment of a fine not exceeding €1,269.74 or up to 5 years prison or both.

===Excepted articles===
Pursuant to S45 of the Bankruptcy Act (as amended), a bankrupt is permitted to retain as excepted articles: clothing,  furniture, bedding, tools or equipment of his trade or occupation or necessary items for himself, his/her spouse or civil partner, children and dependent relatives residing with him/her, as he may select, not exceeding in value €3,100 or such further amount as the court on an application by the bankrupt may allow.

If, having selected items up to the specified value, the bankrupt requests the official assignee not to dispose of items of the kind set out above, the OA may not dispose of such items other than in accordance with an order of the court.

On an application by the OA or by the bankrupt under this section the court may postpone the removal and sale; permit the bankrupt to retain the items or order the sale of the items at any time.

==Suspension of enforcement==

Once a bankruptcy [[petition]] issues, all uncompleted legal enforcement against the debtor is stopped. This is to preserve equality among creditors as no enforcement action can be taken against a bankrupt.

The proceeds of execution of a Court order must be retained by the [[Sheriff]] for 21 days. If a bankruptcy commences in this period, the proceeds are sent to the official assignee rather than the creditors. If the process has not been completed, then bankruptcy will freeze enforcement and the assets collected by the sheriff must be turned over to the bankruptcy trustee or OA.

The OA can apply to have proceedings stopped or restrained. Legal proceedings will generally be stopped on such terms as the court deems appropriate.

On adjudication of bankruptcy, creditors may not take action against the bankrupt's person or property without Court consent.

However, a secured creditor can realise its security separately from the bankruptcy.

==Initiating the bankruptcy process==

===Creditor's petition===

A creditor is entitled to present a petition for adjudication against a debtor, without having to give notice to the debtor, if:&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act 1988 section 11&lt;/ref&gt;

# the debt owing by the debtor to the petitioning creditor amounts to €1,900 or more;
# the debt is a liquidated sum (a sum certain);
# the act of bankruptcy on which the petition is founded has occurred within three months before the presentation of the petition; and
# the debtor is domiciled in the state or, within three years before the date of the presentation of the petition, has ordinarily resided or had a dwelling house or place of business in the state or has carried on business in the state personally or by means of an agent or manager, or is, or within the said period has been, a member of a partnership which has carried on business in the state by means of a partner, agent or manager.&lt;ref&gt;Where the creditor has interests in multiple states see Centre of Main Interests with regard to which is the appropriate forum for insolvency proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service of the petition is effected by serving a copy of the petition on the debtor and showing him the original.

The following additional steps are required prior to presenting a petition:

#prior to the issue of a bankruptcy summons, "Particulars of the Demand and Notice Requiring Payment" must be sent to the debtor by way of ordinary post, the debtor has 4 clear days to respond;
#should the debtor fail to respond, the creditor can then proceed to have a bankruptcy summons issued with 2 copies of the notice together with an affidavit for bankruptcy summons sworn by the creditor being filed in the Examiner's Office together with €650 for the OA's initial costs, fees and expenses;
#once the bankruptcy summons is issued it should be personally served on the debtor together with the affidavit within 28 days. The summons server must endorse the summons with the date of service within 3 days of having served it;
#the debtor has 14 days after the service of summons within which to pay the sum or apply to court to have the summons dismissed; and
#if the debtor fails to pay the debt or to apply to have the summons dismissed with the 14 days, he will be deemed to have committed an act of bankruptcy.

====Hearing the petition====

If the court is satisfied that all the relevant requirements have been complied with, it will adjudicate the debtor bankrupt.&lt;Ref Name=SH /&gt;{{rp|71}}&lt;ref&gt;However the court appears to retain a discretion to stay proceedings which are for instance oppressive or are an abuse of process. See ''McGinn v Beagan'' [1924] I.R. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; A duplicate copy of this order is given to the bankruptcy inspector who serves it on the debtor. The bankruptcy inspector is a civil servant employed in the office of the OA.

The bankrupt can appeal the order but if there is no appeal then the adjudication is published in [[Iris Oifigiúil]] and a newspaper as directed by the court and a statutory sitting is held within 3 weeks of the publication. The bankrupt must make a full disclosure of all his property to the court at this hearing.

Part 5 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 makes provision for an application at the statutory sitting for the appointment of a trustee who will carry out the functions normally carried out by the OA in winding up the a bankrupt's estate. These provisions have rarely been invoked.&lt;Ref Name=SH /&gt;{{rp|110}}

===Debtor's petition===

Before a debtor may bring bankruptcy proceedings against himself, he must show that
he is unable to pay his debts to his creditors and that his available estate is sufficient to produce at least €1,900.00.&lt;ref&gt;Section 15 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 as amended by article 1 and the schedule to the Bankruptcy Act 1988 (Alteration of Monetary Limits) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitions by debtors are relatively rare in Ireland. The most high profile debtor's petition in recent times was that of [[Seán FitzPatrick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |title=FitzPatrick declared bankrupt at his own request

 |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; former chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] in July 2010.

==Duties of the bankrupt to the official assignee==

The bankrupt is obliged (pursuant to section 19 of the Bankruptcy Act 1998) to:

# unless the court otherwise directs, forthwith deliver such books of account or other papers relating to his estate in his possession or control as the Official Assignee may from time to time request and disclose to him such of them as are in the possession or control of any other person;
# deliver up possession of any part of his property which is divisible among his creditors under this Act, and which is for the time being in his possession or control;
# unless the Court otherwise directs, within the prescribed time file in the Central Office of the High Court a statement of affairs in the prescribed form and deliver a copy thereof to the OA;
# give every reasonable assistance in the administration of the estate; and
# disclose any property acquired after his adjudication in bankruptcy.

== Appointment of an official assignee in bankruptcy ==

The functions of the OA are to get in and realise the property, to ascertain the debts and liabilities and to distribute the assets.&lt;ref&gt;Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the performance of his functions the OA shall, in particular, have powers to:

#sell the property by public auction or private contract, with power to transfer the whole thereof to any person or to sell the same in lots;
#make any compromise or arrangement with creditors or persons claiming to be creditors or having or alleging themselves to have any claim present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages whereby the bankrupt or arranging debtor may be rendered liable;
#compromise all debts and liabilities capable of resulting in debts and all claims, present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages, subsisting or supposed to subsist between the bankrupt or arranging debtor and any debtor and all questions in any way relating to or affecting the assets or the proceedings on such terms as may be agreed and take any security for the discharge of any debt, liability or claim, and give a complete discharge in respect thereof;
#institute, continue or defend any proceedings relating to the bankrupt's property,
#refer any dispute concerning the property to [[arbitration]] under the terms of section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1954;
#mortgage or pledge any property to raise any money required for the proper administration of the bankruptcy without the sanction of the court;
#take out in his official name without being required to give security, [[letters of administration]] to any estate on the administration of which the bankrupt or arranging debtor would benefit;
#agree a sum for costs where the court so directs or where he considers that the amount which would be allowed on taxation would not exceed €12,000.00;&lt;ref&gt;Section 61(3)of the Bankruptcy Act 1998 as amended by section 34 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 and section 30 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
#agree the charges of accountants, auctioneers, brokers and other persons;
#ascertain and certify to the court the amount due in respect of a mortgage debt and the due priority thereof with power to the Court to vary such certificate.

==Bankruptcy and the family home==
Pursuant to section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 all of the bankrupt's assets vest in the OA. This includes the bankrupt's interest in the family home.&lt;ref&gt;Sanfey and Holohan, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; However the OA must apply to court under section 61(5)to permit him to sell a family home. The court has a discretion to postpone a sale under this section ''"having regard to the interests of the creditors and of the spouse and dependents of the bankrupt as well as the circumstances of the case"''.

In most circumstances the spouse of the bankrupt will assert an interest in the family home. Notwithstanding this interest the court may make an order under section 31 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 for partition of land or for sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds as the court directs. Accordingly, the OA may obtain an order for sale subject to distributing a share of the proceeds to the spouse of the bankrupt.

The mechanisms by which a spouse's interest in the family home arise are complex and careful consideration needs to be given to the existence and percentage of such interest in the circumstances of any given case.

It should also be noted that where a spouse is engaging in behaviour which may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home, with the intention to deprive a spouse of dependent child of such an interest, it is open to the other spouse to apply to court for an order under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act 1976 to protect such an interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Centre of main interests==

COMI is a concept introduced by the EU Insolvency Regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2000R1346:20100402:EN:HTML
 |title=EC regulation No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings.
 | accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that a person's COMI ''"should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties"''.

The essential elements of the COMI principles are set out below.

*COMI for an individual is where he conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by third parties.
*It can be the professional centre of business rather than the habitual residence.
*COMI can be moved but there needs to be an element of permanence to the move.

==Secured creditors and bankruptcy==
A [[secured creditor]] has 3 options available to it where the individual who granted the security is adjudged bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 1 Paragraph 24 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0027/sched1.html#sched1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanfey and Holohan at paragraph 12–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Realise the secured asset and, if necessary, lodge a proof of debt for the balance due once the proceeds of the sale have been deducted from the debt due;
# Surrender the security held and lodge a proof of debt for the entire amount due; or
# Retain the security, value it and lodge a proof of debt for the difference between the estimated value and the debt due to it

== Discharge and termination of bankruptcy ==
There are 3 ways to terminate bankruptcy.

===Discharge/release===

Discharge frees the debtor from all pre-bankruptcy liabilities.

A bankruptcy is automatically discharged after 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Section 85(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 as substituted by s 30(h) of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a provision introduced in 2011 and historically there was no automatic discharge.

Obtaining a discharge earlier than 12 years requires an application to court.

A court will order a discharge/release where:&lt;ref&gt;Section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 as substituted by s 30(h) of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

*provision has been made to cover the costs. fees (of the OA) and expenses of the bankruptcy, the preferential creditors, and
**all other creditors have been paid in full, including any interest allowed by the court;
**the bankrupt has obtain the consent in writing of all creditors whose debts have been admitted and proved; or
**the bankrupt enters a composition or arrangement with creditors which has been successfully carried out;&lt;ref&gt;Section 41 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
*the court is satisfied that the estate of the bankrupt has been fully realised, provision has been made to cover the costs, fees (of the OA) and expenses of the bankruptcy, the preferential creditors, and
**the creditors have been paid at least 50%;
*the bankruptcy has been in place for 5 years (prior to 2011 this was 12 years), provision has been made to cover the costs. fees (of the OA) and expenses of the bankruptcy, the preferential creditors;
**the court is satisfied that all after acquired property was disclosed; and
**the court is satisfied that it is reasonable and proper to grant discharge.

===Annulment===

Annulment involves cancellation of the bankruptcy and supposes that the bankruptcy was granted in error.

There are basically two grounds for annulment.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 16 and 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first applies in any case where in the opinion of the court, the debtor ought not to have been adjudicated bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;Per the Supreme Court in {{cite court
  |litigants = Gill v Phillip O'Reilly &amp; Co
  |vol = 1
  |reporter = IR
  |pinpoint = 434
  |court = Supreme Court
  |date = 2003}} ''"extremely compelling reasons are required before such an application would succeed."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i.e. where the order was made without jurisdiction or where there had been a clear abuse of process; where the mechanisms of the Bankruptcy Act had been improperly used.

The second applies where the bankrupt within 3 days or such extended time not exceeding 14 days as the Court thinks fit from the service of the copy of the order of adjudication on him, show cause to the Court against the validity of the adjudication.
This involves the bankrupt showing that the creditor(s) have not complied with any of the Creditor's Petition requirements.

====Order for annulment====

Only the bankrupt can apply to have the bankruptcy annulled. Such an order can be made at any stage during the proceedings. The effect of an order is to put the bankrupt in the position he was in prior to adjudication insofar as that is possible without causing prejudice to the creditors.

=== Recission ===

The Court may review, rescind or vary an order made by it in the course of a bankruptcy matter other than an order of discharge or annulment.

The Court can rescind an adjudication of bankruptcy where:

*there is a relevant change in the circumstances, or
*new evidence comes to light which could not have been cited on an appeal.

==Arrangements==

An arrangement is an agreement between the debtor and his creditors. An arrangement allows a debtor to:

*settle outstanding debts by paying a proportion of the amount that he owed to his creditors; and
*come to an arrangement with his creditors over the payment of his debts

=== Voluntary arrangements ===

An individual may try to come to a voluntary arrangement by deed with his creditors outside the control of the court&lt;ref&gt;Sanfey &amp; Holohan, section 16-26 ''eq seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to agreeing a part-payment of his debts in settlement of the claims. This arrangement does not require court approval and avoids a bankruptcy.

Reasons for considering this option include:

*these proceedings are more expedient as bankruptcy proceedings tend to take a long time;
*the cost involved are usually less;
*the debtor avoids the publicity of bankruptcy proceedings;
*the debtor retains more control over the process; and
*the debtor may continue to trade.

Any arrangement made between the debtor and creditor out of court is a matter of contract between them with there being no involvement by the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the High Court. A deed of arrangement must be registered with the High Court offices.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to register within seven days, will make it void.&lt;ref&gt;Section 5 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect of the arrangement on the creditor====

The agreement is binding on the participating creditor regardless of whether the other creditors have assented to the offer or not.&lt;ref&gt;Sanfey and Holohan, section 16-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrangements under court control===

The requirements for a debtor to come to an arrangement with his creditors which is under the control of the court are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Section 87 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

*full provision must be made, by way of a supporting affidavit giving particulars of and description of assets and their fair value and an estimate for fees, expenses and the amount due to preferential creditors;
*once 60% of the creditors in value and number have accepted the proposal ''and'' it is approved by the court, it becomes binding on all the creditors, who were creditors at the time of the petition and had notice of the sitting;
*only creditors who have debts of at least €30 will be entitled to vote at such a sitting,
*the advantages are similar to those of a voluntary arrangement with the added significant advantage that dissenting creditors can be bound if the requisite majority is obtained; however, there will be additional court costs and expenses of the OA. Additionally, should a composition be voted down, bankruptcy proceedings will undoubtedly follow so using voluntary arrangements under court control is a high risk strategy for a debtor.

The role of the OA is to present to the Court for approval:

*a list of creditors admitted by him or by the court;
*a copy of the relevant account of the arranging debtor;
*particulars of expenses, fees, costs, preferential payments, dividend payable to creditors; and
*his report on the realisation of the estate.

The court may make such order as it thinks fit for the distribution of the estate or any part thereof by payment of the expenses, fees, costs and preferential payments as well as the relevant dividend.

The court's grounds for refusal of consent for such an arrangement are broad. The court can refuse consent if:

*the proposals are unfair on the opposing minority;
*the debtor's conduct had been commercially unfair; or
*it is not a bona-fide arrangement

and may refuse to approve on certain other grounds.

==Post-Bankruptcy arrangements==

It is also possible to have an arrangement with creditors after bankruptcy commences. This is known as a composition in bankruptcy. It commences with an application to court&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to section 38 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; which if granted, suspends bankruptcy proceedings.

The features of a post-bankruptcy arrangement are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Section 39 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

*a meeting is called before the court for the purpose of making an offer to creditors. The meeting must be advertised and certain statements must be filed;
*the arrangement requires consent of 60% in value and 60% in number of creditors ''and'' court approval. The court summons meetings, under the auspices of a court official, the Examiner;
*a composition can be paid by payment of cash within a certain time, payment in instalments or cash payment and instalments.

The bankruptcy may be discharged when:&lt;ref&gt;Section 41 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

*in the case of a composition payable in cash, upon lodgement with the OA of the necessary amount to pay the composition, expenses, fees, costs, such further sums as the court may direct and the preferential payments;
*in the case of a composition payable by instalments which are secured to the satisfaction of the creditors, upon lodgement with the OA of the completed securities, the necessary amount to pay expenses, fees, costs, such further sums as the court may direct and the preferential payments;
*in the case of a composition payable partly in cash and partly by instalments which are secured to the satisfaction of the creditors, upon lodgement with the OA of the completed securities, the necessary amount to pay the cash composition, expenses, fees, costs, such further sums as the court may direct and the preferential payments.

==Statistics==
Bankruptcy is, at present, relatively rarely used in Ireland. This can be partly explained by the prevalence of [[Bankruptcy tourism]] which allows people to avail of less stringent bankruptcy laws outside Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/23/bankruptcy-tourism-why-foreign-companies-and-individuals-are-choosing-to-go-bankrupt-in-britain_n_2177924.html | title = Bankruptcy Tourism: Why Foreign Companies And Individuals Are Choosing To Go Bankrupt In Britain|date =24 November 2012 |accessdate=13 February 2014}}

==Recent reform and further proposals==
Irish Bankruptcy laws have been the subject of sustained criticism both regarding the complexity of the process and the minimum length of time (12 years, until amended in 2011) taken to purge bankruptcy where all of the debts of the bankrupt have not been discharged.

In the wake of the bursting of the [[Irish property bubble]], commentators have noted the appearance of bankruptcy tourism where Irish debtors move to other jurisdictions to avail of more lenient bankruptcy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''CFA Institute''' is a global association of investment professionals.

The organization offers the [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation, the [[Certificate in Investment Performance Measurement]] (CIPM) designation, and the Investment Foundations Certificate. It provides continuing education conferences, seminars, webcasts, and publications to allow members and other participants to stay current on developments in the investment industry. CFA Institute also oversees the CFA Institute Research Challenge for university students and the Research Foundation of CFA Institute.

CFA Institute offices are located in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Mumbai]], and [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], USA.

==History==
In 1947, four financial analyst societies—Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia—cooperated for the purpose of promoting the exchange of ideas and supporting the welfare of their profession. In 1962, some of these financial analysts created the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation and established a [[code of conduct]]. In 1963, the profession was formalized when 284 candidates sat for the first CFA exam and 268 CFA charters were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfainstitute.org/Timeline%20Documents/aimr_history_brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Association for Investment Management and Research voted to change its name to the CFA Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educalc.net/366484.page|title=AIMR Changes Name to CFA Institute : Educalc.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, 120,000 CFA Charters have been awarded. CFA Institute has more than 142,000 members in 150 countries and territories, and 137 member societies in 60 countries.

The '''California Society of Municipal Finance Officers''' (or CSMFO) is a [[professional association]] of state, [[County (United States)|county]], and [[local government]] finance officers in [[California]].  The California Society of Municipal Finance Officers is the statewide organization serving all California municipal finance professionals, an affiliate of the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Membership is open to anyone in the State of California actively engaged in government finance in any [[city]], county, or [[Special-purpose district|special district]].  Its stated mission is to  promote excellence in financial management through innovation, continuing education and professional development.  CSMFO members are actively involved in the key issues facing cities, counties, and special districts in the State of California.

Recognizing that public servants have an obligation to serve the public’s interests, CSMFO serves to actively improve fiscal integrity, adherence to the highest standards of ethical conduct, and to create better accountability by disseminating best practices.

==The Challenge to Excellence in Government Finance ==

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]](CFO Act) was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]]. For each of 23 federal agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. Since that time, federal efforts have been intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. Similar financial expectations exist at State and Local government levels.

The [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) of a public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for budgeting, financial planning, record-keeping, cash flow management, higher management. communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director or treasurer, from agency to agency. The CFO typically reports to the city manager or other chief executive officer.

Financial reporting has multiple audiences, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to provide transparent accountability for use of public funds (taxes).  Additionally, financial reporting must provide internal guidance to program managers to maintain budgetary control and to governing city councils and boards of directors to provide adequate financial policy guidelines.

The United States government in general has sought to improve the quality of financial reporting.  The Government Accounting Standards Board ([[Governmental Accounting Standards Board|GASB]]) has a stated mission to "establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasb.org/ Government Accounting Standards Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Pronouncements in particular have trended to incorporate more comparable elements of business-sector.

The need for and value of financial managers has increased. Over the past decades, a number of factors have created a rapidly changing environment for today's government financial managers.  Beginning with the [[New York City]] financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront.  The 1994 Bankruptcy of [[Orange County, California]] further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.

==Role of CSMFO Membership==
Members are finance directors and treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds.  Municipal funding sources are commonly [[property tax]], [[sales tax]], [[income tax]], utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.

Michael Genest is the [[Finance Director]] and [[Bill Lockyer]] is the [[Treasurer]] of the [[State of California]].  There are 480 California cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html State of California, Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428195928/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 58 [[California counties]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html State of California, Counties ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094654/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 3,400 [[Special Districts]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/cwpu2005/vol4/vol4-background-whatssospecialaboutspecialdistricts.pdf A Citizen's Guide to Special Districts in California] Retrieved 2009-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; and School Districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship.  Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.  Finance Directors typically are appointed by the City Manager.

==Professional Standards Setting==
Certification is a guide for municipal finance directors and treasurers to become valued administrators in local government.  CSMFO encourages [[professional certification]] for public finance directors and treasurers who meet standards of education, experience and commitment to a [[code of ethics]].  CSMFO does not offer its own [[post-nominal]] professional certificate since GFOA already administers the Certified Professional Finance Officer (CPFO), CMTA offers the [[Certified California Municipal Treasurer]] (CCMT) certification program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?displaytype=11&amp;story=23047&amp;zone=ilsg&amp;section=conf&amp;sub_sec=conf_codes Institute for Local Government, Ethics Codes]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Government Accountants offers the [[Certified Government Financial Manager]] (CGFM) certification, requiring six hours of testing on Federal, State and Local Government Financial material.

==CSMFO Code of Ethics==

Members are enjoined to adhere to legal, moral and professional standards of conduct. The following ethical principles govern the conduct of the Municipal members of the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers who shall:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154 CSMFO Code of Ethics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926062024/http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154# |date=2006-09-26 }} Retrieved 2009-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and Education in California Finance and Treasury==
CSMFO has technical and professional committees that deal with financial issues facing government and the public.  CSMFO also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members.  CSMFO's annual statewide conferences provide an array of education across many topics and alternate annually between various northern and southern cities.  By assembling leadership from a broad representation of government agencies and also bringing in subject matter experts in various disciplines, the collective expertise and professionalism of financial managers and policymakers is enhanced and improved.

==Statewide Financial Leadership==
CSMFO is recognized as a leading source of expert knowledge in public financial management by exercising leadership in research, recommended practice and policy development, and information dissemination.  Nationwide recognition is furthered through a continued association with the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Statewide recognition is furthered through a thorough participation of members drawn from many cities, counties and special districts.

Standing Committees
Financial Leadership is furthered by engaging in efforts to assist statewide finance officers to develop the skills and capabilities necessary to enable them to become organizational leaders as well as technical experts.  &lt;br&gt;

==Resources==
The CSMFO website is a well-known statewide resource for a variety of documents relevant to local government, the most obvious benefit of which is to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and to make more knowledge available statewide to everyone.  CSMFO's library of resources includes sample RFPs, job descriptions, and a variety of documents and information relevant to local government.  Categories of posted information include Accounting/Financial Reporting, Budgeting, Consultants, Investments/Cash Management, Job Descriptions, Payroll, Human Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures, Revenue Management, RFPs/RFQs, and Technology.

CSMFO facilitates interagency communication for the purposes of sharing information and best practices.  Cooperate with and complement the services provided by other organizations to increase the effectiveness of all.

Like GFOA nationwide, CSMFO sponsors award programs designed to encourage good financial reporting in California, for financial documents including the [[Comprehensive annual financial report]], or CAFR, and the annual [[budget]].

CSMFO provides technology information and analytical tools to help governments identify and apply appropriate, economical technologies to support efficient resource allocation, quality services, and effective decision making and to promote citizen involvement.

== Biography ==
Born into a family of Greek immigrants to the United States in [[Newark, New Jersey]], Argyris (pronounced AHR-JUR-ris) grew up in [[Irvington, New Jersey]] and Athens, Greece.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/argyris_chris_1923&lt;/ref&gt; In World War II he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/chris-argyris-theories-of-action-double-loop-learning-and-organizational-learning/ Chris Argyris: theories of action, double-loop learning and organizational learning] at infed.org.&lt;/ref&gt; After his service he studied psychology at [[Clark University]], where he met [[Kurt Lewin]]. He obtained his MA in 1947, and joined the [[Kansas University]], where he obtained his MSc in Psychology and Economics in 1949. In 1951 received his PhD from Cornell University, with a thesis on the behavior in organizations under the supervision of [[William F. Whyte]].

In 1951 Argyris started his academic career at [[Yale University]] as part of the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]] where he worked under its director and an early influence, [[E. Wight Bakke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Organizational Behavior: Foundations, Theories, and Analyses | first=John B. | last=Miner | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | year=2002 | page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale he subsequently became appointed Professor of Management science. In 1971 he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he was Professor of Education and Organizational Behavior, until his retirement. Argyris was active as director of the consulting firm Monitor in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Chris Argyris received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Toronto]] in 2006. He also received a Doctor of Science award from [[Yale University]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale News: Citations for Recipients of Honorary Degrees at Yale University 2011|url=http://news.yale.edu/2011/05/23/citations-recipients-honorary-degrees-yale-university-2011|accessdate=2 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421185809/http://news.yale.edu/2011/05/23/citations-recipients-honorary-degrees-yale-university-2011|archivedate=21 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Chris Argyris' early research explored the impact of formal organizational structures, control systems and management on individuals and how they responded and adapted to them. This research resulted in the books ''Personality and Organization'' (1957) and ''Integrating the Individual and the Organization'' (1964). He then shifted his focus to organizational change, in particular exploring the behaviour of senior executives in organizations (''Interpersonal Competence and Organizational Effectiveness'' (1962); ''Organization and Innovation'' (1965).

From there he moved on to an inquiry into the role of the social scientist as both researcher and actor (''Intervention Theory and Method'' (1970); ''Inner Contradictions of Rigorous Research'' (1980) and ''Action Science'' (1985) – with Robert Putnam and Diana McLain Smith). His fourth major area of research and theorizing – in significant part undertaken with [[Donald Schön]] – was in individual and organizational learning and the extent to which human reasoning, not just behavior, can become the basis for diagnosis and action (''Theory in Practice'' (1974); ''Organizational Learning'' (1978); ''Organizational Learning II'' (1996) – all with Donald Schön). He has also developed this thinking in ''Overcoming Organizational Defenses'' (1990) and ''Knowledge for Action'' (1993).

=== Adult personality ===
Argyris believed that managers who treat people positively and as responsible adults will achieve productivity. Mature workers want additional responsibilities, variety of tasks, and the ability to participate in decisions. He also came to the conclusion that problems with employees are the result of mature personalities managed using outdated practices.

===Action science===
Argyris' collaborative work with Robert W. Putnam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://actionscience.net/about/people/putnam Action Design: Robert Putnam bio]&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with [[Robert D. Putnam]]), and Diana McLain Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://actionscience.net/about/people/smith Action Design: Diana Mclain Smith bio]&lt;/ref&gt; advocates an approach to research that focuses on generating knowledge that is useful in solving practical problems. Other key concepts developed by Argyris include ladder of inference, [[double-loop learning]] {{Harv|Argyris|Schön|1974}}, theory of action/espoused theory/theory-in-use, high advocacy/high inquiry dialogue and actionable knowledge and  the study of adult personality.

Argyris' concept of Action Science begins with the study of how [[human]] beings design their actions in difficult situations.  Human actions are designed to achieve intended consequences and governed by a set of environment variables.  How those governing variables are treated in designing actions are the key differences between single-loop learning and [[double-loop learning]].  When actions are designed to achieve the intended consequences and to suppress conflict about the governing variables, a single-loop learning cycle usually ensues.  On the other hand, when actions are taken, not only to achieve the intended consequences, but also to openly inquire about conflict and to possibly transform the governing variables, both single-loop and double-loop learning cycles usually ensue.  (Argyris applies single-loop and double-loop learning concepts not only to personal behaviors but also to organizational behaviors in his models.)

Model 1 illustrates how single-loop learning affects human actions.  Model 2 describes how double-loop learning affects human actions.  The following Model 1 and Model 2 tables introduce these ideas (tables are from Argyris, Putnam &amp; Smith, 1985, Action Science, Ch. 3).  Other key books conveying Argyris' approach include Argyris &amp; Schon, 1974 and Argyris, 1970, 1980, 1994).

[[File:CRISP-DM Process Diagram.png|thumb|right|Process diagram showing the relationship between the different phases of CRISP-DM]]
'''Cross-industry standard process for data mining''', known as '''CRISP-DM''',&lt;ref name=Shearer00&gt;Shearer C., ''The CRISP-DM model: the new blueprint for data mining'', J Data Warehousing (2000); 5:13—22.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[open standard]] process model that describes common approaches used by [[data mining]] experts. It is the most widely-used [[analytics]] model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2015/07/29/what-it-needs-to-know-about-the-data-mining-process/#2065f3a3515f What IT Needs To Know About The Data Mining Process] Published by Forbes, 29 July 2015, retrieved June 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, IBM corporation released a new methodology called ''Analytics Solutions Unified Method for Data Mining/Predictive Analytics''&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2015/10/16/have-you-seen-asum-dm/ Have you seen ASUM-DM?], By Jason Haffar, 16 October 2015, SPSS Predictive Analytics, IBM{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/services/ASUM.pdf Analytics Solutions Unified Method - Implementations with Agile principles] Published by IBM, 1 March 2016, retrieved October 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ASUM-DM) which refines and extends CRISP-DM. 

==History==

CRISP-DM was conceived in 1996 and became a European Union project under the [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]] funding initiative in 1997.  The project was led by five companies: [[Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL)]], [[Teradata]], [[Daimler AG]], [[NCR Corporation]] and [[OHRA]], an insurance company.

This core consortium brought different experiences to the project: ISL, later acquired and merged into SPSS. The computer giant NCR Corporation produced the Teradata [[data warehouse]] and its own data mining software. Daimler-Benz had a significant data mining team. OHRA was just starting to explore the potential use of data mining.

The first version of the methodology was presented at the 4th CRISP-DM SIG Workshop in Brussels in March 1999,&lt;ref name=crispDMbrussels&gt;Pete Chapman (1999); [http://lyle.smu.edu/~mhd/8331f03/crisp.pdf ''The CRISP-DM User Guide''].&lt;/ref&gt; and published as a step-by-step data mining guide later that year.&lt;ref name=crispDMguide&gt;Pete Chapman, Julian Clinton, Randy Kerber, Thomas Khabaza, Thomas Reinartz, Colin Shearer, and Rüdiger Wirth (2000); [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/support/Modeler/Documentation/14/UserManual/CRISP-DM.pdf ''CRISP-DM 1.0 Step-by-step data mining guides''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2008 a CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG was formed and there were discussions about updating the CRISP-DM process model.&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearer"&gt;Colin Shearer (2006); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2006/n19/4i.html ''First CRISP-DM 2.0 Workshop Held'']&lt;/ref&gt; The current status of these efforts is not known.  However, the original crisp-dm.org website cited in the reviews,&lt;ref name="kurgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"/&gt; and the CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG website&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt; are both no longer active.

While many non-IBM data mining practitioners use CRISP-DM,&lt;ref name="KDnug2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt; IBM is the primary corporation that currently embraces{{peacock-inline|date=April 2018}} the CRISP-DM process model. It makes some of the old CRISP-DM documents available for download&lt;ref name="crispDMguide"/&gt; and it has incorporated it into its [[SPSS Modeler]] product.

Based on current research CRISP-DM is the most widely used form of data-mining model because of its various advantages which solved the existing problems in the data mining industries. Some of the drawbacks of this model is that it does not perform project management activities. The fact behind the success of CRISP-DM is that it is industry, tool, and application neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mariscal,G.,Marban,O.,Fernandez,C.||title=A Survey of Data Mining and knowledge discovery process Models and methodologies|url=http://doi.org/10.1017/S0269888910000032|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=The Knowledge Engineering Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major phases==
CRISP-DM breaks the process of [[data mining]] into six major phases.&lt;ref name="Harper06"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harper | first = Gavin |author2=Stephen D. Pickett |date=August 2006 | title = Methods for mining HTS data | journal = [[Drug Discovery Today]] | volume = 11 | issue=15–16 | pages = 694–699 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T64-4KDJSRH-4&amp;_user=793840&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=4&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235020%232006%23999889984%23627946%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5020&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=17&amp;_acct=C000043460&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=793840&amp;md5=f7f5b2376172e12b63177a32b03de111 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2006.06.006 | pmid = 16846796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the phases is not strict and moving back and forth between different phases as it is always required. The arrows in the process diagram indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between phases.  The outer circle in the diagram symbolizes the cyclic nature of data mining itself. A data mining process continues after a solution has been deployed. The lessons learned during the process can trigger new, often more focused business questions, and subsequent data mining processes will benefit from the experiences of previous ones.

==Polls==
Polls conducted at the same website (KDNuggets) in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that it was the leading methodology used by industry data miners who decided to respond to the survey.&lt;ref name="KDnug2002"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2002); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2004"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2004); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2007"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2007); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2014"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2014); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt; The only other data mining approach named in these polls was [[SEMMA]]. However, SAS Institute clearly states that SEMMA is not a data mining methodology, but rather a "logical organization of the functional toolset of SAS Enterprise Miner." A review and critique of data mining process models in 2009 called the CRISP-DM the "de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects."&lt;ref name="Marban"&gt;Óscar Marbán, Gonzalo Mariscal and Javier Segovia (2009); [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5937/InTech-A_data_mining_amp_knowledge_discovery_process_model.pdf ''A Data Mining &amp; Knowledge Discovery Process Model'']. In Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Real Life Applications, Book edited by: Julio Ponce and Adem Karahoca, {{ISBN|978-3-902613-53-0}}, pp. 438–453, February 2009, I-Tech, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews of CRISP-DM and data mining process models include Kurgan and Musilek's 2006 review,&lt;ref name="kurgan"&gt;Lukasz Kurgan and Petr Musilek (2006); [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=451120 ''A survey of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining process models''].

Volume 21 Issue 1, March 2006, pp 1–24, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA doi: 10.1017/S0269888906000737.&lt;/ref&gt; and Azevedo and Santos' 2008 comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA.&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"&gt;Azevedo, A. and Santos, M. F. (2008); [http://recipp.ipp.pt/bitstream/10400.22/136/3/KDD-CRISP-SEMMA.pdf KDD, SEMMA and CRISP-DM: a parallel overview]. In Proceedings of the IADIS European Conference on Data Mining 2008, pp 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to update the methodology started in 2006, but have {{as of|2015|06|30}} not led to a new version, and the "Special Interest Group" (SIG) responsible along with the website has long disappeared (see [[#History|History of CRISP-DM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">'''Dala Modu''' was an important  [[Sierra Leonean]] [[Susu people|Susu]] [[trade]]r and [[translation|translator]] between the [[British Colonial]] Government and the local chiefs in the interior in the early decades of the British Colony in [[Sierra Leone]]. His efforts helped in resolving a number of conflicts between the colonial and interior rulers. His reputation as a major commercial force was enhanced in the process, and he built up the prominent Soso community around Lungi in the Kafu Bullom country.

==Early life==
Dala Modu was born in 1770 in [[Wonkafong]], [[Sumbuya]] near [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]] into a family of [[Merchant|traders]]. His father, Fenda Modu, had been advisor to the King of Sumbuya and Headman of Wonkafong. Although born in Guinea, he was raised in [[Freetown]]. Dala Modu first came to [[Freetown]] at the age of four years, with his father in 1774. Desirous of fostering his commercial contacts with the new colony, Fenda Modu sent his son Dala Modu with fifty followers in 1795 to settle on the outskirts of Freetown. The town Dala Modu built up there, named [[Dalamodiya]] after him, quickly became a commercial centre, and he became landlord for many traders from the interior, mostly from his own Soso ethnic group. Dala Modu was welcomed by the [[United Kingdom|British]], who were also keen on developing the trade with the interior on which the colony's survival depended. In [[Freetown]] Dala Modu learned English and studied the colony's monetary system and weights and measures.

==Career==
Dala Modu's business activities became very extensive, involving colony officials, both [[Europe]]an and [[Africa]]n, and the local traders, for whom he acted as agent. He became the primary landlord to visiting traders from the distant interior, giving them advice and assistance on how to get the best out of their trade goods in the [[colony]]. In this process, he developed close contacts with the Freetown merchants to whom he directed the interior traders.

Dala Modu became the local agent to the European firm of [[Macaulay and Babington]] in 1826. The European agent of that Company, [[Kenneth Macaulay (colonialist)|Kenneth Macaulay]], was a close associate of Dala Modu when he acted as governor in that year. Modu organised the felling and processing of timber for the company from his base at [[Lungi, Sierra Leone#History|Madina]] on the [[Bullom]] Shore, where he had lived since 1806. This was done with a large band of servile labour he retained there. For the 1826 season alone, he received £1,000 as partial payment. In 1834, many [[gold]] traders from the interior came to the colony through him, bringing him much wealth in broker's fees.

Dala Modu used his wealth and business contacts to build for himself a prominent position in the relations between the colony officials and the local rulers in the interior. He was helped in this by his powerful family connections in the Northern River areas (north of the [[Scarcies]]), where his family owned parts of the major trading islands. These came in handy in treaties of cession he negotiated in 1818 and 1825 with the colonial government, which was eager to use these islands, like Matacong and the Isles de Los, as customs posts.

But Dala Modu's personal qualities of diplomacy undoubtedly played a major role in winning the favoured position he came to enjoy. As early as 1802, soon after the rebellion of the Nova Scotian settlers in the colony, Dala Modu was instrumental in convincing the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] chiefs to withdraw their support for the rebels and to hand over the leaders of the uprising to the British. But, in 1806, he was accused of slave trading and other charges. When called to answer these charges, he appeared in Muslim robes rather than the European dress he was used to wearing in Freetown. This angered the British authorities, who proceeded to expel him from the colony. Dala Modu then moved to [[Madina, Port Loko District|Madina]] on the Bullom Shore from where he continued his business activities. It was there that he built up the [[Sosso]] community with migrants coming from the interior. Dala Modu thus because effectively the King of [[Kaffu Bullom Chiefdom|Kafu Bullom]] and [[Loko Masama]], but his influence extended as far as the Port Loko areas. In fact, he became ruler of Rokon on the Rokel in 1837.

The colonial government in Freetown soon realized that it needed Dala Modu's services in settling disputes in the interior. From 1818, when he arranged the cession of the Isles de Los to the British, he started receiving an annual payment from them. Between 1820 and 1841, Dala Modu arranged peace talks on a number of occasions to settle local disputes the Colony Government felt were inhibiting trade. These included the rebellion on the north [[Rokel]] in 1835, and the [[Temne people|Temne]]/[[Loko people|Loko]] war in 1836. Though he did not get along well with some of the governors, succeeding ones were quick to realise his worth and do business with him. Governor [[Henry Dundas Campbell]] visited him in 1835 and was struck by his intelligence and affluent style of living.

When Dala Modu died, over eighty [[cattle|cows]] were slaughtered during his funeral ceremonies, attended by British and African officials from the colony and by many local chiefs from the interior. Dala Modu was among the first indigenous entrepreneurs to take advantage of the new business opportunities arising after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] of the [[slave trade]].

==History==
[[File:delbartonkountzemansion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Luther Kountze's mansion lies in the center of the Delbarton campus |The Kountze Mansion, also known as "Old Main"]]
In the 1880s, [[Luther Kountze]] established an estate in northern New Jersey. He began to buy more land, eventually expanding his estate to cover {{convert|4000|acres}}. This eventually became the home of St. Mary's Abbey/Delbarton, [[Morristown National Historical Park]] and Lewis Morris County Park. Kountze eventually named the estate "Delbarton," borrowing one syllable from the names of each of his first three children (DELancey, BARclay and LivingsTON).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintmarysabbey.org/about-us/abbey-history/the-kountze-family-of-delbarton/index.aspx The Kountze Family of Delbarton] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415185823/http://www.saintmarysabbey.org/about-us/abbey-history/the-kountze-family-of-delbarton/index.aspx |date=April 15, 2013 }}, St. Mary's Abbey. Accessed July 18, 2012. "Luther Kountze had four children: Barclay Ward, William Delancey, Helen Livingston and Annie Ward. The estate was evidently named by borrowing a syllable from each of the first three children's names."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Kountze died, leaving the entire property to his family. The family decided to put the estate for sale. In 1925, the monks of Saint Mary's Abbey, then in Newark, purchased approximately four hundred acres of Delbarton to use as a separate house for younger members for studying, finally settling on the property in 1927.

After some time, the monks decided to open a secondary school, as the Newark residence had done so with [[Saint Benedict's Preparatory School]]. After some deliberation, Abbot Patrick O'Brien opened Delbarton School in 1939, appointing Father Augustine Wirth as the first headmaster. At that time, the school was a boarding school for sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students.

In 1942, Father Stephen Findlay succeeded as Headmaster and introduced drastic changes. The grade levels were modified, ultimately resulting in [[seventh grade|seventh]] through [[twelfth grade]]s being offered. The Kountze carriage house was destroyed in a fire in 1947, leading to the construction of the St. Joseph Gymnasium. Because of the fire, the school chose as its motto, ''"Succisa Virescit"'' (having been cut down, she grows back stronger), borrowing from the often destroyed [[Abbey of Monte Cassino]] in Italy. Trinity Hall opened in 1959, allowing the enrollment to increase to over 300. Father Stephen retired in 1967 to the position of Director of Development. In 1971, the Schmeil-O'Brien Hall dormitory was dedicated, although the majority of students were day students.

Delbarton's fourth headmaster, Father Gerard Lair (1975–1980), initiated more changes. The system of discipline from demerits and detention changed to a conversational program designed to bring about positive changes. As the academic prestige of the School grew, the Board of Trustees decided to terminate the residential program in 1978. The last two resident students graduated in 1983.

Since then, more facilities have been built, with the dedication of the Lynch Athletic Center in 1983, Findlay Science Pavilion in 1995, Fine Arts Center in 2006, the 40 Acres soccer and baseball fields in 2009, and the Cocoziello Field and Posserelli Track in 2010.

Molestation allegations against a monk at Delbarton resulted in lawsuits being filed against the school by two former students who claimed to have been inappropriately touched by the Reverend.&lt;ref&gt;Manahan, Kevin. [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/delbarton_monk_accused_of_sexu.html "Delbarton monk accused of sexual abuse in newest allegations"], NJ Advance Media for [[NJ.com]], June 6, 2012. Accessed December 8, 2017. "The latest in a string of accusations of sexual abuse at the Delbarton School involve a monk, the Rev. Benedict Worry, who has been serving as the pastor of St. Elizabeth of Hungary in Linden and the chaplain for the Linden Police Department. At a press conference on the Morris County courthouse lawn Tuesday, two miles from the private school, Delbarton alumnus Steve Badt and an unnamed former student joined two other alleged abuse victims in a civil lawsuit originally filed in March against the school and St. Mary’s Abbey, which runs the school."&lt;/ref&gt;

== International focus ==
Delbarton has made many efforts to open up the student body to the international community. Over the past few years many respectable speakers have spoken to the student body including [[Dith Pran]] and [[Lech Wałęsa]].

Delbarton students also have several opportunities to travel abroad. The school participates in foreign exchange programs with schools in [[Ireland]], particularly sister school [[Glenstal Abbey School]] in [[County Limerick]], and the Bildungszentrum Markdorf School in [[Markdorf]], [[Germany]]. Juniors can travel to the [[Caribbean]] during the summer between their junior and senior year to learn about the culture and history of select islands through the school's SOL program. Students also have the opportunity to experience eco-tourism first hand in [[Costa Rica]]. Students have visited nature reserves, [[Arenal Volcano]], [[Poás Volcano National Park]] and [[Monteverde]] while studying at the CPI language school in [[Heredia, Costa Rica]]. Delbarton students have also traveled to Spain on several organized summer trips and to Germany for [[World Youth Day]] with the school's religious educator David Hajduk. The school has also sent several students to help assist in [[Operation Smile]] Missions in [[China]], [[Honduras]], and [[Thailand]]. The most recent established trip overseas was a mission trip to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and Hanga, [[Tanzania]], where students donated money and aid to several schools. The school's various musical ensembles also travel to foreign countries to tour and perform.

Students participate in the school's [[Model United Nations]] and Challenge 20/20 clubs. The Model United Nations club participates in four to five Model UN Conferences every year and has attained much success, winning the Best Small Delegation Award at Princeton's 2005 conference, the 2007 Seton Hall University conference, and 2009 WAMUNC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delbarton-model-un.delbarton-school.groupfusion.net/ Delbarton Model UN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919040409/http://delbarton-model-un.delbarton-school.groupfusion.net/ |date=September 19, 2009 }}. Accessed June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The club also participated in The Hague International Model United Nations, held in the [[Netherlands]] from 2006 to 2008.

The blocks are named each school year in keeping with the year's academic theme, which honors figures of heroism, social justice, promoters of worldwide peace, or historically important figures. All students have a thirty-minute free period ("M block") from 10:00 to 10:35 AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delbarton.org/Announcements/index.asp |title=Delbarton School Daily Announcements |work=Delbarton School Website |accessdate=November 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115073850/http://www.delbarton.org/announcements/index.asp |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers, guidance, and college counseling are available during M block and after school for extra assistance as needed. Although the school day ends at 2:40 PM, the first buses do not leave campus until 4:00 PM, which encourages students to pursue extracurricular activities, work with faculty on homework and special projects, and volunteer on one of the many community service projects the school sponsors. Late bus service is also offered at 6:00 PM.

For example, students may take mathematics classes up to 3 years ahead of the nation-wide standard (Algebra 1 in freshman year). Advanced math courses such as Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and AP Statistics are offered, as are independent study options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delbarton.org/academics/academic-program/Mathematics/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140503065533/http://www.delbarton.org/academics/academic-program/Mathematics/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2014 |title=Delbarton School: Academics: Mathematics |accessdate=May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language and literature courses are also offered in several languages.

The '''Euro Banking Association''' (EBA) is an [[industry forum]] for the European [[payments industry]] with close to 200 member banks and organisations from the European Union and across the world aimed at fostering and driving pan-European payment initiatives. Through its industry initiatives and the euro payment systems it has delivered, the EBA is a key contributor to the creation of a standardised [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA).

== History and structure ==
The Euro Banking Association (EBA) was founded in Paris in 1985 by 18 commercial banks and the [[European Investment Bank]]. The [[European Commission]] as well as the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) supported the founding of the EBA. Since then, the number of members has risen to almost 200. The institutions come from all member states of the [[European Union]] as well as from Norway, Switzerland, Australia, China, Japan, the [[United Arab Emirates]] and the United States.

In its early years, the agenda of the EBA included the promotion of the [[European Monetary Union]] (EMU) and the development and management of a private industry ECU clearing system stretching across Europe.

For the start of the EMU, the EBA delivered EURO1, a [[Real-time gross settlement|RTGS]]-equivalent large-value payment system for single [[euro]] transactions. The EBA also developed [[EBA Clearing#STEP1|STEP1]], a payment service for single euro payments of high priority and urgency for small and medium-sized banks, and [[EBA Clearing#STEP2|STEP2]], a Pan-European Automated Clearing House (PE-ACH), which processes euro retail payments. All three payment systems are run by [[EBA Clearing]].

As the largest network of payment practitioners with a pan-European mindset and vision, the EBA provides a country-neutral forum for discussing and driving payment initiatives. Based on the support of its unique membership, the EBA contributes to the development and improvement of pan-European business practices in co-operation with regulatory and industry bodies. The communication and explanation of these business practices and other industry developments to its membership and to the wider industry constitute another important part of the EBA’s mission.

Once a year, the EBA brings together its member banks and organisations as well as other stakeholders in the market for a pan-European payments conference entitled EBAday.

The association is based in [[Paris]].

The [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] article 169 enables the EU to follow the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] to protect consumers "health, safety and economic interests" and promote rights to "information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests".&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_XV:_Consumer_Protection art 169]&lt;/ref&gt; All member states may grant higher protection, and a "high level of consumer protection" is regarded as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 169(3) and the [[CFREU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#Article_38_.E2.80.93_Consumer_protection art 38]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the [[Product Liability Directive 1985]], [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]], [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005]] and the [[Consumer Rights Directive 2011]], requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the [[Consumer Bill of Rights]] proclaimed by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to [[information asymmetry|lack information]], and they have [[Inequality of bargaining power|less bargaining power]].&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"&gt;See ''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10], [39] and ''[[Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores]]'' (2000) C-240/98 to C-244/98 and [2000] ECR I-4941, [25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ehrwald - SPAR interior.jpg|thumb|left|Due to their [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal bargaining power]],&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"/&gt; consumers are entitled to a legislative "charter of rights" to safe and healthy products, fair terms, proper information free from misleading advertising and marketing, and rights of cancellation.]]
The [[Product Liability Directive 1985]] was the first consumer protection measure. It creates [[Strict liability|strict]] [[enterprise liability]] for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, as a way to promote basic standards of health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Product Liability Directive 1985]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0374:en:HTML 85/374/EEC], recital 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is [[insolvent]], of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1985 arts 1 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; A "defect" is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to [[Externality|externalise]] the risks of its activities.

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]] was the second main measure.&lt;ref&gt;[[UTCCD 1993]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0013:EN:HTML 93/13/EC] and see [[H Collins]], 'Good Faith in European Contract Law' (1994) 14 OJLS 229&lt;/ref&gt; Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, if it is not "individually negotiated| and "if, contrary to the requirement of [[good faith]], it causes a [[Just price|significant imbalance]] in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer". The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his [[bargaining power]] and his [[Information asymmetry|level of knowledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10]&lt;/ref&gt; Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to "[[good faith]]" and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;See further, for the history behind the parallel in [[German contract law]], [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] §307 ''Münchener Kommentar zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch'' §307 Rn 32&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'', clauses in gas supply contracts enabling the German utiliies company [[RWE]] to vary unilaterally prices were advised by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] to be insufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'' (2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0092&amp;rid=3 C-92/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Brusse v Jahani BV]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0488&amp;qid=1413899840951&amp;from=EN C-488/11]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In ''[[Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya]]'', following the [[global financial crisis]], the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts.&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62011CJ0415:EN:HTML Case C-415/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s.]]'', the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the [[right to housing]], in the event that a home could be repossessed.&lt;ref&gt;(2014) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62013CJ0034&amp;from=EN Case C-34/13]&lt;/ref&gt; Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s case law.

'''George Hampel''' (August 27, 1885 &amp;ndash; May 15, 1954) was an [[Americans|American]] politician, [[accountant]] and [[bookseller]] from [[Milwaukee]] who served one term in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] as a Socialist (1931–1932) and two terms in the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] as a Progressive (1937–1944). Hampel at various times identified himself as a [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democrat]]/[[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]], and [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Progressive]]; and joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] when the Progressives rejoined the latter party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf ''Members of the Wisconsin Legislature, 1848-1999'' Madison: State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, 1999; pp. 10, 61] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209014416/http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Hampel was born in Milwaukee in 1885. He was educated at [[Milwaukee High School of the Arts|West Division High School]], part of the [[Milwaukee Public Schools]], and also took classes at the [[International Correspondence Schools]] and Hesse's Art School. Hampel was an accountant and president of Hampel's Book Shop, Inc.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, Howard F. &amp; Bryhan, Leone G. (eds.) ''The Wisconsin Blue Book: 1942''. Madison: The State Printing Office, 1942; p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
He began his political career in 1916 by running unsuccessfully for [[State Treasurer of Wisconsin]] as a [[Sewer Socialists|Social Democrat, as they were called in Wisconsin]], receiving only 31,329 votes to Republican [[Merlin Hull]]'s 232,171.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1917&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1917.p0518 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1917]'', p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he was appointed to the Milwaukee [[Motion Picture]] Commission, a [[film censorship]] body; he would remain on the Commission until 1940.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Hampel was soon elected as county clerk of [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], serving from 1919 to 1920 &lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1919&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1919.p0175 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1919]'', p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as clerk, Hampel testified and wrote an affidavit in support of fellow Wisconsin socialist [[Victor Berger]] for the Congressman's [[House of Representatives of the United States|House]] hearings regarding whether he should be seated.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jwY9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA367 Victor L. Berger Hearings before the Special Committee, vol. 1]'' p. 367 &amp; ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8cuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 vol. 2]'', p. 351. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he was a delegate to the Convention of the Socialist Party of America.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/05/10/112660017.pdf 6,000 Socialists Cheer for Debs]", ''New York Times'' May 20, 1920 at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ten years away from elected office, Hampel won election as a Socialist to the Wisconsin State Assembly representing Milwaukee County's third Assembly district in 1930, winning 2994 votes versus Republican Frank G. Pope's 2,058, and Democrat John H. Stemper's 545.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1931&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1931.p0609 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1931]'', pp. 572, 577, 609.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he ran for the Wisconsin State Senate's [[Wisconsin Senate, District 6|Sixth District]] seat, but lost to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Charles H. Phillips]]. Phillips received 14,885 votes; Hampel 13,951; Republican George W. Becker 3,433; and former Republican Assemblyman (running as an [[independent (politics)|independent]]) [[Martin M. Higgins]] 267&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1933&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1933.p0572 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1933]'', p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; Hampel was successful when he ran again for the seat in 1936, this time running as a [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Progressive]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1937&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1937.p0450 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1937]'', p. 450. Hampel received 22,093 votes; Republican Phillips 14,136; Democrat Salendon Bennett 4,982.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected as a Progressive in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1942&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1942.p0687 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1940]'', p. 687. Hampel received 24,106 votes; Democrat Albert C. Treichler 9,095; and Republican Andre J. Rockne 13,616.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hampel had been a member of both the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the Wisconsin Progressive Party, he left the Socialists in 1941 after that party ordered its members to quit the Progressive Party.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5gUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-iIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2912,1380789 To Quit or Not, Party Debates]" ''Milwaukee Journal'' September 3, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a vice chairman and Milwaukee County chairman of the state Progressive Party in the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KTYdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EiMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3750,3279520 Progressives Answer Hoan]", ''Milwaukee Journal'' January 24, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1940&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1940.p0504 Wisconsin Blue Book, 1940]'', p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to keep his state senate seat when he ran without any party affiliation in 1944, losing to Democrat [[Edward W. Reuther]]. Reuther received 22,163 votes; Republican Arthur H. Schroeder  17,272; Hampel 4,222; and Socialist former Assemblyman and Senator [[Alex C. Ruffing]] 3,112 votes.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=WI.WIBlueBk1948.p0705&amp;id=WI.WIBlueBk1948 Wisconsin Blue Books, 1948]'', p. 705&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Wisconsin Progressive Party no longer remained a viable third party after the 1944 elections, Hampel and his son argued against joining the Democrats and instead favored rejoining the [[Republican Party of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FakWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6673,2068915 Progressives to Take Time]" ''Milwaukee Journal'' December 5, 1944, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Hampel then helped to lead the Progressives back into the Republican Party fold after the declining party voted in favor of such a merger on March 17, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19460326&amp;id=6gIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3714,4469278 Roberts Quits Job with Progressives]" ''Milwaukee Journal'', March 26, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ABsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ISUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2953,4578450 Hampel Backs Reuss in Race]" ''Milwaukee Journal'', December 19, 1947 at 4. ("With his father, George Hampel, sr., a former Socialist leader, he helped lead the Progressives back in to the Republican fold in 1946.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.'''

HHI was founded in 1972 by [[Chung Ju-yung]] as a division of the [[Hyundai Group]], and in 1974, completed building its first ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Made in Korea: Chung Ju Yung and the Rise of Hyundai|first1=Richard |last1=Steers |publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-92050-6|page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UecUDMPIUIUC&amp;dq=Made+in+Korea:+Chung+Ju+Yung+and+the+Rise+of+Hyundai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the company was spun-off from its parent company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.hhi.co.kr/about/glance HHI At a Glance], HHI website, About-Us Page.  Downloaded Nov. 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  HHI has four core business divisions: Shipbuilding, Offshore &amp; Engineering, Industrial Plant &amp; Engineering, and Engine &amp; Machinery. HHI also has five non-core related subsidiaries: Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Hyundai Construction Equipment, Hyundai Robotics, Hyundai Heavy Industries Green Energy, and Hyundai Global Service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/hyundai-heavy-industries-spins-off-six-separate-companies/amp/ Hyundai Heavy Industries Spins Off into Six Separate Companies] Marine Insight News.  Nov. 18, 2016.  Downloaded Nov. 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hyundai Group started as a small South Korean construction firm in 1947, headed by its founder, Korean entrepreneur Chung Ju-Yung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/185337|title=The last emperor|accessdate=11 January 2012|publisher=The Economist|date=4 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another widely known and closely related [[South Korea|Korean]] company, the [[Hyundai Motor Company]], was founded in 1967, five years prior to the founding of the Heavy Industry Group. The motor company was also founded by Chung. 

The name is an informal romanisation of the Korean {{lang-ko|[[:wikt:현대|현대]]|label=none}} (''hyeondae'') meaning "contemporary", which was Chung's vision for the group of companies that he founded.

'''Life Sciences Foundation (LSF)''' was a San Francisco-based [[nonprofit organization]] that was established in 2011 to collect, preserve, interpret, and promote the history of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Tells the Story of Biotechnology |date=March 6, 2013|author=Stephanie Fischer |url=http://www.phrma.org/life-sciences-foundation-tells-the-story-of-biotechnology#sthash.1cg0P5hW.dpuf |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSF conducted historical research,  maintained archives and published  historically relevant materials and information.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012"&gt;{{citation |date=May 1, 2012 |volume=32 |number=9 |title=Telling the Story of Biotechnology: Life Sciences Foundation Formed to Help People Understand Why Biotech History Matters |author=Donna Loc |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/telling-the-story-of-biotechnology/4087/ |publisher=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their public support of climate-science denier Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in 2018 caused a backlash against the foundation and eroded their scientific credibility.

On December 1, 2015, the LSF and the '''Chemical Heritage Foundation''' finalized a merger, creating one organization that covers "the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/history|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite news|title=CHF and LSF Announce Merger|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chf-and-lsf-announce-merger-300159747.html|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=Oct 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the '''[[Science History Institute]]''', to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Stephan|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation is morphing into the Science History Institute|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/chemical-heritage-foundation-science-history-institute-philadelphia-20180103.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization is headquartered in [[Philadelphia]] but retains offices in the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Mandate==

The LSF mandate was to collect and promote the history of biotechnology. This includes telling the stories of "scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and financiers" in order to "humanize" biotechnology to a lay audience.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; The history of the biotechnology industry includes examining the complex relationships and socio-political dynamics that occur when science and entrepreneurship come together.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bio.org/node/3423 |publisher= [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO) |date=nd |title=Related Organizations &amp; State Affiliates |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a foundation that would collect and share the history of biotechnology came about at a meeting in early January 2009 in San Francisco attended by G. Steven Burrill of Burrill &amp; Company, [[Dennis Gillings]] of [[Quintiles]] in Durham, NC,, John Lechleiter of [[Eli Lilly &amp; Co.]], [[Henri Termeer]], then CEO of [[Genzyme]] and Arnold Thackray, founding President and CEO of the [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] (CHF)&lt;ref name="LSF_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSF_about"&gt;{{citation |url=http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021014715/http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-21 |date=nd |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |title=About |work=Life Sciences Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Five years ago, G. Steven Burrill was part of a small group of biotech leaders who came together to discuss the importance of capturing the great stories and lessons of the biotech pioneers for future generations. From this meeting, the Life Sciences Foundation was formed in 2010.|Life Sciences Foundation 2014}}

Thackray had shaped Chemical Heritage Foundation—"the premier institution preserving the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related sciences and technologies." Oral history was one component of the CHF mandate of preserving interpreting, and promoting the history of science.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COH"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/center-for-oral-history |title=Center for Oral History |work= [[Science History Institute]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[American Chemical Society]] had launched the Center for the History of Chemistry which was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Thackray, a Fellow of [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Historical Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]],&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/profile/arnold-thackray |title=Arnold Thackray |website= Science History Institute |date=February 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackray received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the history of science from Cambridge University.&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012" /&gt;

Thackray argued that before LSF was founded, the recorded history of biotechnology was "fragmented, uneven, and rather paltry." He observed that, "If you don't write your own history, somebody else will do it for you, and they may be hostile."&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

{{quote|There is a valuable heritage here. The life sciences will shape the course of the 21st century. We need to preserve their history. We need to teach young people about the world in which they live ... Records are being scattered, memories are fading, stories are disappearing. Once lost, they're gone forever.|Arnold Thackray}}

By the end of 2011, LSF's steering committee of industry leaders— [[Joshua Boger]], Robert Carpenter, Bob Coughlin, [[Henri Termeer]] and Peter Wirth— were promoting the foundation's work by encouraging scientists and industrialists who were members of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, to contribute potential stories and materials to the archival record of the history of biotechnology in Boston and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012" /&gt;

== Oral History Program ==

The Life Sciences Foundation conducted [[oral history]] interviews with scientists, entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers, and leaders of thought in the biotechnology industry.&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; LSF's hosts timelines, transcripts and audio recordings and provides links to existing oral histories housed at institutions across the globe.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |title=Q&amp;A with Arnold Thackray, President &amp; CEO of the Life Sciences Foundation - News - |work=[[Massachusetts Biotechnology Council]] MassBio (MBC) |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111073955/http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archives ==

Original documentary materials pertinent to the history of biotechnology and the life sciences are being collected. The materials include personal papers and correspondence, donated company records, laboratory notebooks, photographs, video and audio recordings. Collected materials will be guided to permanent repositories in appropriate institutional settings.  Electronic reproductions will be made available to scholars, journalists, educators, and the general public in a digital archive.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/life-sciences-foundation-looks-capture-history-biotech |work=Bioworld |date=February 2, 2012 |author=Morrison, Trista |accessdate= July 19, 2015 |title=Life Sciences Foundation Looks to Capture History of Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

LSF historians work on a range of publications including a quarterly magazine, scholarly articles, white papers, and books. These works are intended for multiple audiences and focused on the emergence and evolution of biotechnologies in pharmaceutical discovery and development, agriculture, energy production, and [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt; In October 2011, the [[University of Chicago Press]] released ''Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech'' by Life Sciences Foundation historian Sally Smith Hughes.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes_2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech |author=Sally Smith Hughes |pages=232 |date=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==

Founding partners of the Life Sciences Foundation include Burrill, [[Celgene]], John Lechleiter, [[Genentech]], Henri Termeer, [[Merck &amp; Co.]], Millennium, [[Pfizer]], [[Quintiles]], and [[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Thermo Fisher]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor, [[Phillip Allen Sharp|Phillip Sharp]], serves as LSF's academic advisor.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; Its executive and advisory board members are leaders from biotech, venture capital, academic institutions and trade associations.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

When Thackray retired in 2012, Heather R. Erickson, 34, was appointed as LSF President and CEO and member of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="CEO_2012"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Names Heather R.

[[Pepsi]], the carbonated [[beverage]], has had many advertising spokespersons over the years. [[PepsiCo]]'s other drink brands, including [[Mountain Dew]] and [[Gatorade]], also have a variety of famous spokespersons.

==History==
Celebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products.

===United States===
[[Joan Crawford]] was married to PepsiCo president [[Alfred Steele]] from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973.

During the 1960s, [[Joanie Sommers]] sang two popular commercial songs ("It's Pepsi, for those who think young" and "Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as "The Pepsi Girl"
in 1974 Joseph Nicoletti, then of Brooklyn N.Y. now music-film consultant, Laguna Beach, California, sung and produced the theme "You're Drinking Diet Pepsi and it Shows." Hal Linden (Barney Miller) did the voice over and it was a BBD&amp;O hit Commercial. Nicoletti was signed by legendary ad man Phil Dusenberry. Inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, Dusenberry wrote the script "The Natural." Dusenberry said Nicoletti was one of the best singing Voices in the business.

In 1984, [[Michael Jackson]] signed a contract with Pepsi that produced many commercials and world tours through 1993.

During the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer [[Chayanne]] was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles.

In the early 1990s, [[Ray Charles]] was the star of a [[Diet Pepsi]] campaign called "[[You Got the Right One, Baby]]," which was also known as "Uh-huh."

During the late 1990s the [[Spice Girls]] became the face of Pepsi with the tagline “Generation Next” inspired by their song [[Move Over]] from their album ''[[Spiceworld (album)|Spiceworld]]''. Promotion included TV commercials, CD singles for the promo single "Step to Me", and collectible cans and glasses with each Spice Girl on a different can or cup.

In 2001, [[Britney Spears]] became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and [[Enrique Iglesias]]. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song "[[We Will Rock You]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] set in a Roman gladiator arena.

In 2004, Beyoncé, [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[David Beckham]] all starred in a commercial for the brand together, featuring the two singers as assassin-like characters. 

In 2005, [[Christina Aguilera]] was signed to promote the popular drink (she was previously promoting Coca-Cola in 2000).  The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States.  Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. [[Aretha Franklin]] was also a spokesperson in 1998. And also in 1999 [[Janet Jackson]] signed on to the original "Ask For More" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson.

In 2006, PepsiCo and Motorola launched the "Cool Tones" campaign. It involved [[Mariah Carey]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[The All American Rejects]] writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. The artists also filmed commercials for the campaign in which they perform their original ringtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/2605/introducing_ringtone_music_videos/news/ |title=Introducing … Ringtone Music Videos! |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-original-ringtones-by-mariah-carey-mary-j-blige-and-the-all-american-rejects-now-available-exclusively-through-the-pepsi-cool-tones--motorola-phones-promotion-56349032.html |title=New Original Ringtones by Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All-American Rejects Now Available |website=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Beyoncé was signed to promote Pepsi once again. This campaign will be her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 — and her face will be on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign is estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyoncé’s fee and what Pepsi calls a creative content development fund.

[[Nicki Minaj]] signed a promotional deal with Pepsi in February 2012. A commercial was released which includes her hit single, "[[Moment 4 Life]]", on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm.

[[NASCAR]] driver [[Jeff Gordon]] is a spokesperson for Pepsi, and was sponsored by the company starting in 1997 as an associate sponsor, and sponsored Gordon in the [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] for two seasons. Since 2001, Pepsi has served as sponsor for Gordon in at least two races per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/sponsors.html|title=Jeff Gordon's Sponsors|work=Gordonline.com|accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Drew Brees]] and musical group [[One Direction]] co-starred in a Pepsi commercial.

In 2017, model and television personality [[Kendall Jenner]] starred in a commercial premiering the week of April 1 which caused much controversy over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/pepsi-ad-internet-response/|title=Pepsi’s New Kendall Jenner Ad Was So Bad It Actually United the Internet|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and the United Kingdom===
For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, Pepsi was the title sponsor of Suzuki's effort in motorcycle road racing's premier class, Grand Prix 500cc. The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors.

During 1988-9, [[Suzuki]] also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!---this is awful. Needs rewording at best. Deletion would be better---&gt;

In 1998, the group [[Spice Girls]] have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song "[[Move Over|Move Over (Generation Next)]]".

Since 2001, [[Sakis Rouvas]] has been a spokesperson in the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Balkan]] campaign under contract with the headquarters of [[United Kingdom]], being the only Greek artist to have ever been proposed to represent the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mad.tv/news/?id=3509|script-title=el:Σόκαρε ο Σάκης!|publisher=''[[MAD TV (Greece)|MAD TV]]''|accessdate=2009-01-30|language=Greek|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/665CuZo8x?url=http://www.mad.tv/news/?id=3509|archivedate=2012-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since summer 2009, [[Inna]] is the spokeswoman in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and secondly in [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]]. She promoted Pepsi mostly in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria through TV commercials and internet adverts. Some commercials have been translated from Romanian into Bulgarian or even Hungarian.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, [[Colombian people|Colombian]] artists [[Shakira]], and [[Juanes]]; [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Daddy Yankee]] have promoted the soft drink. Spanish-speaking [[Jaci Velasquez]] did some commercials. In 2007 [[RBD]] promoted the drink in their home country of [[Mexico]].

===Asia===
As for Asia, celebrity and singers [[Show Lo]], [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Jay Chou]], [[Aaron Kwok]], [[Jolin Tsai]], [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]], [[Louis Koo]], [[Nicholas Tse]], [[F4 (band)|F4]], [[Faye Wong]], [[Kelly Chen|Kelly Chan]], [[Momo Wu]], [[Bamboo Mañalac]], [[Jericho Rosales]], [[Jackson Wang]], [[Daniel Padilla]] and [[Julia Barretto]] have appeared in several different advertisements.

In [[Pakistan]],  Pepsi sponsors the [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan cricket team]] and many Pakistani celebrities and personalities have been spokespersons for the brand including [[Hadiqa Kiani]], [[Junaid Jamshed]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Bob Woolmer]], [[Younus Khan]], [[Kamran Akmal]], [[Adnan Sami]],  [[Reema Khan]], [[Call (Pakistani band)|Call]], and [[Vital Signs (pop band)|Vital Signs]].

In India, Pepsi first used [[Aamir Khan]], model turned actress [[Mahima Chaudhary]] and model and ex-Miss World [[Aishwariya Rai]] to promote its product. Later it used [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shahrukh Khan]], [[Kajol]], [[Rani Mukherjee]],  [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Fardeen Khan]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Shahid Kapoor]] (before he entered the movie world), [[Preity Zinta]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Ram Charan Teja]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], and [[Kareena Kapoor]] as well as the national [[cricket]] team. Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone were signed for Pepsi's Youngistan campaign which targeted the youth.

===Australia===
In Australia, the trend has been to use local Australian celebrities to promote Pepsi including [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Jennifer Hawkins]] (Miss Universe 2004), [[Holly Valance]], [[Harry Kewell]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Mark Philippoussis]] and several others including New Zealander [[Sonny Bill Williams]]

== Troubled endorsers ==
Pepsi has had a notorious association with spokespersons, primarily popstars, over the last 25 years.

* The first international popstar to become a spokesperson for the drink was [[Michael Jackson]], who along with his brothers ([[The Jackson 5]]) advertised Pepsi for "the new generation" in an advertisement featuring a reworking of his song "[[Billie Jean]]". However, when filming a second advertisement in 1984, a pyrotechnics stunt went wrong and badly burnt Jackson.
* In 1987, [[David Bowie]] and [[Tina Turner]] joined forces to advertise the soft drink, in an advertisement featuring a reworking of Bowie's hit "[[Modern Love (song)|Modern Love]]." The company also agreed to sponsor Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider World Tour. Bowie was accused of sexual assault shortly afterwards, and the company dropped the advertisements immediately. Two years later, Pepsi's attempts to make [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] a new Pepsi spokesperson ended with the infamous "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" incident when Madonna's video brought charges of [[anti-Catholicism]] to the company.
* In August 2002, Pepsi pulled a national, 30-second commercial featuring multiplatinum rapper [[Ludacris]] from the air after Fox's [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called for a boycott of the soft drink company. O'Reilly characterized Pepsi as "immoral" for using the rapper, whom he described as a "rap thug." O'Reilly referenced several of Ludacris's lyrics, which he said emphasized a lifestyle that included getting intoxicated, selling drugs, fighting people, and degrading women. The issue resurfaced when Pepsi began to run ads with [[The Osbournes]], a move that [[Russell Simmons]], head of the Hip Hop Summit Action Network categorized as racially insensitive. The company maintained that Ludacris was an inappropriate spokesman because of his usage of language, but Simmons and the HHSAN contended that the Osbournes use of language was just as unacceptable. The final accord reached between the two parties had Pepsi make an annual contribution of $1 million to the Ludacris Foundation (an organization that helps middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts) for three years. In addition, the HHSAN helped Pepsi find other community-based organizations to support. Simmons made it clear that he would not accept any money for any charitable organization that he was involved in. While Pepsi offered to shoot a new series of ads on hip-hop history with Ludacris, the rapper declined and additionally stated through Simmons that he did not want his previous ads to re-air.
* According to allhiphop.com, in 2005, a rumor spread that the newest spokesperson for Pepsi, [[Kanye West]], was dropped after a comment made against President [[George W. Bush]]. Nicole Bradley, public relations manager of Pepsi, clarified that the company's relationship with West had not changed and their marketing will continue as planned.

== History ==
While it can be contested that the history of management information systems date as far back as companies using ledgers to keep track of accounting, the modern history of MIS can be divided into five ''eras'' originally identified by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] and Jane Laudon in their seminal textbook ''Management Information Systems.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm|last1=Laudon|first1=Kenneth C.|last2=Laudon|first2=Jane P.|publisher=Prentice Hall/CourseSmart|year=2009|edition=11|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bizfluent.com/about-5444925-history-management-information-systems.html|title=The History of Management Information Systems|last=Boykin|first=George|date=2017-09-26|website=bizfluent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* First Era – [[Mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]] computing
* Second Era – [[Personal computer]]s
* Third Era – [[Client/server]] networks
* Fourth Era – [[Enterprise computing]] 
* Fifth Era – [[Cloud computing]]

The ''first era'' (mainframe and minicomputer computing) was ruled by [[IBM]] and their mainframe computers for which they supplied both the hardware and software. These computers would often take up whole rooms and require teams to run them. As technology advanced, these computers were able to handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.

The ''second era'' (personal computers) began in 1965 as microprocessors started to compete with mainframes and minicomputers and accelerated the process of decentralizing computing power from large data centers to smaller offices. In the late 1970s, minicomputer technology gave way to personal computers and relatively low-cost computers were becoming mass market commodities, allowing businesses to provide their employees access to computing power that ten years before would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. This proliferation of computers created a ready market for interconnecting networks and the popularization of the Internet. (The first microprocessor — a four-bit device intended for a programmable calculator — was introduced in 1971 and microprocessor-based systems were not readily available for several years. The MITS Altair 8800 was the first commonly known microprocessor-based system, followed closely by the Apple I and II.  It is arguable that the microprocessor-based system did not make significant inroads into minicomputer use until 1979, when [[VisiCalc]] prompted record sales of the Apple II on which it ran. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 was more broadly palatable to business, but its limitations gated its ability to challenge minicomputer systems until perhaps the late 1980s to early 1990s.)

The ''third era'' (client/server networks) arose as technological complexity increased, costs decreased, and the end-user (now the ordinary employee) required a system to [[Information sharing|share information]] with other employees within an enterprise. Computers on a common network shared information on a server. This lets thousands and even millions of people access data simultaneously on networks referred to as [[Intranet|Intranets]]. 

The ''fourth era'' (enterprise computing) enabled by high speed networks, consolidated the original department specific software applications into integrated software platforms referred to as [[enterprise software]]. This new platform tied all aspects of the business enterprise together offering rich information access encompassing the complete management structure.

The ''fifth era'' (cloud computing) is the latest and employs networking technology to deliver applications as well as data storage independent of the configuration, location, or nature of the hardware. This, along with high speed [[cellphone]] and [[Wi-Fi]] networks, has led to new levels of mobility in which managers may access the MIS remotely with [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computers]] and [[smartphones]].

== Terminology ==
The terms management information systems (MIS), [[information system|information system (IS)]] , [[enterprise resource planning|enterprise resource planning (ERP)]], [[computer science]], [[Computer engineering|electrical computer engineering]], and [[information technology management]] (IT) are often confused. MIS is a hierarchical subset of information systems. MIS are more organization-focused narrowing in on leveraging information technology to increase business value. Computer science is more software-focused dealing with the applications that may be used in MIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/what-is-mis|title=What is MIS?|last=The University of Arizona|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical computer engineering is product-focused mainly dealing with the architecture behind computer systems. ERP software is a subset of MIS and IT management refers to the technical management of an IT department which may include MIS.

== Management ==
While management information systems can be used by any and every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the [[chief information officer]]s (CIO) and [[chief technology officer]]s (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. They act as decision makers in the implementation process of new MIS.

Once decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. They are also in charge of implementing the policies affecting the MIS (either new specific policies passed down by the CIOs or CTOs or policies that align the new systems with the organizations overall IT policy). It is also their role to ensure the availability of data and network services as well as the security of the data involved by coordinating IT activities.

Upon implementation, the assigned users will have the appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS need necessarily be management level. It is common practice to have inputs to MIS be inputted by non-managerial employees though they rarely have access to the reports and decision support platforms offered by these systems.

== Types ==
The following are types of information systems used to create reports, extract data, and assist in the decision making processes of middle and operational level managers.

* [[Decision support system|Decision support systems (DSS)]] are computer program applications used by middle and higher management to compile information from a wide range of sources to support problem solving and decision making. A DSS is used mostly for semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. 
* [[Executive information system|Executive information systems (EIS)]] is a reporting tool that provides quick access to summarized reports coming from all company levels and departments such as accounting, human resources and operations.
* [[Marketing Information System|Marketing information system]]s are management Information Systems designed specifically for managing the [[marketing]] aspects of the business.
*[[Accounting information system]]s are focused [[accounting]] functions. 
*[[Human resource management system]]s are used for personnel aspects. 
* [[Office automation|Office automation systems (OAS)]] support communication and productivity in the enterprise by automating [[workflow]] and eliminating bottlenecks. OAS may be implemented at any and all levels of management.
* [[School Information Management System|School Information Management Systems (SIMS)]] cover school administration, often including teaching and learning materials.
* [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise resource planning (ERP)]] software facilitates the flow of information between all business functions inside the boundaries of the organization and manage the connections to outside stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Bidgoli, Hossein, (2004).

* [[Database|Local Databases]], can be small, simplistic tools for managers and are considered to be a primal or base level version of a MIS.

== Advantages ==
The following are some of the benefits that can be attained using MIS:&lt;ref&gt; (1995), Strategic Information Systems Planning: A Review, Information Resources Management Association International Conference, May 21–24, Atlanta.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies are able to identify their strengths and weaknesses due to the presence of revenue reports, employees' performance record etc. Identifying these aspects can help a company improve its business processes and operations.
* Giving an overall picture of the company. 
* Acting as a communication and planning tool.
* The availability of customer data and feedback can help the company to align its [[business process]]es according to the needs of its customers. The effective management of customer data can help the company to perform direct marketing and promotion activities.
*MIS can help a company gain a [[competitive advantage]].
*MIS reports can help with decision-making as well as reduce downtime for actionable items.

== Enterprise applications ==
* ''Enterprise systems''—also known as ''[[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)'' systems—provide integrated software modules and a unified database that personnel use to plan, manage, and control core business processes across multiple locations. Modules of ERP systems may include finance, accounting, marketing, human resources, production, inventory management, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = A | last2 = Ferreira | first2 = C. | last3 = Bento | first3 = E. | last4 = Aparicio | first4 = F. | year = 2016 | title = Enterprise resource planning adoption and satisfaction determinants | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 659–671 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Supply chain management]] (SCM)'' systems enable more efficient management of the supply chain by integrating the links in a supply chain. This may include suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and final customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Supply Chain Management: The Next Big Thing?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/supply-chain-management-the-next-big-thing-09122011.html|work=Sept. 12, 2011|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">'''''Orange-Book-Standard''''' (Az. KZR 39/06) is a decision issued on May 6, 2009 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] ({{lang-de|Bundesgerichtshof}}, BGH) on the interaction between [[patent law]] and [[technical standard|standards]], and more generally between [[intellectual property law]] and [[competition law]]. The Court held that a defendant, accused of [[patent infringement]] and who was not able to obtain a [[Licensing#Intellectual_property|license]] from the patentee, may defend himself, under certain conditions, by invoking an [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|abuse of a dominant market position]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Straus]], [http://jeclap.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/3/189 "Patent Application: Obstacle for Innovation and Abuse of Dominant Position under Article 102 TFEU?"], Journal of European Competition Law &amp; Practice (2010) 1 (3): 189-201, footnote 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Orange-Book-Standard" comes from the [[Rainbow Books|Orange Book]] that contained the format specifications for [[CD-R]]s, the technology at issue in the case that led to the Orange-Book-Standard decision.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schweizer, [http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2010/03/dutch-see-orange-book-differently.html "Dutch see Orange Book differently; Philips prevails again"], IPKat, March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki''' (March 13, 1909 in [[Magetan]], [[Dutch East Indies]] – 1998) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[field hockey]] player who competed in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. He had a professional career as agricultural engineer, was married to [[Lilie van Thiel]] (born 1913), and was the son of [[Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki, Sr.|Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki]] and [[Anna Catharina Cramer]].

He was a squad member of the Dutch field hockey team, which won the silver medal in the 1928 Olympics. He was a reserve player and did not play a single match.

He played from 1926 to 1930 as back in the hockey teams of [[Bloemendaal]], [[H.H.C]] (1930), the [[Netherlands National Student Hockey Team]], and the [[Netherlands National Hockey Team]]. He also played lawn tennis and rowed at [[W.S.R. Argo]] in 1936.

After graduating in 1937 from [[Wageningen University]] with a degree in tropical agriculture, Muller von Czernicki eventually became the CEO of Rubber Cultuur Maatschappij "Amsterdam" (RCMA), now [[Acomo (Amsterdam Commodities)|''Amsterdam Commodities'' (Acomo)]], a company with thousands of employees that, until 1957 when [[Indonesia]] nationalized all plantations, primarily managed rubber and palm oil plantations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8975">'''Performance improvement''' is measuring the output of a particular [[business process]] or procedure, then modifying the process or procedure to increase the [[Output (economics)|output]], increase [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], or increase the effectiveness of the process or procedure. Performance improvement can be applied to either individual performance such as an athlete or organizational performance such as a racing team or a commercial business.

In [[organizational development]], performance improvement is organizational change in which the [[Management|managers]] and [[Board of directors|governing body]] of an [[organization]] put into place and manage a program which measures the current level of performance of the organization and then generates ideas for modifying [[organizational behavior]] and [[infrastructure]] which are put into place to achieve higher output. The primary goals of organizational improvement are to increase [[organizational effectiveness]] and [[organizational efficiency|efficiency]] to improve the ability of the organization to deliver goods and or services.  A third area sometimes targeted for improvement is [[organizational efficacy]], which involves the process of setting organizational goals and objectives.

Performance improvement at the operational or individual [[employee]] level usually involves processes such as [[statistical quality control]].  At the organizational level, performance improvement usually involves softer forms of measurement such as [[customer satisfaction]] surveys which are used to obtain qualitative information about performance from the viewpoint of customers.

The [[United States Coast Guard]] has published the ''Performance Improvement Guide (PIG)'',&lt;ref name="USCG PIG"&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg095/cg09541/docs/5th%20edition%20PIG.pdf US Coast Guard Performance Improvement Guide (PIG)], 5th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; which describes various processes and tools for [[performance management]] at the individual and organizational levels.

Performance is a measure of the results achieved.  Performance efficiency is the ratio between effort expended and results achieved.  The difference between current performance and the theoretical performance limit is the performance improvement zone.

Another way to think of performance improvement is to see it as improvement in four potential areas. First are the resource input requirements (e.g., reduced [[working capital]], material, replacement or reorder time, and set-up requirements). Second, is the THROUGHPUT requirements, often viewed as process efficiency; this is measured in terms of time, waste, and resource utilization. Third, OUTPUT requirements, often viewed from a cost/price, quality, functionality perspective. Fourth, OUTCOME requirements, did it end up making a difference.

Performance is an abstract concept and must be represented by concrete, measurable phenomena or events to be measured.  [[Baseball]] athlete performance is abstract covering many different types of activities.  [[Batting average]] is a concrete measure of a particular performance attribute for a particular game role, batting, for the game of baseball.

Performance assumes an actor of some kind but the actor could be an individual person or a group of people acting in concert.  The performance platform is the infrastructure or devices used in the performance act.

There are two main ways to improve performance: improving the measured attribute by using the performance platform more effectively, or by improving the measured attribute by modifying the performance platform, which in turn allows a given level of use to be more effective in producing the desired output.

For instance, in several sports such as [[tennis]] and [[golf]], there have been technological improvements in the apparatuses used in these sports.  The improved apparatus in turn allows players to achieve better performance with no improvement in skill by purchasing new equipment.  The apparatus, the [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]] and [[golf ball]] or the [[tennis racket]], provide the player with a higher theoretical performance limit.

== Science: Behavior modification ==
In his study of innate human needs, renowned psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] in his concept of a hierarchy of needs identified esteem and social fulfillment, garnered by recognition by family and peers, as a basic human need, and therefore able to be tied to structured programs that increase performance. Abraham Maslow, on “Third Force” psychology, combines aspects of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional psychology, and accounts for the impact of culture and society on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Horney, Karen. Neurosis and Human Growth: The Struggle Toward Self-Realization. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1950. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate or commercial ==
In business, human performance in sales, operations and employee engagement is able to be improved through psychologically rewarding experiences "which can trigger a host of intrinsic human emotions and behavior as identified by [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]]. Including rewards in a performance improvement solution is a proven strategy to engage employees and align them with the company's goals. Awards can be cash or non-cash. Both stimulate human behavior. The addition of non-cash awards to the total rewards package creates a unique manner of unlocking the performance potential of people because it separates a reward from being used as or perceived as ordinary salary income. Non-cash awards break through the clutter to motivate higher achievement of  and drive greater returns on investment. Cash as a reward can also be spent on day-to-day items like food or gas and does not create the increased "psychological reward" of achieving special items, or points to acquire items. By connecting with all levels of the organization, a complete rewards package can amplify performance across the organization and bring personal goals into alignment with organizational goals." &lt;ref&gt;Maritz, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Reward programs supporting improvement in sales and operations can be effectively paid for from the increase in revenue or profits which flow from the program, and without spending to reward for your current levels.&lt;ref&gt;Profit Growth International&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial evidence that monetary rewards are not effective outside the context of very [[rote work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pink|first=Dan|title=The puzzle of motivation|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html|work=TED|accessdate=5 December 2013|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, monetary incentive plans may decrease employee morale, as in Microsoft's stack-ranking system, where the total reward amount is fixed and employees are graded on an artificially fitted distribution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|title=Microsoft does away with stack ranking|url=http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-does-away-with-stack-ranking-7000023103/|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levels ==
Performance improvement can occur at different levels:
* an individual performer
* a team
* an organizational unit
* the [[organization]] itself

== Cycle ==
[[Business performance management]] and improvement can be thought of as a [[Business cycle|cycle]]:
# Performance [[planning]] where [[goal]]s and [[Goal|objectives]] are established
# Performance coaching where a [[Management|manager]] intervenes to give [[feedback]] and adjust performance
# [[Performance appraisal]] where individual performance is formally documented and feedback delivered

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''professional conference organiser''', '''professional congress organiser''' ('''PCO''') or '''conference company''' is a company which specialises in the organisation and management of congresses, conferences, seminars and similar events.

==Role==
PCOs can typically work as consultants for academic and professional associations. They usually provide full service management for conferences including conference design, [[abstract_management|abstract management software]], program development, registration, site and venue selection and booking, audiovisuals, IT support, logistics, leisure management, marketing, printing and web services, sourcing speakers, funding,  sponsorship and exhibitor sales, financial management and budget control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKDnKFv3v0YC&amp;pg=PT322&amp;lpg=PT322&amp;dq=pco+conferences&amp;source=web&amp;ots=44eHJG8Ei5&amp;sig=ZQTKIwLhEwzOlMiEjG8Fx2b0y-4#PPT321,M1 Conferences and Conventions: A Global Industry By Tony Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies offer related services including travel agents and public relations companies. They tend to focus on limited areas such as destination management.

==Size of market sector==
Recent surveys of UK conference venues have found that a third of conference bookings were made by PCOs or venue-finding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC Information drawn from the British Conference Venues Survey 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100649/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf Survey of Conferences in Scotland in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070507/http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html Paid report in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (first part free)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207013830/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 UK-based conferences generated £7.6 billion in direct sales giving PCOs a central role in some £2.5 billion of revenue generation. The UK is ranked second behind the US for global market share of conferences. Thus, although there is no one source of global statistics for the conference market it appears that PCOs play a central role in several billion dollars' worth of revenue generation worldwide.

Robert Kuok is media-shy; most of his businesses are privately held by him or his family. Apart from a multitude of businesses in Malaysia, his companies have investments in many countries throughout Asia.&lt;ref name=forsakes/&gt; His business interests range from [[sugarcane]] [[plantations]] ''([[Perlis Plantations Bhd]])'', [[sugar refinery|sugar refineries]], [[flour]] [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[compound feed|animal feed]], [[oil]], [[mining]], [[finance]], [[hotel]] ''([[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts]])'', [[property]], [[trading]], [[freight]] and [[publishing]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; His biggest source of wealth is a stake in [[Wilmar International]], the world's largest listed [[palm oil]] trader company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2010/07/06/malaysias-sugar-king-kuok-has-gone-global/|title=Malaysia's Sugar King Kuok has gone global - Business News - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kuok was born on 6 October 1923,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Billionaires Index"/&gt; in the sugar business. Kuok's father arrived in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] from [[Fujian]], China, at the beginning of the 20th century, and Robert was the youngest of three brothers, born on 6 October 1923, in Johor Bahru. He grew up speaking his parents' Chinese Fuzhou dialect, English and Japanese during Japan's wartime occupation of Malaya. He was a student from [[Raffles Institution]] and [[English College Johore Bahru]].

He claims he began in business as an office boy, and later started a business with relatives' support.&lt;ref name="forsakes" /&gt; Upon graduation, being a [[collaborationist]] with the [[Empire of Japan]], he worked as a clerk in the rice-trading department of Japanese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsubishi]] Shoji Kaisha between the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] period between 1942 and 1945, in Singapore, a conglomerate which with the help of Japanese military unit monopolized the rice trade in Malaya during the occupation period. He was soon promoted to head the rice-trading department. After the war, he took the skills he learned from the Japanese back to the family's business in Johor.&lt;ref&gt;Annabelle R. Gambe. ''Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurship and Capitalist Development in Southeast Asia'', p 94. Lit Verlag Munster, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuok senior died in 1948, and Kuok and his two brothers and a cousin [[Kuok Hock Chin]] founded ''Kuok Brothers Sdn Bhd'' in 1949, trading agricultural commodities. Kuok relationship with the Japanese continued after Malaya gained independence. In 1959, Kuok formed Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Co. Bhd. together with two prominent Japanese partners. He also brought many influential Malay elite into his company as directors and shareholders which include UMNO politician and Malay royalty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In 1961, he made a coup by buying cheap sugar from India before the prices shot up. He continued to invest heavily in [[sugar refineries]], controlled 80% of the Malaysian sugar market with production of 1.5 million tonnes, equivalent to 10% of world production, and so earned his nickname "Sugar King of Asia".

In 1971, he built the first [[Shangri-La Hotel Singapore|Shangri-La Hotel]], in Singapore. His first foray into Hong Kong property was in 1977, when he acquired a plot of land on the newly reclaimed [[Tsim Sha Tsui East]] waterfront, where he built the second hotel, the [[Kowloon Shangri-La]]. In 1993, his Kerry Group acquired a 34.9% stake in the [[SCMP Group|South China Morning Post]] from [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]]. Kuok officially retired from the Kerry Group on 1 April 1993. 

His companies have investments in many countries, including Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, [[Mainland China]], Indonesia, Fiji and Australia. Businesses in China include 10 bottling companies for [[Coca-Cola]], and ownership of the [[The China World Trade Center|Beijing World Trade Centre]].&lt;ref name="forsakes" /&gt;

Freight interests include [[Malaysian Bulk Carriers|Malaysian Bulk Carriers Berhad]] and [[Transmile Air Services|Transmile Group]].

His political influence is attested by his having been selected as one of the [[Hong Kong Affairs Advisors]] in the run-up to the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]], and his minority stake in [[CITIC Pacific]]. He was also instrumental in conveying information and setting up the meetings between Malaysia and China governments leading to full diplomatic cross recognition of the two countries.

In 2007, Kuok combined his plantations, edible oil and grains businesses with Wilmar International, hence making it the world's biggest palm-oil processor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/robert-kuok-hock-nien/|title=Bloomberg Billionaires Index - Robert Kuok|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2009, PPB Group under the flagship of Robert Kuok issued a statement to the Bursa Malaysia that it had decided to dispose of its sugar units along with land used to cultivate sugar cane for RM 1.29 billion to [[FELDA]]. The sales resulted in a one-off gain for the company. The sugar unit and sugar cane plantation were the second largest business segment upon its grain and feed which were topping the sales.

In February 2014, Kuok's Singapore-based oil services company PACC Offshore Services Holdings (POSH) started pre-IPO talks with investors to list on the [[Singapore Stock Exchange]] to raise $400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuok-owned offshore firm in talks for $400m Singapore IPO|url=http://oilpatchasia.com/2014/02/kuok-owned-offshore-firm-in-talks-for-400m-singapore-ipo/|publisher=Oil Patch Asia|accessdate=5 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305105631/http://oilpatchasia.com/2014/02/kuok-owned-offshore-firm-in-talks-for-400m-singapore-ipo/|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuok lives in Deep Water Bay on Hong Kong island.

'''Roberto de Assis Moreira''', commonly known as '''Assis''' (born January 10, 1971), is a former [[association football|football]]er&lt;ref name="sambafoot"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.sambafoot.com/players/934_Assis.html|title=Assis|publisher=Sambafoot|date=November 27, 2009|accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the brother, manager, agent and adviser of [[Brazil]]ian footballer [[Ronaldinho]].

==Biography==
Although Assis is known predominantly for his intelligent managing of better known and more illustrious younger brother [[Ronaldinho]]'s career, he himself was a budding football talent in his youth. In fact, Brazilian club [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] offered Assis' family a villa in order to keep the promising youngster with the club.

Previously, the family had lived in a wooden house in the middle of a ''[[favela]]'' or [[slum]] in [[Porto Alegre]], in the south of Brazil. At this time, João (his father), a solderer by trade, often worked as a car park security guard at [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]'s stadium in order to supplement his meager income.

Roberto's success as a footballer helped his family leave the slots behind for a more comfortable home, but his hopes of playing top-level football with [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] were all but destroyed when he suffered a serious knee injury, which led him to play football in Switzerland. He played for [[FC Sion|Sion]] in 1992-1995 and 1996-1998. With Sion he won two [[Swiss Cup|Cups]] in [[1994–95 in Swiss football|1995]] and [[1996–97 in Swiss football|1997]] and became [[Swiss Super League|Swiss Champion]] that year. Then he went to stints in Japan and Mexico.

Years later, Roberto's younger brother Ronaldo (now known only as [[Ronaldinho]]), would emerge as an even hotter talent at [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]'s youth set-up before departing his home country for French side [[Paris Saint-Germain|PSG]] and eventually Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], whom he was with for five years, before departing for [[AC Milan|Milan]] in 2008.

Today, Assis acts as his brother's agent and adviser, and is credited by many, including [[Ronaldinho]] himself, as a major influence and guiding force of the player.

During his acceptance speech after receiving the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award for a second consecutive year in December 2005, Ronaldinho paid tribute to his brother: "He's my idol. He's been through a lot and has helped me every step of the way. He has encouraged me never to stop trying."

Assis also owns Brazilian club [[Porto Alegre Futebol Clube|Porto Alegre]], which currently plays the [[Campeonato Gaúcho]].

'''Shut-off nozzles''' are used in the manufacturing process of [[plastic injection molding]]. Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike [[hot runner]] nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off nozzles differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.

== Reasons for using ==

Shut-off nozzles are used to avoid drooling of the melt and stringing, as well as to feed with a retracted nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;Johannaber, Friedrich (2008). ''Injection Molding Machines: A User's Guide.'' Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich. {{ISBN|978-3-446-22581-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Shut-off nozzles can be self-controlled or externally controlled.

=== Self-controlled ===
[[File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated info.jpg|Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated]]The needle keeps the nozzle [[wikt:orifice|orifice]] closed by spring pressure. When the injection pressure increases, the melt will push back on the needle head and try to open the nozzle. Once the melt inside the nozzle reaches a certain amount of [[pressure]], it will succeed in pushing the needle back against the spring. There must, therefore, be a minimum pressure for the opening process to overcome the [[force]] of the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Pötsch, Gerd. Michaeli, Walter (2008). '' Injection Molding: An Introduction.'' Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich. {{ISBN|978-3-446-40635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nozzle opens, the pressure will drop again and the spring-operated needle will close the nozzle tip orifice.

=== Externally actuated ===
The nozzle is opened by external force, independent of the melt-pressure. The shut-off nozzle’s actuation is [[hydraulically]] or [[pneumatically]] driven. Externally actuated shut-off nozzles can have different ways of closing the melt stream. Due to the fact that they operate independently of melt-pressure, they can be used for a range of applications such as melt pre-compression, physical and chemical [[foaming]] and high-speed injection molding.

==== Needle ====
[[File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation info.jpg|Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation]]The melt flow is shut off via a melt channel-axis positioned needle moving back and forth according to actuation. This nozzle type shuts off the melt stream directly at the nozzle orifice-mold interface which prevents drooling.

==== Bolt ====
[[File:Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation info.jpg|Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation]]A shut-off bolt, positioned [[perpendicular]] to the melt channel moves up and down according to actuation, and thus shuts off/opens the melt flow. This nozzle type has a single melt channel. It therefore does not require rerouting of the melt around the shut-off mechanism. This makes it more suitable for processing of large volumes as well as shear sensitive materials.

==== Rotary ====
[[File:Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation info.jpg|Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation]]This nozzle type is fitted with a rotatable bolt assembly which has a cavity equal in size to the melt channel. In its open position, the bolt cavity is directly aligned with the melt stream. When the [[actuator]] rotates the bolt assembly, the cavity becomes misaligned and thus shuts of the melt flow.

== Introduction to the Society of Professional Economists ==

The [http://spe.org.uk Society of Professional Economists] is Europe’s largest network of professional economists. Its members are drawn from all areas of the discipline including financial and professional services, business, journalism, government, consultancy, business schools and universities. Membership is open to anyone who has a degree with substantial economic content and/or works in an area of economic endeavour or investigation.

The Society of Professional Economists engages and supports its members through networking events, professional development and education as well as a high-profile conferences and an annual dinner. It provides a monthly newsletter with updates on these events, links to events organised by other professional bodies, new members and economic news. The Society also reviews books and provides a forum for members to advertise job opportunities and their own events.

The Society exists to help all those who use economics in their professional work. Its activities aim to demonstrate the use of economic analysis as a tool to support business decision-making and to enhance the standing of the professional economist working outside academia. It provides a forum for its members to discuss and debate economic issues and helps them keep in touch with practical and theoretical developments within the discipline. 

The Society is a lively and engaged networking platform for economists of all ages and backgrounds. It particularly welcomes younger members to engage through its social networks on Facebook and LinkedIn and has membership packages aimed specifically at those who are embarking on a career in the profession. The Society also offers affiliate membership to individuals who are interested in economics but not practicing.

== [http://spe.org.uk/whats-on/events/ Activities] ==

=== Monthly meetings ===
 
[http://spe.org.uk/about/society-activities/ Monthly meetings] are the core of the SPE’s activities, and typically run from September to July at lunchtime or in the evening. Distinguished speakers from the UK and abroad and from both the private and public sectors address a wide range of topical issues with ample time for questions and discussion. Evening meetings are followed by drinks and the opportunity to network with other SPE members from a wide range of organisations.

Post-fiscal event briefings are held with HM Treasury following Budgets and Autumn Statements. They offer SPE members the opportunity to discuss the macroeconomic aspects of what has been announced, and UK fiscal policy more generally.

=== Annual conferences ===

These bring together members and expert speakers for an informed and always lively discussion of key issues affecting the business environment. 

In recent years it has featured [[Ben Broadbent]], [[Charlie_Bean|Sir Charles Bean]], [[Robert Chote]], [[Gavyn Davies]], [[DeAnne_Julius|Dame DeAnne Julius]], [[Diane_Coyle|Professor Diane Coyle]], [[Evan_Davis|Evan Davies]] and [[Stephanie Flanders]].

The next [http://spe.org.uk/about/society-activities/conference/ annual conference will be on the 28th September 2018]. Speakers will include [[Philip_R._Lane|Prof Philip Lane]], Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, and [[Dave_Ramsden|Sir Dave Ramsden]], Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.

=== Annual dinners ===
 
SPE annual dinners attract high-profile national and international guest speakers. Past speakers have included Sir John Vickers, Sir Gus O’Donnell, Sir Howard Davies, Jean-Claude Trichet, Mario Draghi, William C Dudley, Prof Axel Weber, Christian Noyer and Dr James Bullard. The Society was delighted to welcome Dr. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England to its Annual Dinner in May 2018.

=== Masterclasses ===

[http://spe.org.uk/speakers/masterclasses/ Masterclasses] on current issues and new developments contribute to continuing professional development. Members use these events to refresh or update their knowledge, and provide further opportunities to get to know other members and build networks. 

=== Professional development ===

The SPE runs a [http://spe.org.uk/careers/development/ Continuous Professional Development Programme] and a series of masterclasses presented by leading lights in their field.

=== Recruitment ===

The SPE has an active jobs board. A large number of employers and recruiters advertise job opportunities for economists through the Society.

=== [http://spe.org.uk/about/rybczynski-prize/ The Rybzcynski prize] ===
 
This prize is awarded annually by the Society to the author of the year's best piece of writing on an issue of importance to professional economists. 

=== Publications ===

The Society produces a monthly newsletter, book reviews, a regular salary survey and reports and webcasts from its events.

== History ==

The Society of Professional Economists was initially established as The Business Economists Group in 1953. When [http://rse.mtcserver6.com/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/fraser_c.pdf Sir Campbell Fraser of the Economist Intelligence Unit], with the aid of three of his own colleagues as well as John Dixon of Dunlop and Clive Dalton of Esso, set up a meeting with a view to establishing a small group of economists working in business. [Reference: Donald Anderson challenge of change]. The group wanted to discuss professional challenges in responding to the UK’s relatively poor post-war economic recovery [Reference: Donald Anderson challenge of change].
The first Business Economists Group meeting took place in 1953, in the St Ermin’s Hotel in Westminster, London. The attendance list shows there were thirty-three attendees: thirteen from industry, seven from consultancies and market research organisations, three from financial sectors, and one from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. The remaining six were from government organisations. The aim of this first meeting was to: 
* Discuss the divergence between the real world challenges and economic theory. • Keep up-to-date with developments in economic theory.
* Exchange views and analyse government policies, trends and current affairs. 
* Develop a ‘group’ that could facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences and so mitigate professional isolation. 
* Provide professional standards for business economists and promote the interests of the ‘groups’ members.
* The Society’s aims today remain largely unchanged but reflect the reality of economics as it is now practiced professionally and the needs of economists to network and engage in lively debate across many platforms in order to keep on top of the rapid developments in the subject area.

== Membership ==

The Society of Professional Economists is a membership organisation. Its members are drawn from all areas of economics, including financial and professional services, business, journalism, government, consultancy, business schools and universities. Membership is open to anyone who has a degree with substantial economic content and/or works in an area of economic endeavour or investigation.

It has four types of members: Full members, student or early career members, affiliate members and corporate members.

Notable members include:

'''The Asian Banker''' is a company that provides information for the financial services industry in the form of publications, online materials such as e-newsletters, research, and conventions, and other industry gatherings. It is regarded as one of the Asian region's leading consultancies in financial services research, benchmarking and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.smu.edu.sg/article.cfm?articleid=1157 "The Asian Banker: From Trade Journal to Industry Trendsetter,"]. Knowledge@SMU,' 5 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Asian Banker was founded in Singapore in 1996 by [[Emmanuel Daniel]], a former consultant.  It was established first as a publisher of trade publication, such as [[The Asian Banker Journal]], before moving into research, consulting, benchmarking, and events organisation, all catering to the financial services industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nus.edu.sg/nec/ed/tvf/tvf-emmanueldaniel020903.html National University of Singaopre, Entrepreneurship in the information business] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018063456/http://nus.edu.sg/nec/ed/tvf/tvf-emmanueldaniel020903.html |date=18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The company's original product was [[The Asian Banker Journal]], a quarterly publication of 40 pages that was launched in January 1997.  Throughout 1997 and 1998, it provided on-the-ground coverage of the Asian financial crisis, anchored by Daniel's journalistic skills and award-winning articles—Daniel won the prestigious Citibank Excellence in Journalism Award for the Asian region in February 1999 for his work in determining the impact of the Internet on banking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theasianbanker.com/A556C5/homepage.nsf/0/8CC41EF3E637F54748256D09002893AA?OpenDocument About The Asian Banker] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630003808/https://www.theasianbanker.com/A556C5/homepage.nsf/0/8CC41EF3E637F54748256D09002893AA?OpenDocument |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine covers a wide range of industry topics, such as opinion editorials, current events analysis, retail banking, transaction banking, risk management, bank regulation and IT for financial services. It features profiles of individuals in the financial services industry, some of which can run to several pages if the individual is particularly influential.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theasianbanker.com/A556C5/Journals.nsf/frmJournal?OpenForm&amp;Issue=86 The Asian Banker Journal main page]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is characterised by its coverage of bank CEOs and chief regulators interviews. The publications business also maintains a video interview website called The Banking Conversation. The website contains interviews, 10 to 30 minutes in length, of prominent figures in banking, economics, IT, investing and academia.

By 2005, The Asian Banker Journal was published 10 times a year.  While Daniel has turned over management of the magazine to staff, he still writes for a blog.

==Forums business==
The company launched a forums division in 2000 to capitalise on the interest its readership had in taking part in a forum to discuss banking issues and challenges that had come to the fore in the aftermath of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].  It held the first [[Asian Banker Summit]] in Singapore in 2000.  Subsequent summits have been held in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta and Hanoi, Beijing and Singapore.

The Summit typically include fora on topics such as [[risk management]], information technology, [[transaction banking]], [[payment systems]] and regulation, and they include both opening, and closing, keynote speeches. Past keynote speakers include [[Al Gore]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-03/18/content_2711819.htm China View, 18 March 2005, "Al Gore Stresses sustainability of world economy"].

In The Asian Banker Summit 2008 in Hanoi and The Asian Banker Summit 2009 in Beijing, The Asian Banker collaborated with [[The Bankers' Association for Finance and Trade]] (BAFT) on a conference, held in conjunction with The Asian Banker Summit, called The BAFT Asia Conference on Cash, Treasury and Trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianbankerforums.com/summit2008/conference_04.php The Asian Banker Summit 2008, BAFT Asia Conference on Cash, Treasury and Trade]. Asianbankerforums.com.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October 2008, BAFT announced that it had renewed the agreement for the 2009 conference in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aba.com/Press+Room/102708BAFTAsianBanker.htm American Bankers Association, 27 October 2008, "BAFT and The Asian Banker Renew Agreement to Collaborate on Annual Asian Summit"]. Aba.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Summit, the company holds events in other cities around Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianbankerforums.com Asian Banker Forums]. Asian Banker Forums.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Asian Banker launched a research division in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theasianbanker.com/A556C5/Research.nsf/frmResDtCtr?OpenForm Asian Banker Research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630004025/https://www.theasianbanker.com/A556C5/Research.nsf/frmResDtCtr?OpenForm |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asian Banker Research]] business compiles rankings, such as Asia Pacific banks by asset size and financial strength, CEO compensation, dividend payouts, the top 40 Islamic banking institutions in Asia, a databook of macro indicators of banking, payments and distribution, and industry performance. The division also writes management reports, research notes, country reports, and proprietary benchmarking on consumer banking technology and operations, and other topics.

===The Asian Banker 300===
While The Asian Banker's research business covers a variety of research projects, its most visible product is [[The Asian Banker 300]], a reference guide to the 300 largest banks in Asia Pacific by assets. The company expands the list to over 500 banks in its online version. The research comes out in September or October and is launched every year at [[Sibos (conference)|Sibos]], the large annual financial services convention organised by [[SWIFT]]. In the 2008 financial year, the 10 largest banks in the Asia Pacific region by assets were [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]], [[Mizuho Financial Group]], [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]], [[Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group]], [[China Construction Bank]], [[Agricultural Bank of China]], [[Bank of China]], [[Norinchukin Bank]], [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] and [[National Australia Bank]]. This has been unchanged since the previous years.&lt;ref name="The Asian Banker 300"&gt;[http://www.asianbankerpublication.com/A556C5/Journals.nsf/frmJournal?OpenForm&amp;Issue=92 The Asian Banker 300]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, the guide has added a strength ranking, which measures each of the 300 banks according to a strength formula.  The formula weights assets, year-on-year growth in loans, year-on-year growth in deposits, and eight other criteria to arrive at a total strength score.&lt;ref name="The Asian Banker 300"/&gt; Invariably, the largest banks are not necessarily the strongest banks, and in the 2009 financial year, the 10 strongest banks in the Asia Pacific region were [[HDFC Bank]], [[Punjab National Bank]], [[Public Bank]], [[Bank of Nanjing]], [[Bank Central Asia]], [[China CITIC Bank]], [[ANZ Bank New Zealand|ANZ National Bank]], [[Union Bank of India]], [[Westpac Banking Corporation]] and [[China Construction Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianbankerpublication.com/A556C5/Journals.nsf/frmJournal?OpenForm&amp;Issue=92 The Asian Banker list of the 300 largest banks by assets in the Asia Pacific region]&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking is a recognised benchmark among financial institutions in Asia, and banks that have mentioned the ranking in their investor relations materials and financial reports include [[Siam Commercial Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scb.co.th/en/abt/abt_awb_50.shtml About Siam Commercial Bank, Awards and Rankings, 2007].

== Political positions ==
Kuvvatov was a critic of Tajikistani president [[Emomalii Rahmon]], accusing him of nepotism and corruption.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|author=Daren Butler |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/06/us-turkey-tajikistan-idUSKBN0M20M920150306 |title=Vocal critic of Tajik president shot dead in Istanbul |publisher= |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leader of the opposition [[Group 24]], which he founded after going into exile in 2012.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsasia&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/tajik-opposition-leader-s/1699336.html |title=Vocal critic of Tajik president shot dead in Istanbul |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |date= 6 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 he publicly called on Tajikistanis to gather for a political protest on 10 October. However, no one showed up to the protests after Tajikistani authorities had blocked websites and deployed armored vehicles. The [[Supreme Court of Tajikistan]] ruled that Kuvvatov's Group 24 was an extremist movement and banned publications by it.&lt;ref name=eurasia&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/70436 |title=Tajikistan: What’s Behind Government’s Heavy-Handed Protest Response? |publisher=eurasianet.org |date=14 October 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajik authorities had blocked hundreds of websites after Group 24 used social media to call for an antigovernment protest in Dushanbe on 10 October 2014.&lt;ref name=Gadoev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-opposition-quvatov-killing/26885021.html |title= Tajik Opposition Tycoon Quvatov Killed In Istanbul |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date= 6 March 2015|work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, a court in Dushanbe has sentenced Umedjon Solehov to 17 1/2 years in jail for his being a member of this opposition movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/local_link/298048/434559_de.html Tajik Activist Sentenced To More Than 17 Years In Jail] by [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL's Tajik Service]] 04 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Eurasianet reported that Kuvvatov was not widely known or liked before the failed protests, but that he became much more known afterwards.&lt;ref name=eurasia/&gt;

==Exile==
In 2012 Kuvvatov went into exile to first [[Russia]] and later the [[United Arab Emirates]] after Tajikistan asked for his extradition.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; He was arrested in [[Dubai]] in September 2012 at the behest of Tajikistan. He was released in September 2013 after obtaining a pardon.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/tajikistan-opposition-leader-kuvvatov-facing-new-dangers#.VPlxVfmG_Ns|title=Tajikistan Opposition Leader Kuvvatov Facing New Dangers|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuvvatov went to Turkey, where he was arrested on 20 December 2014 on an alleged visa violation. His extradition was once more sought by Tajikistan, for extremism, economic crimes and hostage-taking.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedomhouse/&gt; Turkey however refused extradition.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;

== Death ==
According to Turkish media reports, conspirators planned his murder for three months. At first they wanted to poison Kuvvatov at the joint dinner on the night of 5 to 6 March 2015 in Istanbul. Then the killers used weapons and Kuvvatov was shot dead with a single bullet to his head when he got outside trying to reach the nearest hospital.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belsat.eu/en/articles/opposition-activist-dead-three-suspects-detained/ |title= Tajik opposition activist dead.

[[Rahmatullo Zoyirov]], chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan]], told [[RFE/RL]]'s Tajik Service that Quvvatov's killing had been pre-planned.&lt;ref name=Nemtsov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-quvatov-killing-turkey-opposition-nemtsov/26886088.html |title= Slaying Of Tajik Opposition Leader Draws Nemtsov Comparisons |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date=6 March 2015 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |accessdate=24 March 2015|quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quvvatov's wife, Kumriniso Hafizova, told RFE/RL on 8 March that she, her husband and their two sons had been invited for dinner at the house of Sulaimon Qayumov, a 30-year-old Tajik citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/slain-tajik-opposition-tycoon-to-be-buried-in-istanbul/26889471.html |title= Three Arrested As Tajik Opposition Tycoon Buried In Istanbul |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date= 9 March 2015 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qayumov has been living in Turkey for three months and positioned himself as a Quvvatov sympathizer.&lt;ref name=Gadoev /&gt; After dinner, Quvvatov and his family members felt sick and rushed out for fresh air. When they were outside, an unidentified Tajik-speaking man approached Quvvatov from behind, fired a single shot to his head and immediately fled the scene. The 47-year-old entrepreneur was already dead when medics arrived at the scene and police searched the area for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belsat.eu/en/articles/tajik-opposition-activist-umarali-kuvvatov-shot-dead-istanbul/ |title= Tajik opposition activist Umarali Kuvvatov shot dead in Istanbul |publisher=[[Belsat TV]]|date=  6 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish media also reported that Mr Kuvatov's wife and children had symptoms of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tajik opposition leader Kuvatov shot dead in Turkey |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31760810|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have drawn parallels between the murder of Umarali Quvvatov and the late February assassination of Russian opposition leader [[Boris Nemtsov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catoday.org/centrasia/18746-smert-treh-oppozicionerov-menshe-chem-za-mesyac-v-zone-byvshego-soyuza-byt-kritikom-vlasti-opasno-dlya-zhizni.html |title=Смерть троих оппозиционеров меньше чем за месяц: В зоне бывшего Союза быть критиком власти опасно для жизни! |first= |last= |author= Киргизбек Канунов (гражданский активист) |authorlink= |date= 7 March 2015 |work=Центральная Азия |publisher= "Озодагон" (независимое информационное региональное агентство) |location= |language= Russian |trans-title= |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists on 6 March, [[Muhiddin Kabiri]], the leader of the opposition [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan]], compared the killing to the recent deaths of Nemtsov and [[Rakhat Aliyev]], the former son-in-law of Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72416 |title= Tajikistan: Opposition Leader Gunned Down in Istanbul |author=  Chris Rickleton |publisher=[[The Open Society Institute|EurasiaNet.org]]|date= 6 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajabi Mirzo, an independent political analyst, described Quvvatov's death as a "shameful and terrible event" that could be compared with Nemtsov's killing. "Nemtsov was killed the day before the announced rally, and Quvatov after the announcement of the [parliamentary] election results," he wrote.&lt;ref name=Nemtsov /&gt;

The '''World Trade Center''' is a mostly completed complex of buildings in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[United States|U.S.]], replacing [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|the original seven World Trade Center buildings]] on the [[World Trade Center site|same site]] that were destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]].  The site is being rebuilt with up to six new skyscrapers, four of which have been completed; a [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|memorial and museum]] to those killed in the attacks; an elevated park adjacent to the site, called [[Liberty Park]]; and a [[World Trade Center (PATH station)#World Trade Center Transportation Hub|transportation hub]].&lt;ref group="note" name="status"/&gt; The 104-story [[One World Trade Center]], the tallest building in the [[Western Hemisphere]], is the lead building for the new complex.

The buildings are among many created by the [[World Trade Centers Association]]. The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|original World Trade Center]] featured the landmark [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)#North and South Towers|Twin Towers]], which opened in 1973, and were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world at their completion. They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated hijackers flew two [[Boeing 767]] jets into the complex in a coordinated act of [[terrorism]]. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. The resulting [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] of the World Trade Center caused structural failure in the surrounding buildings as well. The [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks|process of cleaning up and recovery]] at the [[World Trade Center site]] took eight months, after which rebuilding of the site commenced.

After years of delay and controversy, reconstruction at the [[World Trade Center site]] started. The new complex includes One World Trade Center, [[3 World Trade Center]], [[4 World Trade Center]], [[7 World Trade Center]], and one other high-rise office building being planned at [[2 World Trade Center]]. The new World Trade Center complex also includes a museum and memorial, and a transportation hub similar in size to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. 7 World Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, making it the first of five skyscrapers to have been completed in the World Trade Center complex. 4 World Trade Center, the first building completed as part of the site's master plan, opened on November 12, 2013. The National September 11 Museum opened on May 21, 2014, and the memorial opened on September 11, 2011. One World Trade Center was opened on November 3, 2014. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened to the public on March 4, 2016, and 3 World Trade Center opened on June 11, 2018. 2 World Trade Center's full construction was placed on hold in 2009, with a new design announced in 2015.

In 2002, ground was broken on construction of a new 7 World Trade Center building located just to the north of the main World Trade Center site. Since it was not part of the site master plan, the rebuilding of 7&amp;nbsp;World Trade Center was allowed to proceed without delay. While 7 World Trade Center was not part of the master plan, Silverstein and Con Edison recognized that the rebuilding of the tower would have to be consistent with the master plan anyway. The master plan called for reopening several streets that had been eliminated in the original complex, so the new 7 World Trade Center was designed so Greenwich Street, which had been blocked by the original 7 World Trade Center, could be continuous through the new complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/07/group-offers-insights-wtc-redevelopment |title=Experts Discuss Planning, Designing and Rebuilding World Trade Center |publisher=Cornell Chronicle |date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|PATH station]] at the World Trade Center opened in {{Nowrap|November 2003}}, pending replacement by a permanent station designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panynj.gov/drp/pdfdocs/env/feis/VolumeI/07_Urban%20Design.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003233954/http://www.panynj.gov/drp/pdfdocs/env/feis/VolumeI/07_Urban%20Design.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2006 |work=Permanent WTC Path Terminal Final Environmental Impact Statement and Section 4(f) Evaluation |title=Urban Design and Visual Resources (Chapter 7) |format=PDF |publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey |date=May 2005 |accessdate=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
{{New World Trade Center}}
In the months following the attacks, architects and [[urban planning]] experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Up From The Ashes |work=Newsweek |date=November 12, 2001 |author=McGuigan, Cathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing Mayor Giuliani advocated for a "soaring memorial" to be the only thing at the World Trade Center site during his final speech as mayor.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=37}} Meanwhile, Larry Silverstein wanted to construct a new World Trade Center as soon as possible: the insurance documents for his lease on the old World Trade Center had not been finalized at the time of the attacks, so he could not receive insurance benefits from the attacks unless he rebuilt all the office space that had been destroyed.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=37}} [[George Pataki]], the then-[[Governor of New York]], controlled the Port Authority alongside the [[Governor of New Jersey]] and so was entitled to make the final decision regarding the site. He wished to balance the desires of people like Giuliani, who did not want any future development on the site, with those of people like Silverstein, who wanted a new World Trade Center as soon as possible.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=42}} In January 2002, New York City [[art dealer]] [[Max Protetch]] solicited 50 concepts and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderings]] from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his [[art gallery]] in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everyone Weighs In With Rebuilding Ideas |first=Edward |last=Wyatt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/nyregion/ground-zero-the-proposals-everyone-weighs-in-with-rebuilding-ideas.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 11, 2002 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the World Trade Center site, numerous stakeholders were involved, including Silverstein and the Port Authority. In addition, the victims' families, people in the surrounding neighborhoods, and others wanted input. In November 2001, Governor Pataki established the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC) as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pérez-Peña |first=Richard |title=A NATION CHALLENGED: DOWNTOWN; State Plans Rebuilding Agency, Perhaps Led by Giuliani |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 2001 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD81639F930A35752C1A9679C8B63 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=4}} In order to bypass the approval of the [[New York State Assembly]], Pataki left out [[Sheldon Silver]], the State Assemblyman for the area, from the decision-making process regarding the LMDC.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=43}} The LMDC coordinated [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] assistance in the rebuilding process, and was tasked with working with the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]], Larry Silverstein, and whoever was selected as the site's architects.

However, the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Principles for Development and Blueprint for Renewal for World Trade Center Site |publisher=RenewNYC.org |date=April 9, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=112d53af-0d20-44ec-89d7-23f397b5a569 |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected [[Beyer Blinder Belle]] as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Appraisal; Marginal Role for Architecture at Ground Zero |first=Herbert |last=Muschamp |authorlink=Herbert Muschamp |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDB1E38F930A15756C0A9649C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new 7 World Trade Center, which was not part of the new plan, began construction on May 7, 2002.&lt;ref name="nyt-7wtcstart"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/08/nyregion/as-a-hurdle-is-cleared-building-begins-at-ground-zero.html|title=As a Hurdle Is Cleared, Building Begins At Ground Zero|last=Bagli|first=Charles V.|date=May 8, 2002|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Port Authority and Lower Manhattan Developent {{sic|nolink=y}} Corporation Unveil Six Concepts Plans for World Trade Center Site, Adjacent Areas and Related Transportation |publisher=RenewNYC.org |date=July 16, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=b3aa6fb4-ebb6-48e3-ba62-c92bce75a647 |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback deemed all six designs to be "poor", so the LDMC announced a new international, open-design study.{{sfn|Goldberger|2004|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and New York New Visions Announce Panel to Help Select Teams to Participate in Design Study of World Trade Center Site and Surrounding Areas |publisher=RenewNYC.org |date=September 17, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=633a746a-8f04-40ea-85aa-4f58639a2d20 |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Design Study for World Trade Center Site and Surrounding Areas |publisher=RenewNYC.org |date=August 14, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=da800006-c35b-4f1c-a9ec-ff53cfe45ae2 |accessdate=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions – a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations – announced seven semifinalists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:

Days before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair [[John C.

Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes.  As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtc.com/news/Silversteins-Army|title=Silverstein's Army  -- World Trade Center|work=wtc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the "swap" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlawyer-digital.com/americanlawyer/tal200709/?pg=5|title=americanlawyer-digital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "swap" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Raab |title=Construction of World Trade Center |publisher=Esquire |date=May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy and criticism===

There was much debate regarding the future of [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] following the destruction of the World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but at a taller height than before.&lt;ref name=haaretz-remembering/&gt; The project for the new Twin Towers was called [[Twin Towers II]], which was led by an informal organization called the [[Twin Towers Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burchfiel|first1=Nathan|title=Group Wants Twin Towers Rebuilt at NYC's Ground Zero|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/group-wants-twin-towers-rebuilt-nycs-ground-zero|accessdate=July 13, 2016|work=CNS News|date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others did not want anything built there at all or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.&lt;ref name="haaretz-remembering"&gt;{{cite web |last=Handwerker |first=Haim |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/925885.html |title=The politics of remembering Ground Zero – Haaretz – Israel News |work=Haaretz |date=November 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th floor, called [[Windows on the World]], and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/09/wotw.php |title=Windows on the World, New York's Sky-High Restaurant - Eater NY |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called "Windows on the World Wine School", run by wine personality [[Kevin Zraly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/windows-on-the-world-september-11 |title=Windows on the World September 11 - A 9/11 Story About Wine and Wisdom |work=Esquire |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20010917/SUB/109170715# |title=Owner vows to reopen Windows On The World |date=September 17, 2001 |work=Crain's New York Business |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=Gothamist |date=March 8, 2011 |title=WTC Scraps Windows on the World Plan |url=http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313083936/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php |archivedate=March 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of [[CBS]]'s ''60 Minutes'' in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center's having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved.  Investor [[Larry Silverstein]] said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, thirty-five years after work started.&lt;ref name=cns20100218/&gt; Although billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, he said Ground Zero "is still a hole in the ground".&lt;ref name=cns20100218/&gt; During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: "I am the most frustrated person in the world....I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime".&lt;ref name="cns20100218"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6220282.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title=Developer: Ground Zero a National Disgrace - 60 Minutes: Eight Years and Billions of Dollars Later, Part of 9/11 Site is Still Just a Big Hole |publisher=CBS News |date=February 18, 2010 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[One World Trade Center]] itself was met with criticism early in its planning and construction stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/18/wtc.trump/ |publisher=CNN |title=Trump pushes own Ground Zero plan |date=May 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original design, which was asymmetrical, significantly shorter, and called for an off-center spire, was met with much disapproval, causing a new one to be devised. A key feature of the final design, the fortified, windowless base, was also denounced as looking dreary and unwelcoming.&lt;ref name="Open14"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zraick|first=Karen|title=World Trade Center Update: Prismatic Glass Facade For WTC Tower Scrapped|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/world-trade-center-update_n_860992.html|publisher=''The Huffington Post''|date=May 12, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514202702/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/world-trade-center-update_n_860992.html|archivedate=May 14, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To alleviate this problem, the designers decided to clad it with prismatic glass panels.

=== Early construction and final planning ===
[[File:WTC Site View 2011-12-03.jpg|thumb|alt=Large construction side with cranes and two recessed, square areas|Construction of the September 11 Memorial complex in December 2010]]

The design for the World Trade Center was finalized in 2004, but was revised extensively after the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] raised security concerns regarding various sites in the complex, which delayed the start of the construction of the entire complex by two years.&lt;ref name="Esquire Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a15344/world-trade-center-rebuilding-0912/|last=Raab|first=Scott|title=The Truth About the World Trade Center|publisher=Esquire Magazine|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new plans for the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]], which involved doubling the number of support columns, pushed back the construction timeline. In the original plan, the construction of the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] would have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof of the Transportation Hub provided the foundation on which the memorial rested upon and the walls of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a10738/world-trade-center-memorial-0911/|last=Raab|first=Scott|title=The Memorial|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Esquire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims' families to have the memorial completed by the 10-year anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the memorial and holding off construction of the transportation hub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/393-08/mayor-bloomberg-new-plan-speed-rebuilding-world-trade-center-including-memorial-|title=Mayor Bloomberg Discusses New Plan to Speed Rebuilding of World Trade Center, Including Memorial, in Weekly Radio Address|last=|first=|date=October 5, 2008|work=The official website of the City of New York|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/nyregion/the-4-billion-train-station-at-the-world-trade-center.html|title=How Cost of Train Station at World Trade Center Swelled to $4 Billion|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=December 2, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; which increased costs to an estimated $3.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Brenzel 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/the-path-to-4-billion/|title=The ‘Path’ to $4 billion|last=Brenzel|first=Kathryn|date=April 1, 2016|website=The Real Deal New York|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A [[Performing Arts Center (Manhattan)|Performing Arts Center]] was also announced that year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Towers===
[[One World Trade Center]] (previously coined the "Freedom Tower" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Daniel Libeskind's design. The building rises to {{convert|1368|ft|m}}, the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its spire rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill architect [[David Childs]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtc.com/about/freedom-tower |title=Freedom Tower: About the Building |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=Silverstein Properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libeskind and Silverstein reach an agreement for WTC site |first=Kevin |last=Lerner |magazine=[[Archit.

[[File:World trade center 2014 logo detail.png|150px|frameless|right]]
The World Trade Center's new logo, revealed in August 2014, was designed by the firm [[Landor Associates]] and shaped like a "W". All the black bars, the empty spaces, and the "W" itself symbolizes something, giving the logo at least six meanings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-15/the-world-trade-centers-new-logo-has-at-least-six-meanings |title=Six Meanings Behind the World Trade Center’s New Logo |author=Belinda Lanks |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The five bars in the logo represent the towers that will comprise the completed World Trade Center.&lt;ref name=Wilson-logo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;
*The top half of the logo features bars cut off at a 17.76-degree angle, evoking One World Trade Center's 1,776-foot (541 m) height.&lt;ref name=Wilson-logo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;
*Two white columns at the top symbolize the [[Tribute in Light]] memorial.&lt;ref name=Wilson-logo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;
*Three black bars at the top symbolize the Twin Towers' [[trident]]-shaped columns.&lt;ref name=Wilson-logo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;
*Two black bars at the bottom stand for the twin pools of the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]].&lt;ref name=Wilson-logo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;
*The logo, as a whole, is shaped like a "W", which stands for "World Trade Center" and "[[Westfield World Trade Center]]".&lt;ref name="Wilson-logo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Mark |title=The World Trade Center Has A New, Very Confusing Logo |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034384/the-world-trade-center-has-a-new-very-confusing-logo |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |work=Fast Company |date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunlap-Logo/&gt;

Landor Associates was awarded a $3.57 million contract in 2013 for redesigns, which comprised "the performance of professional services for the development and implementation of the World Trade Center (WTC) site-wide navigation, signage, and operational communications program" and included the development of the new logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpinfo.panynj.gov/files/uploads/documents/board-meeting-information/board-minutes-contract-authorizations/pa_minutes_9_18_2013.pdf|page=196|title=Minutes|publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Riccardi, the principal in the design firm Memo, stated, "Its strength is its ability to be seen in many ways.
