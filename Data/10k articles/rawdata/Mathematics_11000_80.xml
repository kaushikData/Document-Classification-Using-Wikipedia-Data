In [[digital circuit]]s, an '''adder–subtractor''' is a circuit that is capable of [[adder (electronics)|adding]] or [[subtractor|subtracting]] numbers (in particular, [[binary numeral system|binary]]). Below is a circuit that does adding ''or'' subtracting'' depending on a control signal. It is also possible to construct a circuit that performs both addition and subtraction at the same time.

==Construction==

[[Image:4-bit ripple carry adder-subtracter.svg|thumb|400px|A 4-bit ripple-carry adder–subtractor based on a 4-bit adder that performs [[two's complement]] on ''A'' when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}} to yield {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''B'' − ''A''}}.]]

Having an ''n''-bit adder for ''A'' and ''B'', then {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''A'' + ''B''}}. Then, assume the numbers are in [[two's complement]]. Then to perform {{nowrap|''B'' − ''A''}}, two's complement theory says to invert each bit with a [[NOT gate]] then add one. This yields {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''B'' + {{overline|''A''}} + 1}}, which is easy to do with a slightly modified adder.

By preceding each ''A'' input bit on the adder with a 2-to-1 [[multiplexer]] where:
* Input 0 (''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''A''
* Input 1 (''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is {{overline|''A''}}
that has control input ''D'' that is also connected to the initial carry, then the modified adder performs
* addition when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 0}}, or
* subtraction when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}}.
This works because when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}} the ''A'' input to the adder is really {{overline|''A''}} and the carry in is 1.  Adding ''B'' to {{overline|''A''}} and 1 yields the desired subtraction of {{nowrap|''B'' − ''A''}}.

A way you can mark number ''A'' as positive or negative without using a multiplexer on each bit is to use an [[XOR gate|XOR gate]] to precede each bit instead. 
* The first input to the XOR gate is the actual input bit
* The second input to the XOR gate for each is the control input ''D''
This produces the same [[truth table]] for the bit arriving at the adder as the multiplexer solution does since the XOR gate output will be what the input bit is when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 0}} and the inverted input bit when {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}}.

==Role in the arithmetic logic unit==
{{main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

Adders are a part of the core of an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU). The [[control unit]] decides which operations an ALU should perform (based on the [[op code]] being executed) and sets the ALU operation. The ''D'' input to the adder–subtractor above would be one such control line from the control unit.

The adder–subtractor above could easily be extended to include more functions. For example, a 2-to-1 multiplexer could be introduced on each ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' that would switch between zero and ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''; this could be used (in conjunction with {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}}) to yield the [[two's complement]] of ''A'' since {{nowrap|1=−''A'' = {{overline|''A''}} + 1}}.

A further step would be to change the 2-to-1 multiplex on ''A'' to a 4-to-1 with the third input being zero, then replicating this on ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' thus yielding the following output functions:
* 0 (with both the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' inputs set to zero and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 0}})
* 1 (with both the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' inputs set to zero and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}})
* ''A'' (with the ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' input set to zero)
* ''B'' (with the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' input set to zero)
* {{nowrap|''A'' + 1}} (with the ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' input set to zero and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}})
* {{nowrap|''B'' + 1}} (with the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' input set to zero and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}})
* {{nowrap|''A'' + ''B''}}
* {{nowrap|''A'' − ''B''}}
* {{nowrap|''B'' − ''A''}}
* {{overline|''A''}} (with ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to invert; ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to zero; and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 0}})
* −''A'' (with ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to invert; ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to zero; and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}})
* {{overline|''B''}} (with ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to invert; ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to zero; and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 0}})
* −'B'' (with ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to invert; ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' set to zero; and {{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}})

By adding more logic in front of the adder, a single adder can be converted into much more than just an adder—an ALU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12964">In [[probability theory]], the [[central limit theorem]] states that, under certain circumstances, the [[probability distribution]] of the scaled [[sample mean|mean of a random sample]] [[convergence in distribution|converges]] to a [[normal distribution]] as the sample size increases to infinity. Under stronger assumptions, the '''Berry–Esseen theorem''', or '''Berry–Esseen inequality''', gives a more quantitative result, because it also specifies the rate at which this convergence takes place by giving a bound on the maximal error of [[approximation theory|approximation]] between the normal distribution and the true distribution of the scaled sample mean. The approximation is measured by the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test#Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic|Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance]]. In the case of [[Independence (probability theory)|independent samples]], the convergence rate is {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the sample size, and the constant is estimated in terms of the [[Skewness|third]] absolute [[Moment (mathematics)|normalized moments]].

==Statement of the theorem==
Statements of the theorem vary, as it was independently discovered by two [[mathematician]]s, [[Andrew C. Berry]] (in 1941) and [[Carl-Gustav Esseen]] (1942), who then, along with other authors, refined it repeatedly over subsequent decades.

===Identically distributed summands===

One version, sacrificing generality somewhat for the sake of clarity, is the following:

:There exists a positive [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] ''C'' such that if ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., are [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|i.i.d. random variables]] with [[Expected value|E]](''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0, and E(|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = ρ &lt; ∞,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Since the random variables are identically distributed, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... all have the same [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] as ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and if we define
::&lt;math&gt;Y_n = {X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;
:the [[sample mean]], with ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[cumulative distribution function]] of
::&lt;math&gt;{Y_n \sqrt{n} \over {\sigma}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- please DO NOT CHANGE this formula unless you have read and understood the relevant comments on the talk page --&gt;
:and Φ the cumulative distribution function of the [[standard normal distribution]], then for all ''x'' and ''n'',
::&lt;math&gt;\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le {C \rho \over \sigma^3\sqrt{n}}.\ \ \ \ (1)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:BerryEsseenTheoremCDFGraphExample.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of the difference in cumulative distribution functions alluded to in the theorem.]]
That is: given a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed random variables]], each having [[mean]] zero and positive [[variance]], if additionally the third absolute [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] is finite, then the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of the [[Standard score|standardized]] sample mean and the standard normal distribution differ (vertically, on a graph) by no more than the specified amount.  Note that the approximation error for all ''n'' (and hence the limiting rate of convergence for indefinite ''n'' sufficiently large) is bounded by  the [[Big O notation|order]] of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Calculated values of the constant ''C'' have decreased markedly over the years, from the original value of 7.59 by {{harvtxt|Esseen|1942}}, to 0.7882 by {{harvtxt|van Beek|1972}}, then 0.7655 by {{harvtxt|Shiganov|1986}}, then 0.7056 by {{harvtxt|Shevtsova|2007}}, then 0.7005 by {{harvtxt|Shevtsova|2008}}, then 0.5894 by {{harvtxt|Tyurin|2009}}, then 0.5129 by {{harvtxt|Korolev|Shevtsova|2009}}, then 0.4785 by {{harvtxt|Tyurin|2010}}. The detailed review can be found in the papers {{harvtxt|Korolev|Shevtsova|2009}}, {{harvtxt|Korolev|Shevtsova|2010}}. The best estimate {{Asof|2012|lc=yes}}, ''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.4748, follows from the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le {0.33554 (\rho+0.415\sigma^3)\over \sigma^3\sqrt{n}},&lt;/math&gt;
due to {{harvtxt|Shevtsova|2011}}, since σ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;ρ and 0.33554&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1.415&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.4748. However, if ρ&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.286σ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, then the estimate 
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le {0.3328 (\rho+0.429\sigma^3)\over \sigma^3\sqrt{n}},&lt;/math&gt;
which is also proved in {{harvtxt|Shevtsova|2011}}, gives an even tighter upper estimate.

{{harvtxt|Esseen|1956}} proved that the constant also satisfies the lower bound
: &lt;math&gt;
    C\geq\frac{\sqrt{10}+3}{6\sqrt{2\pi}} \approx 0.40973 \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} + 0.01079 .
  &lt;/math&gt;

===Non-identically distributed summands===

:Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., be independent random variables with [[expected value|E]](''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0, and E(|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ∞. Also, let
::&lt;math&gt;S_n = {X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n \over \sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+\cdots+\sigma_n^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
:be the normalized ''n''-th partial sum. Denote ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[cumulative distribution function|cdf]] of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Φ the cdf of the [[standard normal distribution]]. For the sake of convenience denote  
::&lt;math&gt;\vec{\sigma}=(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n),\ \vec{\rho}=(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_n).&lt;/math&gt;
:In 1941, [[Andrew C. Berry]] proved that for all ''n'' there exists an absolute constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le C_1\cdot\psi_1,\ \ \ \ (2)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1=\psi_1\big(\vec{\sigma},\vec{\rho}\big)=\Big({\textstyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2}\Big)^{-1/2}\cdot\max_{1\le
i\le n}\frac{\rho_i}{\sigma_i^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Independently, in 1942, [[Carl-Gustav Esseen]] proved that for all ''n'' there exists an absolute constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le C_0\cdot\psi_0, \ \ \ \ (3)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0=\psi_0\big(\vec{\sigma},\vec{\rho}\big)=\Big({\textstyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2}\Big)^{-3/2}\cdot\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\rho_i.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to make sure that ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;≤ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Due to this circumstance inequality (3) is conventionally called the Berry–Esseen inequality, and the quantity ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lyapunov fraction of the third order. Moreover, in the case where the summands ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; have identical distributions 
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0=\psi_1=\frac{\rho_1}{\sigma_1^3\sqrt{n}},&lt;/math&gt;
and thus the bounds stated by inequalities (1), (2) and (3) coincide apart from the constant.

Regarding ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, obviously, the lower bound established by {{harvtxt|Esseen|1956}} remains valid:
: &lt;math&gt;
    C_0\geq\frac{\sqrt{10}+3}{6\sqrt{2\pi}} = 0.4097\ldots.
  &lt;/math&gt;

The upper bounds for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; were subsequently lowered from the original estimate 7.59 due to {{harvtxt|Esseen|1942}} to (considering recent results only) 0.9051 due to {{harvtxt|Zolotarev|1967}}, 0.7975 due to {{harvtxt|van Beek|1972}}, 0.7915 due to {{harvtxt|Shiganov|1986}}, 0.6379 and 0.5606 due to {{harvtxt|Tyurin|2009}} and {{harvtxt|Tyurin|2010}}. {{Asof|2011}} the best estimate is 0.5600 obtained by {{harvtxt|Shevtsova|2010}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4004">In 1932, [[George David Birkhoff|G. D. Birkhoff]] created a set of four [[postulate]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] in the plane, sometimes referred to as '''Birkhoff's axioms'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Birkhoff|first= George David|author-link=George David Birkhoff|year= 1932|title=A Set of Postulates for Plane Geometry (Based on Scale and Protractors)|journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume= 33|pages=329–345|doi=10.2307/1968336}}&lt;/ref&gt; These postulates are all based on basic [[geometry]] that can be confirmed experimentally with a [[Vernier scale|scale]] and [[protractor]]. Since the postulates build upon the [[real number]]s, the approach is similar to a [[model theory|model]]-based introduction to Euclidean geometry.

Birkhoff's axiom system was utilized in the secondary-school textbook by Birkhoff and Beatley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Birkhoff|first1= George David|first2=Ralph|last2= Beatley|author1-link=George David Birkhoff|title=Basic Geometry|edition= 3rd|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8218-2101-5|origyear=first edition, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These axioms were also modified by the [[School Mathematics Study Group]] to provide a new standard for teaching high school geometry, known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20130615062200/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~rcampbel/Math306/Axioms/SMSG.html SMSG axioms].
A few  other textbooks in the [[foundations of geometry]] use variants of Birkhoff's axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Paul Joseph|last1= Kelly|first2=Gordon|last2=Matthews|year= 1981|title=The non-Euclidean, hyperbolic plane: its structure and consistency|isbn=0-387-90552-9|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Postulates==
The distance between two points {{math|''A''}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''B''}} is denoted by {{math|''d''(''A,&amp;nbsp;B'')}}; the angle formed by three points {{math|''A'',''B'',''C''}}  is denoted by  {{math|1=∠ ''ABC''}}.

'''Postulate I: Postulate of line measure'''.  
The set of points {{math|{''A'', ''B'', ...} }} on any line can  be put into a 1:1 correspondence with the [[real number]]s {{math|{''a,&amp;nbsp;b'',&amp;nbsp;...} }} so that {{math|1={{!}}''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''{{!}} = ''d''(''A,&amp;nbsp;B'')}} for all points {{math|''A''}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''B''}}.

'''Postulate II: Point-line postulate'''.  
There is one and only one line, {{math|''ℓ''}}, that contains any two given distinct points {{math|''P''}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''Q''}}.

'''Postulate III: Postulate of angle measure'''.  
The set of rays {{math|{''ℓ,&amp;nbsp;m,&amp;nbsp;n'',&amp;nbsp;...} }} through any point {{math|''O''}} can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2''π'')}} so that if {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are points (not equal to {{math|''O''}}) of {{math|''ℓ''}} and {{math|''m''}}, respectively, the difference {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;2π)}} of the numbers associated with the lines {{math|''ℓ''}} and {{math|''m''}} is {{math|∠ ''AOB''}}. Furthermore, if the point {{math|''B''}} on {{math|''m''}} varies continuously in a line {{math|''r''}} not containing the vertex {{math|''O''}}, the number {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} varies continuously also.

'''Postulate IV: Postulate of similarity'''.  
Given two triangles {{math|''ABC''}} and {{math|''A'B'C'&amp;nbsp;''}} and some constant {{math|''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}} such that  {{math|1=''d''(''A',&amp;nbsp;B' '') =&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''A, B''), ''d''(''A',&amp;nbsp;C'&amp;nbsp;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''A,&amp;nbsp;C'')}} and {{math|1=∠ ''B'A'C'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±∠ ''BAC''}}, then {{math|1=''d''(''B',&amp;nbsp;C'&amp;nbsp;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kd''(''B,&amp;nbsp;C''), ∠ ''C'B'A'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±∠ ''CBA''}}, and {{math|1=∠ ''A'C'B'&amp;nbsp;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±∠ ''ACB''}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">[[File:Rye Castle, Rye, East Sussex, England-6April2011 (1).jpg|thumb|A square pyramid of cannonballs in a square frame]]
In the mathematics of [[figurate number]]s, the '''cannonball problem''' asks which numbers are both [[square]] and [[square pyramidal number|square pyramidal]]. The problem can be stated as: given a square arrangement of cannonballs, for what size squares can these cannonballs also be arranged into a square pyramid.
Equivalently, which squares can be represented as the sum of consecutive squares, starting from 1?

When cannonballs are stacked within a square frame, the number of balls is a square pyramidal number; [[Thomas Harriot]] gave a formula for this number around 1587, answering a question posed to him by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] on their expedition to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cannonball Problem |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |author=David Darling |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/Cannonball_Problem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Édouard Lucas]] formulated the cannonball problem as a [[Diophantine equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 = M^2&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} N(N+1)(2N+1) = \frac{2N^3+3N^2+N}{6} = M^2&lt;/math&gt;
and conjectured that the only solutions are ''N'' = 1, ''M'' = 1, and ''N'' = 24, ''M'' = 70. It was not until 1918 that [[G. N. Watson]] found a proof for this fact, using [[elliptic function]]s.  More recently, [[elementary proof]]s have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ma, D. G. |title=An Elementary Proof of the Solutions to the Diophantine Equation &lt;math&gt;6y^2=x(x+1)(2x+1)&lt;/math&gt; |journal=Sichuan Daxue Xuebao |volume=4 |pages=107–116 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anglin, W. S. |title=The Square Pyramid Puzzle|jstor=2323911 |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=120–124 |year=1990 |doi=10.2307/2323911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The solution ''N'' = 24, ''M'' = 70. can be used for constructing the [[Leech_lattice#Using_the_Lorentzian_lattice_II25,1|Leech Lattice]].  The result has relevance to the [[bosonic string theory]] in 26 dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week95.html |title=week95 |publisher=Math.ucr.edu |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is possible to [[Squaring the square|tile a geometric square with unequal squares]], it is not possible to do so with a solution to the cannonball problem. The squares with side lengths from 1 to 24 have areas equal to the square with side length 70, but they cannot be arranged to tile it.

==Related problems==
The only numbers that are simultaneously [[triangular number|triangular]] and square pyramidal, are 1, 55, 91, and 208335.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A039596|name=Numbers that are simultaneously triangular and square pyramidal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein"&gt;{{MathWorld|id=SquarePyramidalNumber|title=Square Pyramidal Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are no numbers (other than the trivial solution 1) that are both [[tetrahedral number|tetrahedral]] and square pyramidal.&lt;ref name="Weisstein"/&gt;

[[File:Anagram canonical svg.svg|thumb|Algorithmic [[anagram]] test using [[multiset]]s as canonical forms: The strings "&lt;tt&gt;madam curie&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;radium came&lt;/tt&gt;" are given as [[C (programming language)|C]] arrays. Each one is converted into a canonical form by sorting. Since both sorted strings literally agree, the original strings were anagrams of each other.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''canonical''', '''normal''', or '''standard'''  '''form''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a standard way of presenting that object as a [[mathematical expression]]. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a ''unique'' representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

More generally, for a class of objects on which an [[equivalence relation]] is defined, a '''canonical form''' consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[Jordan normal form]] is a canonical form for [[matrix similarity]], and the [[row echelon form]] is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an [[invertible matrix]].

In computer science, and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a '''canonical form''' is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, ''normal form'' is a weaker notion: A '''normal form''' is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

'''Canonical form''' can also mean a [[differential form]] that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its '''canonical form'''.  Putting something into canonical form is [[canonicalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have some set ''S'' of objects, with an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''. A '''canonical form''' is given by designating some objects of ''S'' to be "in canonical form", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in ''S'' represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.
A canonical form thus provides a [[classification theorem]] and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation ''R'' on a set ''S'' is a mapping ''c'':''S''→''S'' such that for all ''s'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'':
# ''c''(''s'') = ''c''(''c''(''s'')) &amp;nbsp; ([[idempotence]]),
# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; (decisiveness), and 
# ''s'' ''R'' ''c''(''s'') &amp;nbsp; (representativeness). 
Property 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object ''s'' in ''S'' to its canonical form ''s''*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.

For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 30 than ''x'' + 30 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of [[Jordan canonical form]] for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==Examples==
Note: in this section, "[[up to]]" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

In the untyped lambda calculus, e.g., the term &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(x x) \; \lambda x.(x x))&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

=== Dynamical systems ===
* [[Normal form (dynamical systems)]]

===Graph theory===
{{main article|Graph canonization}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Differential forms===
Canonical [[differential form]]s include the [[canonical one-form]] and [[canonical symplectic form]], important in the study of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[symplectic manifold]]s.

=== Computing ===
In [[computing]], the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called ''data normalization''.

For instance, [[database normalization]] is the process of organizing the [[Field (computer science)|fields]] and [[Table (database)|table]]s of a [[relational database]] to minimize [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] and dependency. 

In the field of [[software security]], a common [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] is unchecked [[malicious input]]. The mitigation for this problem is proper [[input validation]]. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML encoding]]) and reducing the input data to a single common [[character set]].

Other forms of data, typically associated with [[signal processing]] (including [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|imaging]]) or [[machine learning]], can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

The chain-ladder method is used in both the [[general insurance|property and casualty]]&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=wm&gt;https://www.casact.org/library/studynotes/Werner_Modlin_Ratemaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[health insurance]]&lt;ref name=soa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soa.org/files/pd/health/hspring07-005bk.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327110448/http://www.soa.org/files/pd/health/hspring07-005bk.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; fields. Its intent is to estimate [[incurred but not reported]] claims and project ultimate loss amounts.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;

The primary underlying assumption of the chain-ladder method is that historical loss development patterns are indicative of future loss development patterns.&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Methodology==

According to Jacqueline Friedland's "Estimating Unpaid Claims Using Basic Techniques," there are seven steps to apply the chain-ladder technique:

# Compile claims data in a development triangle
# Calculate age-to-age factors
# Calculate averages of the age-to-age factors
# Select claim development factors
# Select tail factor
# Calculate cumulative [[loss development factor|claim development factor]]s
# Project ultimate claims

Age-to-age factors, also called [[loss development factor]]s (LDFs) or link ratios, represent the ratio of loss amounts from one valuation date to another, and they are intended to capture growth patterns of losses over time. These factors are used to project where the ultimate amount losses will settle.

==Example==

First, losses (either reported or paid) are compiled into a triangle, where the rows represent accident years and the columns represent valuation dates. For example, 43,169,009 represents loss amounts related to claims occurring in 1998, valued as of 24 months.

Next, age-to-age factors are determined by calculating the ratio of losses at subsequent valuation dates. From 24 months to 36 months, accident year 1998 losses increased from 43,169,009 to 45,568,919, so the corresponding age-to-age factor is 45,568,919 / 43,169,009 = 1.056. A "tail factor" is selected (in this case, 1.000) to project from the latest valuation age to ultimate.

Finally, averages of the age-to-age factors are calculated. Judgmental selections are made after observing several averages. The age-to-age factors are then multiplied together to obtain cumulative development factors.

[[Incurred but not reported]] can be obtained by subtracting reported losses from ultimate losses, in this case, 569,172,456 - 543,481,587 = 25,690,869.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.casact.org/pubs/forum/06fforum/273.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

The chain-ladder technique is only accurate when patterns of loss development in the past can be assumed to continue in the future.&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt; In contrast to other loss reserving methods such as the [[Bornhuetter-Ferguson method]], it relies only on past experience to arrive at an [[incurred but not reported]] claims estimate.

When there are changes to an insurer's operations, such as a change in claims settlement times, changes in claims staffing, or changes to case reserve practices, the chain-ladder method will not produce an accurate estimate without adjustments.&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;

The chain-ladder method is also very responsive to changes in experience, and as a result, it may be unsuitable for very volatile lines of business.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;

In the book&lt;ref name="Croft"&gt;H. Croft, K. J. Falconer, and R. K. Guy. Unsolved Problems in Geometry, volume II of 'Problem Books in Mathematics'. Springer-Verlag, New York, Berlin, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a generalization
of the [[equichordal point problem]] attributed to R. Gardner.
[[File:Curve transp.png|thumb|A Curve and Its Chord]]
:We consider a point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; inside a [[Jordan curve]] with the property that for any [[chord (geometry)|chord]] &lt;math&gt;[X,Y]&lt;/math&gt; of the curve passing through &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; the two parts &lt;math&gt;[X,O]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[O,Y]&lt;/math&gt; of the chord satisfy the following equation, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed real number:
::&lt;math&gt;
|X-O|^\alpha+|O-Y|^\alpha = c
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Chordal_Equation"&gt;The Chordal Equation&lt;/ref&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant not depending on the chord. In this article
we will call a point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; satisfying equation&lt;ref name="Chordal_Equation"/&gt;
a '''chordal point''', or &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-'''chordal point'''.

The template for all chordal problems is this:
:'''Problem''': Is there a curve with two or more distinct points with this property?

== Curves with one equichordal point ==
The center of the [[circle]] is a solution of the chordal equation&lt;ref name="Chordal_Equation"/&gt;
for an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. One can show a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] of solutions
for many &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for example, &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;. The method of construction such solutions
is by writing the equation of the curve in the form &lt;math&gt;r = f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in [[polar coordinates]].
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;, the solution may be found in this article.&lt;ref name="The_Announcement"&gt;Marek Rychlik, The Equichordal Point Problem, Electronic Research Announcements of the AMS,
1996, Volume 2, Issue 3, pages 108-123, available on-line at [http://www.ams.org/journals/era/1996-02-03/S1079-6762-96-00015-7/S1079-6762-96-00015-7.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== An example ==
This is an example of a curve with one equichordal point. based on an example in.&lt;ref name="Mathworld_Equichordal_Point"&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EquichordalPoint.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The core idea is that we may start with any [[Jordan curve|Jordan arc]] given in polar coordinates by
an equation &lt;math&gt;r=r_0(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\leq\theta\leq\pi&lt;/math&gt;, and complement
it to a closed [[Jordan curve]] given by the equation &lt;math&gt;r=r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\theta\in[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Along the way, we must satisfy some number of conditions to ensure continuity of the resulting curve.

Let us define a function &lt;math&gt;r_0(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;r_0(\theta) = x+\left(\frac{1}{2}-x\right)\cos2\theta&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real parameter and &lt;math&gt;x\in(1/4,1/2]&lt;/math&gt;.
This function is clearly defined for all real &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, but we only use its
values for &lt;math&gt;0\leq\theta\leq\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;r(0)= r(\pi)&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the second function &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta) = \begin{cases}
 r_0(\theta)&amp;\text{ if }0\leq\theta\leq\pi\\
 1-r_0(\theta-\pi)&amp;\text{ if }\pi\leq\theta\leq2\pi.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
This function has the following properties:
# &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;r(0)=r(2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; extends uniquely to a &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic, continuous function on &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;; from now on, we identify &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with this extension;
# &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)+r(\theta+\pi) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\theta\in(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.
These properties imply that the curve given in polar coordinates by the equation &lt;math&gt;r=r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
is a closed Jordan curve and that the origin is an equichordal point.

The construction presented here and based on&lt;ref name="Mathworld_Equichordal_Point"/&gt; results in a curve which is
&lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt;, with the exception of &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, when the curve becomes a circle. Rychlik&lt;ref name="The_Announcement"/&gt; formulated conditions on the Fourier series of &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; which easily allow constructing of curves with one equichordal point, including analytic curves. Rychlik gives a specific example of an analytic curve:
:&lt;math&gt; r = 0.5+0.2\,\sin\theta + 0.2\,\cos3\theta&lt;/math&gt;
Fourier series analysis in Rychlik's paper&lt;ref name="The_Announcement"/&gt; reveals the pattern of Fourier coefficients of all suitable functions &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Special cases ==
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the [[equichordal point problem]], and for
&lt;math&gt;\alpha=-1&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the [[equireciprocal point problem]] considered
by Klee.&lt;ref name="Klee_Equireciprocal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer_Paper"&gt;K. J. Falconer. On the equireciprocal point problem. Geom. Dedicata, 14:113–126, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

We may also consider a more general relationship between &lt;math&gt;|X-O|&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;|O-Y|&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the [[equiproduct point problem]]
is obtained by considering the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;|X-O||O-Y|=c. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\log|X-O| + \log|O-Y| = c'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

This naturally leads to a more general class of problems. For a given function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we may study the equations:
:&lt;math&gt;f(|X-O|) + f(|O-Y)) = c .&lt;/math&gt;

Even more generally, we could consider a function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; of two real variables.  We need to assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=f(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we may consider the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(|X-O|, |O-Y|) = c.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; needs only be defined for positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the family of chordal problems of this type is parameterized by symmetric functions of two variables.

== The status of various special cases ==

=== The equichordal point problem (''&amp;alpha;'' = 1) ===
This has been the most famous of the chordal problems.
In this case, the equation&lt;ref name="Chordal_Equation"/&gt; states that every chord passing through &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;
has the same length. It has become known as the [[equichordal point problem]], and was fully solved in 1996 by Marek Rychlik.

=== The equireciprocal point problem (''&amp;alpha;'' = &amp;minus;1)===

Klee&lt;ref name="Klee_Equireciprocal"&gt;V. Klee. Can a plane convex body have two equireciprocal points? ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', 76:54–55, 1969, correction in 78:1114, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the [[ellipse]] solves the [[equireciprocal point problem]], with the ellipse foci serving
as the two equireciprocal points. However, in addition to the ellipses, many
solutions of low smoothness also exist, as it was shown in.&lt;ref name="Falconer_Paper"/&gt; From the point of view of the equichordal point problem, this is due to the lack of hyperbolicity of the fixed points of a certain map of the plane.

=== Other cases ===
The method used in Rychlik's proof for the equichordal point problem may only generalize to some rational values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. A reasonable
conjecture could be:
:'''Conjecture:''' There are no solutions of the Chordal Problem for rational &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; close to&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Crispin St. John Alvah Nash-Williams''' (19 December 1932 – 20 January 2001) was a British mathematician. His research interest was in the field of [[discrete mathematics]], especially [[graph theory]].

==Biography==
Nash-Williams was born on 19 December 1932 in [[Cardiff, Wales]]; his father, [[Victor Erle Nash-Williams]], was an archaeologist at [[University College Cardiff]], and his mother had studied classics at [[Oxford University]]. After studying mathematics at [[Cambridge University]], earning the title of [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] in 1953, he remained for his graduate studies at Cambridge, studying under the supervision of [[Shaun Wylie]] and [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]]. He continued his studies for a year at [[Princeton University]], with [[Norman Steenrod]]; all three of Wylie, Rees, and Steenrod are listed as the supervisors of his Ph.D. dissertation. He finished his dissertation in 1958, but before doing so he returned to the UK as an assistant lecturer at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. He kept his position at Aberdeen through ten years and two promotions until 1967, when he moved to the [[University of Waterloo]] and became one of the three faculty members in the newly formed Department of Combinatorics there. In 1972 he returned to Aberdeen, as Professor of Pure Mathematics; in 1975 he moved to the [[University of Reading]], where he took the chair previously held by [[Richard Rado]], who had been one of his dissertation examiners. In 1996 he retired; he died on 20 January 2001 in [[Ascot, Berkshire]], where his brother was rector.&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Nash-Williams.html Nash-Williams biography] from the MacTutor history of mathematics archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;{{citation|first=D. J. A.|last=Welsh|title=Obituary: Crispin St J. A. Nash-Williams (1932-2001)|journal=Bull. London Math. Soc.|volume=35|issue=6|year=2003|doi=10.1112/S0024609303002315|pages=829–844}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
He was elected to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1969. In 1994, the University of Waterloo gave him an honorary doctorate for his contributions to [[combinatorics]]. A conference in his honor was held on his retirement in 1996, the proceedings of which were published as a [[festschrift]]. The 18th British Combinatorial Conference, held in Sussex in July 2001, was dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref name="welsh"/&gt;

==Contributions==
Hilton&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=A. J. W.|last=Hilton|title=Crispin St J A Nash-Williams|journal=Bull. Inst. Combin. Appl.|volume=33|year=2001|pages=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "Themes running through his papers are [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s, [[Euler tour|Eulerian graphs]], [[spanning tree]]s, the [[Perfect matching|marriage problem]], detachments, [[reconstruction conjecture|reconstruction]], and infinite graphs."
In his first papers Nash-Williams considered the [[knight's tour]] and [[random walk]] problems on infinite graphs; the latter paper included an important recurrence criterion for general [[Markov chain]]s, and was also the first to apply electrical network techniques of [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] to random walks. His dissertation, which he finished in 1958, concerned generalizations of [[Euler tour]]s to infinite graphs.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welsh"/&gt; Welsh&lt;ref name="welsh"/&gt; writes that his subsequent work defining and characterizing the [[arboricity]] of graphs (discovered in parallel and independently by [[W. T. Tutte]]) has "had a huge impact," in part because of its implications in [[matroid]] theory. Nash-Williams also studied [[k-edge-connected graph]]s, Hamiltonian cycles in [[dense graph]]s, versions of the [[reconstruction conjecture]] for infinite graphs, and the theory of [[quasi-order]]s. He also gave a short elegant proof of [[Kruskal's tree theorem]].

A '''cutaway drawing''', also called a '''cutaway diagram''' is a [[3D graphics]], [[technical drawing|drawing]], [[diagram]] and or [[technical illustration|illustration]], in which surface elements of a three-dimensional model are selectively removed, to make internal features visible, but without sacrificing the outer context entirely.

== Overview ==
According to Diepstraten et al. (2003) "the purpose of a cutaway drawing is to allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering".&lt;ref name="DWE03"&gt; J. Diepstraten, D. Weiskopf &amp; T. Ertl (2003). [http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/~weiskopf/publications/eg2003.pdf "Interactive Cutaway Illustrations"]. in: ''Eurographics 2003''. P. Brunet and D. Fellner (ed). Vol 22 (2003), Nr 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though cutaway drawing are not dimensioned manufacturing [[blueprint]]s, they are meticulously drawn by a handful of devoted artists who either had access to manufacturing details or deduced them by observing the visible evidence of the hidden skeleton (e.g. rivet lines, etc.). The goal of this drawings in studies can be to identify common design patterns for particular vehicle classes. Thus, the accuracy of most of these drawings, while not 100 percent, is certainly high enough for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Sensmeier, and Jamshid A. Samareh (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110529061046/http://140.116.81.56/FS/NASA-aiaa-2004-1624.pdf "A Study of Vehicle Structural Layouts in Post-WWII Aircraft"] Paper American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is used extensively in [[computer-aided design]], see first image. It has also been incorporated into the [[user interface]] of some [[video game]]s. In [[The Sims]], for instance, users can select through a control panel whether to view the house they are building with no walls, cutaway walls, or full walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:Fire-setting.jpg|thumb|An engraving by [[Georgius Agricola]] illustrating the mining practice of [[fire-setting]]]]
The cutaway view and the [[exploded view]] were minor graphic inventions of the [[Renaissance]] that also clarified pictorial representation. This cutaway view originates in the early fifteenth century notebooks of [[Taccola|Marino Taccola]] (1382 – 1453). In the 16th century cutaway views in definite form were used in [[Georgius Agricola]]'s (1494-1555) mining book ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' to illustrate underground operations.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene S. Ferguson (1999). ''Engineering and the Mind's Eye''. p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1556 book is a complete and systematic treatise on [[mining]] and [[metallurgy#Extractive metallurgy|extractive metallurgy]], illustrated with many fine and interesting [[woodcut]]s which illustrate every conceivable process to extract ores from the ground and metal from the ore, and more besides. It shows the many [[watermill]]s used in [[mining]], such as the machine for lifting men and material into and out of a mine shaft, see image.

The term "Cutaway drawing" was already in use in the 19th century but, became popular in the 1930s.

== Technique ==
The location and shape to cut the outside object depends on many different factors, for example:&lt;ref name="DWE03"/&gt;
* the sizes and shapes of the inside and outside objects, 
* the semantics of the objects, 
* personal taste, etc. 

These factors, according to Diepstraten et al. (2003), "can seldom be formalized in a simple algorithm, But the properties of cutaway can be distinguish in two classes of cutaways of a drawing":&lt;ref name="DWE03"/&gt;
* ''cutout'' : illustrations where the cutaway is restricted to very simple and regularly shaped of often only a small number of planar slices into the outside object.
* ''breakaway'' : a cutaway realized by a single hole in the outside of the object.

== Examples ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">In [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] and [[communication complexity]] theories the '''decision tree model''' is the [[model of computation]] or [[communication]] in which an algorithm or communication process is considered to be basically a [[decision tree]], i.e., a sequence of branching operations based on comparisons of some quantities, the comparisons being assigned the unit computational cost.

The branching operations are called "tests" or "queries". In this setting the algorithm in question may be viewed as a computation of a [[Boolean function]] &lt;math&gt;f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; where the input is a series of queries and the output is the final decision. Every query is dependent on previous queries.

Several variants of decision tree models have been introduced, depending on the complexity of the operations allowed in the computation of a single comparison and the way of branching.

Decision trees models are instrumental in establishing [[lower bound]]s for [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] for certain classes of computational problems and algorithms: the lower bound for [[worst-case analysis|worst-case computational complexity]] is proportional to the largest depth among the decision trees for all possible inputs for a given computational problem. The computation complexity of a problem or an algorithm expressed in terms of the decision tree model is called '''decision tree complexity''' or '''query complexity'''.

==Classification by query computational complexity==

=== Simple decision tree ===

The model in which every decision is based on the comparison of two numbers within constant time is called a ''decision tree model''. It was introduced to establish computational complexity of [[sorting]] and searching.&lt;ref&gt;"Data structures and algorithms,  by [[Alfred V. Aho]], [[John E. Hopcroft]], [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest illustration of this lower bound technique is for the problem of finding the smallest number among ''n'' numbers using only comparisons. In this case the decision tree model is a [[binary tree]]. Algorithms for this searching problem may result in ''n'' different outcomes (since any of the ''n'' given numbers may turn out to be the smallest one). It is known that the depth of a binary tree with ''n'' [[Leaf node|leaves]] is at least &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;, which gives a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; for the searching problem.  

However this lower bound is known to be slack, since the following simple argument shows that at least ''n'' - 1 comparisons are needed: Before the smallest number can be determined, every number except the smallest must "lose" (compare greater) in at least one comparison.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

Along the same lines the lower bound of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; for [[sorting]] may be proved.  In this case, the existence of numerous comparison-sorting algorithms having this time complexity, such as [[mergesort]] and [[heapsort]], demonstrates that the bound is tight.

=== Linear decision tree ===
Linear decision trees, just like the simple decision trees, make a branching decision based on a set of values as input. As opposed to binary decision trees, linear decision trees have three output branches. A linear function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, \dots, x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is being tested and branching decisions are made based on the sign of the function (negative, positive, or 0).

Geometrically, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; defines a [[hyperplane]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. A set of input values reaching any particular nodes represents the intersection of the half-planes defined by the nodes.

===Algebraic decision tree===
Algebraic decision trees are a generalization of linear decision trees to allow test functions to be polynomials of degree ''d''. Geometrically, the space is divided into semi-algebraic sets (a generalization of hyperplane). The evaluation of the complexity is more difficult.

== Classification by query computational model ==

===Deterministic decision tree===
If the output of a decision tree is &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x\in \{0,1\}^n &lt;/math&gt;, the decision tree is said to "compute"  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The depth of a tree is the maximum number of queries that can happen before a leaf is reached and a result obtained. '''&lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;''', the '''deterministic decision tree''' complexity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest depth among all deterministic decision trees that compute &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Randomized decision tree===
One way to define a '''randomized decision tree''' is to add additional nodes to the tree, each controlled by a probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Another equivalent definition is to select a whole decision tree at the beginning from a set of decision trees based on a probability distribution.  Based on this second definition, the complexity of the randomized tree is defined as the greatest depth among all the trees associated with probabilities greater than 0.  '''&lt;math&gt;R_2(f)&lt;/math&gt;''' is defined as the complexity of the lowest-depth randomized decision tree whose result is &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with probability at least &lt;math&gt;2/3&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in \{0,1\}^n &lt;/math&gt; (i.e., with bounded 2-sided error).

'''&lt;math&gt;R_2(f)&lt;/math&gt;''' is known as the [[Monte Carlo algorithm|Monte Carlo]] randomized decision-tree complexity, because the result is allowed to be incorrect with bounded two-sided error.  The [[Las Vegas algorithm|Las Vegas]] decision-tree complexity '''&lt;math&gt;R_0(f)&lt;/math&gt;''' measures the ''expected'' depth of a decision tree that must be correct (i.e., has zero-error).  There is also a one-sided bounded-error version known as '''&lt;math&gt;R_1(f)&lt;/math&gt;'''.

===Nondeterministic decision tree===
The nondeterministic decision tree complexity of a function is known more commonly as the [[Certificate (complexity)|certificate complexity]] of that function.  It measures the number of input bits that a [[nondeterministic algorithm]] would need to look at in order to evaluate the function with certainty.

===Quantum decision tree===
The quantum decision tree complexity '''&lt;math&gt;Q_2(f)&lt;/math&gt;''' is the depth of the lowest-depth quantum decision tree that gives the result &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with probability at least &lt;math&gt;2/3&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in \{0,1\}^n &lt;/math&gt;.  Another quantity, '''&lt;math&gt;Q_E(f)&lt;/math&gt;''', is defined as the depth of the lowest-depth quantum decision tree that gives the result &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with probability 1 in all cases (i.e. computes &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; exactly).  &lt;math&gt;Q_2(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_E(f)&lt;/math&gt; are more commonly known as '''quantum query complexities''', because the direct definition of a quantum decision tree is more complicated than in the classical case. Similar to the randomized case, we define &lt;math&gt;Q_0(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_1(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows immediately from the definitions that for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-bit Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;Q_2(f) \leq R_2(f) \leq R_1(f) \leq R_0(f) \leq D(f) \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q_2(f) \leq Q_E(f) \leq D(f) \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

The quantum decision tree complexity &lt;math&gt;Q_2(f)&lt;/math&gt; is also polynomially related to &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the largest known gap between deterministic and quantum query complexities is only quadratic.  A quadratic gap is achieved for the [[Grover's algorithm|OR function]]; &lt;math&gt;D(OR_n) = n&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;Q_2(OR_n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

It is important to note that these polynomial relationships are valid only for ''total'' Boolean functions.  For [[Total function|partial Boolean functions]], that have a domain a subset of &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, an exponential separation between &lt;math&gt;Q_E(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt; is possible; the first example of such a problem was discovered by [[Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm|Deutsch and Jozsa]].

These relationships can be summarized by the following inequalities, which are true up to constant factors:&lt;ref name="Midrijanis2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3359">In [[mathematics]], the '''EHP spectral sequence''' is a [[spectral sequence]] used for inductively calculating the [[homotopy groups of spheres]] localized at some [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. It is described in more detail in {{harvtxt|Ravenel|2003|loc=chapter 1.5}} and {{harvtxt|Mahowald|2001}}. It is related to the EHP long exact sequence of {{harvtxt|Whitehead|1953}}; the name "EHP" comes from the fact that [[George W. Whitehead]] named 3 of the maps of his sequence "E" (the first letter of the German word "Einhängung" meaning "suspension"), "H" (for [[Heinz Hopf]], as this map is the second Hopf–James invariant), and "P" (related to [[Whitehead product]]s).

For &lt;math&gt;p = 2&lt;/math&gt; the spectral sequence uses some exact sequences associated to the fibration {{harv|James|1957}}
:&lt;math&gt;S^n(2)\rightarrow \Omega S^{n+1}(2)\rightarrow \Omega S^{2n+1}(2)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; stands for a loop space and the (2) is [[localization of a topological space]] at the prime 2.  This gives a spectral sequence with &lt;math&gt;E_1^{k,n}&lt;/math&gt; term equal to 
: &lt;math&gt;\pi_{k+n}(S^{2 n - 1}(2))&lt;/math&gt; 
and converging to &lt;math&gt;\pi_*^S(2)&lt;/math&gt; (stable homotopy groups of spheres localized at 2). The spectral sequence has the advantage that the input is previously calculated homotopy groups. It was used by {{harvtxt|Toda|1977}} to calculate the first 31 stable homotopy groups of spheres.

For arbitrary primes one uses  some fibrations found by {{harvtxt|Toda|1962}}: 
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat S^{2n}(p)\rightarrow \Omega S^{2n+1}(p)\rightarrow \Omega S^{2pn+1}(p)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S^{2n-1}(p)\rightarrow \Omega \widehat S^{2n}(p)\rightarrow \Omega S^{2pn-1}(p)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\widehat S^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(2np-1)&lt;/math&gt;-skeleton of the loop space &lt;math&gt;\Omega S^{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. (For &lt;math&gt;p = 2&lt;/math&gt;, the space &lt;math&gt;\widehat S^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt; S^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, so Toda's fibrations at &lt;math&gt;p = 2&lt;/math&gt; are the same as the James fibrations.)

'''Economics of networks''' is an increasing new field on the border of [[economics]] and [[network science]]s. It is concerned with understanding of economic phenomena by using network concepts and the tools of network science. Some main authors in this field are [[Sanjeev Goyal]], [[Matthew O. Jackson]] and [[Rachel Kranton]].

This term should not be confused with network economics or [[Network effect|network externality]], a theory explaining that a product or service has an increasing demand, that is, the more people use it, the more utility it brings.

== Models of networked markets ==
Using the concept of networks during the analysis of markets can enable us to better understand its functioning. On the border of network science and market theory, several models have emerged explaining different aspects of markets.

=== [[Social exchange theory|Exchange theory]] ===
Exchange theory explains how economic transactions, tradon of favors, communication of information or other goods’ exchanges are affected by the structure of relationship among the involved participants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social and economic networks|last = Jackson|first = Matthew O.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780691134406|location = Princeton|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concept is that the act of exchange depends on the agents’ other opportunities and their environment, and thus getting a deeper understanding is possible only by examining these factors. The position of a given agent in the network, for example, can endow her with power over the auctions and deals she make with her partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Power, Equity and Commitment in Exchange Networks|last = Cook|first = Karen S.|date = October 1978|journal = American Sociological Review|doi = 10.2307/2094546|pmid = |last2 = Emerson|first2 = Richard M. |jstor=2094546 |volume=43 |pages=721–739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilateral trading models ===
As part of exchange theory, bilateral trading models consider sellers and buyers and use game theory models of the bargaining in networks in order to predict the behaviour of agents depending on the type of network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The outcome of transactions can be determined by, for example, the number of sellers a buyer is connected to, or vice versa for which Corominas-Bosch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = One Two-Sided Network Markets|last = Corominas-Bosch|first = Margarida|date = 2004|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|doi = 10.1016/s0022-0531(03)00110-8|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; built a very simple model. Another case is when the agents agree on the transaction through an auction and their decision making during the auction depends on the link structure. Kranton and Minehart&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Theory of Buyer-Seller Networks|last = Kranton|first = Rachel E.|date = June 2001|journal = American Economic Review|doi = 10.1257/aer.91.3.485|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Minehart|first2 = Deborah F. |volume=91 |pages=485–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to the conclusion that if we consider markets as networks it can enable sellers to pool uncertainty in demand. As building links is costly, due to the trade-off not everybody need to be linked to everybody in the network. Sparsity in the network will prove to be efficient.

=== Informal exchange ===
The first networks in economics were discovered prior to the development of network science. [[Károly Polányi|Károly Polány]], Claude [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]] or [[Bronisław Malinowski|Bronislaw Malinowski]] studied such tribes where complicated [[Gift economy|gift exchange]] mechanisms constructed networks between groups, families or islands. Although modern trade systems differ fundamentally, such systems based on reciprocity can still survive and reciprocity-based or personalised exchange deals persists even when a market would be more efficient. According to Kranton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://public.econ.duke.edu/~rek8/reciprocalexchange.pdf|title = Reciprocal Exchange: A Self-Sustaining System|last = Kranton|first = Rachel|date = 1996|journal = American Economic Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; informal exchange can exist in networks if transactions are more reciprocal than market-based. In this case, market exchange is hard to find and associated with high search costs, therefore yields low utility. Personalised exchange agreements ensure the possibility of long term agreements.

== Scale-free property and economics ==
Recent studies have tried to examine the deeper connection between [[socioeconomic]] factors and phenomena and the [[Scale-free network|scale free property]]. They found that [[business networks]] have scale-free property, and that the [[merger]] among companies decreases the average separation between firms and increase [[clique|cliquishness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Complex networks and economics|last = Souma|first = Wataru|date = 2003|journal = Physica A|doi = 10.1016/s0378-4371(02)01858-7|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Fujiwara|first2 = Yoshi|last3 = Aoyama|first3 = Hideaki |volume=324 |pages=396–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106013124|title = The topology of interbank payment flows|last = Soramaki|first = Kimmo|date = June 2007|journal = Physica A|doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2006.11.093|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Bech|first2 = Morten L.|last3 = Arnold|first3 = Jeffrey|last4 = Glass|first4 = Robert J.|last5 = Beyeler|first5 = Walter E.|volume=379|pages=317–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists found that payment flows in an [[online payment]] system exhibits free-scale property, high [[clustering coefficient]] and [[small world phenomenon]], and that after 9/11 attacks the connectivity of the network reduced and average path length increased. These results were found to be useful in order to understand how to overcome a possible contagion of similar disturbances in payment networks.

== World trade web ==
World trade is generally highlighted as a typical example for huge networks. The interconnectedness of the countries can both have positive and negative externalities. It has been shown that the world trade web exhibits [[Scale-free_network|scale free]] properties, where the main hub is the United States. 18 out of 21 analyzed developed countries showed large synchronization in economic performance and cycles with the US during 1975-2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437103005673|title = Complexity and synchronization of the World Trade Web|last = Li|first = Xiang|date = October 2003|journal = Physica A|doi = 10.1016/S0378-4371(03)00567-3|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Jin|first2 = Yu Ying|last3 = Chen|first3 = Guanrong|volume=328|pages=287–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining three countries are special cases. Austria’s performance correlates highly with that of Germany, though Germany and Japan took completely different economic paths. It seems, despite their embeddedness into the global economy, that the unusual economic measures following [[Unification of Germany|Germany’s unification]] in 1992 and the [[Plaza Accord]] in 1985 (which appreciated the Japanese Yen), drove these two countries off the normal economic track. The importance of regional economic (and political) cooperation also appears in this analysis.

'''Efim Isaakovich Zelmanov''' ({{lang-ru|Ефи́м Исаа́кович Зе́льманов}}; born 7 September 1955 in [[Khabarovsk]]) is a [[Russian-American]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/3008679.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]], known for his work on combinatorial problems in [[nonassociative algebra]] and [[group theory]], including his solution of the [[restricted Burnside problem]].

Zelmanov's early work was on [[Jordan algebra]]s in the case of infinite dimensions. He was able to show that [[Glennie's identity]] in a certain sense generates all identities that hold. He then showed that the [[Engel identity]] for [[Lie algebra]]s implies [[nilpotent Lie algebra|nilpotence]], in the case of infinite dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">In [[information theory]], the '''entropy power inequality''' is a result that relates to so-called "entropy power" of [[random variable]]s. It shows that the entropy power of suitably [[well-behaved]] random variables is a [[superadditive]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The entropy power inequality was proved in 1948 by [[Claude Shannon]] in his seminal paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]". Shannon also provided a sufficient condition for equality to hold; Stam (1959) showed that the condition is in fact necessary.

==Statement of the inequality==

For a random variable ''X''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[probability density function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', the [[differential entropy]] of ''X'', denoted ''h''(''X''), is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;h(X) = - \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) \log f(x) \, d x&lt;/math&gt;

and the entropy power of ''X'', denoted ''N''(''X''), is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt; N(X) = \frac{1}{2\pi e} e^{ \frac{2}{n} h(X) }.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, ''N''(''X'') = |''K''| &lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt; when ''X''&amp;nbsp;is normal distributed with covariance matrix ''K''.

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[independent random variables]] with probability density functions in the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) for some ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Then

:&lt;math&gt;N(X + Y) \geq N(X) + N(Y). \,&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, equality holds [[if and only if]] ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[multivariate normal]] random variables with proportional [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]].

'''Giovanni Enrico Eugenio Vacca''' (18 November 1872 – 6 January 1953) was an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[mathematician]], [[Sinologist]] and historian of science. 

Vacca studied mathematics and graduated from the [[University of Genoa]] in 1897 under the guidance of G. B. Negri. He was a politically active student and was banished for that from Genoa in 1897. He moved to [[Turin]] and became an assistant to [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In 1899 he studied, at [[Hanover]], unpublished manuscripts of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], which he published in 1903. Around 1898 Vacca became interested in Chinese language and culture after attending a Chinese exhibition in [[Turin]]. He took private lessons of Chinese and continued to study it at the [[University of Florence]]. Vacca then traveled to China in 1907–8 and defended a PhD in Chinese studies in 1910. In 1911, he became a lecturer in Chinese literature at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]. In 1922, he moved to Florence and taught Chinese literature and language at university until 1947. &lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Vacca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interests of Vacca were almost equally split between mathematics, Sinology and history of science, with a corresponding number of papers being 38, 47 and 45. In 1910, Vacca developed a [[complex number]] iteration for [[pi]]:&lt;ref&gt;G. Vacca. ''A new analytical expression for the number π and some historical considerations'', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (Ser. 2), 1910, vol.16, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = i,\quad x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + |x_n|}2,\qquad\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \frac2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation efficiency of these formulas is significantly worse than of the modern [[Borwein's algorithm]] – they converge by only about half a decimal point with each iteration.

Vacca published his two major contributions to mathematics in 1910 and 1926, on [[series expansion]] (later named Vacca series) of the [[Euler constant]]. They are, respectively
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \gamma &amp;= \sum_{k=2}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{ \left \lfloor \log_2 k \right \rfloor}{k}
  = \tfrac12-\tfrac13
  + 2\left(\tfrac14 - \tfrac15 + \tfrac16 - \tfrac17\right)
  + 3\left(\tfrac18 - \cdots - \tfrac1{15}\right) + \cdots\\[6pt]
 \zeta(2) + \gamma  &amp;= \sum_{k=2}^\infty\left(\frac1{\lfloor \sqrt{k} \rfloor^2} - \frac1{k}\right)
  = \sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{k - \lfloor\sqrt{k}\rfloor^2}{k\lfloor\sqrt{k}\rfloor^2} \\[4pt]
  &amp; = \tfrac12 + \tfrac23 + \tfrac1{2^2}\left(\tfrac15 + \tfrac26 + \tfrac37 + \tfrac48\right)
                        + \tfrac1{3^2}\left(\tfrac1{10} + \cdots + \tfrac6{15}\right) + \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Vacca noted in 1910 that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[James Joseph Sylvester]]|author2=[[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher]]|title=The Quarterly journal of pure and applied mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4qXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 August 2011|year=1910|publisher=J. W. Parker|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''There is some hope that this series can be of some use in the proof of the irrationality of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, a very difficult problem, proposed, but not resolved, in the Correspondence, recently published, between [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] und [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes|Stieltjes]].''

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hall algebra''' is an [[associative algebra]] with a basis corresponding to isomorphism classes of finite abelian [[p-group|''p''-groups]]. It was first discussed by {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1901}} but forgotten until it was rediscovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Philip Hall|first= Philip|last= Hall|year=1959}}, both of whom published no more than brief summaries of their work. The '''Hall polynomials''' are the [[structure constants]] of  the '''Hall algebra'''. The Hall algebra plays an important role in the theory of [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig]] regarding [[crystal basis|canonical bases]] in [[quantum group]]s. {{harvtxt|Ringel|1990}} generalized Hall algebras to more general [[Category theory|categories]], such as the category of representations of a [[quiver (mathematics)|quiver]].

== Construction ==
A [[finite set|finite]] [[abelian group|abelian]] [[p-group|''p''-group]] ''M'' is a direct sum of [[cyclic group|cyclic]] ''p''-power components &lt;math&gt;C_{p^{\lambda_i}},&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; called the ''type'' of ''M''.  Let &lt;math&gt;g^\lambda_{\mu,\nu}(p)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of subgroups ''N'' of ''M'' such that ''N'' has type &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and the quotient ''M/N'' has type &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hall proved that the functions ''g'' are [[polynomial]] functions of ''p'' with integer coefficients. Thus we may replace ''p'' with an indeterminate ''q'', which results in the '''Hall polynomials''' 

: &lt;math&gt;g^\lambda_{\mu,\nu}(q)\in\mathbb{Z}[q]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Hall next constructs an [[associative ring]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[q]&lt;/math&gt;, now called the '''Hall algebra'''. This ring has a basis consisting of the symbols &lt;math&gt;u_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the structure constants of the multiplication in this basis are given by the Hall polynomials: 

:&lt;math&gt; u_\mu u_\nu = \sum_\lambda g^\lambda_{\mu,\nu}(q) u_\lambda. \, &lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that ''H'' is a commutative ring, freely generated by the elements &lt;math&gt;u_{\mathbf1^n}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[elementary abelian group|elementary ''p''-groups]]. The linear map from ''H'' to the algebra of [[symmetric function]]s defined on the generators by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;u_{\mathbf 1^n} \mapsto q^{-n(n-1)/2}e_n \, &lt;/math&gt;

(where ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[elementary symmetric function]]) uniquely extends to a [[ring homomorphism]] and the images of the basis elements &lt;math&gt;u_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted via the [[Hall–Littlewood polynomial|Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions]]. Specializing ''q'' to 0, these symmetric functions become [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]], which are thus closely connected with the theory of Hall polynomials.

[[Image:Happy-End-problem.svg|thumb|300px|The happy ending problem: every set of five points in general position contains the vertices of a convex quadrilateral]]
The "'''happy ending problem'''" (so named by [[Paul Erdős]] because it led to the marriage of [[George Szekeres]] and [[Esther Szekeres|Esther Klein]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/a-world-of-teaching-and-numbers--times-two/2005/11/06/1131211943674.html A world of teaching and numbers - times two], [[Michael Cowling]], [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 2005-11-07, cited 2014-09-04&lt;/ref&gt;) is the following statement:

:'''Theorem''': any set of five points in the plane in [[general position]]&lt;ref&gt;In this context, general position means that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.&lt;/ref&gt; has a subset of four points that form the vertices of a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]].

This was one of the original results that led to the development of [[Ramsey theory]].

The happy ending theorem can be proven by a simple case analysis: if four or more points are vertices of the [[convex hull]], any four such points can be chosen. If on the other hand, the point set has the form of a triangle with two points inside it, the two inner points and one of the triangle sides can be chosen. See {{harvtxt|Peterson|2000}} for an illustrated explanation of this proof, and {{harvtxt|Morris|Soltan|2000}} for a more detailed survey of the problem.

The '''Erdős–Szekeres conjecture''' states precisely a more general relationship between the number of points in a general-position point set and its largest convex polygon, namely that the smallest number of points for which any general position arrangement contains a convex subset of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points is &lt;math&gt;2^{n-2}+1&lt;/math&gt; . It remains unproven, but less precise bounds are known.

==Larger polygons==
[[Image:8-points-no-pentagon.svg|thumb|A set of eight points in general position with no convex pentagon]]
{{harvtxt|Erdős|Szekeres|1935}} proved the following generalisation:

:'''Theorem''': for any positive [[integer]] ''N'', any sufficiently large finite set of points in the plane in general position has a subset of ''N'' points that form the vertices of a convex polygon.

The proof appeared in the same paper that proves the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] on monotonic subsequences in sequences of numbers.

Let ''f''(''N'') denote the minimum ''M'' for which any set of ''M'' points in general position must contain a convex ''N''-gon. It is known that
* ''f''(3) = 3, trivially.
* ''f''(4) = 5.&lt;ref&gt;This was the original problem, proved by Esther Klein.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f''(5) = 9.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Erdős|Szekeres|1935}}, this was first proved by E. Makai; the first published proof appeared in {{harvtxt|Kalbfleisch|Kalbfleisch|Stanton|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A set of eight points with no convex pentagon is shown in the illustration, demonstrating that ''f''(5) &gt; 8; the more difficult part of the proof is to show that every set of nine points in general position contains the vertices of a convex pentagon.
* ''f''(6) = 17.&lt;ref&gt;This has been proved by {{harvtxt|Szekeres|Peters|2006}}. They carried out a computer search which eliminated all possible configurations of 17 points without convex hexagons while examining only a tiny fraction of all configurations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The value of ''f''(''N'') is unknown for all ''N'' &gt; 6; by the result of {{harvtxt|Erdős|Szekeres|1935}} it is known to be finite.

On the basis of the known values of ''f''(''N'') for ''N'' = 3, 4 and 5, Erdős and Szekeres conjectured in their original paper that
:&lt;math&gt;f(N) = 1 + 2^{N-2} \quad \mbox{for all } N \geq 3.&lt;/math&gt;
They proved later, by constructing explicit examples, that
:&lt;math&gt;f(N) \geq 1 + 2^{N-2},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|Szekeres|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but the best known upper bound when ''N'' ≥ 7 is
:&lt;math&gt;f(N)\leq 2^{N + o(N)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Suk|2016}}. See [[binomial coefficient]] and [[big O notation]] for notation used here and [[Catalan number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation]] for the asymptotic expansion.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empty convex polygons==
There is also the question of whether any sufficiently large set of points in general position has an "empty" convex quadrilateral, [[pentagon]], etc.,
that is, one that contains no other input point. The original solution to the happy ending problem can be adapted to show that any five points in general position have an empty convex quadrilateral, as shown in the illustration, and any ten points in general position have an empty convex pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harborth|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist arbitrarily large sets of points in general position that contain no empty convex [[heptagon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horton|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time the question of the existence of empty [[hexagon]]s remained open, but {{harvtxt|Nicolás|2007}} and {{harvtxt|Gerken|2008}} proved that every sufficiently large point set in general position contains a convex empty hexagon.  More specifically, Gerken showed that the number of points needed is no more than ''f''(9) for the same function ''f'' defined above, while Nicolás showed that the number of points needed is no more than ''f''(25). {{harvtxt|Valtr|2008}} supplies a simplification of Gerken's proof that however requires more points, ''f''(15) instead of ''f''(9). At least 30 points are needed: there exists a set of 29 points in general position with no empty convex hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Overmars|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==
The problem of finding sets of ''n'' points minimizing the number of convex quadrilaterals is equivalent to minimizing the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]] in a straight-line [[graph drawing|drawing]] of a [[complete graph]]. The number of quadrilaterals must be proportional to the fourth power of ''n'', but the precise constant is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Scheinerman|Wilf|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is straightforward to show that, in higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s, sufficiently large sets of points will have a subset of ''k'' points that forms the vertices of a [[convex polytope]], for any ''k'' greater than the dimension: this follows immediately from existence of convex ''k''-gons in sufficiently large planar point sets, by projecting the higher-dimensional point set into an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace. However, the number of points necessary to find ''k'' points in [[convex position]] may be smaller in higher dimensions than it is in the plane, and it is possible to find subsets that are more highly constrained. In particular, in ''d'' dimensions, every ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 points in general position have a subset of ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 points that form the vertices of a [[cyclic polytope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}, Ex. 6.5.6, p.120. Grünbaum attributes this result to a private communication of Micha A. Perles.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, for every ''d'' and ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''d'' there exists a number ''m''(''d'',''k'') such that every set of ''m''(''d'',''k'') points in general position has a subset of ''k'' points that form the vertices of a [[neighborly polytope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}, Ex. 7.3.6, p. 126. This result follows by applying a Ramsey-theoretic argument similar to Szekeres's original proof together with Perles's result on the case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1740">In [[number theory]], a '''hemiperfect number''' is a [[positive integer]] with a half-integral [[abundancy index]].

For a given [[odd number]] ''k'', a number ''n'' is called ''k''-hemiperfect [[if and only if]] the sum of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' (the [[divisor function]], ''σ''(''n'')) is equal to {{sfrac|''k''|2}}&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;n.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21377">In [[mathematics]], '''Hensel's lemma''', also known as '''Hensel's lifting lemma''', named after [[Kurt Hensel]], is a result in [[modular arithmetic]], stating that if a [[polynomial equation]] has a [[Multiple roots of a polynomial|simple root]] modulo a [[prime number]] {{math|''p''}}, then this root corresponds to a unique root of the same equation modulo any higher power of {{math|''p''}}, which can be found by iteratively "[[lift (mathematics)|lift]]ing" the solution modulo successive powers of {{math|''p''}}. More generally it is used as a generic name for analogues for [[completion (ring theory)|complete]] [[commutative ring]]s (including [[p-adic field|''p''-adic field]]s in particular) of the [[Newton method]] for solving equations. Since [[p-adic analysis|''p''-adic analysis]] is in some ways simpler than [[real analysis]], there are relatively neat criteria guaranteeing a root of a polynomial.

== Statement ==

Many equivalent statements of Hensel's lemma exist. Arguably the most common statement is the following.

=== General statement ===
Assume &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a field complete with respect to a normalised discrete [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose, furthermore, that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_K&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of integers of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. all elements of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with non-negative valuation), let &lt;math&gt;\pi\in K&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;v(\pi)=1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;k=\mathcal{O}_K/\pi&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[residue field]]. Let &lt;math&gt;f(X)\in\mathcal{O}_K[X]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_K&lt;/math&gt;. If the reduction &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(X)\in k[X]&lt;/math&gt; has a simple root (i.e. there exists &lt;math&gt;k_0\in k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(k_0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{f'}(k_0) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;), then there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathcal{O}_K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt; and the reduction &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}=k_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lang, ''Algebraic Number Theory'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1970, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative statement ===
Another way of stating this (in less generality) is: let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[polynomial]] with [[integer]] (or ''p''-adic integer) coefficients, and let ''m'',''k'' be positive integers such that ''m'' ≤ ''k''.  If ''r'' is an integer such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(r) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;

then there exists an integer ''s'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(s) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^{k+m}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r \equiv s \pmod{p^{k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, this ''s'' is unique modulo ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+m&lt;/sup&gt;, and can be computed explicitly as the integer such that

:&lt;math&gt;s = r - f(r)\cdot a&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;  is an integer satisfying  &lt;math&gt;a \equiv [f'(r)]^{-1} \pmod{p^m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt; so that the condition &lt;math&gt;s \equiv r \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt; is met.  As an aside, if &lt;math&gt;f'(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then 0, 1, or several ''s'' may exist (see Hensel Lifting below).

=== Derivation ===
The lemma derives from considering the Taylor expansion of ''f'' around ''r''.  From &lt;math&gt;r \equiv s \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that ''s'' has to be of the form ''s = r + tp&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some integer ''t''. 

Let  &lt;math&gt;f(r + t p^k) = \sum_{n=0}^N c_n \ \left(tp^k\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_0 = f(r), \, c_1 = f'(r)&lt;/math&gt;, hence

:&lt;math&gt;f(r + tp^k) = f(r) + t\,p^k\, f'(r) + p^{2k}\, t^2\, g(t)&lt;/math&gt; for some polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients.

Reducing both sides modulo &lt;math&gt;p^{k+m}, m \leq k&lt;/math&gt;, we see that for &lt;math&gt;f(s) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^{k+m}}&lt;/math&gt; to hold, we need

:&lt;math&gt;0 \equiv f(r + tp^k) \equiv f(r) + t\,p^k \, f'(r)\pmod{p^{k+m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we note that &lt;math&gt;f(r) = zp^k&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a root of &lt;math&gt;f(x) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt;''.''  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \equiv (z + tf'(r))p^k \pmod{p^{k+m}}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is to say
:&lt;math&gt;0 \equiv z + tf'(r) \pmod{p^m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p^m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; gives the explicit formula for ''s'' mentioned above.  The assumption that &lt;math&gt;f'(r)&lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by ''p'' ensures that &lt;math&gt;f'(r)&lt;/math&gt; has an inverse mod &lt;math&gt;p^m&lt;/math&gt; which is necessarily unique.  Hence a solution for ''t'' exists uniquely modulo &lt;math&gt;p^m&lt;/math&gt;, and ''s'' exists uniquely modulo &lt;math&gt;p^{k+m}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Hensel lifting ==

Using the lemma, one can "lift" (i.e. add multiples of the next power of p) a root ''r'' of the polynomial ''f'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to a new root ''s'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''r'' ≡ ''s'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; (by taking ''m''=1; taking larger ''m'' follows by induction).  In fact, a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is also a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, so the roots mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; are precisely the liftings of roots mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The new root ''s'' is congruent to ''r'' mod ''p'', so the new root also satisfies &lt;math&gt;f'(s) \equiv f'(r) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;.  So the lifting can be repeated, and starting from a solution ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt; we can derive a sequence of solutions ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of the same congruence for successively higher powers of ''p'', provided &lt;math&gt;f'(r_k) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; for the initial root ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This also shows that ''f'' has the same number of roots mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; as mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, mod ''p'' &lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;, or any other higher power of ''p'', provided the roots of ''f'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are all simple.

What happens to this process if ''r'' is not a simple root mod ''p''?  If we have a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; at which the derivative mod ''p'' is 0, then there is ''not'' a unique lifting of a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;: either there is no lifting to a root mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; or there are multiple choices:

::if &lt;math&gt; f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f'(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p},&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; s \equiv r \pmod{p^k} \Rightarrow f(s) \equiv f(r) \pmod{p^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

That is, &lt;math&gt;f(r + tp^{k}) \equiv f(r)\pmod{p^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt; for all integers ''t''.
Therefore if &lt;math&gt; f(r) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p^{k+1}},&lt;/math&gt; then there is no lifting of ''r'' to a root of ''f''(''x'') mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, while if &lt;math&gt; f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^{k+1}},&lt;/math&gt; then every lifting of ''r'' to modulus ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is a root of ''f''(''x'') mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

To see the difficulty that can arise in concrete examples, take ''p'' = 2, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, and ''r'' = 1. Then ''f''(1) ≡ 0 mod 2 and f'(1) ≡ 0 mod 2. We have ''f''(1) = 2 ≠ 0 mod 4 which means that no lifting of 1 to modulus 4 is a root of ''f''(''x'') mod 4.

On the other hand, if we take ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 17 then, as before, 1 is a root of ''f''(''x'') mod 2 and the derivative is 0 mod 2. But since ''f''(1) is 0 mod 4, then we '''''can''''' lift our solution to modulo 4 and '''''both''''' 1 and 3 are solutions. The derivative is still 0 mod 2, so ''a priori'' we don't know whether we can lift them to modulo 8, but in fact we can, since ''f''(1) is 0 mod 8 and ''f''(3) is 0 mod 8, giving solutions at 1, 3, 5, and 7 mod 8. Since of these only ''f''(1) and ''f''(7) are 0 mod 16 we can lift only 1 and 7 to modulo 16, giving 1, 7, 9, and 15 mod 16. Of these, only 7 and 9 give ''f''(''x'')=0 mod 32, so these can be raised giving 7, 9, 23, and 25 mod 32. It turns out that (for this example f(x)) for every integer ''k'' ≥ 3, there are four liftings of 1 mod 2 to a root of ''f''(''x'') mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Hensel's lemma for ''p''-adic numbers ==
In the ''p''-adic numbers, where we can make sense of rational numbers modulo powers of ''p'' as long as the denominator is not a multiple of ''p'', the recursion from ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (roots mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; (roots mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) can be expressed in a much more intuitive way.  Instead of choosing ''t'' to be an(y) integer which solves the congruence
&lt;math&gt;tf'(r_k) \equiv -(f(r_k)/p^{k})\pmod{p^m}&lt;/math&gt;, let ''t'' be the rational number &lt;math&gt;\ -(f(r_k)/p^{k})/f'(r_k) &lt;/math&gt; (the ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; here is not really a denominator since ''f''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) is divisible by ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).  Then set

::&lt;math&gt;r_{k+1} = r_k + tp^k = r_k - \frac{f(r_k)}{f'(r_k)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This fraction may not be an integer, but it is a ''p''-adic integer, and the sequence of numbers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in the ''p''-adic integers to a root of ''f''(''x'') = 0. Moreover, the displayed recursive formula for the (new) number ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is precisely [[Newton's method]] for finding roots to equations in the real numbers.

By working directly in the ''p''-adics and using the ''p''-adic absolute value, there is a version of Hensel's lemma which can be applied even if we start with a solution of ''f''(''a'') ≡ 0 mod ''p'' such that f'(''a'') ≡ 0 mod ''p''. We just need to make sure the number f'(''a'') is not exactly 0. This more general version is as follows:
if there is an integer ''a'' which satisfies |''f''(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f&amp;prime;(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then there is a unique ''p''-adic integer ''b'' such ''f''(''b'') = 0 and |''b''-''a''|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f'(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. The construction of ''b'' amounts to showing that the recursion from Newton's method with initial value ''a'' converges in the ''p''-adics and we let ''b'' be the limit. The uniqueness of ''b'' as a root fitting the condition |''b''-''a''|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f'(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; needs additional work.

The statement of Hensel's lemma given above (taking &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;) is a special case of this more general version, since the conditions that ''f''(''a'') ≡ 0 mod ''p'' and f'(''a'') ≠ 0 mod ''p'' say that |''f''(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 and |f'(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.

== Examples ==
Suppose that ''p'' is an odd prime number and ''a'' is a [[quadratic residue]] modulo ''p'' that is nonzero mod ''p''. Then Hensel's lemma implies that ''a'' has a square root in the ring of ''p''-adic integers '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Indeed, let ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''a''. Its derivative is 2''x'', so if ''r'' is a square root of ''a'' mod ''p'' we have

: &lt;math&gt;f(r) = r^2 - a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(r) = 2r \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the second condition depends on ''p'' not being 2. The basic version of Hensel's lemma tells us that starting from ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= ''r'' we can recursively construct a sequence of integers {&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} such that

: &lt;math&gt;r_{k+1} \equiv r_k \pmod{p^k}, \quad r_k^2 \equiv a \pmod{p^k}. &lt;/math&gt;

This sequence converges to some ''p''-adic integer ''b'' and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=''a''. In fact, ''b'' is the unique square root of ''a'' in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; congruent to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; modulo ''p''. Conversely, if ''a'' is a perfect square in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and it is not divisible by ''p'' then it is a nonzero quadratic residue mod ''p''. Note that the [[quadratic reciprocity law]] allows one to easily test whether ''a'' is a nonzero quadratic residue mod ''p'', thus we get a practical way to determine which ''p''-adic numbers (for ''p'' odd) have a ''p''-adic square root, and it can be extended to cover the case ''p''=2 using the more general version of Hensel's lemma (an example with 2-adic square roots of 17 is given later).

To make the discussion above more explicit, let us find a "square root of 2" (the solution to &lt;math&gt;x^2-2=0&lt;/math&gt;) in the 7-adic integers. Modulo 7 one solution is 3 (we could also take 4), so we set &lt;math&gt;r_1 = 3&lt;/math&gt;. Hensel's lemma then allows us to find &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(r_1)=3^2-2=7&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(r_1)/p^1=7/7=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(r_1)=2r_1=6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;tf'(r_1) \equiv -(f(r_1)/p^k)\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;t\cdot 6 \equiv -1\pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow t = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = r_1 + tp^1 = 3+1 \cdot 7 = 10 =13_7.&lt;/math&gt;

And sure enough, &lt;math&gt;10^2\equiv 2\pmod{7^2}&lt;/math&gt;. (If we had used the Newton method recursion directly in the 7-adics, then ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - f(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/f'(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 3 - 7/6 = 11/6, and 11/6 ≡ 10 mod 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

We can continue and find &lt;math&gt;r_3 = 108 = 3 + 7 + 2\cdot 7^2 = 213_7&lt;/math&gt;. Each time we carry out the calculation (that is, for each successive value of ''k''), one more base 7 digit is added for the next higher power of 7. In the 7-adic integers this sequence converges, and the limit is a square root of 2 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; which has initial 7-adic expansion

::&lt;math&gt;3 + 7 + 2\cdot7^2 + 6\cdot 7^3 + 7^4 + 2\cdot 7^5 + 7^6 + 2\cdot 7^7 + 4\cdot 7^8 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

If we started with the initial choice &lt;math&gt;r_1 = 4&lt;/math&gt; then Hensel's lemma would produce a square root of 2 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; which is congruent to 4 (mod 7) instead of 3 (mod 7) and in fact this second square root would be the negative of the first square root (which is consistent with 4 = -3 mod 7).

As an example where the original version of Hensel's lemma is not valid but the more general one is, let ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 17 and ''a'' = 1. Then ''f''(''a'') = -16 and f'(''a'') = 2, so |''f''(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f&amp;prime;(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies there is a unique 2-adic integer ''b'' satisfying ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 17 and |''b''- ''a''|&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f'(''a'')|&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2, i.e., ''b'' ≡ 1 mod 4. There are two square roots of 17 in the 2-adic integers, differing by a sign, and although they are congruent mod 2 they are not congruent mod 4. This is consistent with the general version of Hensel's lemma only giving us a unique 2-adic square root of 17 that is congruent to 1 mod 4 rather than mod 2. If we had started with the initial approximate root ''a'' = 3 then we could apply the more general Hensel's lemma again to find a unique 2-adic square root of 17 which is congruent to 3 mod 4. This is the other 2-adic square root of 17.

In terms of lifting roots of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 17 from one modulus 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to the next 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, the lifts starting with the root 1 mod 2 are as follows:

:: 1 mod 2 --&gt; 1, 3 mod 4
:: 1 mod 4 --&gt; 1, 5 mod 8 and 3 mod 4 ---&gt; 3, 7 mod 8
:: 1 mod 8 --&gt; 1, 9 mod 16 and 7 mod 8 ---&gt; 7, 15 mod 16, while 3 mod 8 and 5 mod 8 don't lift to roots mod 16
:: 9 mod 16 --&gt; 9, 25 mod 32 and 7 mod 16 --&gt; 7, 23 mod 16, while 1 mod 16 and 15 mod 16 don't lift to roots mod 32.

For every ''k'' at least 3, there are ''four'' roots of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 17 mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, but if we look at their 2-adic expansions we can see that in pairs they are converging to just ''two'' 2-adic limits.  For instance, the four roots mod 32 break up into two pairs of roots which each look the same mod 16:

:: 9 = 1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 25 = 1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 7 = 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 23 = 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

The 2-adic square roots of 17 have expansions

::1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; + ..., 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;...

Another example where we can use the more general version of Hensel's lemma but not the basic version is a proof that any 3-adic integer ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 9 is a cube in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - c and take initial approximation ''a'' = 1.  The basic Hensel's lemma cannot be used to find roots of ''f''(''x'') since f'(''r'') ≡ 0 mod 3 for every ''r''. To apply the general version of Hensel's lemma we want |f(1)|&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |f'(1)|&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which means ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 27. That is, if ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 27 then the general Hensel's lemma tells us ''f''(''x'') has a 3-adic root, so ''c'' is a 3-adic cube.  However, we wanted to have this result under the weaker condition that ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 9. If ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 9 then ''c'' ≡ 1, 10, or 19 mod 27. We can apply the general Hensel's lemma three times depending on the value of ''c'' mod 27: if ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 27 then use ''a'' = 1, if ''c'' ≡ 10 mod 27 then use ''a'' = 4 (since 4 is a root of ''f''(''x'') mod 27), and if ''c'' ≡ 19 mod 27 then use ''a'' = 7.  (It is not true that every ''c'' ≡ 1 mod 3 is a 3-adic cube, e.g., 4 is not a 3-adic cube since it is not a cube mod 9.)

In a similar way, after some preliminary work Hensel's lemma can be used to show that for any ''odd'' prime number ''p'', any ''p''-adic integer ''c'' which is 1 mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a ''p''-th power in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.
(This is false when ''p'' is 2.)

==Generalizations==
Suppose ''A'' is a [[commutative ring]], complete with respect to an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_A&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in A[x]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in ''A''. Then if ''a'' ∈ ''A'' is an "approximate root" of ''f'' in the sense that it satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; f(a) \equiv 0 \pmod{\mathfrak m}&lt;/math&gt;

then there is an exact root ''b'' ∈ ''A'' of ''f'' "close to" ''a''; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;f(b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b \equiv a \pmod{\mathfrak m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further, if ''f'' &amp;prime;(''a'') is not a zero-divisor then ''b'' is unique.

As a special case, if &lt;math&gt;f(a) \equiv 0 \pmod{\mathfrak m}&lt;/math&gt; and ''f'' &amp;prime;(''a'') is a unit in ''A'' then there is a unique solution to ''f''(''b'') = 0 in ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;b \equiv a \pmod{\mathfrak m}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be generalized to several variables as follows:

'''Theorem''': Let ''A'' be a commutative ring that is complete with respect to an ideal '''m''' ⊂ ''A'' and
''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') ∈ ''A''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] for ''i'' = 1,...,''n'' be a system of ''n'' polynomials in ''n'' variables over ''A''. Let '''f''' = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), viewed as a mapping from ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''J''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') be the [[Jacobian matrix]] of '''f'''. Suppose some '''a''' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an approximate solution to '''f''' = '''0'''  in the sense that

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''') &amp;equiv; 0 mod (det J&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a'''))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''m'''

for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''. Then there is some '''b''' = (''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; satisfying '''f'''('''b''') = '''0''', i.e.,

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''b''') = 0 for all ''i'',

and furthermore this solution is "close" to '''a''' in the sense that

:''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; mod ''J''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''')'''m'''

for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''.

As a special case, if ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''') ≡ 0 mod '''m''' for all ''i'' and det J&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''') is a unit in ''A'' then there is a solution to '''f'''('''b''') = '''0''' with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; mod '''m''' for all ''i''.

When ''n'' = 1, '''a''' = ''a'' is an element of ''A'' and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''') = ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') is ''f'' &amp;prime;(''a''). The hypotheses of this multivariable Hensel's lemma reduce to the ones which were stated in the one-variable Hensel's lemma.

==Related concepts==
Completeness of a ring is not a necessary condition for the ring to have the Henselian property: [[Goro Azumaya]] in 1950 defined a commutative [[local ring]] satisfying the Henselian property for the maximal ideal '''m''' to be a '''[[Henselian ring]]'''.

[[Masayoshi Nagata]] proved in the 1950s that for any commutative local ring ''A'' with maximal ideal '''m''' there always exists a smallest ring ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; containing ''A'' such that ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; is Henselian with respect to '''m'''''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;. This ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''[[Henselization]]''' of ''A''. If ''A'' is [[noetherian ring|noetherian]], ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; will also be noetherian, and ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; is manifestly algebraic as it is constructed as a limit of [[étale topology|étale neighbourhood]]s. This means that ''A''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; is usually much smaller than the completion ''Â'' while still retaining the Henselian property and remaining in the same [[category theory|category]]{{clarify|date=November 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1688">An '''indeterminate equation''', in [[mathematics]], is an equation for which there is more than one solution; for example, 2''x'' = ''y'' is a simple indeterminate equation, as are a''x'' + b''y'' = c and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.  Indeterminate equations cannot be solved uniquely. Prominent examples include the following:

'''[[Univariate]] [[polynomial equation]]''':
:&lt;math&gt;a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots +a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which has multiple solutions for the variable ''x'' in the [[complex plane]] unless it can be rewritten in the form &lt;math&gt;a_n(x-b)^n=0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Non-degenerate [[Conic section|conic equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dx + Ey + F = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where at least one of the given [[Parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]] ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' is non-zero, and ''x'' and ''y'' are real variables.

'''[[Pell's equation]]''':
:&lt;math&gt;\ x^2 - Py^2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is a given integer that is not a [[square number]], and in which the variables ''x'' and ''y'' are required to be integers.

'''The equation of [[Pythagorean triple]]s''':
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=z^2,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are required to be positive integers.

'''The equation of the [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]]''':
:&lt;math&gt;a^m+b^n=c^k,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are required to be [[coprime]] positive integers and the variables ''m'', ''n'', and ''k'' are required to be positive integers the sum of whose reciprocals is less than 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''superintuitionistic logic''' is a [[propositional logic]] extending [[intuitionistic logic]].  [[Classical logic]] is the strongest consistent superintuitionistic logic; thus, consistent superintuitionistic logics are called '''intermediate logics''' (the logics are intermediate between intuitionistic logic and classical logic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intermediate logic|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Intermediate_logic|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A superintuitionistic logic is a set ''L'' of propositional formulas in a countable set of
variables ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying the following properties:
:1. all [[Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization|axioms of intuitionistic logic]] belong to ''L'';
:2. if ''F'' and ''G'' are formulas such that ''F'' and ''F'' → ''G'' both belong to ''L'', then ''G'' also belongs to ''L'' (closure under [[modus ponens]]);
:3. if ''F''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a formula of ''L'', and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are any formulas, then ''F''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) belongs to ''L'' (closure under substitution).
Such a logic is intermediate if furthermore
:4. ''L'' is not the set of all formulas.

==Properties and examples==
There exists a [[cardinality of the continuum|continuum]] of different intermediate logics. Specific intermediate logics are often constructed by adding one or more axioms to intuitionistic logic, or by a semantical description. Examples of intermediate logics include:
* intuitionistic logic ('''IPC''', '''Int''', '''IL''', '''H''')
* classical logic ('''CPC''', '''Cl''', '''CL'''): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ''p'' ∨ ¬''p''}} = {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ¬¬''p'' → ''p''}} = {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ((''p'' → ''q'') → ''p'') → ''p''}}
* the logic of the weak [[excluded middle]] ('''KC''', [[V. A. Jankov|Jankov]]'s logic, [[De Morgan's laws|De Morgan]] logic&lt;ref&gt;Constructive Logic and the Medvedev Lattice,
Sebastiaan A. Terwijn, Notre Dame J. Formal Logic, Volume 47, Number 1 (2006), 73-82.&lt;/ref&gt;): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ¬¬''p'' ∨ ¬''p''}}
* [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] logic ('''LC''', '''G'''): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + (''p'' → ''q'') ∨ (''q'' → ''p'')}}
* [[Georg Kreisel|Kreisel]]–[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] logic ('''KP'''): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + (¬''p'' → (''q'' ∨ ''r'')) → ((¬''p'' → ''q'') ∨ (¬''p'' → ''r''))}}
* [[Yuri T. Medvedev|Medvedev]]'s logic of finite problems ('''LM''', '''ML'''): defined semantically as the logic of all [[Kripke semantics|frames]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal P(X)\setminus\{X\},\subseteq\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for [[finite set]]s ''X'' ("Boolean hypercubes without top"), {{As of|2015|lc=on}} not known to be recursively axiomatizable
* [[realizability]] logics
* [[Dana Scott|Scott]]'s logic ('''SL'''): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ((¬¬''p'' → ''p'') → (''p'' ∨ ¬''p'')) → (¬¬''p'' ∨ ¬''p'')}}
* Smetanich's logic ('''SmL'''): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + (¬''q'' → ''p'') → (((''p'' → ''q'') → ''p'') → ''p'')}}
* logics of bounded cardinality ('''BC'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{IPC}+\bigvee_{i=0}^n\bigl(\bigwedge_{j&lt;i}p_j\to p_i\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
* logics of bounded width, also known as the logic of bounded anti-chains ('''BW'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''BA'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{IPC}+\bigvee_{i=0}^n\bigl(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}p_j\to p_i\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
* logics of bounded depth ('''BD'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): {{nowrap|'''IPC''' + ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∨ (''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → (''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ (''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; → ... → (''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ (''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)))...)))}}
* logics of bounded top width ('''BTW'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{IPC}+\bigvee_{i=0}^n\bigl(\bigwedge_{j&lt;i}p_j\to\neg\neg p_i\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
* logics of bounded branching ('''T'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''BB'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{IPC}+\bigwedge_{i=0}^n\bigl(\bigl(p_i\to\bigvee_{j\ne i}p_j\bigr)\to\bigvee_{j\ne i}p_j\bigr)\to\bigvee_{i=0}^np_i&lt;/math&gt;
* Gödel ''n''-valued logics ('''G'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;): '''LC''' + '''BC'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''LC''' + '''BD'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;

Superintuitionistic or intermediate logics form a [[complete lattice]] with intuitionistic logic as the [[bottom element|bottom]] and the inconsistent logic (in the case of superintuitionistic logics) or classical logic (in the case of intermediate logics) as the top. Classical logic is the only [[atom (order theory)|coatom]] in the lattice of superintuitionistic logics; the lattice of intermediate logics also has a unique coatom, namely '''SmL'''.

The tools for studying intermediate logics are similar to those used for intuitionistic logic, such as [[Kripke semantics]]. For example, Gödel–Dummett logic has a simple semantic characterization in terms of [[total order]]s.

==Semantics==

Given a [[Heyting algebra]] ''H'', the set of [[propositional formula]]s that are valid in ''H'' is an intermediate logic. Conversely, given an intermediate logic it is possible to construct its [[Lindenbaum algebra]] which is a Heyting algebra.

An intuitionistic [[Kripke frame]] ''F'' is a [[partially ordered set]], and a Kripke model ''M'' is a Kripke frame with valuation such that &lt;math&gt;\{x\mid M,x\Vdash p\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[upper set|upper subset]] of ''F''. The set of propositional formulas that are valid in ''F'' is an intermediate logic. Given an intermediate logic ''L'' it is possible to construct a Kripke model ''M'' such that the logic of ''M'' is ''L'' (this construction is called ''canonical model''). A Kripke frame with this property may not exist, but a [[general frame]] always does.

==Relation to modal logics==
{{main|Modal companion}}
Let ''A'' be a propositional formula. The ''Gödel–Tarski translation'' of ''A'' is defined recursively as follows:

*&lt;math&gt; T(p_n) = \Box p_n &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; T(\neg A) = \Box \neg T(A) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; T(A \land B) = T(A) \land T(B) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; T(A \vee B) = T(A) \vee T(B) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; T(A \to B) = \Box (T(A) \to T(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

If ''M'' is a [[modal logic]] extending '''S4''' then {{nowrap begin}}ρ''M'' = {''A'' | ''T''(''A'') ∈ ''M''}{{nowrap end}} is a superintuitionistic logic, and ''M'' is called a ''modal companion'' of ρ''M''. In particular:

*'''IPC''' = ρ'''S4'''
*'''KC''' = ρ'''S4.2'''
*'''LC''' = ρ'''S4.3'''
*'''CPC''' = ρ'''S5'''

For every intermediate logic ''L'' there are many modal logics ''M'' such that ''L''&amp;nbsp;= ρ''M''.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''ladder graph''' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[planar graph|planar]] [[undirected graph]] with ''2n'' vertices and ''3n-2'' edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=LadderGraph|title=Ladder Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ladder graph can be obtained as the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of two [[path graph]]s, one of which has only one edge: ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Hosoya, H. and Harary, F. "On the Matching Properties of Three Fence Graphs." J. Math. Chem. 12, 211-218, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noy, M. and Ribó, A. "Recursively Constructible Families of Graphs." Adv. Appl. Math. 32, 350-363, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Properties==
By construction, the ladder graph L&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the [[grid graph]] ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2,''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and looks like a ladder with ''n'' rungs. It is [[Hamiltonian graph|Hamiltonian]] with girth 4 (if ''n&gt;1'') and [[chromatic index]] 3 (if ''n&gt;2'').

The [[chromatic number]] of the ladder graph is 2 and its [[chromatic polynomial]] is &lt;math&gt;(x-1)x(x^2-3x+3)^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Ladder graphs.svg|thumb|450px|left|The ladder graphs ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Ladder graph L8 2COL.svg|The [[chromatic number]] of the ladder graph is&amp;nbsp;2.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ladder rung graph==
Sometimes the term "ladder graph" is used for the ''n''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; '''ladder rung graph''', which is the graph union of ''n'' copies of the path graph P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
[[Image:Ladder rung graphs.svg|thumb|450px|left|The ladder rung graphs ''LR''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''LR''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''LR''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''LR''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''LR''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

== Circular ladder graph ==
{{main|Prism graph}}
The '''circular ladder graph''' ''CL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is constructible by connecting the four 2-degree vertices in a ''straight'' way, or by the Cartesian product of a cycle of length ''n&amp;ge;3'' and an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Yichao|last2=Gross|first2=Jonathan L.|last3=Mansour|first3=Toufik|title=Total Embedding Distributions of Circular Ladders|journal=Journal of Graph Theory|date=September 2013|volume=74|issue=1|pages=32–57|doi=10.1002/jgt.21690}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In symbols, ''CL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It has ''2n'' nodes and ''3n'' edges.
Like the ladder graph, it is [[connected graph|connected]], [[planar graph|planar]] and [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian]], but it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] if and only if ''n'' is even.

Circular ladder graph are the [[polyhedral graph]]s of prisms, so they are more commonly called '''prism graphs'''.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi=|\frac1{2i}\operatorname{Log} \operatorname{Cr}(I_1,I_2,P_1,P_2)|&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Log}&lt;/math&gt; is the principal value of the [[complex logarithm]]
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cross-ratio]] of four collinear points
* &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]] of the lines
* &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; are the intersections of the [[Cayley-Klein metric|absolute conic]], having equations &lt;math&gt;x_0=x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, with the line joining &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The expression between vertical bars is a real number.

Laguerre formula can be useful in [[computer vision]], since the absolute conic has an image on the retinal plane which is invariant under camera displacements, and the cross ratio of four collinear points is the same for their images on the retinal plane.

== Derivation ==

It may be assumed that the lines go through the origin. Any [[isometry]] leaves the absolute conic invariant, this allows to take as the first line the ''x'' axis and the second line lying in the plane ''z''=0. The [[homogeneous coordinates]] of the above four points are

:&lt;math&gt;(0,1,i,0),\ (0,1,-i,0),\ (0,1,0,0),\ (0,\cos\phi,\pm\sin\phi,0),&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. Their nonhomogeneous coordinates on the infinity line of the plane ''z''=0 are &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;, 0, &lt;math&gt;\pm\sin\phi/\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt;. (Exchanging &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; changes the cross ratio into its inverse, so the formula for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; gives the same result.) Now from the [[Cross-ratio#Definition|formula of the cross ratio]] we have
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Cr}(I_1,I_2,P_1,P_2)=-\frac{-i\cos\phi\pm\sin\phi}{i\cos\phi\pm\sin\phi}=e^{\pm 2i\phi}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">In [[physics]], '''Langevin dynamics''' is an approach to the mathematical modeling of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of molecular systems, originally developed by the French physicist [[Paul Langevin]]. The approach is characterized by the use of simplified models while accounting for omitted [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] by the use of [[stochastic differential equation]]s.

==Overview==
A molecular system in the real world is unlikely to be present in vacuum. Jostling of solvent or air molecules causes friction, and the occasional high velocity collision will perturb the system. Langevin dynamics attempts to extend [[molecular dynamics]] to allow for these effects. Also, Langevin dynamics allows temperature to be controlled like with a thermostat, thus approximating the [[canonical ensemble]].

Langevin dynamics mimics the viscous aspect of a solvent. It does not fully model an [[implicit solvent]]; specifically, the model does not account for the [[Poisson-Boltzmann equation|electrostatic screening]] and also not for the [[hydrophobic effect]]. It should also be noted that for denser solvents, hydrodynamic interactions are not captured via Langevin dynamics.

For a system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles with masses &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with coordinates &lt;math&gt;X=X(t)&lt;/math&gt; that constitute a time-dependent [[random variable]], the resulting [[Langevin equation]] is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first=Tamar | last=Schlick|authorlink= Tamar Schlick | year=2002 | title=Molecular Modeling and Simulation | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-387-95404-X |  page = 480

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt;M\ddot{X} = - \nabla U(X) - \gamma \dot{X} + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} R(t)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the particle interaction potential; &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient operator such that &lt;math&gt;-\nabla U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the force calculated from the particle interaction potentials; the dot is a time derivative such that &lt;math&gt;\dot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and &lt;math&gt;\ddot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration; &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity; ''T'' is the temperature, ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]; and &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a delta-correlated [[Stationary process|stationary]] [[Gaussian Process|Gaussian process]] with zero-mean, satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t) \right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t)R(t') \right\rangle = \delta(t-t')&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta]].

If the main objective is to control temperature, care should be exercised to use a small damping constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; grows, it spans from the inertial all the way to the diffusive ([[Brownian motion|Brownian]]) regime. The Langevin dynamics limit of non-inertia is commonly described as [[Brownian dynamics]]. Brownian dynamics can be considered as overdamped Langevin dynamics, i.e. Langevin dynamics where no average acceleration takes place.

The Langevin equation can be
reformulated as a [[Fokker–Planck equation]] that governs the [[probability distribution]] of the random variable ''X''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2647">In [[mathematics]], the '''Legendre chi function''' is a [[special function]] whose [[Taylor series]] is also a [[Dirichlet series]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi_\nu(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)^\nu}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As such, it resembles the Dirichlet series for the [[polylogarithm]], and, indeed, is trivially expressible in terms of the polylogarithm as

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\nu(z) = \frac{1}{2}\left[\operatorname{Li}_\nu(z) - \operatorname{Li}_\nu(-z)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The Legendre chi function appears as the [[discrete Fourier transform]], with respect to the order ν, of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]], and also of the [[Euler polynomial]]s, with the explicit relationships given in those articles.

The Legendre chi function is a special case of the [[Lerch transcendent]], and is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\nu(z)=2^{-\nu}z\,\Phi (z^2,\nu,1/2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Identities==
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_2(x) + \chi_2(1/x)= \frac{\pi^2}{4}-\frac{i \pi}{2}\ln |x| .&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\chi_2(x) = \frac{{\rm arctanh\,} x}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integral relations==
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi/2} \arcsin (r \sin \theta) d\theta 
= \chi_2\left(r\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi/2} \arctan (r \sin \theta) d\theta 
= -\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi} \frac{ r \theta \cos \theta}{1+ r^2 \sin^2 \theta} d\theta  
= 2 \chi_2\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+r^2}- 1}{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi/2} \arctan (p \sin \theta)\arctan (q \sin \theta) d\theta = \pi \chi_2\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+p^2}- 1}{p}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1+q^2}- 1}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\alpha}\int_0^{\beta} \frac{dx dy}{1-x^2 y^2} = \chi_2(\alpha\beta)\qquad {\rm if}~~|\alpha\beta|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, '''Legendre moments''' are a type of [[image moment]] and are achieved by using the [[Legendre polynomial]].  Legendre moments are used in areas of image processing including: pattern and object recognition, image indexing, line fitting, feature extraction, edge detection, and texture analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Deepika, C. et al. "Palmprint authentication using modified legendre moments", Procedia Computer Science, 2010, Vol.2, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–172&lt;/ref&gt;  Legendre moments have been studied as a means to reduce image moment calculation complexity by limiting the amount of information redundancy through approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Huazhong Shu, et al. "An Efficient Method for Computation
of Legendre Moments", Academic Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendre moments&lt;ref&gt;Pew-Thian Yap. "An Efficient Method for the Computation of Legendre Moments", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ( Volume: 27, Issue: 12, Dec. 2005 ) &lt;/ref&gt; ==
With order of ''m'' + ''n'', and object intensity function ''f''(''x'',''y''):
 
:&lt;math&gt; L_{pq}=\frac{(2m+1)(2n+1)} 4 \int\limits_{-1}^1 \int\limits_{-1}^1 P_m(x) P_n(y)f(x,y) \,dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'',''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...{{math|∞|size=150%}} with the ''n''th-order Legendre polynomials being:

:&lt;math&gt;P_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{k,n}x^k=\frac{(-1)^n}{2^n n!} \left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) [(1-x^2)^n] &lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_n(x) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^{D(n)}(-1)^k \frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^n k!(n-k)!(n-2k)!} x^{n-2k} \\[5pt]
&amp;  = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n(n!)^2}x^n-\frac{(2n-2)!}{2^n 1!(n-1)!(n-2)!} x^{n-2} + \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''(''n'') = floor(''n''/2). The set of Legendre polynomials {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')} form an orthogonal set on the interval [−1,1]: 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 P_n(x)P_m(x) \, dx = \frac{2}{2n+1}\delta_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;

A [[recurrence relation]] can be used to compute the Legendre polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)P_{n+1}(x)-(2n+1)xP_n(x)+nP_{n-1}(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

''f''(''x'',''y'') can be written as an infinite series expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials  [−1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'',''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_{mn}P_m(x)P_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''longevity risk''' is any potential risk attached to the increasing [[life expectancy]] of pensioners and policy holders, which can eventually result in higher pay-out ratios than expected for many [[pension fund]]s and insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{Citation|url=http://www.sias.org.uk/data/papers/LongevityRisk/DownloadPDF |accessdate=2004-10-26 |title=see Stephen Richards &amp; Gavin Jones, "Financial Aspects of Longevity Risk", SI Actuarial Society, 26 Oct 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004211750/http://www.sias.org.uk/data/papers/LongevityRisk/DownloadPDF |archivedate=2006-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important risk to individuals who are [[retirement spend down|spending down savings]] is that they will live longer than expected and thus exhaust their savings, dying in poverty or burdening relatives. This is also referred to as "outliving one's savings" or "outliving one's assets".

== Individuals ==
{{further|Retirement spend down#Longevity risk}}
Individuals often underestimate longevity risk.  In the United States, most retirees do not expect to live past 85, but this is in fact the median conditional life expectancy for men at 65 (half of 65-year-old men will live to 85 or older, and more women will).

== Low interest rates and declining returns exacerbating longevity risk ==
The collapse in returns on [[government bond]]s is taking place against the backdrop of a protracted fall in returns for other core assets such as blue chip [[stock]]s, and, more importantly, a silent demographic shock. Factoring in the corresponding longevity risk, pension [[Insurance premium|premiums]] could be raised significantly while [[disposable income]]s stagnate and employees work longer years before retiring.

[[File:Red de mezcla.png|thumb|Simple decryption mix net. Messages are encrypted under a sequence of public keys. Each mix node removes a layer of encryption using its own private key. The node shuffles the message order, and transmits the result to the next node.]]

'''Mix networks'''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as "digital mixes"&lt;/ref&gt; are [[routing]] protocols that create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of [[proxy servers]] known as ''mixes'' which take in messages from multiple senders, shuffle them, and send them back out in random order to the next destination (possibly another mix node). This breaks the link between the source of the request and the destination, making it harder for eavesdroppers to trace end-to-end communications. Furthermore, mixes only know the node that it immediately received the message from, and the immediate destination to send the shuffled messages to, making the network resistant to malicious mix nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudio A. Ardagna|chapter=Privacy Preservation over Untrusted Mobile Networks|editors=Bettini, Claudio|title=Privacy In Location-Based Applications: Research Issues and Emerging Trends|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9783642035111|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1fKbX2hhFMC&amp;pg=PA88|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Danezis, George|chapter=Mix-Networks with Restricted Routes|editor=Dingledine, Roger|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: Third International Workshop, PET 2003, Dresden, Germany, March 26-28, 2003, Revised Papers|volume=Vol. 3|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540206101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2OnhrVLMX0C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each message is encrypted to each proxy using [[public key cryptography]]; the resulting encryption is layered like a [[Russian doll]] (except that each "doll" is of the same size) with the message as the innermost layer.  Each proxy server strips off its own layer of encryption to reveal where to send the message next.  If all but one of the proxy servers are compromised by the tracer, untraceability can still be achieved against some weaker adversaries.

The concept of mix networks was first described by [[David Chaum]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="chaum"&gt;David Chaum, Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/358549.358563 Comm. ACM], 24, 2 (Feb. 1981); 84-90&lt;/ref&gt;  Applications that are based on this concept include [[anonymous remailers]] (such as [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer|Mixmaster]]) and [[onion routing]] (including [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]).

==How it works==
[[Image:Chaum_Mix.svg|right|400px]]
Participant ''A'' prepares a message for delivery to participant ''B'' by appending a random value R to the message, sealing it with the addressee's public key &lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt;, appending B’s address, and then sealing the result with the mix's public key &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt;.
M opens it with his private key, now he knows B’s address, and he sends &lt;math&gt;K_b(message, R)&lt;/math&gt; to B.

=== Message format ===
&lt;math&gt;K_m(R1,K_b(R0,message),B)\longrightarrow(K_b(R0,message),B)&lt;/math&gt;

To accomplish this, the sender takes the mix’s public key (&lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt;), and uses it to encrypt an envelope containing a random string (&lt;math&gt;R1&lt;/math&gt;), a nested envelope addressed to the recipient, and the email address of the recipient (''B''). This nested envelope is encrypted with the recipient’s public key (&lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt;), and contains another random string (''R0''), along with the body of the message being sent. Upon receipt of the encrypted top-level envelope, the mix uses its secret key to open it. Inside, it finds the address of the recipient (''B'') and an encrypted message bound for ''B''. The random string (&lt;math&gt;R1&lt;/math&gt;) is discarded.

&lt;math&gt;R0&lt;/math&gt; is needed in the message in order to prevent an attacker from guessing messages. It is assumed that the attacker can observe all incoming and outgoing messages. If the random string is not used (i.e. only &lt;math&gt;(K_b(message))&lt;/math&gt; is sent to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) and an attacker has a good guess that the message &lt;math&gt;message'&lt;/math&gt; was sent, he can test whether &lt;math&gt;K_b(message')=K_b(message)&lt;/math&gt; holds, whereby he can learn the content of the message. By appending the random string &lt;math&gt;R0&lt;/math&gt; the attacker is prevented from performing this kind of attack; even if he should guess the correct message (i.e. &lt;math&gt;message'=message&lt;/math&gt; is true) he won't learn if he is right since he doesn't know the secret value &lt;math&gt;R0&lt;/math&gt;. Practically, &lt;math&gt;R0&lt;/math&gt; functions as a [[Salt (cryptography)|salt]].

=== Return Addresses ===
What is needed now is a way for ''B'' to respond to ''A'' while still keeping the identity of ''A'' secret from ''B''.

A solution is for ''A'' to form an untraceable return address &lt;math&gt;K_m(S1, A), K_x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is its own real address, &lt;math&gt;K_x&lt;/math&gt; is a public one-time key chosen for the current occasion only, and &lt;math&gt;S1&lt;/math&gt; is a key that will also act as a random string for purposes of sealing. Then, ''A'' can send this return address to ''B'' as part of a message sent by the techniques already described.

B sends &lt;math&gt;K_m(S1, A), K_x (S0, response)&lt;/math&gt; to M, and M transforms it to &lt;math&gt;A, S1 (K_x (S0, response))&lt;/math&gt;.
 
This mix uses the string of bits &lt;math&gt;S1&lt;/math&gt; that it finds after decrypting the address part &lt;math&gt;K_m(S1, A)&lt;/math&gt; as a key to re-encrypt the message part &lt;math&gt;K_x(S0, response)&lt;/math&gt;.  Only the addressee, ''A'', can decrypt the resulting output because ''A'' created both &lt;math&gt;S1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_x&lt;/math&gt;.  
The additional key &lt;math&gt;K_x&lt;/math&gt; assures that the mix cannot see the content of the reply-message.
 
The following indicates how ''B'' uses this untraceable return address to form a response to ''A'', via a new kind of mix:

The message from ''A'' &lt;math&gt;\longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''B'':

&lt;math&gt;K_m(R1, K_b(R0, message, K_m(S1, A), K_x ), B)\longrightarrow K_b(R0, message, K_m(S1, A), K_x )&lt;/math&gt;

Reply message from ''B''&lt;math&gt;\longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''A'':

&lt;math&gt;K_m(S1, A) , K_x(S0, response)\longrightarrow A, S1(K_x(S0, response))&lt;/math&gt;

Where: &lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt; = ''B''’s public key, &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; = the mix’s public key.

A destination can reply to a source without sacrificing source anonymity. The reply message shares all of the performance and security benefits with the anonymous messages from source to destination.

== Vulnerabilities ==
Although mix networks provide security even if an adversary is able to view the entire path, mixing is not absolutely perfect. Adversaries can provide long term correlation attacks and track the sender and receiver of the packets.&lt;ref name="ritter"&gt;Tom Ritter, "the differences between onion routing and mix networks", [https://ritter.vg/blog-mix_and_onion_networks.html ritter.vg] Retrieved December 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threat Model ===
An adversary can perform a passive attack by monitoring the traffic to and from the mix network. Analyzing the arrival times between multiple packets can reveal information. Since no changes are actively made to the packets, an attack like this is hard to detect. In a worst case of an attack, we assume that all the links of the network are observable by the adversary and the strategies and infrastructure of the mix network are known.

A packet on an input link cannot be correlated to a packet on the output link based on information about the time the packet was received, the size of the packet, or the content of the packet. Packet correlation based on packet timing is prevented by batching and correlation based on content and packet size is prevented by encryption and packet padding, respectively.

Inter-packet intervals, that is, the time difference between observation of two consecutive packets on two network links, is used to infer if the links carry the same connection. The encryption and padding does not affect the inter-packet interval related to the same IP flow. Sequences of inter-packet interval vary greatly between connections, for example in web browsing, the traffic occurs in bursts. This fact can be used to identify a connection.

=== Active Attack ===
Active attacks can be performed by injecting bursts of packets that contain unique timing signatures into the targeted flow. The attacker can perform attacks to attempt to identify these packets on other network links. The attacker might not be able to create new packets due to the required knowledge of symmetric keys on all the subsequent  mixes. Replay packets cannot be used either as they are easily preventable through hashing and caching.

=== Artificial Gap ===
Large gaps can be created in the target flow, if the attacker drops large volumes of consecutive packets in the flow. For example, a simulation is run sending 3000 packets to the target flow, where the attacker drops the packets 1 second after the start of the flow. As the number of consecutive packets dropped increases, the effectiveness of defensive dropping decreases significantly. Introducing a large gap will almost always create a recognizable feature.

=== Artificial Bursts ===
The attacker can create artificial bursts. This is done by creating a signature from artificial packets by holding them on a link for a certain period of time and then releasing them all at once. Defense dropping provides no defense in this scenario and the attacker can identify the target flow. There are other defense measures that can be taken to prevent this attack. One such solution can be adaptive padding algorithms. The more the packets are delayed, the easier it is to identify the behavior and thus better defense can be observed.

=== Other Time Analysis Attacks ===
An attacker may also look into other timing attacks other than inter-packet intervals. The attacker can actively modify packet streams to observe the changes caused in the network's behavior. Packets can be corrupted to force re-transmission of TCP packets, which the behavior is easily observable to reveal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shmatikov |first=Vitaly |last2=Wang |first2=Ming-Hsiu |date=2006 |title=Timing Analysis in Low-Latency Mix Networks: Attacks and Defenses |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/111/chp%253A10.1007%252F11863908_2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F11863908_2&amp;token2=exp=1481227424~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F111%2Fchp%25253A10.1007%25252F11863908_2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fchapter%252F10.1007%252F11863908_2*~hmac=c4dc3ba90b238039ef19f9b423055c46a63ece7fae6d9e8975cd729d81bb707c |format=PDF |journal=European Symposium on Research in Computer Security |volume=4189 |pages=18–33 |doi=10.1007/11863908_2 |access-date=December 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleeper Attack ===
Assuming an adversary can see messages being sent and received into threshold mixes but they can’t see the internal working of these mixes or what is sent by the same. If the adversary has left their own messages in respective mixes and they receive one of the two, they are able to determine the message sent and the corresponding sender. The adversary has to place their messages (active component) in the mix at any given time and the messages must remain there prior to a message being sent. This is not typically an active attack. Weaker adversaries can use this attack in combination with other attacks to cause more issues.

Mix networks derive security by changing order of messages they receive to avoid creating significant relation between the incoming and outgoing messages. Mixes create interference between messages. The interference puts bounds on the rate of information leak to an observer of the mix. In a mix of size n, an adversary observing input to and output from the mix has an uncertainty of order n in determining a match. A sleeper attack can take advantage of this. In a layered network of threshold mixes with a sleeper in each mix, there is a layer receiving inputs from senders and a second layer of mixes that forward messages to the final destination. From this, the attacker can learn that the received message could not have come from the sender into any layer 1 mix that did not fire. There is a higher probability of matching the sent and received messages with these sleepers thus communication is not completely anonymous. Mixes may also be purely timed: they randomize the order of messages received in a particular interval and attach some of them with the mixes, forwarding them at the end of the interval despite what has been received in that interval. Messages that are available for mixing will interfere, but if no messages are available, there is no interference with received messages.&lt;ref name="syverson"&gt;Paul Syverson, "Sleeping dogs lie on a bed of onions but wake when mixed", [https://petsymposium.org/2011/papers/hotpets11-final10Syverson.pdf Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium] Retrieved December 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[David Chaum]] published the concept of Mix Networks in 1979 in his paper: [https://www.worldcat.org/title/untraceable-electronic-mail-return-addresses-and-digital-pseudonyms/oclc/22448941 "Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms"]. The paper was for his master's degree thesis work, shortly after he was first introduced to the field of cryptography through the work of [[Public-key cryptography|public key cryptography]], [[Martin Hellman]], [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Ralph Merkle]]. While public key cryptography encrypted the security of information, Chaum believed there to be personal privacy vulnerabilities in the meta data found in communications. Some vulnerabilities that enabled the compromise of personal privacy included time of messages sent and received, size of messages and the address of the original sender. He cites Martin Hellman and Whitfield's paper [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rubin/courses/sp03/papers/diffie.hellman.pdf "New Directions in Cryptography"] (1976) in his work.

'''Multi-index notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] that simplifies formulas used in [[multivariable calculus]], [[partial differential equation]]s and the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s, by generalising the concept of an integer [[index notation|index]] to an ordered [[tuple]] of indices.

==Definition and basic properties==

An ''n''-dimensional '''multi-index''' is an ''n''-[[tuple]]

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;

of [[natural number|non-negative integers]] (i.e. an element of the ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt;).

For multi-indices &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; one defines:

;Componentwise sum and difference
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \pm \beta= (\alpha_1 \pm \beta_1,\,\alpha_2 \pm \beta_2, \ldots, \,\alpha_n \pm \beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Partial order]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \le \beta \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \alpha_i \le \beta_i \quad \forall\,i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Sum of components (absolute value) 
:&lt;math&gt;| \alpha | = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Factorial]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha ! = \alpha_1! \cdot \alpha_2! \cdots \alpha_n!&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Binomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{\alpha}{\beta} = \binom{\alpha_1}{\beta_1}\binom{\alpha_2}{\beta_2}\cdots\binom{\alpha_n}{\beta_n} = \frac{\alpha!}{\beta!(\alpha-\beta)!}&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Multinomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{k}{\alpha} = \frac{k!}{\alpha_1! \alpha_2! \cdots \alpha_n! } = \frac{k!}{\alpha!} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k:=|\alpha|\in\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Power (mathematics)|Power]]
:&lt;math&gt;x^\alpha = x_1^{\alpha_1} x_2^{\alpha_2} \ldots x_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Higher-order [[partial derivative]]

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha = \partial_1^{\alpha_1} \partial_2^{\alpha_2} \ldots \partial_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial_i^{\alpha_i}:=\partial^{\alpha_i} / \partial x_i^{\alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[4-gradient]]).

==Some applications==
The multi-index notation allows the extension of many formulae from elementary calculus to the corresponding multi-variable case. Below are some examples. In all the following, &lt;math&gt;x,y,h\in\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\nu\in\mathbb{N}_0^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f,g,a_\alpha\colon\mathbb{C}^n\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).

;[[Multinomial theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt; \biggl( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\biggr)^k = \sum_{|\alpha|=k} \binom{k}{\alpha} \, x^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Multi-binomial theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt; (x+y)^\alpha = \sum_{\nu \le \alpha} \binom{\alpha}{\nu} \, x^\nu y^{\alpha - \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, since {{math|''x''+''y''}} is a vector and {{math|''α''}} is a multi-index, the expression on the left is short for {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;...(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;+''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

;[[Leibniz rule (generalized product rule)|Leibniz formula]]
For smooth functions ''f'' and ''g''

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha(fg) = \sum_{\nu \le \alpha} \binom{\alpha}{\nu} \, \partial^{\nu}f\,\partial^{\alpha-\nu}g.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Taylor series]]
For an [[analytic function]] ''f'' in ''n'' variables one has

:&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) = \sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^n_0}^{}{\frac{\partial^{\alpha}f(x)}{\alpha !}h^\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, for a smooth enough function, we have the similar '''Taylor expansion'''
:&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le n}{\frac{\partial^{\alpha}f(x)}{\alpha !}h^\alpha}+R_{n}(x,h),&lt;/math&gt;
where the last term (the remainder) depends on the exact version of Taylor's formula. For instance, for the Cauchy formula (with integral remainder), one gets 
:&lt;math&gt;R_n(x,h)= (n+1) \sum_{|\alpha| =n+1}\frac{h^\alpha}{\alpha !}\int_0^1(1-t)^n\partial^\alpha f(x+th)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

;General linear [[partial differential operator]]
A formal linear ''N''-th order partial differential operator in ''n'' variables is written as

:&lt;math&gt;P(\partial) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le N}{}{a_{\alpha}(x)\partial^{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Integration by parts]]
For smooth functions with [[compact support]] in a bounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega}{}{u(\partial^{\alpha}v)}\,dx = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_{\Omega}^{}{(\partial^{\alpha}u)v\,dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used for the definition of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s and [[weak derivative]]s.

==An example theorem==
If &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt; are multi-indices and &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \partial^\alpha x^\beta = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{\beta!}{(\beta-\alpha)!} x^{\beta-\alpha} &amp; \hbox{if}\,\, \alpha\le\beta,\\
 0 &amp; \hbox{otherwise.} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
The proof follows from the [[power rule]] for the [[differential calculus|ordinary derivative]]; if ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'' are in {0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.}, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha} x^\beta = \begin{cases} \frac{\beta!}{(\beta-\alpha)!} x^{\beta-\alpha} &amp; \hbox{if}\,\, \alpha\le\beta, \\ 0 &amp; \hbox{otherwise.} \end{cases}\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots, \alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta=(\beta_1,\ldots, \beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\partial^\alpha x^\beta&amp;= \frac{\partial^{\vert\alpha\vert}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} x_1^{\beta_1} \cdots x_n^{\beta_n}\\
&amp;= \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} x_1^{\beta_1} \cdots
\frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} x_n^{\beta_n}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For each ''i'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, the function &lt;math&gt;x_i^{\beta_i}&lt;/math&gt; only depends on &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. In the above, each partial differentiation &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; therefore reduces to the corresponding ordinary differentiation &lt;math&gt;d/dx_i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, from equation (1), it follows that &lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha x^\beta&lt;/math&gt; vanishes if ''&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for at least one ''i'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.,&amp;nbsp;''n''}. If this is not the case, i.e., if ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;'' as multi-indices, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^{\alpha_i}}{dx_i^{\alpha_i}} x_i^{\beta_i} = \frac{\beta_i!}{(\beta_i-\alpha_i)!} x_i^{\beta_i-\alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt;
for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the theorem follows. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4199">In [[mathematics]], '''noncommutative topology''' is a term used for the relationship between [[topological]] and [[C*-algebra]]ic concepts. The term has its origins in the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]], which implies the [[Equivalence of categories|duality]] of the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s and the category of [[commutative operation|commutative]] C*-algebras. Noncommutative topology is related to analytic [[noncommutative geometry]].

== Examples ==

The premise behind noncommutative topology is that a noncommutative C*-algebra can be treated like the algebra of complex-valued [[continuous function]]s on a 'noncommutative space' which does not exist classically. Several topological properties can be formulated as properties for the C*-algebras without making reference to commutativity or the underlying space, and so have an immediate generalization.
Among these are:
* [[compact space|compactness]] ([[unital algebra|unital]])
* [[σ-compact space|σ-compactness]] ([[σ-unital algebra|σ-unital]])
* [[Lebesgue covering dimension|dimension]] ([[real rank (C*-algebras)|real]] or [[topological stable rank|stable rank]])
* [[connected space|connectedness]] ([[projectionless C*-algebra|projectionless]])
* [[extremally disconnected space]]s ([[AW*-algebra]]s)

Individual elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond with continuous functions. And so certain types of functions can correspond to certain properties of a C*-algebra. For example, [[self-adjoint]] elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond to real-valued continuous functions. Also, [[projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projections]] (i.e. self-adjoint [[idempotent]]s) correspond to [[indicator function]]s of [[clopen set]]s.

Categorical constructions lead to some examples. For example, the [[coproduct]] is the [[Disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] and thus corresponds to the [[direct sum of algebras]], which is the [[product (category theory)|product]] of C*-algebras. Similarly, [[Product topology]] corresponds to the coproduct of C*-algebras, the [[tensor product of algebras]]. In a more specialized setting,
compactifications of topologies correspond to unitizations of algebras. So the [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]] corresponds to the minimal unitization of C*-algebras, the [[Stone-Čech compactification]] corresponds to the [[multiplier algebra]], and [[corona set]]s corresponds with [[corona algebra]]s.

There are certain examples of properties where multiple generalizations are possible and it is not clear which is preferable. For example, [[probability measure]]s can correspond either to [[state (functional analysis)|states]] or tracial states. Since all states are vacuously 
tracial states in the commutative case, so it is not clear whether the tracial condition is necessary to be a useful generalization.

== K-theory ==
One of the major examples of this idea is the generalization of [[topological K-theory]] to noncommutative C*-algebras in the form of [[operator K-theory]].

A further development in this is a [[functor#Bifunctors|bivariant]] version of K-theory called [[KK-theory]], which has a composition product 

&lt;math&gt;KK(A,B)\times KK(B,C)\rightarrow KK(A,C)&lt;/math&gt;

of which the ring structure in ordinary K-theory is a special case. The product gives the structure of a [[Category (topology)|category]] to KK. It has been related to [[Correspondence (mathematics)|correspondences]] of algebraic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

"'''Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I'''" ("On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I") is a paper in [[mathematical logic]] by [[Kurt Gödel]].  Dated November 17, 1930, it was originally published in German in the 1931 volume of ''[[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].''  Several English translations have appeared in print, and the paper has been included in two collections of classic mathematical logic papers. The paper contains [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], now fundamental results in logic that have many implications for [[consistency proof]]s in mathematics. The paper is also known for introducing new techniques that Gödel invented to prove the incompleteness theorems. 

== Outline and key results ==

The main results established are Gödel's first and second [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which have had an enormous impact on the field of [[mathematical logic]]. These appear as theorems VI and XI, respectively, in the paper.

In order to prove these results, Gödel introduced a method now known as [[Gödel numbering]].  In this method, each sentence and formal proof in [[Peano arithmetic|first-order arithmetic]] is assigned a particular natural number.  Gödel shows that many properties of these proofs can be defined within any theory of arithmetic that is strong enough to define the [[primitive recursive function]]s. (The contemporary terminology for [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s and [[primitive recursive function]]s had not yet been established when the paper was published; Gödel used the word ''rekursiv'' ("recursive") for what are now known as primitive recursive functions.) The method of Gödel numbering has since become common in mathematical logic.

Because the method of Gödel numbering was novel, and to avoid any ambiguity, Gödel  presented a list of 45 explicit formal definitions of primitive recursive functions and relations used to manipulate and test Gödel numbers.  He used these to give an explicit definition of a formula Bew(''x'') that is true if and only if ''x'' is the Gödel number of a sentence φ and there exists a natural number that is the Gödel number of a proof of φ. The name of this formula derives from ''Beweis'', the German word for proof. 

A second new technique invented by Gödel in this paper was the use of self-referential sentences.  Gödel showed that the classical [[paradox]]es of self-reference, such as "[[Liar paradox|This statement is false]]," can be recast as self-referential formal sentences of arithmetic.  Informally,
the sentence employed to prove Gödel's first incompleteness theorem says "This statement is not provable."   The fact that such self-reference can be expressed within arithmetic was not known until Gödel's paper appeared; independent work of [[Alfred Tarski]] on his [[Tarski's indefinability theorem|indefinability theorem]] was conducted around the same time but not published until 1936.

In footnote 48a, Gödel stated that a planned second part of the paper would establish a link between consistency proofs and type theory, but Gödel did not publish a second part of the paper before his death.  His 1958 paper in ''Dialectica'' did, however, show how type theory can be used to give a consistency proof for arithmetic.

== Published English translations ==
During his lifetime three English translations of Gödel's paper were printed, but the process was not without difficulty.  The first English translation was by Bernard Meltzer; it was published in 1963 as a standalone work by Basic Books and has since been reprinted by Dover and reprinted by Hawking (''God Created the Integers'', Running Press, 2005:1097ff). The Meltzer version—described by [[Raymond Smullyan]] as a 'nice translation'—was adversely reviewed by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg (1966).  According to Dawson's biography of Gödel (Dawson 1997:216),
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fortunately, the Meltzer translation was soon supplanted by a better one prepared by Elliott Mendelson for Martin Davis's anthology ''The Undecidable''; but it too was not brought to Gödel's attention until almost the last minute, and the new translation was still not wholly to his liking ... when informed that there was not time enough to consider substituting another text, he declared that Mendelson's translation was 'on the whole very good' and agreed to its publication.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Afterward he would regret his compliance, for the published volume was marred throughout by sloppy typography and numerous misprints.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The translation by Elliott Mendelson appears in the collection ''The Undecidable'' (Davis 1965:5ff).  This translation also received a harsh review by Bauer-Mengelberg (1966), who in addition to giving a detailed list of the typographical errors also described what he believed to be serious errors in the translation.

A translation by [[Jean van Heijenoort]] appears in the collection ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic'' (van Heijenoort 1967). A review by [[Alonzo Church]] (1972) described this as "the most careful translation that has been made" but also gave some specific criticisms of it. Dawson (1997:216) notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The translation Gödel favored was that by Jean van Heijenoort ... In the preface to the volume van Heijenoort noted that Gödel was one of four authors who had personally read and approved the translations of his works.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This approval process was laborious. Gödel introduced changes to his text of 1931, and negotiations between the men were "protracted": "Privately van Heijenoort declared that Gödel was the most doggedly fastidious individual he had ever known." Between them they  "exchanged a total of seventy letters and met twice in Gödel's office in order to resolve questions concerning subtleties in the meanings and usage of German and English words." (Dawson 1997:216-217).

Although not a translation of the original paper, a very useful 4th version exists that "cover[s] ground quite similar to that covered by Godel's original 1931 paper on undecidability" (Davis 1952:39), as well as Gödel's own extensions of and commentary on the topic. This appears as ''On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems'' (Davis 1965:39ff) and represents the lectures as transcribed by [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. Barkley Rosser]] while Gödel delivered them at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton N.J. in 1934. Two pages of errata and additional corrections by Gödel were added by Davis to this version. This version is also notable because in it Gödel first describes the [[Herbrand]] suggestion that gave rise to the (general, i.e. Herbrand-Gödel) form of [[recursion]].

Sci.|volume=41|issue=4|pages=934–949|doi=10.1021/ci0003092}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of the [[Wiener index]], introduced by [[Harry Wiener]]. The Padmakar–Ivan index of a graph ''G'' is the sum over all edges  ''uv'' of  ''G'' of number of edges which are not equidistant from ''u''  and ''v''.
Let ''G'' be a graph and ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''uv'' an edge of ''G''. Here &lt;math&gt;n_{eu}(e\mid G)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of edges lying closer to the vertex ''u'' than the vertex ''v'', and &lt;math&gt;n_{ev}(e\mid G)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of edges lying closer to the vertex ''v'' than the vertex ''u''. The Padmakar–Ivan index of a graph ''G'' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{PI}(G)=\sum_{e\in E(G)}[n_{eu}(e\mid G) + n_{ev}(e\mid G)] &lt;/math&gt;

The PI index is very important in the study of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] for the classification models used in the [[chemical]], [[biological sciences]], [[engineering]], and [[nanotechnology]].

==Examples==
The PI index of Dendrimer Nanostar of the following figure can be calculated by&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The mathematics of [[pendulum]]s are in general quite complicated. Simplifying assumptions can be made, which in the case of a [[#Simple gravity pendulum|simple pendulum]] allow the equations of motion to be solved analytically for small-angle oscillations.

== Simple gravity pendulum ==
[[File:Oscillating pendulum.gif|right|300px|thumb|Animation of a pendulum showing the [[Equations of motion|velocity and acceleration vectors]].]]

A so-called "simple pendulum" is an idealization of a "real pendulum" but in an [[isolated system]] using the following assumptions:
* The rod or cord on which the bob swings is massless, inextensible and always remains taut;
* The bob is a point mass;
* Motion occurs only in [[two dimensions]], i.e. the bob does not trace an [[ellipse]] but an [[Arc (geometry)|arc]].
* The motion does not lose energy to [[friction]] or [[air resistance]].
* The gravitational field is uniform.
* The support does not move.

The [[differential equation]] which represents the motion of a simple pendulum is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+\frac{g}{\ell} \sin\theta=0&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|2em}}{{EquationRef|Eq. 1}}
where {{mvar|g}} is acceleration due to gravity, {{mvar|l}} is the length of the pendulum, and {{mvar|θ}} is the angular displacement.

| [[File:Pendulum gravity.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Force diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.|right|300px]]
Consider Figure 1 on the right, which shows the forces acting on a simple pendulum. Note that the path of the pendulum sweeps out an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a circle. The angle {{mvar|θ}} is measured in [[radian]]s, and this is crucial for this formula. The blue arrow is the [[gravitational force]] acting on the bob, and the violet arrows are that same force resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the bob's instantaneous motion. The direction of the bob's instantaneous [[velocity]] always points along the red axis, which is considered the tangential axis because its direction is always tangent to the circle. Consider [[Newton's second law]],
:&lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|F}} is the sum of forces on the object, {{mvar|m}} is mass, and {{mvar|a}} is the acceleration. Because we are only concerned with changes in speed, and because the bob is forced to stay in a circular path, we apply Newton's equation to the tangential axis only. The short violet arrow represents the component of the gravitational force in the tangential axis, and trigonometry can be used to determine its magnitude. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} F &amp;= -mg\sin\theta = ma, \qquad \text{so} \\ a &amp;= -g \sin\theta,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|g}} is the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth. The negative sign on the right hand side implies that {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|a}} always point in opposite directions. This makes sense because when a pendulum swings further to the left, we would expect it to accelerate back toward the right.

This linear acceleration {{mvar|a}} along the red axis can be related to the change in angle {{mvar|θ}} by the arc length formulas; {{mvar|s}} is arc length:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} s &amp;= \ell\theta, \\ v &amp;= \frac{ds}{dt} = \ell\frac{d\theta}{dt}, \\ a &amp;= \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = \ell\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \ell\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} &amp;= -g \sin\theta, \\ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{\ell} \sin\theta &amp;= 0. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

|"Torque" derivation of ({{EquationNote|Eq. 1}})
|
Equation (1) can be obtained using two definitions for torque.
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

First start by defining the torque on the pendulum bob using the force due to gravity.
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \tau } = \mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{g} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''l'''}} is the length vector of the pendulum and {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the force due to gravity.

For now just consider the magnitude of the torque on the pendulum.
:&lt;math&gt;|\boldsymbol{\tau}| = -mg\ell\sin\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|m}} is the mass of the pendulum, {{mvar|g}} is the acceleration due to gravity, {{mvar|l}} is the length of the pendulum
and {{mvar|θ}} is the angle between the length vector and the force due to gravity.

Next rewrite the angular momentum.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ L } = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{r} \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}) .&lt;/math&gt;
Again just consider the magnitude of the angular momentum.
:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{L}| = mr^2 \omega = m \ell^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} .&lt;/math&gt;
and its time derivative

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d}{dt}|\mathbf{L}| = m \ell^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

According to {{math|'''τ''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''L'''|''dt''}}}}, we can get by comparing the magnitudes

:&lt;math&gt;-mg\ell\sin\theta = m \ell^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{\ell} \sin\theta = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same result as obtained through force analysis.

|"Energy" derivation of ({{EquationNote|Eq. 1}})
|
[[Image:simple pendulum height.svg|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' Trigonometry of a simple gravity pendulum.|right|300px]]

It can also be obtained via the [[conservation of mechanical energy]] principle: any object falling a vertical distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; would acquire [[kinetic energy]] equal to that which it lost to the fall. In other words, [[gravitational potential]] energy is converted into kinetic energy. Change in potential energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = mgh.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The change in kinetic energy (body started from rest) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta K = \tfrac12 mv^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since no energy is lost, the gain in one must be equal to the loss in the other

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 mv^2=mgh.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The change in velocity for a given change in height can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{2gh}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using the arc length formula above, this equation can be rewritten in terms of {{mvar|{{sfrac|dθ|dt}}}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} v = \ell\frac{d\theta}{dt} &amp;= \sqrt{2gh}, \quad \text{so} \\ \frac{d\theta}{dt} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{2gh}}{l}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is the vertical distance the pendulum fell. Look at Figure 2, which presents the trigonometry of a simple pendulum. If the pendulum starts its swing from some initial angle {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the vertical distance from the screw, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;y_0 = \ell\cos\theta_0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = \ell\cos\theta.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then {{mvar|h}} is the difference of the two

:&lt;math&gt;h = \ell\left(\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of {{mvar|{{sfrac|dθ|dt}}}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{2g} \ell (\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|2em}}{{EquationRef|Eq. 2}}

This equation is known as the ''first integral of motion'', it gives the velocity in terms of the location and includes an integration constant related to the initial displacement ({{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}). We can differentiate, by applying the [[chain rule]], with respect to time to get the acceleration

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\theta}{dt} &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\sqrt{\frac{2g} \ell \left(\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0\right)}, \\
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} &amp; = \frac12\frac{-\frac{2g} \ell \sin\theta}{\sqrt{\frac{2g} \ell (\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0)}}\frac{d\theta}{dt} \\
&amp; = \frac12\frac{-\frac{2g}{\ell}  \sin\theta}{\sqrt{\frac{2g}{\ell} (\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0)}}\sqrt{\frac{2g}{\ell} (\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0)} = -\frac g \ell \sin\theta, \\
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} &amp;+ \frac{g}{\ell} \sin\theta = 0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same result as obtained through force analysis.

==Small-angle approximation==
[[File:Small-angle approximation for sine function.svg|thumb|300px|Small-angle approximation for the sine function: For {{math|''θ'' ≈ 0}} we find {{math|sin ''θ'' ≈ ''θ''}}.]]
The differential equation given above is not easily solved, and there is no solution that can be written in terms of elementary functions. However adding a restriction to the size of the oscillation's amplitude gives a form whose solution can be easily obtained. If it is assumed that the angle is much less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[radian]] (often cited as less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;radians, about 6°), or

:&lt;math&gt;\theta \ll 1,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then substituting for {{math|sin ''θ''}} into {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} using the [[small-angle approximation]],

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta\approx\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

yields the equation for a [[harmonic oscillator]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+\frac{g}{\ell} \theta=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The error due to the approximation is of order {{math|''θ''{{isup|3}}}} (from the [[Maclaurin series]] for {{math|sin ''θ''}}).

Given the initial conditions {{math|1=''θ''(0) = ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1={{sfrac|''dθ''|''dt''}}(0) = 0}}, the solution becomes
{{Equation box 1 |indent =: |cellpadding = 0 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = transparent
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\theta(t) = \theta_0\cos\left(\sqrt\frac{g}{\ell}\,t\right) \quad\quad\quad\quad \theta_0 \ll 1.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
The motion is [[simple harmonic motion]] where {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[amplitude (wave motion)|amplitude]] of the oscillation (that is, the maximum angle between the rod of the pendulum and the vertical). The period of the motion, the time for a complete oscillation (outward and return) is
{{Equation box 1 |indent =: |cellpadding = 0 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = transparent
|equation = &lt;math&gt;T_0 = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac\ell g} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \theta_0 \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;
}}
which is known as [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s law for the period. Note that under the small-angle approximation, the period is independent of the amplitude {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}; this is the property of [[Isochronous|isochronism]] that [[Galileo]] discovered.

===Rule of thumb for pendulum length===

:&lt;math&gt;T_0 = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac \ell g}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt; \ell = \frac{g}{\pi^2}\frac{T_0^2} 4.&lt;/math&gt;

If [[International System of Units|SI units]] are used (i.e. measure in metres and seconds), and assuming the measurement is taking place on the Earth's surface, then {{math|''g'' ≈ 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|{{sfrac|''g''|π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ≈ 1}} (0.994 is the approximation to 3 decimal places).

Therefore, a relatively reasonable approximation for the length and period are,

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \ell &amp;\approx \frac{T_0^2}{4}, \\ T_0 &amp;\approx 2 \sqrt\ell \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of seconds between ''two'' beats (one beat for each side of the swing), and {{mvar|l}} is measured in metres.

== Arbitrary-amplitude period ==
[[Image:Pendulum period.svg|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Deviation of the "true" period of a pendulum from the small-angle approximation of the period. "True" value was obtained numerically evaluating the elliptic integral. |right|300px]]

[[Image:Pendulum rel error.svg|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' Relative errors using the power series for the period.|right|300px]]

[[File:Pendulum phase portrait.svg|thumb|312x312px|'''Figure 5.''' Potential energy and [[phase portrait]] of a simple pendulum. Note that the {{mvar|x}}-axis, being angle, wraps onto itself after every 2{{pi}} radians.]]

For amplitudes beyond the [[small angle approximation]], one can compute the exact period by first inverting the equation for the angular velocity obtained from the energy method ({{EquationNote|Eq. 2}}),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{d\theta} = \sqrt\frac\ell{2g}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

and then integrating over one complete cycle,

:&lt;math&gt;T = t(\theta_0\rightarrow0\rightarrow-\theta_0\rightarrow0\rightarrow\theta_0),&lt;/math&gt;

or twice the half-cycle

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2 t(\theta_0\rightarrow0\rightarrow-\theta_0),&lt;/math&gt;

or four times the quarter-cycle

:&lt;math&gt;T = 4 t(\theta_0\rightarrow0),&lt;/math&gt;

which leads to

:&lt;math&gt;T = 4\sqrt\frac\ell{2g}\int^{\theta_0}_0 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\cos\theta-\cos\theta_0}} \, d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this integral diverges as {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} approaches the vertical

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\theta_0 \rightarrow \pi} T = \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

so that a pendulum with just the right energy to go vertical will never actually get there. (Conversely, a pendulum close to its maximum can take an arbitrarily long time to fall down.)

This integral can be rewritten in terms of [[elliptic integral]]s as

:&lt;math&gt;T = 4\sqrt\frac\ell g F\left( \frac{\pi} 2, \sin \frac{\theta_0} 2\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F}} is the [[elliptic integral#Incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind|incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind]] defined by

: &lt;math&gt;F(\varphi , k) = \int_0^\varphi \frac 1 {\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2 u}}\,du\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Or more concisely by the [[integration by substitution|substitution]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sin{u} = \frac{\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{\sin\frac{\theta_0}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
expressing {{mvar|θ}} in terms of {{mvar|u}},

{{Equation box 1 |indent =: |cellpadding = 0 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = transparent
|equation =&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2 T_0}{\pi} K(k), \qquad  \mathrm{where} \quad k=\sin\frac{\theta_0}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|2em}}{{EquationRef|Eq. 3}}
}}
Here {{mvar|K}} is the [[elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the first kind|complete elliptic integral of the first kind]] defined by

: &lt;math&gt;K(k) = F \left( \frac \pi 2, k \right) = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2 u}}\,du\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For comparison of the approximation to the full solution, consider the period of a pendulum of length 1&amp;nbsp;m on Earth ({{mvar|g}} = {{val|9.80665|u=m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) at initial angle 10 degrees is
:&lt;math&gt;4\sqrt{\frac{1\text{ m}}{g}}\ K\left(\sin\frac{10^\circ} {2} \right)\approx 2.0102\text{ s}.&lt;/math&gt;
The linear approximation gives

:&lt;math&gt;2\pi \sqrt{\frac{1\text{ m}}{g}} \approx 2.0064\text{ s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the two values, less than 0.2%, is much less than that caused by the variation of {{mvar|g}} with geographical location.

From here there are many ways to proceed to calculate the elliptic integral.

===Legendre polynomial solution for the elliptic integral===
Given {{EquationNote|Eq. 3}} and the [[Legendre polynomial]] solution for the elliptic integral:

:&lt;math&gt;K(k) = \frac \pi 2 \left(1 + \left(\frac 1 2 \right)^2 k^2 + \left(\frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4}\right)^2 k^4 + \cdots + \left(\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{(2n)!!}\right)^2 k^{2n} + \cdots \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''!!}} denotes the [[double factorial]], an exact solution to the period of a pendulum is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
T &amp; = 2\pi \sqrt\frac \ell g \left( 1+ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta_0}{2} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4} \right)^2 \sin^4 \frac{\theta_0}{2} + \left( \frac {1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6} \right)^2 \sin^6 \frac{\theta_0}{2} + \cdots \right) \\
 &amp; = 2\pi \sqrt\frac\ell g \cdot \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \left ( \frac{(2n)!}{( 2^n \cdot n! )^2} \right )^2 \cdot \sin^{2 n}\frac{\theta_0}{2} \right).\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

Figure 4 shows the relative errors using the power series. {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the linear approximation, and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} include respectively the terms up to the 2nd to the 10th powers.

=== Power series solution for the elliptic integral ===
Another formulation of the above solution can be found if the following Maclaurin series:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \frac{\theta_0} 2 =\frac12\theta_0 - \frac{1}{48}\theta_0^3 + \frac{1}{3\,840}\theta_0^5 - \frac{1}{645\,120}\theta_0^7 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
is used in the Legendre polynomial solution above.
The resulting power series is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Arithmetic-geometric mean solution for elliptic integral===

The first iteration of this algorithm gives

:&lt;math&gt;T_1 = \frac{2T_0}{1 + \cos \frac{\theta_0}{2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This approximation has the relative error of less than 1% for angles up to 96.11 degrees.&lt;ref name=Carvalhaes /&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+\cos(\theta_0/2)}{2} = \cos^2 \frac{\theta_0}{4},&lt;/math&gt; the expression can be written more concisely as

==Arbitrary-amplitude angular displacement Fourier series==

The Fourier series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(t)=8\sum_{l=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^l}{2l+1}\frac{q^{l+1/2}}{1+q^{2l+1}}\cos\left[(2l+1)\omega t\right] &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Nome (mathematics)|elliptic nome]], &lt;math&gt;q=\exp(-\pi K'/K)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\omega=2\pi/T&lt;/math&gt; the angular frequency.
If one defines
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\frac{1-\sqrt{\cos\frac{\theta_0}{2}}}{2+2\sqrt{\cos\frac{\theta_0}{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated using the expansion
:&lt;math&gt;q=\epsilon+2\epsilon^5+15\epsilon^{19}+150\epsilon^{13}+1707\epsilon^{17}+20910\epsilon^{21}+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;
(see {{OEIS2C|A002103}}). Note that for &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;\tfrac12&lt;/math&gt;, thus the approximation is applicable even for large amplitudes.

== Examples ==

The animations below depict the motion of a simple (frictionless) pendulum with increasing amounts of initial displacement of the bob, or equivalently increasing  initial velocity. The small graph above each pendulum is the corresponding [[phase plane]] diagram; the horizontal axis is displacement and the vertical axis is velocity.  With a large enough initial velocity the pendulum does not oscillate back and forth but rotates completely around the pivot.

== Compound pendulum ==

A '''compound pendulum''' (or '''physical pendulum''') is one where the rod is not massless, and may have extended size; that is, an arbitrarily shaped [[rigid body]] swinging by a pivot. In this case the pendulum's period depends on its [[moment of inertia]] {{mvar|I}} around the pivot point.

The equation of [[torque]] gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = I \alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:{{mvar|α}} is the angular acceleration.
:{{mvar|τ}} is the torque

The torque is generated by gravity so:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = - m g L \sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: {{mvar|m}} is the mass of the body
: {{mvar|L}} is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the pendulum
: {{mvar|θ}} is the angle from the vertical

Hence, under the small-angle approximation {{math|sin ''θ'' ≈ ''θ''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \theta'' \approx -\frac{mgL \theta} {I_\mathrm{cm} + mL^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the moment of inertia of the body about its center of mass.

The expression for {{mvar|α}} is of the same form as the conventional simple pendulum and gives a period of&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pendp.html Physical Pendulum]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{I_\mathrm{cm} + mL^2} {mgL}}&lt;/math&gt;

And a frequency of
: &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{mgL}{I_\mathrm{cm} + mL^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the initial angle is taken into consideration (for large amplitudes), then the expression for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes: 
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \theta'' = -\frac{mgL \sin\theta}{I_\mathrm{cm} + mL^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and gives a period of: 
: &lt;math&gt;T = 4 K \left(\sin^2\frac{\theta_0}{2}\right) \sqrt{\frac{I_\mathrm{cm} + mL^2}{mgL}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the maximum angle of oscillation (with respect to the vertical) and {{math|''K''(''k'')}} is the [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the first kind|complete elliptic integral of the first kind]].

== Physical interpretation of the imaginary period ==

The [[Jacobi's elliptic functions|Jacobian elliptic function]] that expresses the position of a pendulum as a function of time is a [[doubly periodic function]] with a [[real number|real]] period and an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] period. The real period is of course the time it takes the pendulum to go through one full cycle. [[Paul Appell]] pointed out a physical interpretation of the imaginary period:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul |last=Appell |title=Sur une interprétation des valeurs imaginaires du temps en Mécanique |trans-title=On an interpretation of imaginary time values in mechanics |journal=[[Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences]] |volume=87 |issue=1 |date=July 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; if {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the maximum angle of one pendulum and {{math|180° − ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the maximum angle of another, then the real period of each is the magnitude of the imaginary period of the other. This interpretation, involving dual forces in opposite directions, might be further clarified and generalized to other classical problems in mechanics with dual solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Adlaj |first=S. |title=Mechanical interpretation of negative and imaginary tension of a tether in a linear parallel force field |work=Selected papers of the International Scientific Conference on Mechanics "Sixth Polyakhov Readings" |date=2012 |location=Saint Petersburg |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coupled pendulums ==
[[File:Coupled pendulums.svg|thumb|415x415px|Two identical simple pendulums coupled via a spring connecting the bobs.]]
'''Coupled pendulums''' can affect each other's motion, either through a direction connection (such as a spring connecting the bobs) or through motions in a supporting structure (such as a tabletop). The equations of motion for two identical simple pendulums coupled by a spring connecting the bobs can be obtained using [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian Mechanics]].

The kinetic energy of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K}=\frac{1}{2}mL^2\left(\dot\theta_1^2+\dot\theta_2^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the bobs, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the strings, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; are the angular displacements of the two bobs from equilibrium.

The potential energy of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{p}=mgL(2-\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2)+\frac{1}{2}kL^2(\theta_2-\theta_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational acceleration]], and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hooke's law|spring constant]]. The displacement &lt;math&gt;L(\theta_2-\theta_1)&lt;/math&gt; of the spring from its equilibrium position assumes the [[Small-angle approximation|small angle approximation]].

The Lagrangian is then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}mL^2\left(\dot\theta_1^2+\dot\theta_2^2\right)-mgL(2-\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2)-\frac{1}{2}kL^2(\theta_2-\theta_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;

which leads to the following set of coupled differential equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ddot\theta_1+\frac{g}{L}\sin\theta_1+\frac{k}{m}(\theta_1-\theta_2)&amp;=0 \\
\ddot\theta_2+\frac{g}{L}\sin\theta_2-\frac{k}{m}(\theta_1-\theta_2)&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding and subtracting these two equations in turn, and applying the small angle approximation, gives two [[Harmonic oscillator#Simple harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator]] equations in the variables &lt;math&gt;\theta_1+\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_1-\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ddot\theta_1+\ddot\theta_2+\frac{g}{L}(\theta_1+\theta_2)&amp;=0 \\
\ddot\theta_1-\ddot\theta_2+\left(\frac{g}{L}+2\frac{k}{m}\right)(\theta_1-\theta_2)&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with the corresponding solutions

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\theta_1+\theta_2&amp;=A\cos(\omega_1t+\alpha) \\
\theta_1-\theta_2&amp;=B\cos(\omega_2t+\beta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_1&amp;=\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} \\
\omega_2&amp;=\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}+2\frac{k}{m}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are [[Constant of integration|constants of integration]].

Expressing the solutions in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; alone:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\theta_1&amp;=\frac{1}{2}A\cos(\omega_1t+\alpha)+\frac{1}{2}B\cos(\omega_2t+\beta) \\
\theta_2&amp;=\frac{1}{2}A\cos(\omega_1t+\alpha)-\frac{1}{2}B\cos(\omega_2t+\beta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the bobs are not given an initial push, then the condition &lt;math&gt;\dot\theta_1(0)=\dot\theta_2(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; requires &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, which gives (after some rearranging):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A&amp;=\theta_1(0)+\theta_2(0)\\
B&amp;=\theta_1(0)-\theta_2(0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Per-user unitary rate control''' ('''PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC''') is a multi-user MIMO scheme. PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC uses both transmission pre-coding and multi-user scheduling. By doing that, the network capacity is further enhanced than the capacity of the single-user MIMO scheme.

* Background technologies: A single-user MIMO was initially developed to improve the spectral efficiency of point-to-point wireless transmission link. A multi-user MIMO was developed for cellular systems where the base station simultaneously communicates with multiple users.
* Principle: The concept of Per-User Unitary Rate Control (PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC) was proposed in US Patent No. 7,324,480, ''Mobile communication apparatus and method including base station and mobile station having multi-antenna'' by James S. Kim, Kwang Bok Lee, Kiho Kim and Changsoon Park.

Recently, PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC has been adopted in the IEEE 802.16m system description documentation (SDD) and the concept of this scheme was included in 3GPP [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] standard.

==Technology==
Per-user unitary rate control (PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC) is a practical multi-user [[MIMO]] solution. PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC allows a base station to transmit different data streams to multiple users simultaneously. The base station selects target users from candidate users based on the information fed by users. Transmission data are multiplied by a pre-coding matrix selected from the set of predefined matrices before transmission. The selection of a pre-coding matrix is determined based on the information provided by users. The selection of both target users and a pre-coding matrix according to the information provided by mobiles enables the utilization of multi-user diversity and data multiplexing at the same time. Moreover. Using predefined precoding matrices reduces feedback overhead from users to the base station. Pre-coding matrices used in this scheme is unitary. The use of unitary pre-coding matrices facilitates the estimation of interference from other users' data to the unintended user.

==Mathematical description==
The operation of PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC is mathematically described for the transmitter and receiver sides, respectively.

===Base station===
It is assumed that the base station employs &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; transmission antennas. The &lt;math&gt;N_t \times 1&lt;/math&gt; transmission signal vector is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^K \mathbf{w}_i P_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_t \times 1&lt;/math&gt; linear precoding vector. PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_i&lt;/math&gt; based on the received finite channel status information, which is delivered to the base station from the user equipment (UE) through uplink feedback signaling. The feedback signal consists of index in a look-up table of a precoding codebook.

===Receiver side===
Every receiver has a receive antenna array with &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; elements. The receive signal vector at user &lt;math&gt;k (=1,2,\ldots,K)&lt;/math&gt; is modeled as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_k = \mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{n}_k&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_k&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;N_r \times 1&lt;/math&gt; received symbol and noise, respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the  &lt;math&gt;N_r \times N_t&lt;/math&gt; matrix with the channel coefficients.

===Throughput performance===
The figure illustrates the throughput advantage of PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC over the conventional single-user and no scheduling scheme, assuming that the codebook size is one, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(G=1)&lt;/math&gt;. For larger codebook sizes the performance can be better than the performance of the unit-size codebook. Because of codebook-based multi-user scheduling, PU&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;RC outperforms the conventional single-user and no scheduling scheme when the number of users is larger than one. Note that the performance plotted in the figure for the two systems were obtained assuming linear receiver.

'''Pierre Alphonse Laurent''' (18 July 1813 – 2 September 1854) was a French mathematician and Military Officer best known as the discoverer of the [[Laurent series]], an expansion of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] into an [[Infinity|infinite]] [[power series]], generalizing the [[Taylor series]] expansion.

He was born in Paris, France. '''Pierre Laurent''' entered the École Polytechnique in Paris in 1830, Laurent graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1832, being one of the best students in his year, and entered the engineering corps as second lieutenant. He then attended the École d'Application at Metz until he was sent to Algeria.

Laurent returned to France from Algeria around 1840 and spent six years directing operations for the enlargement of the port of Le Havre on the English Channel coast. Rouen had been the main French port up to the nineteenth century but the hydraulic construction projects on which Laurent worked in Le Havre turned it into France's main seaport. It is clear that Laurent was a good engineer, putting his deep theoretical knowledge to good practical use.

It was while Laurent was working on the construction project at Le Havre that he began to write his first mathematical papers. He submitted a memoir for the Grand Prize of the [[Académie des Sciences]] of 1842. His result was contained in a memoir submitted for the Grand Prize of the [[Académie des Sciences]] in 1843, but his submission was after the due date, and the paper was not published and never considered for the prize. Laurent died at age 41 in Paris. His work was not published until after his death.

Principia Cybernetica was initiated in 1989 in the USA by [[Cliff Joslyn]] and [[Valentin Turchin]], and a year later broadened to Europe with [[Francis Heylighen]] from Belgium joining their cooperation.

Major activities of the Principia Cybernetica Project are: 
* Principia Cybernetica Web: an online encyclopedia
* Web Dictionary of Cybernetics and Systems; an online dictionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcp.vub.ac.be/ASC/indexASC.html Web Dictionary of Cybernetics and Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Newsletter Principia Cybernetica News
* Conferences and traditional publications

The organization is associated with: 
* [[American Society for Cybernetics]].
* Evolution, Complexity and Cognition group: a transdisciplinary research group at the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, founded in 2004 and directed by [[Francis Heylighen]].
* Journal of Memetics-Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission (JoM-EMIT) is an international peer-refereed scientific journal
* Global Brain Group: for discussion about the emergence of a [[global brain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIN-L.html The Global Brain Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principia Cybernetica Web ==
The Principia Cybernetica Web,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be Principia Cybernetica Web]&lt;/ref&gt; which went [[List of websites founded before 1995|online in 1993]], is one of the first complex webs in the world.
It is still viewed as one of the most important sites{{By whom|date=October 2011}} on [[cybernetics]], [[systems theory]], [[complexity]], and related approaches.

== Workshops and symposia ==
Especially in the 1990s the Principia Cybernetica has organized a series of workshops and international symposia on [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] themes.&lt;ref name="Principia Cybernetica Meetings"&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ACT.html Principia Cybernetica Meetings], 2001, retrieved October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 1st Principia Cybernetica Workshop in June 1991 in [[Brussels]] many [[cyberneticist]]s attended like Harry Bronitz, [[Gordon Pask]], J.L.

'''SIGNAL''' is a [[programming language]] based on synchronized [[data-flow]] (flows + synchronization): a process is a set of equations on elementary flows describing both data and control.&lt;ref&gt;P. Le Guernic, T. Gautier, M. Le Borgne, and C. Le Maire. Programming Real-Time Applications with SIGNAL. ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', '''79(9)''': 1321-1336, September 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIGNAL [[Model of computation|formal model]] provides the capability to describe [[systems]] with [[Multi-rate digital signal processing|several clocks]] &lt;ref&gt;P. Le Guernic, J.-P. Talpin, and J.-C. Le Lann. Polychrony for system design. ''Journal for Circuits, Systems and Computers'', Special Issue on Application Specific Hardware Design, World Scientific, April 2003 (also available as INRIA Research Report 4715, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Gamatié and T. Gautier. The SIGNAL Synchronous Multiclock Approach to the Design of Distributed Embedded Systems. ''IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems'', '''21(5)''': 641-657, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (polychronous systems) as [[Ontology components#Relationships|relational specifications]]. Relations are useful as partial specifications and as specifications of [[Nondeterministic programming|non-deterministic]] devices (for instance a non-deterministic [[Bus (computing)|bus]]) or external processes (for instance an unsafe car driver).

Using SIGNAL allows one to [[specification|specify]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Gamatié. Designing Embedded Systems with the SIGNAL Programming Language: Synchronous, Reactive Specification. ''{{ISBN|978-1-4419-0940-4}}.'' Book edited by Springer - New York, 260 pages, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; an application, to design an [[architecture]], to refine detailed components down to [[RTOS]]{{clarify|date=November 2011}} or hardware description. The SIGNAL model supports a [[design methodology]] which goes from [[specification]] to [[implementation]], from [[abstraction]] to [[concretization]], from [[Synchronization|synchrony]] to [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]].

SIGNAL has been mainly developed in [http://www.inria.fr/ INRIA][http://www.inria.fr/en/en/teams/espresso Espresso team] since the 1980s, at the same time as similar programming languages, [[Esterel]] and [[Lustre (programming language)|Lustre]].

== A brief history ==
The SIGNAL language was first designed for [[Digital signal processing|signal processing applications]] in the beginning of the 1980s. It has been proposed to answer the demand of new [[Domain-specific language|domain-specific]] language for the design of [[Digital signal processing|signal processing applications]], adopting a [[dataflow programming|dataflow]] and [[Block diagram|block-diagram]] style with [[array data type|array]] and [[sliding window]] operators. P. Le Guernic, A. Benveniste, and T. Gautier have been in charge of the language definition. The first paper on SIGNAL was published in 1982, while the first complete description of SIGNAL appeared in the PhD thesis of T. Gautier. The symbolic representation of SIGNAL via z/3z (over [-1,0,1]) has been introduced in 1986. A full compiler of SIGNAL based on the clock calculus on hierarchy of Boolean clocks, was described by L. Besnard in his PhD thesis in 1992. The clock calculus has been improved later by T. Amagbegnon with the proposition of arborescent canonical forms.

During the 1990s, the application domain of the SIGNAL language has been extended into general embedded and real-time systems. The relation-oriented specification style enabled the increasing construction of the systems, and also led to the design considering multi-clocked systems, compared to the original single-clock-based implementation of Esterel and Lustre. Moreover, the design and implementation of distributed embedded systems were also taken into account in SIGNAL. The corresponding research includes the optimization methods proposed by B. Chéron, the clustering models defined by B. Le Goff, the abstraction and separate compilation formalized by O. Maffeïs, and the implementation of distributed programs developed by P. Aubry.

==The Polychrony Toolsets==
The Polychrony toolset is an [[Open Source]] development environment for critical/embedded systems based on SIGNAL, a [[real-time computing|real-time]] polychronous [[data-flow]] language. It provides a unified [[model-driven engineering|model-driven environment]] to perform design exploration by using top-down and [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] [[design methodology|design methodologies]] formally supported by design model transformations from [[specification]] to [[implementation]] and from [[Synchronization|synchrony]] to asynchrony. It can be included in [[heterogeneous]] design systems with various input formalisms and output languages.

Polychrony is a set of tools composed of:

==The SME environment==
The SME (SIGNAL Meta under Eclipse) environment is a [[front and back ends|front-end]] of Polychrony in the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] environment based on [[Model-driven engineering|Model-Driven Engineering]] (MDE) technologies. It consists of a set of Eclipse plug-ins which rely on the [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF). The environment is built around SME, a [[metamodeling|metamodel]] &lt;ref&gt;C. Brunette, J.-P. Talpin, A. Gamatié, and T. Gautier. A Metamodel for the Design of Polychronous Systems. ''Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming'', '''78(4)''': 233-259, Elsevier, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SIGNAL language extended with [[mode automata]] &lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Talpin, C. Brunette, T. Gautier, and A. Gamatié. Polychronous mode automata. Proceedings of the 6th ACM &amp; IEEE International conference on Embedded software (EMSOFT '06), ACM Press, October 2006, 83-92.&lt;/ref&gt; concepts.

The SME environment is composed of several plug-ins which correspond to:
*    A [[reflexive editor]]: a [[tree]] view allowing to manipulate models conform to the SME metamodel.
*    A graphical modeler based on the [http://www.topcased.org TopCased] modeling facilities (cf. previous picture).
*    A reflexive editor and an Eclipse view to create compilation scenarios.
*    A direct connection to the Polychrony services ([[compiler|compilation]], [[formal verification]], etc.).
*    A [[documentation]] and model examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[measure theory]], a '''''σ''-ideal''' of a [[sigma-algebra]] (''σ'', read "sigma," means [[countable]] in this context) is a [[subset]] with certain desirable [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] properties. It is a special type of [[ideal (set theory)|ideal]]. Its most frequent application is perhaps in [[probability theory]].

Let (''X'',Σ) be a [[measurable space]] (meaning Σ is a ''σ''-algebra of subsets of ''X'').  A subset ''N'' of Σ is a ''σ''-ideal if the following properties are satisfied:

(i) Ø ∈ ''N'';

(ii) When ''A'' ∈ ''N'' and ''B'' ∈ Σ , ''B'' ⊆ ''A'' ⇒ ''B'' ∈ ''N'';

(iii) &lt;math&gt;\left\{A_n \right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \subseteq N \Rightarrow \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} A_n\in N.&lt;/math&gt;

Briefly, a sigma-ideal must contain the empty set and contain subsets and countable unions of its elements. The concept of ''σ''-ideal is [[duality (order theory)|dual]] to that of a [[countably]] [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] (''σ''-) [[filter (mathematics)|filter]].

If a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''μ'' is given on (''X'',Σ), the set of ''μ''-[[negligible set]]s (''S'' ∈ Σ such that [[measure zero|''&amp;mu;''(''S'') = 0]]) is a ''σ''-ideal.

The notion can be generalized to [[preorder]]s (''P'',≤,0) with a bottom element 0 as follows: ''I'' is a ''σ''-ideal of ''P'' just when

(i') 0 ∈ ''I'',

(ii') ''x'' ≤ ''y'' &amp; ''y'' ∈ ''I'' ⇒ ''x'' ∈ ''I'', and

(iii') given a family ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''I'' (''n'' ∈ '''N'''), there is ''y'' ∈ ''I'' such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''y'' for each ''n''

Thus ''I'' contains the bottom element, is downward closed, and is closed under [[countable]] [[suprema]] (which must exist). It is natural in this context to ask that ''P'' itself have countable suprema.

A '''''σ''-ideal''' of a set X is a σ-ideal of the power set of X. That is, when no σ-algebra is specified, then one simply takes the full power set of the underlying set. For example, the [[meagre set|meager subsets]] of a topological space are those in the σ-ideal generated by the collection of closed subsets with empty interior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32792">'''Stoic logic''' is the system of [[propositional logic]] developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers in [[ancient Greece]]. It was one of the two great systems of logic in the classical world. It was largely built and shaped by [[Chrysippus]], the third head of the Stoic school in the 3rd-century BCE. Chrysippus's logic differed from Aristotle's [[term logic]] because it was based on the analysis of [[proposition]]s rather than terms. The smallest unit in Stoic logic is an ''assertible'' (the Stoic equivalent of a proposition) which is the content of a statement such as "it is day". Assertibles have a truth-value such that at any moment of time they are either true or false. Compound assertibles can be built up from simple ones through the use of [[logical connectives]]. The resulting syllogistic was grounded on five basic indemonstrable arguments to which all other syllogisms were claimed to be reducible.

Towards the end of antiquity Stoic logic was neglected in favour of Aristotle's logic, and as a result the Stoic writings on logic did not survive, and the only accounts of it were incomplete reports by other writers. Knowledge about Stoic logic as a system was lost until the 20th-century when logicians familiar with the modern [[propositional calculus]] reappraised the ancient accounts of it.

==Background==
{{See also|History of logic}}
[[Stoicism]] is a school of philosophy which developed in the [[Hellenistic period]] around a generation after the time of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics believed that the universe operated according to reason, ''i.e.'' by a God which is immersed in nature itself.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite74"/&gt; Logic (''logike'') was the part of philosophy which examined reason (''logos'').&lt;ref name="sellars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve a happy life—a life worth living—requires logical thought.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite74"/&gt; The Stoics held that an understanding of ethics was impossible without logic.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Brad Inwood]], the Stoics believed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|2003|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Logic helps a person see what is the case, reason effectively about practical affairs, stand his or her ground amid confusion, differentiate the certain from the probable, and so forth.}}

[[File:Chrysippus bust.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysippus, who created much of Stoic logic]]
Aristotle's [[term logic]] can be viewed as a logic of classification.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of four logical terms "all", "some", "is/are", and "is/are not" and to that extent is fairly static.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sellars57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics needed a logic that examines choice and consequence.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite78"/&gt; The Stoics therefore developed a logic of [[proposition]]s which uses connectives such as "if ... then", "either ... or", and "not both".&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such connectives are part of everyday reasoning.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite79"/&gt; [[Socrates]] in the [[Dialogues of Plato]] often asks a fellow citizen ''if'' they believe a certain thing; when they agree, Socrates then proceeds to show how the consequences are logically false or absurd, inferring that the original belief must be wrong.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite79"/&gt; Similar attempts at forensic reasoning must have been used in the law-courts, and they are a fundamental part of Greek mathematics.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite79"/&gt; Aristotle himself was familiar with propositions, and his pupils [[Theophrastus]] and [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] had examined [[hypothetical syllogism]]s, but there was no attempt by the [[Peripatetic school]] to develop these ideas into a system of logic.&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou507"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2009|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoic tradition of logic originated in the 4th-century BCE in a different school of philosophy known as the [[Megarian school]].&lt;ref name="bobzien880"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1996|p=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was two dialeticians of this school, [[Diodorus Cronus]] and his pupil [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]], who developed their own theories of [[Modal logic|modalities]] and of [[Material conditional|conditional propositions]].&lt;ref name="bobzien880"/&gt; The founder of Stoicism, [[Zeno of Citium]], studied under the Megarians and he was said to have been a fellow pupil with Philo.&lt;ref name="sellars56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the outstanding figure in the development of Stoic logic was [[Chrysippus|Chrysippus of Soli]] (c. 279 – c. 206 BCE), the third head of the Stoic school.&lt;ref name="bobzien880"/&gt; Chrysippus shaped much of Stoic logic as we know it creating a system of propositional logic.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite80"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a logician Chrysippus is sometimes said to rival Aristotle in stature.&lt;ref name="sellars56"/&gt; The logical writings by Chrysippus are, however, almost entirely lost,&lt;ref name="bobzien880"/&gt; instead his system has to be reconstructed from the partial and incomplete accounts preserved in the works of later authors such as [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Diogenes Laërtius]], and [[Galen]].&lt;ref name="sellars56"/&gt;

==Propositions==
To the Stoics, logic was a wide field of knowledge which included the study of [[philosophy of language|language]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name="sellars55"/&gt; However, all of these fields were interrelated, and the Stoics developed their logic (or "dialectic") within the context of their theory of language and epistemology.&lt;ref name="otoolejennings400"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assertibles===
The Stoics held that any meaningful utterance will involve three items: the sounds uttered; the thing which is referred to or described by the utterance; and an incorporeal item—the "sayable" (''lekton'')—that which is conveyed in the language.&lt;ref name="everson85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Everson|1994|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''lekton'' is not a statement but the content of a statement, and it corresponds to a complete utterance.&lt;ref name="johansen466"&gt;{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ierodiakonou678"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2006|p=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lekton'' can be something such as a question or a command, but Stoic logic operates on those ''lekta'' which are called "assertibles" (''axiomata''), described as a proposition which is either true or false and which affirms or denies.&lt;ref name="johansen466"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sellars58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of assertibles include "it is night", "it is raining this afternoon", and "noone is walking."&lt;ref name="sellars58-9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|pp=58–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bobzien102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertibles are [[truth-bearer]]s.&lt;ref name="bobzien92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can never be true and false at the same time ([[law of noncontradiction]]) and they must be ''at least'' true or false ([[law of excluded middle]]).&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics catalogued these simple assertibles according to whether they are affirmative or negative, and whether they are definite or indefinite (or both).&lt;ref name="bobzien97-8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|pp=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertibles are much like modern [[proposition]]s, however their truth value can change depending on ''when'' they are asserted.&lt;ref name="bobzien95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an assertible such as "it is night" will only be true when it is night and not when it is day.&lt;ref name="sellars58"/&gt;

===Compound assertibles===
Simple assertibles can be connected to each other to form compound or non-simple assertibles.&lt;ref name="bobzien103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through the use of [[logical connectives]].&lt;ref name="bobzien103"/&gt; Chrysippus seems to have been responsible for introducing the three main types of connectives: the [[Material conditional|conditional]] ('''if'''), [[Logical conjunction|conjunctive]] ('''and'''), and [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] ('''or''').&lt;ref name="bobzien105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical conditional takes the form of "if p then q";&lt;ref name="bobzien106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a conjunction takes the form of "both p and q";&lt;ref name="bobzien106"/&gt; and a disjunction takes the form of "either p or q".&lt;ref name="bobzien109"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''or''' they used is [[Exclusive or|exclusive]], unlike the [[Logical disjunction|inclusive or]] generally used in modern formal logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|2003|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connectives are combined with the use of '''not''' for negation.&lt;ref name="sellars60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the conditional can take the following four forms:&lt;ref name="bobzien129"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If p, then q | If not p, then q | If p, then not q | If not p, then not q

Later Stoics added more connectives: the pseudo-conditional took the form of "since p then q"; and the causal assertible took the form of "because p then q".{{Ref label|A|a|none}} There was also a comparative (or dissertive): "more/less (likely) p than q".&lt;ref name="bobzien109-111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|pp=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality===
Assertibles can also be distinguished by their [[Modal logic|modal properties]]{{Ref label|B|b|none}}—whether they are possible, impossible, necessary, or non-necessary.&lt;ref name="sellars59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this the Stoics were building on an earlier Megarian debate initiated by Diodorus Cronus.&lt;ref name="sellars59"/&gt; Diodorus had defined ''possibility'' in a way which seemed to adopt a form of [[fatalism]].&lt;ref name="kenny136"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adamson|2015|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus defined ''possible'' as "that which either is or will be true".&lt;ref name="ancientlogic"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=logic-ancient|title=Ancient Logic|last=Bobzien|first=Susanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there are no possibilities that are forever unrealised, whatever is possible is or one day will be true.&lt;ref name="kenny136"/&gt; His pupil Philo, rejecting this, defined ''possible'' as "that which is capable of being true by the proposition's own nature",&lt;ref name="ancientlogic"/&gt; thus a statement like "this piece of wood can burn" is ''possible'', even if it spent its entire existence on the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref name="kenny138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adamson|2015|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus, on the other hand, was a causal determinist: he thought that true causes inevitably give rise to their effects and that all things arise in this way.&lt;ref name="adamson58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adamson|2015|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was not a logical determinist or fatalist: he wanted to distinguish between possible and necessary truths.&lt;ref name="adamson58"/&gt; Thus he took a middle position between Diodorus and Philo, combining elements of both their modal systems.&lt;ref name="bobzien120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus's set of Stoic modal definitions was as follows:&lt;ref name="bobzien118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllogistic==
===Arguments===
In Stoic logic, an [[argument form]] contains two (or more) premisses related to one another as cause and effect.&lt;ref name="zeller113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical Stoic [[syllogism]] is:&lt;ref name="bobzien121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If it is day, it is light;&lt;br/&gt;
:It is day;&lt;br/&gt;
:Therefore it is light.

It has a non-simple assertible for the first premiss ("If it is day, it is light") and a simple assertible for second premiss ("It is day").&lt;ref name="bobzien121"/&gt; The second premiss doesn't ''always'' have to be simple but it will have fewer components than the first.&lt;ref name="bobzien121"/&gt;

In more formal terms this type of syllogism is:&lt;ref name="sellars58"/&gt;

:If p, then q;&lt;br/&gt;
:p;&lt;br/&gt;
:Therefore q.

Thus, like Aristotle's term logic, Stoic logic uses variables, but the values of the variables are propositions not terms.&lt;ref name="bobzien881"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1996|p=881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus listed five basic argument forms, which he regarded as true beyond dispute.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} These five indemonstrable arguments are made up of conditional, disjunction, and negation conjunction connectives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmus|Restall2012|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all other arguments are reducible to these five indemonstrable arguments.&lt;ref name="ierodiakonou678"/&gt;

There can be many variations of these five indemonstrable arguments.&lt;ref name="bobzien128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example the assertibles in the premisses can be more complex, and the following syllogism is a valid example of the second indemonstrable (''modus tollens''):&lt;ref name="bobzien129"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:if both p and q, then r;&lt;br/&gt;
:not r;&lt;br/&gt;
:therefore not: both p and q

Similarly one can incorporate negation into these arguments.&lt;ref name="bobzien129"/&gt; A valid example of the fourth indemonstrable (''modus tollendo ponens'' or disjunctive syllogism) is:&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:either [not p] or q;&lt;br/&gt;
:not [not p];&lt;br/&gt;
:therefore q

which, incorporating the principle of [[double negation]], is equivalent to:&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite87"/&gt;

:either [not p] or q;&lt;br/&gt;
:p;&lt;br/&gt;
:therefore q

===Analysis===
Many arguments are not in the form of the five indemonstrables, and the task is to show how they can be reduced to one of the five types.&lt;ref name="sellars60"/&gt; A simple example of Stoic reduction is reported by [[Sextus Empiricus]]:&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou521"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2009|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:if both p and q, then r;&lt;br/&gt;
:not r;&lt;br/&gt;
:but also p;&lt;br/&gt;
:Therefore not q

This can be reduced to two separate indemonstrable arguments of the second and third type:&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou522"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2009|p=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:if both p and q, then r;&lt;br/&gt;
:not r;&lt;br/&gt;
:therefore not: both p and q

:not: both p and q&lt;br/&gt;
:p;&lt;br/&gt;
:therefore not q

The Stoics stated that complex syllogisms could be reduced to the indemonstrables through the use of four ground rules or ''themata''.&lt;ref name="bobzien881"/&gt; Of these four ''themata'', only two have survived.&lt;ref name="ancientlogic"/&gt; One, the so-called first ''thema'', was a rule of antilogism:&lt;ref name="ancientlogic"/&gt;

{{quote|When from two [assertibles] a third follows, then from either of them together with the contradictory of the conclusion the contradictory of the other follows ([[Apuleius]], ''De Interpretatione'' 209. 9–14).}}

The other, the third ''thema'', was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be reduced to simple syllogisms.{{Ref label|E|e|none}} The importance of these rules is not altogether clear.&lt;ref name="barnes82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|1997|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd-century BCE [[Antipater of Tarsus]] is said to have introduced a simpler method involving the use of fewer ''themata'', although few details survive concerning this.&lt;ref name="barnes82"/&gt; In any case, the ''themata'' cannot have been a necessary part of every analysis.&lt;ref name="barnes83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|1997|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next to describing inferences which are valid, another subject which engaged the Stoics was the enumeration and refutation of false arguments, and in particular of [[paradox]]es.&lt;ref name="zeller122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of a Stoic's logical training was to prepare the philosopher for paradoxes and help find solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|2003|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false argument could be one with a false premiss or which is formally incorrect, however paradoxes represented a challenge to the basic logical notions of the Stoics such as truth or falsehood.&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou525"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2009|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; One famous paradox, known as ''[[Liar paradox|The Liar]]'', asked "A man says he is lying; is what he says true or false?"—if the man says something true then it seems he is lying, but if he is lying then he is not saying something true, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmus|Restall|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus is known to have written several books on this paradox, although it is not known what solution he offered for it.&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou526"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ierodiakonou|2009|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paradox known as the ''[[Sorites paradox|Sorites]]'' or "Heap" asked "How many grains of wheat do you need before you get a heap?"&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou526"/&gt; It was said to challenge the idea of true or false by offering up the possibility of vagueness.&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou526"/&gt; The response of Chrysippus however was: "That doesn't harm me, for like a skilled driver I shall restrain my horses before I reach the edge ... In like manner I restrain myself in advance and stop replying to sophistical questions."&lt;ref name="ieridiakonou526"/&gt;

==Stoic practice==
Training in logic included a mastery of logical puzzles, the study of paradoxes, and the dissection of arguments.&lt;ref name="nussbaum2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nussbaum|2009|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not an end in itself, but rather its purpose was for the Stoics to cultivate their rational powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2001|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Logic, for instance, was not limited to an abstract theory of reasoning, nor even to school exercises in syllogistics; rather, there was a daily practice of logic applied to the problems of everyday life. Logic was thus the mastery of inner discourse. ... The Stoics believed that the human passions correspond to a misuse of human discourse. In other words, they are the result of errors in judgement and in reasoning. We must therefore monitor our inner discourse to see whether erroneous value judgments have crept into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadot|2002|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stoic logic was thus a method of self-discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2001|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to enable ethical reflection, permit secure and confident arguing, and lead the pupil to truth.&lt;ref name="nussbaum2009"/&gt; The end result would be thought that is consistent, clear and precise, and which exposes confusion, murkiness and inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nussbaum|2009|pp=348–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] gives a list of dialectical virtues, which were probably invented by Chrysippus:&lt;ref name="long92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2001|p=92}} citing Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 46f.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|First he mentions ''aproptosia'', which means literally 'not falling forward' and is defined as 'knowledge of when one should give assent or not' (give assent); next ''aneikaiotes'', 'unhastiness', defined as 'strong-mindedness against the probable (or plausible), so as not to give in to it'; third, ''anelenxia'', 'irrefutability', the definition of which is 'strength in argument, so as not to be driven by it to the contradictory'; and fourth, ''amataiotes'', 'lack of emptyheadedness', defined as 'a disposition which refers impressions (''phantasiai'') to the correct ''logos''.&lt;ref name="long92"/&gt;}}

==Later reception==
For around five hundred years Stoic logic was one of the two great systems of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kneale|Kneale|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of Chrysippus was discussed alongside that of Aristotle, and it may well have been more prominent since Stoicism was the dominant philosophical school.&lt;ref name="knealekneale177"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kneale|Kneale|1962|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a modern perspective Aristotle's term logic and the Stoic logic of propositions appear complementary, but they were sometimes regarded as rival systems.&lt;ref name="sellars60"/&gt; In late antiquity the Stoic school fell into decline, and the last pagan philosophical school, the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], adopted Aristotle's logic for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharples|2003|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only elements of Stoic logic made their way into the logical writings of later commentators such as [[Boethius]], transmitting confused parts of Stoic logic to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="knealekneale177"/&gt; Propositional logic was redeveloped by [[Peter Abelard]] in the 12th-century, but by the mid-15th-century the only logic which was being studied was a simplified version of Aristotle's.&lt;ref name="hurley6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurley|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th-century [[Immanuel Kant]] could pronounce that "since Aristotle ... logic has not been able to advance a single step, and is thus to all appearance a closed and complete body of doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=403}} quoting Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt; To 19th-century historians, who believed that [[Hellenistic philosophy]] represented a decline from that of Plato and Aristotle, Stoic logic could only be seen with contempt.&lt;ref name="otoolejennings403"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl von Prantl|Carl Prantl]] thought that Stoic logic was "dullness, triviality, and scholastic quibbling" and he welcomed the fact that the works of Chrysippus were no longer extant.&lt;ref name="otoolejennings397"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Zeller]] remarked that "the whole contribution of the Stoics to the field of logic consists in their having clothed the logic of the Peripatetics with a new terminology."&lt;ref name="zeller124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern logic begins in the middle of the 19th-century with the work of [[George Boole]] and [[Augustus de Morgan]],&lt;ref name="hurley6"/&gt; but Stoic logic was only rediscovered in the 20th-century.&lt;ref name="otoolejennings397"/&gt; The first person to reappraise their ideas was the Polish logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] from the 1920s onwards.&lt;ref name="otoolejennings397"/&gt; He was followed by [[Benson Mates]].&lt;ref name="otoolejennings397"/&gt; Although strikingly modern, Stoic logic was not a [[formal system]] in the modern sense, since their motivation was to study their ethical psychology and their general theory of nature ([[Stoic physics]]).&lt;ref name="otoolejennings400"/&gt; Stoic concepts often differ from modern ones, but nevertheless there are many close parallels between Stoic and 20th-century theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Dever|2012|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|What we see as a result is a close similarity between [these] methods of reasoning and the behaviour of digital computers. ... The code happens to come from the nineteeth-century logician and mathematician George Boole, whose aim was to codify the relations studied much earlier by Chrysippus (albeit with greater abstraction and sophistication). Later generations built on Boole's insights ... but the logic that made it all possible was the interconnected logic of an interconnected universe, discovered by the ancient Chrysippus, who labored long ago under an old Athenian stoa.&lt;ref name="shenefeltwhite96-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shenefelt|White|2013|pp=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The minimum requirement for a conditional is that the consequent follows from the antecedent.&lt;ref name="bobzien106"/&gt; The pseudo-conditional adds that the antecedent must be also be true. The causal assertible adds an asymmetry rule such that if p is the cause/reason for q, then q cannot be the cause/reason for p. {{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=109}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} "Stoic modal logic is not a logic of modal propositions (e.g., propositions of the type 'It is possible that it is day' ...) ... instead, their modal theory was about non-modalized propositions like 'It is day', insofar as they are possible, necessary, and so forth." {{Harvnb|Bobzien|1999|p=117}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} Most of these argument forms had already been discussed by Theophrastus, but: "It is plain that even if Theophrastus discussed (1)–(5), he did not anticipate Chrysippus' achievement. ... his Aristotelian approach to the study and organization of argument-forms would have given his discussion of mixed hypothetical syllogisms an utterly unStoical aspect." {{Harvnb|Barnes|1999|p=83}}&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18311">In [[mathematics]], the '''tangent space''' of a [[manifold]] facilitates the generalization of vectors from [[affine space]]s to general manifolds, since in the latter case one cannot simply subtract two points to obtain a vector that gives the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] of the one point from the other.

== Informal description ==

[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|thumb|A pictorial representation of the tangent space of a single point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; on a [[sphere]]. A vector in this tangent space represents a possible velocity at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. After moving in that direction to a nearby point, the velocity would then be given by a vector in the tangent space of that point—a different tangent space that is not shown.]]

In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; of a [[differentiable manifold]] a '''tangent space'''—a real [[vector space]] that intuitively contains the possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. The elements of the tangent space at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; are called the '''tangent vectors''' at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. This is a generalization of the notion of a [[bound vector]] in a [[Euclidean space]]. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of the tangent space at every point of a [[connected space|connected]] manifold is the same as that of the [[manifold]] itself.

For example, if the given manifold is a &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;-[[sphere]], then one can picture the tangent space at a point as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is [[perpendicular]] to the sphere's radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an [[embedding|embedded]] [[submanifold]] of [[Euclidean space]], then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional approach toward defining [[parallel transport]] and was used by Dirac.&lt;ref&gt;Dirac, ''General Theory of Relativity'' (1975), Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.

In [[algebraic geometry]], in contrast, there is an intrinsic definition of the '''tangent space at a point''' of an [[algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; that gives a vector space with dimension at least that of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; itself. The points &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; at which the dimension of the tangent space is exactly that of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; are called '''non-singular''' points; the others are called '''singular''' points. For example, a curve that crosses itself does not have a unique tangent line at that point. The singular points of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; are those where the ‘test to be a manifold’ fails. See [[Zariski tangent space]].

Once the tangent spaces of a manifold have been introduced, one can define [[vector field]]s, which are abstractions of the velocity field of particles moving in space. A vector field attaches to every point of the manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a vector field serves to define a generalized [[ordinary differential equation]] on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable [[curve]] on the manifold whose derivative at any point is equal to the tangent vector attached to that point by the vector field.

All the tangent spaces of a manifold may be ‘glued together’ to form a new differentiable manifold with twice the dimension of the original manifold, called the '''[[tangent bundle]]''' of the manifold.

== Formal definitions ==

The informal description above relies on a manifold's ability to be embedded into an ambient vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{m} &lt;/math&gt; so that the tangent vectors can ‘stick out’ of the manifold into the ambient space. However, it is more convenient to define the notion of a tangent space based solely on the manifold itself.&lt;ref name = "Isham2002"&gt;{{cite book|author = Chris J. Isham|title = Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists|date = 1 January 2002|publisher = Allied Publishers|isbn = 978-81-7764-316-9|pages = 70–72|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DCn9bjBe27oC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various equivalent ways of defining the tangent spaces of a manifold. While the definition via the velocity of curves is intuitively the simplest, it is also the most cumbersome to work with. More elegant and abstract approaches are described below.

=== Definition as the velocity of curves ===

In the embedded-manifold picture, a tangent vector at a point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is thought of as the '''velocity''' of a [[Curve#Topology|curve]] passing through the point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore define a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curves passing through &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; while being tangent to each other at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; C^{k} &lt;/math&gt; manifold (&lt;math&gt; k \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt;) and that &lt;math&gt; x \in M &lt;/math&gt;. Pick a [[chart (topology)|coordinate chart]] &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set|open subset]] of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. Suppose further that two curves &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}: (- 1,1) \to M &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; {\gamma_{1}}(0) = x = {\gamma_{2}}(0) &lt;/math&gt; are given such that both &lt;math&gt; \varphi \circ \gamma_{1},\varphi \circ \gamma_{2}: (- 1,1) \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; are differentiable in the ordinary sense (we call these '''differentiable curves initialized at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;'''). Then &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{2} &lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''equivalent''' at &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; if and only if the derivatives of &lt;math&gt; \varphi \circ \gamma_{1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \varphi \circ \gamma_{2} &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; coincide. This defines an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all differentiable curves initialized at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, and [[equivalence class]]es of such curves are known as ''tangent vectors'' of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. The equivalence class of any such curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \gamma'(0) &lt;/math&gt;. The '''tangent space''' of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt; T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt;, is then defined as the set of all tangent vectors at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;; it does not depend on the choice of coordinate chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Tangentialvektor.svg|thumb|left|200px|The tangent space &lt;math&gt; T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt; and a tangent vector &lt;math&gt; v \in T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt;, along a curve traveling through &lt;math&gt; x \in M &lt;/math&gt;.]]

To define vector-space operations on &lt;math&gt; T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt;, we use a chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; and define a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}: T_{x} M \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; {\mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}}(\gamma'(0)) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}{t}} [(\varphi \circ \gamma)(t)] \right|_{t = 0} &lt;/math&gt;. This map turns out to be [[bijective]] and may be used to transfer the vector-space operations on &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; over to &lt;math&gt; T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt;, thus turning the latter set into an &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real vector space. Again, one needs to check that this construction does not depend on the particular chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; being used, and in fact it does not.

=== Definition via derivations ===

Suppose now that &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; C^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; manifold. A real-valued function &lt;math&gt; f: M \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; is said to belong to &lt;math&gt; {C^{\infty}}(M) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every coordinate chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt; f \circ \varphi^{- 1}: \varphi[U] \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n} \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; is infinitely differentiable. Note that &lt;math&gt; {C^{\infty}}(M) &lt;/math&gt; is a real [[associative algebra]] with respect to the [[pointwise product]] and sum of functions and scalar multiplication.

Pick a point &lt;math&gt; x \in M &lt;/math&gt;. A '''[[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]''' at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is defined as a [[linear map]] &lt;math&gt; D: {C^{\infty}}(M) \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the Leibniz identity
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall f,g \in {C^{\infty}}(M): \qquad
D(f g) = D(f) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot D(g),
&lt;/math&gt;
which is modeled on the [[product rule]] of calculus.

If we define addition and scalar multiplication on the set of derivations at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; by
* &lt;math&gt; (D_{1} + D_{2})(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ {D_{1}}(f) + {D_{2}}(f) &lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt; (\lambda \cdot D)(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \lambda \cdot D(f) &lt;/math&gt;,
then we obtain a real vector space, which we define as the tangent space &lt;math&gt; T_{x} M &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

The relation between derivations at a point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and tangent vectors at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is as follows: If &lt;math&gt; \gamma: (- 1,1) \to M &lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable curve initialized at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, then the corresponding derivation &lt;math&gt; D_{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt; {D_{\gamma}}(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ (f \circ \gamma)'(0) &lt;/math&gt; (where the derivative is taken in the ordinary sense because &lt;math&gt; f \circ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt; (- 1,1) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt;).

Generalizations of this definition are possible, for instance, to [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]. However, instead of examining derivations &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; from the full algebra of functions, one must instead work at the level of [[germ (mathematics)|germs]] of functions. The reason for this is that the [[structure sheaf]] may not be [[injective sheaf#Fine sheaves|fine]] for such structures. For example, let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be an algebraic variety with [[structure sheaf]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O}_{X} &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[Zariski tangent space]] at a point &lt;math&gt; p \in X &lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{k} &lt;/math&gt;-derivations &lt;math&gt; D: \mathcal{O}_{X,p} \to \mathbb{k} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{k} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[ground field]] and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O}_{X,p} &lt;/math&gt; is the stalk of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O}_{X} &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Definition via cotangent spaces ===

Again, we start with a &lt;math&gt; C^\infty &lt;/math&gt; manifold &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt; x \in M &lt;/math&gt;. Consider the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; C^\infty(M) &lt;/math&gt; that consists of all smooth functions &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; vanishing at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I^2 &lt;/math&gt; are real vector spaces, and &lt;math&gt; T_x M &lt;/math&gt; may be defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt; I / I^2 &lt;/math&gt;. This latter quotient space is also known as the '''[[cotangent space]]''' of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

While this definition is the most abstract, it is also the one that is most easily transferable to other settings, for instance, to the [[algebraic variety|varieties]] considered in [[algebraic geometry]].

If &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is a derivation at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; D(f) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; f \in I^2 &lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a linear map &lt;math&gt; I / I^2 \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt; r: I / I^2 \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; is a linear map, then &lt;math&gt; D(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} ~ r\left((f - f(x)) + I^2\right) &lt;/math&gt; defines a derivation at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. This yields an equivalence between tangent spaces defined via derivations and tangent spaces defined via cotangent spaces.

== Properties ==

If &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; C^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; manifold in a natural manner (take coordinate charts to be [[Identity function|identity maps]] on open subsets of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;), and the tangent spaces are all naturally identified with &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Tangent vectors as directional derivatives ===

Another way to think about tangent vectors is as [[directional derivative]]s. Given a vector &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, one defines the corresponding directional derivative at a point &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall f \in {C^{\infty}}(\mathbb{R}^{n}): \qquad
  (D_{v} f)(x) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~
  \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}{t}} [f(x + t v)] \right|_{t = 0}
= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} v^{i} {\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{i}}}(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
This map is naturally a derivation at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, every derivation at a point in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is of this form. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vectors (thought of as tangent vectors at a point) and derivations at a point.

As tangent vectors to a general manifold at a point can be defined as derivations at that point, it is natural to think of them as directional derivatives. Specifically, if &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is a tangent vector to &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; (thought of as a derivation), then define the directional derivative &lt;math&gt; D_{v} &lt;/math&gt; in the direction &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall f \in {C^{\infty}}(M): \qquad
{D_{v}}(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ v(f).
&lt;/math&gt;
If we think of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; as the initial velocity of a differentiable curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; initialized at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; v = \gamma'(0) &lt;/math&gt;, then instead, define &lt;math&gt; D_{v} &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall f \in {C^{\infty}}(M): \qquad
{D_{v}}(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ (f \circ \gamma)'(0).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Basis of the tangent space at a point ===

For a &lt;math&gt; C^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; manifold &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, if a chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi = (x^{1},\ldots,x^{n}): U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is given with &lt;math&gt; p \in U &lt;/math&gt;, then one can define an ordered basis &lt;math&gt; \left( \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}} \right)_{p} \right)_{i = 1}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; T_{p} M &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall i \in \{ 1,\ldots,n \}, ~ \forall f \in {C^{\infty}}(M): \qquad
{\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}} \right)_{p}}(f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~
({\partial_{i}}(f \circ \varphi^{- 1}))(\varphi(p)).
&lt;/math&gt;
Then for every tangent vector &lt;math&gt; v \in T_{p} M &lt;/math&gt;, one has
:&lt;math&gt;
v = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} v(x^{i}) \cdot \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}} \right)_{p}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This formula therefore expresses &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of the basis tangent vectors &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}} \right)_{p} \in T_{p} M &lt;/math&gt; defined by the coordinate chart &lt;math&gt; \varphi: U \to \mathbf{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = An Introduction to Differential Geometry|first = Eugene|last = Lerman|page = 12|url = http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~lerman/518/f11/8-19-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The derivative of a map ===

{{main|Pushforward (differential)}}

Every smooth (or differentiable) map &lt;math&gt; \varphi: M \to N &lt;/math&gt; between smooth (or differentiable) manifolds induces natural [[linear map]]s between their corresponding tangent spaces:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}: T_{x} M \to T_{\varphi(x)} N.
&lt;/math&gt;
If the tangent space is defined via differentiable curves, then this map is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}}(\gamma'(0)) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ (\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0).
&lt;/math&gt;
If, instead, the tangent space is defined via derivations, then this map is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
[\mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}(X)](f) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ X(f \circ \varphi).
&lt;/math&gt;

The linear map &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x} &lt;/math&gt; is called variously the '''derivative''', '''total derivative''', '''differential''', or '''pushforward''' of &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. It is frequently expressed using a variety of other notations:
:&lt;math&gt;
D \varphi_{x}, \qquad (\varphi_{*})_{x}, \qquad \varphi'(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
In a sense, the derivative is the best linear approximation to &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. Note that when &lt;math&gt; N = \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt;, then the map &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}: T_{x} M \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; coincides with the usual notion of the [[Differential (calculus)|differential]] of the function &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;. In [[local coordinates]] the derivative of &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]].

An important result regarding the derivative map is the following:
:'''Theorem'''. If &lt;math&gt; \varphi: M \to N &lt;/math&gt; is a [[local diffeomorphism]] at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x}: T_{x} M \to T_{\varphi(x)} N &lt;/math&gt; is a linear [[isomorphism]]. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}{\varphi}_{x} &lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, then there is an [[open set|open neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; diffeomorphically onto its image.
This is a generalization of the [[inverse function theorem]] to maps between manifolds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3728">In [[mathematics]], '''Tate duality''' or '''Poitou–Tate duality''' is a duality theorem for [[Galois cohomology]] groups of modules over the [[Galois group]] of an [[algebraic number field]] or [[local field]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Tate|first=John|author-link=John Tate|year=1962}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Poitou|first=Georges|year=1967}}.

==Local Tate duality==

{{main|local Tate duality}}
For a ''p''-adic local field ''k'', local Tate duality says there is a perfect pairing of [[finite group|finite groups]]
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H^r(k,M)\times H^{2-r}(k,M')\rightarrow H^2(k,G_m)=\mathbb Q/ \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is a finite group scheme and ''M''&amp;prime; its dual Hom(''M'',''G&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'').
For a local field of characteristic ''p''&gt;0, the statement is similar, except that the pairing takes values in &lt;math&gt;H^2(k, \mu) = \bigcup_{p \nmid n} \frac 1 n \mathbb Z / \mathbb Z.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2000|loc=Theorem 7.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Tate duality==
For a [[global field]] ''k'', a similar statement holds true if &amp;mu; is replaced by the ''S''-idele class group, where ''S'' is a set of primes of ''k''. See {{harvtxt|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2000|loc=Theorem 8.4.4}}.

==Poitou–Tate duality==
Among other statements, Poitou–Tate duality establishes a perfect pairing between certain [[Shafarevich group]]s. Given a global field ''k'' and a set ''S'' of primes, and the maximal extension &lt;math&gt;k_S&lt;/math&gt; which is unramified outside ''S'', the Shafarevich groups capture, broadly speaking, those elements in the cohomology of &lt;math&gt;Gal(k_S/k)&lt;/math&gt; which vanish in the Galois cohomology of the local fields pertaining to the primes in ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2000|loc=Theorem 8.6.8}} for a precise statement.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extension to the case where the ring of ''S''-integers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_S&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by a regular scheme of finite type over &lt;math&gt;Spec \mathcal O_S&lt;/math&gt; was shown by {{harvtxt|Geisser|Schmidt|2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">In [[mathematics]], a [[bounded function]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] for which there exists a [[lower bound]] and an upper bound, in other words, a constant that is larger than the [[absolute value]] of any value of this function. If we consider a [[Family of curves|family]] of bounded functions, this constant can vary across functions in the family. If it is possible to find one constant that bounds all functions, this family of functions is '''uniformly bounded'''.

The [[uniform boundedness principle]] in [[functional analysis]] provides sufficient conditions for uniform boundedness of a family of operators.

== Definition ==

=== Real line and complex plane ===

Let 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F=\{f_i: X \to K, i \in I\}&lt;/math&gt; 
be a family of functions [[Index set|indexed]] by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary set and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s. We call &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; '''uniformly bounded''' if there exists a real number &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f_i(x)|\le M \qquad \forall i \in I \quad \forall x \in X.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Metric space ===

In general let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] with metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then the set
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F=\{f_i: X \to Y, i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; 
is called '''uniformly bounded''' if there exists an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(f_i(x), a) \leq M \qquad \forall i \in I \quad \forall x \in X.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* Every [[uniformly convergent]] sequence of bounded functions is uniformly bounded.
* The family of functions &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=\sin nx&lt;/math&gt; defined for [[real number|real]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; traveling through the [[integer]]s, is uniformly bounded by 1.
* The family of [[derivative]]s of the above family, &lt;math&gt;f'_n(x)=n\, \cos nx,&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' uniformly bounded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1815">'''Zsolt Baranyai''' (June 23, 1948 in [[Budapest]] &amp;ndash; April 6, 1978) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]], working in [[combinatorics]]. 

He graduated from the [[Fazekas Mihály Gimnázium (Budapest)|Fazekas Highschool]] where he was a classmate of [[László Lovász]], [[Miklós Laczkovich]], and [[Lajos Pósa (mathematician)|Lajos Pósa]]. Following this he learned mathematics at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] between 1967 and 1972. Afterwards he was a lecturer at the Analysis Department of the same university. He got his Ph.D. in 1975 and obtained the [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidate degree]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1978, posthumously. 

He did research in combinatorics; [[Baranyai's theorem]] on the decompositions of complete [[hypergraph]]s solved a long-standing open problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|2001}}. Chapter 38, "Baranya's theorem", pp. 536–541.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being a mathematician, Baranyai was a professional musician, who played the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. He died in a car accident after a concert, while touring Hungary with the Bakfark Consort.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Course in Combinatorics|first1=J. H.|last1=van Lint|first2=R.
