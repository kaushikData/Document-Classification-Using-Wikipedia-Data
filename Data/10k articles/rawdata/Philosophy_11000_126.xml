'''80,000 Hours''' is a San Francisco-based organisation that conducts research on the careers with positive social impact and provides career advice. It provides this advice online, through one-on-one advice sessions and through a community of like-minded individuals. The organisation is part of the '''Centre for Effective Altruism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, affiliated with the [[University of Oxford]] Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.&lt;ref name="80k-history" /&gt; The organisation's name refers to the typical amount of time someone spends working over a lifetime.&lt;ref name="80k-faq"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/faq | title = FAQ | accessdate = 29 October 2012 | publisher = 80,000 Hours | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121101064337/http://80000hours.org/faq | archivedate = 1 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}; {{cite web | url = http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3044777/Impact-investing-the-big-business-of-small-donors.html | title = Impact investing: the big business of small donors | accessdate = 31 October 2012 | publisher = Euromoney }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the nonprofits funded by startup accelerator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work?

== Principles ==
According to 80,000 Hours, some careers aimed at doing good are far more effective than others. On their framework for assessing different career options, the value of a career is regarded as depending on both its potential for impact and on the degree to which it gives the individual better opportunities to have an impact in the future.&lt;ref name="80k-about"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/research | title = Research | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | publisher = 80,000 Hours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group emphasises that the positive impact of choosing a certain occupation should be measured by the amount of additional good that is done as a result of this choice, not by the amount of good directly done.&lt;ref name="80k-counterfactuals"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1 | title = The replaceability effect: working in unethical industries part 1 | author = Sebastian Farquhar | accessdate = 31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect ways of making a difference, such as [[Earning to give|earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating]] a portion of it, as well as direct ways, such as scientific research. The moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] mentions the example of banking and finance as a potentially high impact career through such donations in his TED Talk, "The why and how of effective altruism," where he discusses the work of 80,000 Hours.&lt;ref name="peter-singer-TED-talk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html | title = The why and how of effective altruism | author = Peter Singer | accessdate = 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
80,000 Hours has promoted the idea that pursuing a high-earning career and donating a significant portion of the income to cost-effective charities can be an effective philanthropic strategy for some people. [[John Humphrys]] criticised this idea on the [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|BBC Today programme]], saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last = Crouch | first = William | last2 = Hislop | first2 = Ian | title= BBC News - Today - Do bankers make the world better? | subjectlink2 = Ian Hislop | others = [[John Humphrys]] |work=Today | date = 22 November 2011  | access-date = 29 October 2012 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9645000/9645137.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was also criticised in the ''Oxford Left Review'', where Pete Mills wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system.&lt;ref name="oxford-left"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Pete | title = The Ethical Careers Debate | journal = The Oxford Left Review | issue = 7 | pages = 4–9 | date = May 2012 | url=http://oxfordleftreview.com/2012/07/17/olr-issue/ | access-date = 6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that because the likelihood of bringing about social change is difficult to quantify, 80,000 Hours is biased toward quantifiable methods of doing good.

Over time 80,000 Hours has deemphasised 'earning to give', in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform, and begun recommending work on problems that are less easily quantified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/|title=80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give long term - 80,000 Hours|date=2015-07-06|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' has criticised the organisation for its [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] approach to altruism and has argued that cultivating altruism is not purely a matter of maximising one's positive social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | last = Brooks | first = David | title = How to Produce a Person | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html |date=4 June 2013 |page=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effective altruism]] movement, of which 80,000 Hours is a part, has been criticised by Ken Berger, the founder of [[Charity Navigator]] for its efforts to objectively compare and prioritise charitable causes, which he believes to be a subjective process that is the responsibility of individual donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism | journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review | url = http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill responded to this article justifying the need to figure out which charities do the most good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|title=What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism (SSIR)|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], the term '''anattā''' ([[Pali]]) or '''anātman''' ([[Sanskrit]]) refers to the doctrine of "non-self", that there is no unchanging, permanent self, [[soul]] or essence in living beings.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185046/http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta |date=2015-12-10 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=51 }}, Quote: "...anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality.

The Buddhist concept of Anattā or Anātman is one of the fundamental differences between Buddhism and [[Hinduism]], with the latter asserting that [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) exists.&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman&gt;[a] [http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185046/http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta |date=2015-12-10 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
''Anattā'' is a composite Pali word consisting of ''an'' (not, without) and ''attā'' (soul).&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the central Buddhist doctrine that "there is in humans no permanent, underlying substance that can be called the soul."&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt; It is one of the three characteristics of all existence, together with ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering, unsatisfactoriness) and ''[[anicca]]'' (impermanence).&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;

''Anattā'' is synonymous with ''Anātman'' (an + ātman) in Sanskrit Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt; In some Pali texts, ''ātman'' of Vedic texts is also referred to with the term ''Attan'', with the sense of soul.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt; An alternate use of ''Attan'' or ''Atta'' is "self, oneself, essence of a person", driven by the Vedic era Brahmanical belief that the soul is the permanent, unchangeable essence of a living being, or the true self.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124"&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst |title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn= 978-0-86171-566-4|pages=124–125 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism-related English literature, ''Anattā'' is rendered as "not-Self", but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]]; a more complete rendering is "non-Self" because from its earliest days, ''Anattā'' doctrine denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of ''Dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

== Anattā in early Buddhist texts ==
The concept of ''Anattā'' appears in numerous [[Sutra|Sutta]] of the ancient Buddhist [[Nikāya]] texts (Pali canon). It appears, for example, as a noun in ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' III.141, IV.49, V.345, in Sutta II.37 of ''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'', II.37–45 and II.80 of ''[[Patisambhidamagga]]'', III.406 of ''[[Dhammapada]]''. It also appears as an adjective, for example, in ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' III.114, III.133, IV.28 and IV.130–166, in Sutta III.66 and V.86 of ''[[Vinaya]]''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt;

The ancient Buddhist texts discuss ''Attā'' or ''Attan'' (soul, self), sometimes with alternate terms such as ''Atuman'', ''Tuma'', ''Puggala'', ''Jiva'', ''Satta'', ''Pana'' and ''Nama-rupa'', thereby providing the context for the Buddhist ''Anattā'' doctrine. Examples of such ''Attā'' contextual discussions are found in ''Digha Nikaya'' I.186-187, ''Samyutta Nikaya'' III.179 and IV.54, ''Vinaya'' I.14, ''Majjhima Nikaya'' I.138, III.19, and III.265–271 and ''Anguttara Nikaya'' I.284.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt;&lt;ref name=collins71&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title= Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual use of ''Attā'' in Nikāyas  is two sided. In one, it directly denies that there is anything called a self or soul in a human being that is a permanent essence of a human being, a theme found in Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=1–2, 34–40, 224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, states [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]], such as at ''Samyutta Nikaya'' IV.286, the Sutta considers the materialistic concept in pre-Buddhist Vedic times of "no afterlife, complete annihilation" at death to be a denial of Self, but still "tied up with belief in a Self".&lt;ref name=harveyp39&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Self exists" is a false premise, assert the early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=harveyp39 /&gt; However, adds Peter Harvey, these texts do not admit the premise "Self does not exist" either because the wording presumes the concept of "Self" prior to denying it; instead, the early Buddhist texts use the concept of ''Anattā'' as the implicit premise.&lt;ref name=harveyp39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steven Collins, the doctrine of anatta and "denial of self" in the canonical Buddhist texts is "insisted on only in certain theoretical contexts", while they use the terms ''atta, purisa, puggala'' quite naturally and freely in various contexts.&lt;ref name=collins71/&gt; The elaboration of the anatta doctrine, along with identification of the words such as "puggala" as "permanent subject or soul" appears in later Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name=collins71/&gt;

''Anattā'' is one of the main bedrock doctrines of Buddhism, and its discussion is found in the later texts of all Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23"&gt;{{cite book|author= Oliver Leaman|title= Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vK-GAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-68919-4 |pages=23–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] (~200 CE), extensively wrote about rejecting the metaphysical entity called ''attā'' or ''ātman'' (self, soul), asserting in chapter 18 of his ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' that there is no such substantial entity and that "Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nāgārjuna|author2=David J.

=== Existence and non-existence ===
''Anattā'' (no-self, without soul, no essence) is the nature of living beings, and this is one of the three marks of existence in Buddhism, along with ''Anicca'' (impermanence, nothing lasts) and ''Dukkha'' (suffering, unsatisfactoriness is innate in birth, aging, death, rebirth, redeath – the [[Saṃsāra]] cycle of existence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

=== Eternalism and annihilationism ===
While the concept of soul in Hinduism (as atman) and [[Jainism]] (as [[jiva]]) is taken for granted, which is different from the Buddhist concept of no-soul, each of the three religions believed in rebirth and emphasized moral responsibility in different ways in contrast to pre-Buddhist materialistic schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=danielkeownucchedavada /&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

=== Karma, rebirth and anattā ===
{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
The Buddha emphasized both karma and anatta doctrines.&lt;ref name="Selves"&gt;"Selves &amp; Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204143026/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha criticized the doctrine that posited an unchanging soul as a subject as the basis of rebirth and karmic moral responsibility, which he called "atthikavāda". He also criticized the materialistic doctrine that denied the existence of both soul and rebirth, and thereby denied karmic moral responsibility, which he calls "natthikavāda".&lt;ref name="Causality 1975, page 44"&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Buddha asserted that there is no soul, but there is rebirth for which karmic moral responsibility is a must. In the Buddha's framework of karma, right view and right actions are necessary for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm B.

=== Developing the self ===
{{Main|Buddhist Paths to liberation|Personal identity#Theories}}

According to [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]], while the ''Suttas'' criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self as baseless, they see an enlightened being as one whose empirical self is highly developed.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is paradoxical, states Harvey, in that "the Self-like ''nibbana'' state" is a mature self that knows "everything as Selfless".&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt; The "empirical self" is the ''citta'' (mind/heart, mindset, emotional nature), and the development of self in the Suttas is the development of this ''citta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ| year=1995| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One with "great self", state the early Buddhist ''Suttas'', has a mind which is neither at the mercy of outside stimuli nor its own moods, neither scattered nor diffused, but imbued with self-control, and self-contained towards the single goal of ''nibbana'' and a 'Self-like' state.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt; This "great self" is not yet an ''Arahat'', because he still does small evil action which leads to karmic fruition, but he has enough virtue that he does not experience this fruition in hell.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt;

An ''Arahat'', states Harvey, has a fully enlightened state of empirical self, one that lacks the "sense of both 'I am' and 'this I am'", which are illusions that the ''Arahat'' has transcended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=31–32, 44, 50–51, 71, 210–216, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist thought and salvation theory emphasizes a development of self towards a Selfless state not only with respect to oneself, but recognizing the lack of relational essence and Self in others, wherein states Martijn van Zomeren, "self is an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Martijn van Zomeren| title=From Self to Social Relationships: An Essentially Relational Perspective on Social Motivation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXkZDAAAQBAJ| year=2016| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-1-107-09379-9| page=156}}, '''Quote:''' Buddhism is an example of a non-theistic religion, which underlies a cultural matrix in which individuals believe that the self is an illusion. Indeed, its anatta doctrine states that the self is not an essence.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatman in Theravada Buddhism ==
[[Theravada Buddhism]] scholars, states [[Oliver Leaman]], consider the ''Anattā'' doctrine as one of the main theses of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23" /&gt;

The Buddhist denial of "any Soul or Self" is what distinguishes Buddhism from major religions of the world such as Christianity and Hinduism, giving it uniqueness, asserts the Theravada tradition.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23" /&gt; With the doctrine of  ''Anattā'', stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure, asserts [[Nyanatiloka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Collins," insight into the teaching of anatta is held to have two major loci in the intellectual and spiritual education of an individual" as s/he progresses along [[Noble Eightfold Path|the Path]].&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; The first part of this insight is to avoid ''sakkayaditthi'' (Personality Belief), that is converting the "sense of I which is gained from introspection and the fact of physical individuality" into a theoretical belief in a self.&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; 'A belief in a (really) existing body' is considered a false belief and a part of the Ten Fetters that must be gradually lost. The second loci is the psychological realisation of anatta, or loss of 'pride or conceit'. This, states Collins, is explained as the conceit of ''asmimana'' or 'I am'; (...) what this 'conceit' refers to is the fact that for the unenlightened man, all experience and action must necessarily appear phenomenologically as happening to or originating from an 'I'.&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; When a Buddhist gets more enlightened, this happening to or originating in an 'I' or sakkdyaditthi is less.

The Theravada tradition has long considered the understanding and application of the ''Anatta'' doctrine to a complex teaching, whose "personal, introjected application has always been thought to be possible only for the specialist, the practising monk". The tradition, states Collins, has "insisted fiercely on anatta as a doctrinal position", while in practice it may not play much of a role in the daily religious life of most Buddhists.&lt;ref name=stevecollins95&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suttas present the doctrine in three forms. First, they apply the "no-self, no-identity" doctrine to all phenomena as well as any and all objects, yielding the idea that "all things are not-self" (''sabbe dhamma anatta'').&lt;ref name=stevecollins95 /&gt; Second, states Collins, the Suttas apply the doctrine to deny self of any person, treating conceit to be evident in any assertion of "this is mine, this I am, this is myself" (''etam mamam eso 'ham asmi, eso me atta ti'').&lt;ref name=stevecollins96&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the Theravada texts apply the doctrine as a nominal reference, to identify examples of "self" and "not-self", respectively the Wrong view and the Right view; this third case of nominative usage is properly translated as "self" (as an identity) and is unrelated to "soul", states Collins.&lt;ref name=stevecollins96 /&gt; The first two usages incorporate the idea of soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=3–5, 35–36, 109–116, 163, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada doctrine of ''Anatta'', or not-self not-soul, inspire meditative practices for monks, states Donald Swearer, but for the lay Theravada Buddhists in Southeast Asia, the doctrines of ''[[Karma|kamma]]'', [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and ''punna'' (merit) inspire a wide range of ritual practices and ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

The ''Anatta'' doctrine is key to the concept of [[nirvana]] (nibbana) in the Theravada tradition. The liberated nirvana state, states Collins, is the state of ''Anatta'', a state that is neither universally applicable nor can be explained, but can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|This is a major difference between the Theravada Buddhists and different Hindu traditions which assert that nirvana is realizing and being in the state of self (soul, atman) and is universally applicable.

=== Current disputes ===
{{See also|Buddhism in Thailand}}
The dispute about "self" and "not-self" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Potprecha Cholvijarn|title=Nibbāna as True Reality beyond the Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkXJVKnjw3kC|publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh|isbn=978-974-350-263-7|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible, states [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], that "original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25 /&gt; This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as "the principal means to achieving liberation".&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], some modern era Buddhist scholars have claimed that "nirvana is indeed the true Self", while other Thai Buddhists disagree.{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}} For instance, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta]], or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in the 1994 by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven. Payutto]], a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram|Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram]], argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a "true self".{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} Similar interpretations on the "true self" were put forth earlier by the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the ''[[tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}}

Several notable teachers of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. [[Ajahn Maha Bua]], a well known meditation master, described the [[Citta|citta (mind)]] as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under ''anattā.''&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073822/http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }} (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=UWE STOES|title=Thanassaro Bhikkhu|date=2015-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S40nS_0R9Y&amp;t=4545s|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; American monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth.&lt;ref name="Selves" /&gt; Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually ''prevent'' enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|title="There is no self."|last=Bhikkhu|first=Thanissaro|work=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819114904/https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|archive-date=2018-08-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates do not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a "not-self" teaching rather than a "no-self" teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Alexander|date=2009|title=Early Evidence for the ‘no self’ doctrine?|url=http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|journal=Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|volume=|pages=63–64|access-date=2017-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602145336/http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatman in Mahayana Buddhism ==
{{Main|Madhyamaka}} {{see also|sunyata}}
There are many different views of Anatta ({{zh|c=無我|p=wúwǒ}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 無我 ''muga'') within various Mahayana schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard E. King|King, R.]], ''Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gaudapadiya-Karika'' ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press]], 1995), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 97] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101164333/https://books.google.cz/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2016-11-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagarjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka (middle way) school of Mahayana Buddhism, analyzed [[dharma]] first as factors of experience.&lt;ref name=kalupahana56 /&gt; He, states David Kalupahana, analyzed how these experiences relate to "bondage and freedom, action and consequence", and thereafter analyzed the notion of personal self (''attā'', ''ātman'').&lt;ref name=kalupahana56&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nāgārjuna|author2=David J.

Nagarjuna asserted that the notion of a self is associated with the notion of one's own identity and corollary ideas of pride, selfishness and a sense of psychophysical personality.&lt;ref name=kalupahana57 /&gt; This is all false, and leads to bondage in his Madhyamaka thought.

The early Mahayana Buddhism texts link their discussion of "emptiness" (''shunyata'') to ''Anatta'' and ''Nirvana''. They do so, states Mun-Keat Choong, in three ways: first, in the common sense of a monk's meditative state of emptiness; second, with the main sense of ''Anatta'' or 'everything in the world is empty of self'; third, with the ultimate sense of ''Nirvana'' or realization of emptiness and thus an end to rebirth cycles of suffering.&lt;ref name="Choong1999p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun-Keat Choong|title=The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJafx7uO0VsC| year=1999| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-1649-7| pages=1–4, 85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anatta doctrine is another aspect of ''shunyata'', its realization is the nature of the ''nirvana'' state and to an end to rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ray Billington|title= Understanding Eastern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=58–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy|title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8 |pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Stephan Schuhmacher|title= The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC| year =1994|publisher= Shambhala|isbn =978-0-87773-980-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the [[Buddha-nature]] discussed in these sutras does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language and expression of [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness" and represents the potentiality to realize [[Buddhahood]] through Buddhist practices.&lt;ref name=paulwilliamsp111 /&gt; Other scholars do in fact detect leanings towards [[monism]] in these tathagatagarbha references.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hubbard, ''Absolute Delusion, Perfect Buddhahood'', University of Hawai’i Press, Honolulu, 2001, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Zimmermann sees the notion of an unperishing and eternal self in the [[Tathagatagarbha Sutra]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, Michael (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023508/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/BPPB/pdf/BPPB-06.pdf  ''A Buddha Within: The Tathāgatagarbhasūtra''], Biblotheca Philologica et Philosophica Buddhica VI, The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology, Soka University, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmermann also avers that 'the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Zimmermann, A Buddha Within, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He further indicates that there is no evident interest found in this sutra in the idea of Emptiness (''sunyata'').&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, ''A Buddha Within'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Williams states that the "Self" in ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' is actually "non-Self", and neither identical nor comparable to the Hindu concepts of Brahman and Self.&lt;ref name=paulwilliamsp111 /&gt;

The Anatta or Anatman doctrine is extensively discussed in and partly inspires the ritual practices of the Vajrayana tradition. The Tibetan terms such as ''bdag med'' refer to "without a self, insubstantial, anatman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garab Dorje|title=The Golden Letters: The Three Statements of Garab Dorje, the First Teacher of Dzogchen, Together with a Commentary by|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_QKAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-1-55939-050-7|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; These discussions, states Jeffrey Hopkins, assert the "non-existence of a permanent, unitary and independent self", and attribute these ideas to the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Jeffrey Hopkins|title=Absorption in No External World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHqKPG77bd0C  |year=2006|publisher=Snow Lion Publications |isbn=978-1-55939-946-3 |pages=400–405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatta – a difference between Buddhism and Hinduism ==
Anatta is a central doctrine of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elliot Turiel|title=The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXVRvW65nLQC&amp;pg=PA234 |year =2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43266-5|page=234}}, Quote: "A central doctrine of Theravada Buddhism is Anatta, [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nyanatiloka Thera|title=Buddhist Dictionary: Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztIxd_OGs3YC |year=2004|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=978-955-24-0019-3|page=15}}, Quote: "anatta [...] This is the central doctrine of Buddhism, without understanding which a real knowledge of Buddhism is altogether impossible.";&lt;br&gt;For the development of anatta concept to the key doctrine of sunyata in Mahayana: {{cite book|author=Kenneth Fleming|title=Asian Christian theologians in dialogue with Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9oPAQAAIAAJ |year=2002|publisher=P.

This last is the doctrine which most clearly distinguished the teaching of the Buddha from other contemporary schools of thought, and especially from Upanisadic thought, in which the affirmation of the soul or self (Sanskrit: atman; Pali: atta) within the human individual and its identification with the world-soul, or brahman, was the central doctrine. [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; It marks one of the major differences between Buddhism and Hinduism. According to the anatta doctrine of Buddhism, at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is no "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-2240-6}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the "self, soul" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person, amongst other things, realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions within Hinduism believe in [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. The pre-Buddhist [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism assert that there is a permanent ''Atman'', and is an ultimate metaphysical reality.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=34, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ling1969p86"/&gt; This sense of self, is expressed as "I am" in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1, states Peter Harvey, when nothing existed before the start of the universe.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; The Upanishadic scriptures hold that this soul or self is underlying the whole world.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; At the core of all human beings and living creatures, assert the Hindu traditions, there is "eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman."&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt; Within the diverse [[Hindu philosophy|schools of Hinduism]], there are differences of perspective on whether souls are distinct, whether Supreme Soul or God exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, and how to reach [[moksha]]. However, despite their internal differences, one shared foundational premise of Hinduism is that "soul, self exists", and that there is bliss in seeking this self, knowing self, and self-realization.&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengaku Mayeda (2000), Sankara and Buddhism, in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedānta (Editors: Richard V. De Smet, Bradley J. Malkovsky), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004116665}}, pages 18-29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
While the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' recognized many things as being not-Self, they felt that a real, true Self could be found. They held that when it was found, and known to be identical to Brahman, the basis of everything, this would bring liberation. In the Buddhist ''[[Buddhist texts|Suttas]]'', though, literally everything is seen is non-Self, even [[Nirvana]]. When this is known, then liberation – ''Nirvana'' – is attained by total non-attachment. Thus both the ''Upanishads'' and the Buddhist ''Suttas'' see many things as not-Self, but the Suttas apply it, indeed non-Self, to ''everything''.

Both Buddhism and Hinduism distinguish ego-related "I am, this is mine", from their respective abstract doctrines of "Anatta" and "Atman".&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; This, states Peter Harvey, may have been an influence of Buddhism on Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|page=34}}, '''Quote:''' "The post-Buddhist Matri Upanishad holds that only defiled individual self, rather than the universal one, thinks 'this is I' or 'this is mine'. This is very reminiscent of Buddhism, and may well have been influenced by it to divorce the universal Self from such egocentric associations".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatman and Niratman===
The term ''niratman'' appears in the ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'' of Hinduism, such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. ''Niratman'' literally means "selfless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title= Sixty Upanishads of the Veda| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|authorlink=Paul Deussen|year=1980|page=361|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1992p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E.

In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as ''niratman'' and ''sarvasyatman'' (the self of all) – are used in ''Maitrayaniya Upanishad'' to explain the nondual concept of the "highest Self".&lt;ref name="Wood1992p67"/&gt; According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the ''niratman'' state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual soul, and reaching the awareness of universal soul or the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title= Sixty Upanishads of the Veda| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|authorlink=Paul Deussen|year=1980|pages=358-359 introductory note, 361 with footnote 1, 380|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoine Le Grand''' (1629 in [[Douai]]{{spaced ndash}}1699 in [[London]]) was a French [[Recollect]] and [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] philosopher.

==Life==
Born in [[Douai]], [[Spanish Netherlands]], he was attached at an early age to the English community of St. Bonaventure's convent there, and became a Franciscan Recollect friar, and taught philosophy and divinity. Sent on the English mission, he resided for many years in [[Oxfordshire]], and in 1695 he was tutor in the family of Henry Fermor of [[Tusmore, Oxfordshire|Tusmore]]. His advocacy of Cartesianism met with strong resistance from [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]], who would become [[bishop of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;s.v. 'Le Grand, Antoine' in the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the close of his life he engaged in sharp controversies on metaphysical topics with [[John Sergeant (priest)|John Sergeant]], a secular priest. At the twenty-third chapter of his order, assembled in London on 9 July 1693, he was elected provincial, and he held that office till his death on 9 August 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Vere Claiborne Chappell| title = Cartesian philosophers| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4zHlAAAAMAAJ| year = 1992| publisher = Garland| isbn = 978-0-8153-0577-4| page = 309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived a studious and retired life. He is noted for the effort he made to render the approach of Descartes more apparently [[school|scholastic]], to improve its reception with traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legrand/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheism]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|निरीश्वरवाद}},  {{IAST|''nir-īśvara-vāda''}}, lit. "statement of no [[Ishvara|Lord]]", "doctrine of godlessness") or disbelief in [[Deity|God or gods]] has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] streams of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-05-22/edit-page/28331091_1_god-acceptance-shankara |title = The Speaking Tree – The Atheistic Roots of Hindu Philosophy|work = [[The Times of India]]|date = 22 May 2004|last = Daga|first = Mahesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian philosophy]], three schools of thought are commonly referred to as ''nastika'' for rejecting the doctrine of Vedas: [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Cārvāka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3215570/The-tradition-atheism-India-goes-2-000-years-m-proud-that.html|title=The tradition of atheism in India goes back 2,000 years.

Hinduism is a religion, but also a philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Make-space-for-true-values-of-Hinduism/articleshow/46972987.cms|title=Make space for true values of Hinduism|date = 19 April 2015|work = Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. ix, ''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning'' By Eva Rudy Jansen&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and [[Mimamsa]] while not rejecting either [[the Vedas]] or the [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyo.in/lifestyle/atheism-schools-indian-philosophy-jainism-buddhism-materialism-religion-vedas/story/1/5904.html|title=Why Indian philosophy is incomplete without atheism|work = Daily O|date= 27 August 2015|author = Hari Ravikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically reject a personal God, creator God, or a God with attributes. While Samkhya and Yoga rejected the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God, Mimamsa argued that the Vedas could not have been authored by a deity.

Though some schools of thought view the path of the atheist as difficult to follow in matters of [[spirituality]], it is still a valid one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chakravarti |first=Sitansu |title=Hinduism, a way of life |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=978-81-208-0899-7 |quote=According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is a very difficult one to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' ("pious, orthodox") refers to the systems of thought which admit the validity of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Pruthi"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pruthi| title = Vedic civilization – Culture and civilization series| publisher = Discovery Publishing House| year = 2004| page = 214| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C&amp;pg=PA214| isbn = 978-81-7141-875-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit ''{{IAST|asti}}'' means "there is", and ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' (per [[Pāṇini]] 4.2.60) derives from the verb, meaning "one who says ''{{IAST|'asti'}}''". Technically, in [[Hindu philosophy]] the term {{IAST|[[Astika and Nastika|Āstika]]}} refers only to acceptance of authority of Vedas, not belief in the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kapoor| first = Subodh| title = The Systems of Indian Philosophy| publisher = Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd| page = 6| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA6| isbn = 978-81-7755-887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though not accepted universally, ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' is sometimes translated as "theist" and ''{{IAST|Nāstika}}'' as "[[atheist]]", assuming the rejection of Vedas to be synonymous to the rejection of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Monier-Williams|first1=Monier|last2=Leumann|first2=Ernst|last3=Cappeller|first3=Carl|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymological And Philologically Arranged With Special Reference To Cognate Indo-european Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUKaou4KcMC&amp;pg=PA161|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0369-1|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation by [[Swami Vivekananda]] states "As certain religions of the world say that a man who does not believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, a man who does not believe in himself is an atheist. Not believing in the glory of our own soul is what the Vedanta calls atheism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advaitaashrama.org/cw/volume_2/practical_vedanta_and_other_lectures/practical_vedanta_part_i.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The [[Rig Veda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]], deals with significant skepticism around the fundamental question of a creator God and the creation of the universe. It does not, at many instances, categorically accept the existence of a creator God. [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (''Creation   Hymn'') in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=World  scriptures: an   introduction to comparative religions| first=Kramer|   last=Kenneth| isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Subodh Varma | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/vintage-wisdom/28377203_1_vedas-philosophy-speculation |title=The gods came afterwards |publisher=  [[Times of India]] |date= May 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation? &lt;br/&gt;The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.}}
The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]], [[Isha Upanishad|Isha]], [[Mundaka Upanishad|Mundaka]] (in which [[Brahman]] is everything and "no-thing") and especially the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]s have also been interpreted as atheistic because of their stress on the subjective self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bhatt| first = Chetan| title = Liberation and purity: race, new religious movements and the ethics of postmodernity| publisher = [[Routledge]]| year = 1997| page = 160| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VukJs0ik0rUC&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-1-85728-424-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mimamsa]] was a [[Philosophical realism|realistic]], pluralistic school of philosophy which was concerned with the [[exegesis]] of the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"&gt;{{citation|last=Vitsaxis|first=Vassilis|title=Thought and Faith: The concept of divinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52b-A2l7QbwC&amp;pg=PA517|year=2009|publisher=Somerset Hall Press|isbn=978-1-935244-05-9|pages=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core text of the school was the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (c. 200 BCE–200 CE). Mimamsa philosophers believed that the [[revelation]] of the Vedas was sacred, authorless (''[[apaurusheyatva]]'') and infallible, and that it was essential to preserve the sanctity of the Vedic ritual to maintain dharma (cosmic order).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{citation|last=King|first=Richard|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uca8R72W8iQC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0954-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}} As a consequence of the belief in sanctity of the ritual, Mimamsas rejected the notion of God in any form.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"/&gt; Later commentators of the Mimamsa sutras such as [[Prabhākara]] (c. 7th century CE) advanced arguments against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bales|first=Eugene F.|title=A Ready Reference to Philosophy East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34cjS0M1rFIC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1987|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-6640-1|page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Warder|first=Anthony Kennedy|title=A Course In Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zw1UD1Mj9DwC&amp;pg=PA187|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1244-4|page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Mimamsa not only did not accept God but said that human action itself was enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] |author2 = Poolla Tirupati Raju | title = The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy| publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin| year = 1960| page = 305| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uLsAAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the [[Samkhyakarika]] (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;{{rp|63}} The Samkhyakarika is silent on the issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.&lt;ref name = nicholson&gt;{{cite book|last = Nicholson|first = Andrew J.|chapter = Hindu Disproofs of God: Refuting Vedāntic Theism in the Sāṃkhya Sūtra|title =  Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy|date = 2016|chapter-url = http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199314621-e-29|chapter-url-access = subscription|editor-first = Jonardon|editor-last = Ganeri |doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.013.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cārvāka]], a materialistic and atheistic school of Indian philosophy, had developed a systematic philosophy by the 6th century CE. Cārvākas rejected metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], the [[afterlife]], an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate, and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Cārvākas also refused to ascribe supernatural causes to natural phenomena. Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna.

[[Ājīvika]]s was a movement (extinct from at least the 13th century CE) whose founder, [[Makkhali Gosala]], was a contemporary of Mahavira and [[Gautama Buddha]] (the central figures of Jainism and Buddhism, respectively). Gosala and his followers also denied the existence of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=History and Doctrines of the {{IAST|Ājīvikas}}: A Vanished Indian Religion|last = Balsham| first = B.L.|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BiGQzc5lRGYC&amp;| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| year = 2003| isbn = 81-208-1204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against God ==
Mimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the [[Veda]]s or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further thought that the Gods named in the [[Veda]]s had no physical existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Cowell|first1=E. B.|last2=Gough|first2=A. E.|title=The Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha or Review of the Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy: Trubner's Oriental Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkrCRbOq-HUC|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-24517-3 |pages=189–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;
* If the existence of [[Karma (Hinduism)|karma]] is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of [[prakriti]] and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the [[Vedas]], according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.
Therefore, Samkhya maintained not only that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God, but that God as normally understood--an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent creator who is free from suffering--cannot exist.

The Indian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize-winner]] [[Amartya Sen]], in an interview with Pranab Bardhan for the ''California Magazine'' published in the July–August 2006 edition by the [[University of California, Berkeley]] states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/july-august-2006-indo-chic/arguing-indian "The Arguing Indian" California Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented. That gave a leg up to the religious interpretation of India, despite the fact that [[Sanskrit]] had a larger atheistic literature than what exists in any other classical language. [[Vidyaranya|Madhava Acharya]], the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called Sarvadarshansamgraha, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure. The first chapter is "Atheism"&amp;nbsp;– a very strong presentation of the argument in favor of atheism and materialism.}}

According to [[Markandey Katju]], former Chairman of the [[Press Council of India]] and former judge of the [[Supreme Court of India]], "...there are six classical systems of Indian philosophy, Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Sankya, Yoga, Purva Mimansa and Uttar Mimansa, and three non-classical systems, Buddhism, Jainism and Charvak. Out of these nine systems eight of them are atheistic as there is no place for God in them. Only the ninth one, that is Uttar Mimansa, which is also called Vedanta, has a place for God in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justicekatju.blogspot.com/2012/02/what-is-india.html |title=What is India?

[[File:Centum octoginta tres disputationes BEIC3 V00008 F0005.tif|thumbnail|Centum octoginta tres disputationes]]
'''Benedict Pereira''' (also ''Pereyra'', ''Benet Perera'', ''Benet Pererius'') (March 4, 1536 – 6 March 1610) was a Spanish [[Jesuit]] philosopher, theologian, and [[Exegesis|exegete]].

==Life==
Pereira was born at [[Ruzafa]], near [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], in Spain.  He entered the Society of Jesus in 1552 and taught successively literature, philosophy, theology, and sacred scripture in Rome, where he died.

==Works==

He published eight works, and left a vast deal of manuscript. ([[Sommervogel]], infra, mentions twelve sets.)

His main philosophical work is ''De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibus libri quindecim'' (Rome, 1576).

The main difficulties of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' are met in ''Commentariorum et disputationum in Genesim tomi quattuor'' (Rome, 1591–1599). This is a mine of information in regard to the Deluge, [[Noah's Ark]], the [[Tower of Babel]], etc.,  and was highly rated by [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] (''Histoire critique du Vieux Testament'', III, xii).

The "Commentariorum in Danielem prophetam libri sexdecim" (Rome, 1587) are much less diffuse. Other writings 
published by Pereira were five volumes of exegetical dissertations on: "Exodus", 137 dissertations (Ingolstadt, 1601); "The Epistle to the Romans", 188 dissertations (Ingolstadt, 1603); "The Apocalypse", 183 dissertations (Lyons, 1606); "The Gospel of St. John", 214 dissertations on the first nine chapters (Lyons, 1608); 144 dissertations on five following chapters (Lyons, 1610). To the fourth volume of the dissertations is appended a work of twenty-three dissertations to show that Mohammed was not the [[Antichrist]], of the Apocalypse and of Daniel.
==Debate against Clavius==
Pereira was an outspoken opponent of [[Christopher Clavius]] at the [[Collegio Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The debate concerned the nature of mathematics. Pereira argued that mathematical demonstrations point to complex relations between numbers, lines, figures, etc., but lack the logical force of a demonstration from true causes or the essence of things.  Furthermore, mathematics does not have a true subject matter; it merely draws connections between different properties (Alexander, p. 69). Clavius responded in "Prolegomena" that the subject of mathematics is matter itself, since all mathematics is "immersed" in matter. The debate had broad ramifications with regard to inclusion of mathematics as a basic subject in the Jesuit curriculum.

'''Biblical courtship''', also known as '''Christian courtship''' is a conservative Christian alternative to [[dating (activity)|dating]]. It is a response to secular dating culture within various [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] communities, c. 1985 to present{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Motivated by concern for the need of Christian values in contrast to secular dating practices, conservative Christians identified what they saw as key Biblical principles for courtship and romance, and began to disseminate them in the 1980s.

The movement gained widespread exposure{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} following the best-selling response to ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'', a popular contemporary treatment of Christian courtship by homeschool student [[Joshua Harris (pastor)|Joshua Harris]]. Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis has developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s.  Proponents of the courtship movement say that it is identified by Biblical principles, rather than particular methods or behavioral practices.  These principles have been summarized in [[Leave Dating Behind: a Road Map to Marriage]] by Christina Rogers within the acronym '''CARE''':
*Commitment to marriage
*Accountability 
*Rejection of the secular dating philosophy
*Establishing physical boundaries (Song of Songs 2:7&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+solomon+2%3A7&amp;version=NASB|title=Song of solomon 23A7 NASB - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A more detailed list of courting ideals include:
* The guardianship responsibility of fathers over [[single (relationship)|single]] daughters.
* The responsibility of parents to prepare their children for marriage in all respects, and for youths to be prepared in terms of talents, education, vocation and finances prior to seeking a courtship relationship.
* The mentoring role of parents or other suitable "accountability couples" in a given courtship.
* Supervision of courtships to mitigate temptations or abuse, whether of a sexual, emotional or financial nature.
* Emphasis of the importance of marriage as an opportunity for Christian service rather than a selfish endeavor.
* Emphasis of the importance of singleness before marriage as a time for greater Christian service in the community, rather than a time to be employed in selfish pursuits.
* Emphasis of the importance of counsel and evaluation by family and friends as a relationship progresses. (Song of Songs 1:4&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+solomon+1%3A4&amp;version=NASB|title=Song of solomon 13A4 NASB - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Emphasis of the importance of honesty and getting to know one another as real people in "normal life" during courtship (as contrasted with the dating habit of meeting during special events and entertainment while on one's best behavior.)
* The maintenance of sexual [[Virgin|purity]].

'''Black anarchism''' is a loose term sometimes applied in the United States to group together a number of people of African descent who identify with anarchism. They include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin]], [[Kuwasi Balagoon]], Kai Lumumba Barrow, Greg Jackson, and [[Martin Sostre]]. Critics of the term suggest that it elides major political differences between these individuals, incorrectly presenting these individuals as having a shared theory or movement, while imposing a label that these individuals do not (or did not) all accept. 

The individuals to whom the label has been applied all oppose the existence of the [[Sovereign state|State]], the subjugation and domination of black people, and other groups, and favor a non-hierarchical organization of society. In general, these individuals argue for [[class struggle]] while stressing the importance of ending racial and national oppression, opposing [[white supremacy]], [[patriarchy]], [[capitalism]], and the state. They have generally rejected narrow or vulgar forms of "anarchism" that ignore issues of race and national oppression, a deformed "white, petty-bourgeois Anarchism that cannot relate to the people" and that refuses to deal with issues of race saying "No, don't talk about racism unless it is in that very abstract sense of we-are-all-equal-let's-sing-kumbayas-and-pretend-the-color-of-our-skin-does-not-matter" anti-racism.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Ribeiro|''Reflections on APOC and the fate of Black Anarchism''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ashanti Alston (who has explicitly used the term "Black Anarchism") also argued that: 
Black culture has always been oppositional and is all about finding ways to creatively resist oppression here, in the most racist country in the world [the United States]. So, when I speak of a Black anarchism, it is not so tied to the color of my skin but who I am as a person, as someone who can resist, who can see differently when I am stuck, and thus live differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarchistpanther.net/node/17 "Black Anarchism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085929/http://www.anarchistpanther.net/node/17 |date=March 13, 2008 }} ''Anarchist Panther''&lt;/ref&gt;

He added that, as an anarchist, he viewed black nationalism as progressive yet also as deeply limited: "Panther anarchism is ready, willing and able to challenge old nationalist and revolutionary notions that have been accepted as ‘common-sense.’ It also challenges the bullshit in our lives and in the so-called movement that holds us back from building a genuine movement based on the enjoyment of life, diversity, practical self-determination and multi-faceted resistance to the Babylonian Pigocracy. This Pigocracy is in our ‘heads,’ our relationships as well as in the institutions that have a vested interest in our eternal domination.&lt;ref&gt;''@narchist Panther Zine'', October 1999, Edition 1, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''charisma''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|z|m|ə}}; pl. ''charismata'', adj. ''charismatic'') has two senses:&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

# a divinely conferred power or talent

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the term has become widely{{quantify|date=July 2017}} used, with varying meanings, in religion, the [[Social science|social sciences]], the [[biological sciences]], the media, and throughout Western societies.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Since the advent of [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] in 1974, the word charisma has also been used as an attribute in gaming, where it designates a character's likeability and their ability to persuade.

==Etymology==
The English term ''charisma'' is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} (''khárisma''), which means "favor freely given" or "gift of grace".&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; The term and its plural {{lang|grc|χαρίσματα}} (''charismata'') derive from {{lang|grc|χάρις}} (''charis''), which means "grace". Some derivatives from that root (including "grace") have similar meanings to the modern sense of ''personality charisma'', such as "filled with attractiveness or charm", "kindness", "to bestow a favor or service", or "to be favored or blessed".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"charisma" in ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' second edition. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, Robert. ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek''. Brill, 2010, p. 1607.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Koine Greek|ancient Greek dialect]] widely used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] employed these terms without the connotations found in modern religious usage.&lt;ref name=Ebertz&gt;Ebertz, Michael N. "Charisma" in ''Religion Past &amp; Present.'' edited by Hans Dieter Betz, et al., Brill, 2007, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek]]s applied personality charisma to their [[Greek mythology|gods]]; for example, attributing charm, beauty, nature, human creativity or fertility to goddesses they called ''[[Charites]]'' ({{lang|grc|Χάριτες}}).

Theologians and social scientists have expanded and modified the original Greek meaning into the two distinct senses above. For ease of reference, we will call the first sense ''personality charisma'' and the second ''divinely conferred charisma''.

The meaning of ''charisma'' has become greatly diffused from its original ''divinely conferred'' meaning, and even from the ''personality charisma'' meaning in modern English dictionaries, which reduces to a mixture of charm and status. John Potts, who has extensively analyzed the term's history, sums up meanings beneath this diffused common usage:&lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary charisma maintains, however, the irreducible character ascribed to it by Weber: it retains a mysterious, elusive quality. Media commentators regularly describe charisma as the "X-factor". …The enigmatic character of charisma also suggests a connection – at least to some degree – to the earliest manifestations of charisma as a spiritual gift.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. A History of Charisma. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Divinely conferred charisma===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] record the development of ''divinely conferred charisma''. In the Hebrew text the idea of charismatic leadership is generally signaled by the use of the noun ''hen'' (favor) or the verb ''hanan'' (to show favor). The Greek term for ''charisma'' (grace or favor), and its root ''charis'' (grace) replaced the Hebrew terms in the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the 3rd century BC [[Koine Greek#Biblical Koine|Septuagint]]). Throughout, "the paradigmatic image of the charismatic hero is the figure who has received God's favor".&lt;ref name = Scheper&gt;Scheper, George L. "Charisma" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones. Macmillan Reference USA, 2005, v 3, p. 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''divinely conferred charisma''&lt;ref&gt;Grabo, A., Spisak, B. R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2017). Charisma as signal: An evolutionary perspective on charismatic leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 28(4), 473-485. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.&lt;/ref&gt; applied to highly revered figures.

Thus, Eastern Mediterranean Jews in the 1st century CE had notions of ''charis'' and ''charisma'' that embraced the range of meanings found in Greek culture and the spiritual meanings from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. ''A History of Charisma''. PalgraveMacMillan, 2009, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; From this linguistic legacy of fused cultures, in [[1 Corinthians]], [[Paul the Apostle]] introduced the meaning that the Holy Spirit bestowed ''charism'' and ''charismata'', "the gift of God's grace", upon individuals or groups. For Paul, "[t]here is a clear distinction between charisma and charis; charisma is the direct result of divine charis or grace".&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1549&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s, Paul refers to ''charisma'' or its plural ''charismata'' seven times in [[1 Corinthians]], written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]] (or common) Greek around 54 CE. He elaborates on his concepts with six references in Romans (c. 56). He makes 3 individual references in [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 56), [[1 Timothy]], and [[2 Timothy]] (c. 62 – c. 67). The seventeenth and only other mention of ''charisma'' is in 1 Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3), pp. 268-269. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebertz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 23, 37, 43, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia''. Thomson/Gale, 2003, v. 3, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gospel]]s, written in the late first century, apply ''divinely conferred charisma'' to revered figures. Examples are accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and of his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], in which disciples see him as radiant with light, appearing together with Moses and Elijah. Another example is [[Gabriel|Gabriel's]] greeting to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as "full of grace".&lt;ref  name=Scheper/&gt; In these and other instances [[early Christians]] designated certain individuals as possessing "spiritual gifts", and these gifts included "the ability to penetrate the neighbour to the bottom of his heart and spirit and to recognize whether he is dominated by a good or by an evil spirit and the gift to help him to freedom from his demon".&lt;ref name=Benz&gt;Benz, Ernst Wilhelm. "The Roles of Christianity" in ''The new Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 16, 1986, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers characterized their revered religious figures as having "a higher perfection… a special ''Charisma''".&lt;ref name=Benz/&gt; Then, with the establishment of the [[Christian Church]], "the old charismatic gifts and free offerings were transformed into a hierarchical sacerdotal system".&lt;ref&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches'', translated by Olive Wyon. Allen and Unwin, v. 1, 1911/1931, pp. 99, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the institution rather than divinely inspired individuals increasingly dominated religious thought and life, and that focus went unchanged for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, William and Mary Morse. ''Harper's Dictionary of Contemporary Usage''. Harper and Row, 1985, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional changes began in the 17th century when church leaders, notably in the [[Western Christianity|Latin tradition]], accented "individual gifts [and] particular talents imparted by [[God in Christianity|God]] or the [[Holy Spirit]]". The 19th century brought an increasing shift in emphasis toward individual and spiritual aspects of charisma; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and some [[Catholic]] [[Theology|theologians]] narrowed the concept to superlative, out-of-the-ordinary, and virtuoso gifts. Simultaneously, the term became alienated from the much wider meaning that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] had attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, 2007, pp. 493–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the narrowed term projected back to the earlier period "A systematically reflected and highly differentiated understanding of charisma was often unconsciously infused into the Scriptures and writings of the church fathers, so that these texts were no longer read through the eyes of the authors".&lt;ref&gt;Baumert, N. "'Charisma' – Versuch einer Sprachregelung." ''ThPh'' 66, 1991, p. 22. Quoted in Ebertz, 2007, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

These dialectic meanings influenced notable changes in [[Pentecostalism]] in the late 19th century, and [[charismatic movements]] in some mainline churches in the mid-20th century. The discussion in the [[#21st century religion|21st Century Religion]] section explores what ''charisma'' means in these and other religious groups.

===Personality charisma===
The basis for modern secular usage comes from [[Germans|German]] [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. He discovered the term in the work of [[Rudolph Sohm]], a [[Germans|German]] [[church historian]] whose 1892 ''Kirchenrecht''&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Rudolf. ''Kirchenrecht''. Leipzig: Duncher &amp; Humblot, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 269-270. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars, which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Norman. "Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace," ''Sociological Inquiry'', 68:1 pp. 32–60, 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate and literature had made ''charisma'' a popular term when Weber used it in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and in his [[Sociology of Religion (book)|''Sociology of Religion'']]. Perhaps because he assumed that readers already understood the idea, Weber's early writings lacked definition or explanation of the concept.  In the collection of his works, ''Economy and Society'' edited by his wife, he identified the term as a prime example of action he labeled "value-rational," in distinction from and opposition to action he labeled "Instrumentally rational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher= Bedminster Press|year=1968|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he applied meanings for ''charisma'' similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1544.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's ''charisma'' would have coincided with the ''divinely conferred charisma'' sense defined above in Sohm's work.

Weber introduced the ''personality charisma'' sense when he applied ''charisma'' to designate a form of authority. To explain [[charismatic authority]] he developed his classic definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organization'', translated by A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. Free Press, 1924/1947, pp. 328, 358ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Weber extends the concept of charisma beyond supernatural to superhuman and even to exceptional powers and qualities. Sociologist Paul Joosse examined Weber's famous definition, and found that:&lt;blockquote&gt;through simple yet profoundly consequential phrases such as “are considered” and “is treated,” charisma becomes a relational, attributable, and at last a properly sociological concept.... For Weber, the locus of power is in the led, who actively (if perhaps unconsciously) invest their leaders with social authority.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) pp.271. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Weber indicates that it is followers who attribute the individual with powers, emphasizing that "the recognition on the part of those subject to authority" is decisive for the validity of charisma.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1947, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber died in 1920 leaving "disordered, fragmentary manuscripts without even the guidance of a plan or table of the proposed contents". One unfinished manuscript contained his above quoted definition of ''charisma''.&lt;ref name=MacRae&gt;MacRae, Donald G. ''Max Weber''. Viking, 1974, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over a quarter century for his work to be translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;"Max Weber" in ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', edited by Craig Calhoun. Oxford University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to charisma, Weber's formulations are generally regarded as having revived the concept from its deep theological obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Stephen. "Charisma Reconsidered," pp. 5–26 in ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', 3:5, 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the admirable translations and prefaces of his entire works, many scholars have found Weber's formulations ambiguous. For the past half-century they have debated the meaning of many Weberian concepts, including the meaning of ''charisma,'' the role of followers, and the degree of a supernatural component.&lt;ref name=MacRae/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Sonja M. 1984. "The Role of Leadership in the Construction of Reality," pp. 157–178 in ''Leadership Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by Barbara Kellerman. Prentice-Hall, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. "Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the Symbolics of Power," in ''Culture and Its Creators'' edited by Ben-David J. Clark. University of Chicago Press, pp. 150–171, 1977, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, Peter. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rustow, Dankwart A. "The Study of Leadership."

Berghahn Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists have been most active in applying Weber's ideas, researchers in management and organizational behavior including [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues, have reignited interest in charisma with respect to defining the term in unambiguous ways, finding ways to experimentally manipulate charisma, and to estimate the causal effects of charisma on performance outcomes in work and political settings.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacquart, P. &amp; Antonakis, J. 2015.

[[File:Charles Graves (bishop).jpg|thumb|Charles Graves]]
'''Charles Graves''' FRS (6 December 1812 – 17 July 1899) was a 19th-century Anglican [[Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe]]. He was President of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], Dean of the [[Chapel Royal, Dublin|Chapel Royal]] at [[Dublin Castle]] and a noted mathematician.

==Early life==
Born at 12 [[Fitzwilliam Square]], Dublin, the son of John Crosbie Graves (1776–1835), Chief Police Magistrate for Dublin, by his wife Helena Perceval, the daughter and co-heiress of the Revd Charles Perceval (1751–1795) of Bruhenny, [[County Cork]]. Helena enjoyed the patronage of [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale]], who married a daughter of her father's cousin, [[John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont]].

Educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in classics, and in 1834 graduated BA as Senior Moderator in mathematics, getting his MA in 1838. He played cricket for Trinity, and later in his life did much boating and fly-fishing. It was intended that he should join the [[18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot]] under his uncle, Major-General James William Graves (1774–1845), and in preparation he had become an expert swordsman and rider.

==Career==
After leaving Trinity College, Graves followed in the steps of his grandfather, [[Thomas Graves (dean)|Thomas Graves]], (appointed [[Dean of Ardfert]] in 1785 and [[Dean of Connor]] in 1802) and his great uncle, [[Richard Graves (clergyman)|Richard Graves]]. He was appointed a fellow of Trinity College from 1836 to 1843 before taking the professorship of mathematics, a position he held until 1862.

In 1860 he was appointed [[Dean of the Chapel Royal#Ireland|Dean of the Chapel Royal]] and, from 1864 to 1866, he was the [[Dean of Clonfert]] before being consecrated as Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe, a position he held for 33 years until his death in 1899. He had been elected a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in 1837 and subsequently held various officerships, including President from 1861 to 1866.. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1880&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27graves%27%29|title= Library Archive|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the honorary degree of DCL from [[Oxford University]] in 1881.

''A gentleman and a scholar he was well respected as the Bishop of Limerick. He and the Catholic Bishop (O'Dwyer) were on the very best of terms. They cracked Latin jokes at each other, discussed fine points of scholarship and were unclerical enough not to take their religious differences too seriously''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ History of Ballylickey Manor House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701191603/http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ |date=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop O'Dwyer had once joked at the size of Graves' family of nine and Graves retorted with the text about the blessedness of the man who has his quiver full of arrows, to which O'Dwyer replied "The ancient Jewish Quiver only held six."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Publications==
In 1841 Graves published an original mathematical work and he embodied further discoveries in his lectures and in papers read before and published by the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. He was a colleague of Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and on the latter's death Graves gave a presidential panegyric containing a valuable account both of Hamilton's scientific labours and of his literary attainments.

Graves was very interested in Irish antiquarian subjects. He discovered the key to the ancient Irish [[Ogham]] script which appeared as inscriptions on cromlechs and other stone monuments. He also prompted the government to publish the old Irish Brehon Laws, [[Early Irish Law]]. His suggestion was adopted and he was appointed a member of the Commission to do this.

==Private life==
His official residence was The Palace at Limerick, but from the 1850s he took the lease of Parknasilla House, [[County Kerry]], as a summer residence. In 1892 he bought out the lease of the house and a further {{convert|114|acre|km2}} of land that included a few islands. In 1894 he sold it to Great Southern Hotels, who still own it to this day.

'''Common knowledge''' is [[knowledge]] that is known by everyone or nearly everyone, usually with reference to the [[community]] in which the term is used. Common knowledge need not concern one specific subject, e.g., [[science]] or [[history]]. Rather, common knowledge can be about a broad range of subjects, such as science, literature, history, and entertainment. Often, common knowledge does not need to be [[citation|cited]]. Common knowledge is distinct from [[general knowledge]]. The latter has been defined by differential psychologists as referring to "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media", and is considered an aspect of ability related to intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Richard |author2=Irwing, P. |author3=Cammock, T.|title=Sex differences in general knowledge|journal=Intelligence|year=2001|volume=30|pages=27–39|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289601000642|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there are substantial individual differences in general knowledge as opposed to common knowledge.

In broader terms, common knowledge is used to refer to information that a reader would accept as valid, such as information that many users may know.  As an example, this type of information may include the temperature in which water freezes or boils. To determine if information should be considered common knowledge, you can ask yourself who your audience is, are you able to assume they already have some familiarity with the topic, or will the information’s credibility come into question.

Many techniques have been developed in response to the question of distinguishing truth from fact in matters that have become "common knowledge". The [[scientific method]] is usually applied in cases involving phenomena associated with astronomy, mathematics, physics, and the general laws of nature. In legal settings, [[rules of evidence]] generally exclude [[hearsay]] (which may draw on "facts" someone believes to be "common knowledge").

"[[Conventional wisdom]]" is a similar term also referring to ostensibly pervasive knowledge or analysis.

== Examples ==
Examples of common knowledge:

* "[[Paris]] is the capital of [[France]]." Many capital cities of countries are considered common knowledge by most people.
* "The Moon orbits the Earth." Observation of the moon shows us that this happens. In addition, [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|scientific findings give confirmation]]. At various periods in history, it was regarded as common knowledge that the Earth is flat and that the Sun orbits the Earth, although these theories were later found to be false.
* "It is dangerous to mix [[ammonia]] and [[bleach]]." Though both common household chemicals, accidents involving the mixing of ammonia and bleach are rare, because the potentially lethal danger in their chemical reaction is a widely circulated cautionary tale.
* "The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] grants American citizens the right to refuse to answer any question in a court of law that would endanger incriminating themselves." "Pleading the Fifth" is a phrase commonly used in American colloquial speak, and even in such popular media as the sketch comedy series ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. Thus it may be regarded as common knowledge in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">The '''Court History of David''' (frequently called simply the '''Court History''') is one of the two hypothetical main source documents of the [[Books of Samuel]], the other being the Accession History. The text is believed to cover most of 2 Samuel, except for the first few chapters and a few more minor parts. The Court History includes several stories with a distinctly negative attitude towards King [[David]] (e.g., the story of his adultery with [[Bathsheba]]).

German theologian Leonhard Rost (see German Wikipedia article on [[:de:Leonhard Rost|Rost]]) described the history of David's family in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|9-20|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse|1|Kings|1-2|NKJV}} as a ''Succession Document'' aiming to justify [[Solomon]]'s succession to the throne of the [[United Monarchy]] after the death of David.&lt;ref&gt;"Uberlieferung von der Thronnachfolge Davids" (BWANT 3/6; Stuttgart: Kohl-hammer, 1926; reprinted in "Das kleine Credo und andere Studien zum Alten Testament", Heidelberg: Quelle &amp; Meyer, 1965) 119-253&lt;/ref&gt; American theologian James Flanagan later argued that behind this Succession Document lay an earlier work, a ''Court History'', which sought to legitimate David's rule over the kingdoms of Judah and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, James W., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3263203.pdf "Court History or Succession Document? A Study of 2 Samuel 9-20 and 1 Kings 1-2"], Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 91, No. 2 (Jun., 1972), pp. 172-181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] suggested in his book ''The Hidden Book in the Bible'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, R. E., ''The Hidden Book in the Bible'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-06-063004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Court History and the Accession History were originally part of a single historical epic written by the [[Yahwist]] author covering the history of the Israelite world until the time of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. 

Friedman's thesis in ''The Hidden Book in the Bible'' is that the Yahwist author wrote many of the most familiar stories in the Hebrew Bible, including the stories of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], and David, as one unified text. The Hidden Book analyses the punctuation [[patt|patterns]], word choice, sentence structure and allusions used in the biblical stories; and reconstructs what Friedman says is the original, foundational text at the heart of the Bible.

'''David J. Kalupahana''' (1936–2014) was a [[Buddhist]] scholar from [[Sri Lanka]]. He was a student of the late [[K.N. Jayatilleke]], who was a student of [[Wittgenstein]]. He wrote mainly about [[epistemology]], theory of language, and compared later Buddhist philosophical texts against the earliest texts and tried to present interpretations that were both historically contextualised and also compatible with the earliest texts, and in doing so, he encouraged Theravadin Buddhists and scholars to reevaluate the legitimacy of later, Mahayana texts and consider them more sympathetically.

==Biography==
Born in [[Galle District]], Southern Sri Lanka, Kalupahana attended [[Mahinda College]], [[Galle]] for his school education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Silvas|first1=Nissanka|title=Me Mahinda Shasthra Shala: Ma Dutu Mahindaya|date=2013|publisher=Print House Sri Lanka|page=238|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He obtained his BA (Sri Lanka, 1959), Ph.D (London), and D. Litt (Hon. [[University of Peradeniya|Peradeniya, Sri Lanka]]). He was Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]]. He was assistant lecturer in Pali and Buddhist Civilization at the University of Ceylon, and studied Chinese and Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London where he completed a Ph.D. dissertation on the problem of causality in the Pali Nikayas and Chinese Agamas in 1966.

He left the [[University of Ceylon]] (1972) to join the University of Hawaii, serving as the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy and Chairman of the Graduate Field in Philosophy (1974–80). He directed international intra-religious conferences on Buddhism, and on Buddhism and Peace.

Many of his books are published and widely available in India (by Motilal Banarsidass and others), and therefore presumably have a fairly significant influence on the fields of Buddhism and Buddhist Studies in India and other nearby South Asian countries, such as his native Sri Lanka.

== Government Policy on Free software ==
The IT Policy for the state of Kerala had acknowledged the relevance of Free software as early as 2001&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2001 IT policy states that,&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Government wishes to encourage the judicious use of open source/free software that complements/supplements proprietary software, to reduce the total cost of ownership of IT applications/solutions without compromising on the immediate and medium term value provided by the application. The Government welcomes research into the use of open/free software in the context of education, governance, and for general use at home, to make IT truly a part of the daily lives of the people of the State. The Government also encourages projects such as the Simputer that is low cost, based on open software, and attuned to the needs of the common man.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2007, [[government of Kerala]] released its ICT policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.gov.in/documents/10180/46696/IT%20Policy%202007|title=Kerala State IT Policy 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where one of its objectives was to mandate appropriate use of Free Software in all ICT initiatives.&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Government realizes that Free Software presents a unique opportunity in building a truly egalitarian knowledge society. The Government will take all efforts to develop Free Software and Free Knowledge and shall encourage and mandate the appropriate use of Free Software in all ICT initiatives.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Free software communities / mailing lists ==
There are two prominent free software mailing lists and communities around these mailing lists in Kerala. One is around the [[Free Software Users Group, Thiruvananthapuram]] and the other is the [[ILUG-Cochin|Indian Libre User Group, Kochi]]. The primary activities of the users groups were around offering support to Free software users and in running technology and awareness sessions for the public and in institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/free-software-symbolises-freedom/article332594.ece|title=‘Free software symbolises freedom’|date=2009-03-15|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-freedom-movement-gains-pace/article1249331.ece|title=A freedom movement gains pace|date=2008-05-01|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and running install fests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/linux-install-fest-at-technopark/article1322461.ece|title=Linux Install Fest at Technopark|date=2008-08-24|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/freeing-software-for-users/article1412723.ece|title=Freeing software for users|date=2008-04-19|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also active Free software clubs in several Engineering colleges in the state like [[College of Engineering, Trivandrum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/now-a-movement-for-open-hardware/article7466555.ece|title=Now, a movement for open hardware|date=2015-07-26|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai|St. Josephs College of Engineering and Technology, Pala]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[MES College of Engineering|MES College of engineering Kuttippuram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/05/stories/2005090505910300.htm|title=The Hindu : Kerala News : Workshop to focus on Linux networking|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Institute of Technology Calicut|National Institute of Technology, Kozhikode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fossmeet-begins-today/article5687686.ece|title=FOSSMeet begins today|date=2014-02-14|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free software initiatives in the state ==

'''George Hawkins Pember''' (1837–1910), known as '''G. H. Pember''', was an English theologian and author who was affiliated with the [[Plymouth Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;Reetzke, James. ''Biographical Sketches: A Brief History of the Lord's Recovery.'' Chicago: Chicago Bibles and Books, 2003: 23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and marriages==

Pember was born in [[Hereford]], the son of George Hawkins Pember (1805–77) and Mary Pember (1804–77).&lt;ref&gt;Pember's parents are listed in the UK Census of 1841 living in the Parish of St. Peter, Herefordshire. Pember's father's occupation is listed as Silk Mercer. A younger brother named Robert aged 3 also appears in the census record.  1841 Census available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Hereford Cathedral School]] and matriculated from there in 1856. He then enrolled at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. He earned the B.A. in his studies in the Classics in 1860, and proceeded to postgraduate studies earning an M.A. in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PMR856GH|name=Pember, George Hawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his postgraduate studies Pember held a teaching post as assistant master at [[Rossall]], Lancashire, from 1861 to 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PMR856GH|name=Pember, George Hawkins}} and also refer to the UK Census of 1861 which lists Pember as residing in Bathwick, Somerset with the occupation of a tutor. Census available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1864 Pember married Mary Lemmon (née Reynolds).&lt;ref&gt;UK Marriage Index 1837–1915, entry for January–March 1864 at St. Giles, London, Vol. 1b, p 541. Index available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; She had been previously married to William Lemmon who died in 1861, and she had two daughters from that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pember is listed in UK Census of 1871, along with her two daughters Elizabeth and Sarah Lemmon, as residing in Budleigh Salterton, Devon. Census available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; She died on 10 July 1891 and left her estate to her husband George Pember.&lt;ref&gt;UK Death Index 1837–1915 for 1891 July–September Vol. 5b, p 213, and England &amp; Wales National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administration), 1861–1941, entry for 1891, p. 259. Both documents are available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 Pember married Elizabeth Ann Smith in Devon, and they resided at Westbourne Terrace, [[Budleigh Salterton]], Devon for the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;UK Marriage Index 1837–1915, for 1893 October–December, Vol. 5b, p. 151, St. Thomas, Devonshire. Also see entries for the UK Census of 1901 listing the couple as residing at Westbourne Terrace, Budleigh Salterton, Devon. Both documents available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faith==

Pember's conversion to Christianity led him to participate in the Brethren, and from within that movement he developed his career as an author and teacher of biblical and theological themes. The Brethren emerged in the 1820s as an independent movement that protested about the [[ecclesiastical]] divisions of Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the emergence and beliefs of the Brethren see Roy Coad, ''A History of The Brethren Movement'', Exeter: Paternoster Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent leaders within the Brethren such as [[Anthony Norris Groves]], [[George Müller]] and [[John Nelson Darby]] were persuaded that there were biblical teachings that were overlooked or not consistently taught by the Protestant churches such as practising adult [[baptism]] only (hence rejecting [[infant baptism]]), restricting the observance of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] (partaking of the emblems of bread and wine representing Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice) to baptised members, and biblical [[prophecies]] about the imminent return of Christ to the world. As the Brethren placed great emphasis on understanding biblical prophecy they believed that current events could be signs or signals that Christ's second coming would occur very soon.&lt;ref&gt;Ian S. Rennie, "Nineteenth-Century Roots of Contemporary Prophetic Interpretation" in ''Handbook of Biblical Prophecy'', Carl E. Armerding and W. Ward Gasque, eds. Grand Rapids: Baker, 1978, 41–60. {{ISBN|0-8010-0135-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Brethren upheld strong convictions about living in the end-times, participant members engaged in what they saw as the urgent task of preaching the gospel to persuade other people to become followers of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Coad, ''History of The Brethren Movement'', 263–267.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach that the Brethren developed in understanding biblical prophecy is technically known as [[Dispensationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;For background on the Brethren and Dispensationalism see Ian Rennie "Nineteenth Century Roots" in note 9, and also see Robert G.

==Theological writing==
Pember's career as a writer appears to have been very financially successful because in successive UK census records his occupation is described as a man of "independent means".&lt;ref&gt;UK Census records for 1881, 1891 and 1901 respectively, available for subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The books that he wrote all reflect the distinctive doctrinal themes of the Brethren outlined above. His books ''The Antichrist, Babylon and the Coming Kingdom'', ''The Great Prophecies of the centuries concerning Israel and the Gentiles'', and ''Mystery Babylon the Great'' are examples of Brethren interpretations of biblical prophecies in light of current events, and about the rejection of divisions in the Protestant churches.  His book ''The Lord's Command'' is a classic example of Brethren arguments that uphold the need for only adults ([[believer's baptism]]) to be baptised and the rejection of the practice of infant baptism.

His book ''Earth's Earliest Ages'', which went through several editions, had two principal objectives. Pember wrote in the preface to the first edition:
"To remove some of the Geological and other difficulties usually associated with the commencing chapters of Genesis" and "to show the characteristic features of the Days of Noah were reappearing in Christendom, and therefore, that the Days of the Son of Man could not be far distant."&lt;ref&gt;George H. Pember, ''Earth's Earliest Ages and their Connection with Modern Spiritualism, Theosophy, and Buddhism'', reprint ed. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Kregel, 1975 [1876], p. 25. {{ISBN|0-8254-3508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book Pember attempted to reconcile the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account of the world's creation with the emerging fossil evidence in geological science about the age of the earth.  Pember argued a position known as "The [[Gap Theory]]", and which had been previously proposed by the Scottish theologian [[Thomas Chalmers]] (1780–1847).&lt;ref&gt;James R. Moore, "Geologists and Interpreters of Genesis in the Nineteenth Century," in ''God and Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter between Christianity and Science'', David C. Lindberg &amp; Ronald L. Numbers, eds. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986, 322–350. {{ISBN|0-520-05692-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, God originally created the universe but due to the rebellion of some angels led by [[Lucifer]] (or [[Satan]]) the earth descended into chaos and life was destroyed. Pember's position was that the first chapter of Genesis gave an account of God restoring or recreating the world after the collapse of the original creation. So proponents of the Gap Theory like Pember propose that a "gap" exists between the first two verses in Genesis chapter one which allows for all the extra time needed to include the ancient fossil and geological evidences. The geological fossils were creatures that lived in the original creation and were destroyed when Lucifer fell into [[sin]].  The biblical story of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] is about a later recreation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Pember, ''Earth's Earliest Ages'', 27–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Pember's argument for the "Gap Theory" is an example of how some evangelical Christians in the nineteenth century tried to reconcile geological evidence for an old earth with the book of Genesis and without embracing [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory about the [[evolution]] of the species.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Moore, ''The Post-Darwinian Controversies'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-521-21989-2}}; and George M. Marsden, ''Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1991, 153–81. {{ISBN|0-8028-0539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other major feature of Pember's ''Earth's Earliest Ages'' was his argument that the emergence of rival non-Christian religious groups were evidence that end times biblical prophecies were being fulfilled. Three particular religious movements were pinpointed as being examples of the spiritual deception that are characteristic of the biblical signs of the end times: the [[Spiritualist]] churches, the [[Theosophical Society]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pember, ''Earth's Earliest Ages'', 149–276.&lt;/ref&gt; Pember criticised these three movements on the grounds that their teachings were contradicted by the Bible. These religious groups were classified by Pember as modern-day [[heresies]].&lt;ref&gt;Pember, ''Earth's Earliest Ages'', 191–93, 257–59, 273–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Pember's interpretation of the Spiritualist churches and of the Theosophical Society as prophetic signs of anti-Christian spiritual deception represents a nineteenth-century style of argument that has been subsequently developed and refined in Christian [[Countercult]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;For background on the Christian Countercult see John A. Saliba, ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', 2d ed. Walnut Creek: Altamira Press, 2003, 203–23. {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'', 2nd ed. New York &amp; London: Garland Publishing, 1992, 335–43. {{ISBN|0-8153-0502-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Pember's book defends the creation account of Genesis and rejects Darwinian evolutionary theory it is a work of [[Christian apologetics]], and the latter part of the book is an early example of that genre of literature produced in evangelical Countercult apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;For an historical account of late nineteenth-century Christian apologetics responding to Darwin see James R. Moore, ''The Post-Darwinian Controversies''. For a survey of evangelical countercult apologetic models and methods see John W. Morehead, "Where Do We Go From Here?" in ''Encountering New Religious Movements'', Irving Hexham, Stephen Rost &amp; John W. Morehead, Eds.

==Animal welfare and animal rights==

Pember also wrote very briefly about a Christian approach to animal welfare and animal rights, which was becoming a topic of great social concern in Victorian society.&lt;ref&gt;For historical background see Harold D. Guither, ''Animal Rights: History and Scope of a Radical Social Movement'', Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8093-2199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Pember had to say on the subject can be understood on a wide historical canvas. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries human attitudes about the status of animals began to change as theologians and [[philosophers]] discussed whether animals were capable of rational thought, had emotions, had a [[soul]], and questions about brutal treatment were also debated.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500–1800'', London: Penguin, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theologians began to examine passages of the Bible concerned with the [[afterlife]] and the prophesied new heaven and new earth, and as those discussions developed [[Nathaniel Homes]] (1654) and [[Stephen Charnock]] (1660) argued that animals would be included in the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Homes, ''The Resurrection Revealed, or the Dawning of the Day-Star'', London: Simpkin &amp; Marshall, 1833 [1654]. Stephen Charnock, ''The Existence and Attributes of God'', in ''The Complete Works of Stephen Charnock'' Vol 2. Edinburgh: James Nichol, 1864 [1660].&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century the debate was carried forward by both the Anglican Bishop [[Joseph Butler]] in his ''Analogy of Religion'' and the Anglican priest and hymn writer [[Augustus Montague Toplady]], both believed in the [[resurrection]] of animals, while Toplady regarded brutality towards animals as [[sin]].&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Butler, ''The Analogy of Religion'', Part 1, Chapter 1, reprint ed. London: George Bell, 1902 [1736]. Augustus Toplady, "Whether Unnecessary Cruelty to the Brute Creation is Criminal" in ''The Works of Augustus Toplady'', reprint ed. London: J. Chidley, 1837 [1794], 443–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important contributors to the debate were Humphry Primatt (1776), Richard Dean (1767) and [[John Wesley]] as they each addressed the problem of brutality to animals in connection with the [[problem of evil]] and sin, while both Dean and Wesley held to the resurrection of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Humphry Primatt, ''A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals'', London: R. Hett, 1776. Richard Dean, ''An Essay on the Future Life of Brutes'', 2 Vols. Manchester: J. Harrop, 1767. John Wesley, "The Great Deliverance" in ''The Works of the Rev. John Wesley in Ten Volumes'', Vol. 6, New York: J. &amp; J. Harper, 1826, 252–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Pember wrote about animal rights there had already been many Christians in England involved in protesting against the maltreatment of domestic animals, agitating for legislation against cruelty to animals, and in rejecting the practice of the scientific dissection of living animals called [[vivisection]].&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, "Darwinism, Christianity and the Great Vivisection Debate," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 64/3 (2003): 399–419. Lloyd G. Stevenson, "Religious Elements in the Background of the British Anti-Vivisection Movement," ''Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine'' 29 (1956): 125–157.&lt;/ref&gt; An early but failed attempt to pass a Bill against cruelty to animals was initiated by [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]] (1750–1823). He was a Christian who served in the [[House of Lords]] and was also [[Lord Chancellor]] in England. In 1809 Erskine "introduced into the Lords a Bill for the prevention of malicious and wanton cruelty to animals".&lt;ref&gt;John Hostettler, ''Thomas Erskine and Trial by Jury'', Hampshire: Waterside Press, 2010, 197. {{ISBN|978-1-904380-59-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erskine's bill was rejected in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], a later legislative attempt to punish acts of cruelty to animals was successfully passed by England's parliament in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of the 1822 legislation see {{cite web|url=http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/romantic-legislation/1822-uk-act-ill-treatment-cattle.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030063347/http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/romantic-legislation/1822-uk-act-ill-treatment-cattle.htm |archivedate=30 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of that 1822 legislation was the Irish Christian politician [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]]. Two years after the passage of Martin's anti-cruelty legislation, a meeting was called on 16 June 1824 for the formation of an organisation to oppose animal cruelty. With the exception of [[Lewis Gompertz]] who was a Jew, everyone else who attended the meeting were professing Christians and a new organisation was founded. The principal founding figures were Rev. Arthur Broome, [[William Wilberforce]], Richard Martin and [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], and the organisation they created became the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Fairholme and Wellesley Pain, ''A Century of Work for Animals: The History of the R.S.P.C.A., 1824–1934'', London: John Murray, 1934, 49–64. Shevawn Lynam, ''Humanity Dick Martin 'King of Connemara 1754–1834'', Dublin: Lilliput Press, 1989, 231–232. {{ISBN|0-946640-36-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the activities of organisations like the RSPCA, there was a steady stream of books where Christians argued for [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]], and most writers linked animal rights to theological topics such as whether animals have a soul, that brutality is sin, and if they will be included in the general resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include Peter Buchan, ''Scriptural &amp; Philosophical Arguments; or Cogent Proofs from Reason &amp; Revelation that Brutes have Souls and that their Souls are Immortal'', Peterhead: P. Buchan, 1824.  Sarah Burdett, ''The Rights of Animals'', London: John Mortimer, 1839. Henry Crowe, ''Zoophilos, or Considerations on the Moral Treatment of Inferior Animals'', London: J. Seeley, 1819. Joseph Hamilton, ''Animal Futurity: A Plea for the Immortality of the Brutes'', Belfast: C. Aitchison, 1877. James Macauley, ''Essay on Cruelty to Animals'', Edinburgh: John Johnstone, 1839. David Mushet, ''The Wrongs of the Animal World'', London: Hatchard, 1839. Rev. James Plumptre, ''Three Discourses on the Animal Creation and the Duties of Man to them'', London:  Darton, Harvey &amp; Darton, 1816. John Styles, ''The Animal Creation; its claims on our Humanity stated and enforced'', London: Thomas Ward, 1839. Most of these books may be downloaded from the Internet Archive https://archive.org/details/texts&lt;/ref&gt;

So, it is within that context of Christian thought about animals that Pember contributed a short book ''Animals: Their Past and Present''.&lt;ref&gt;The book was reissued in 2003 and is critically reviewed by Richard Ruble in ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]'', see http://www.asa3.org/ASA/BookReviews2000-present/12-03.html&lt;/ref&gt; He examines the spiritual status of animals in the Bible and explores the duties that humans have towards animals. He argues that humans are made in God's image and likeness and have been given authority by God to rule over the animals (sometimes called [[dominion]]). Due to Adam's sin all animals live under the curse. Pember argued that on the basis of several biblical passages in Isaiah 11:6–9, 2 Peter 3 and the book of Revelation that some species of animals will be restored or resurrected to live on the new earth foreshadowed in those biblical books. The nature of animals will be changed so they will no longer be predators, and they will have the capacity for speech. Pember argued that as animals will share in the prophesied new earth that in the present life humans must cease being apathetic about the plight of animals. Humans have responsibilities and duties of care towards animals. Pember's argument about a biblical approach to animal rights as seen from the standpoint of end times prophecy was by no means unique, as some of his Christian contemporaries such as Lutheran authors [[George N. H. Peters]] (''The Theocratic Kingdom'') and Joseph A. Seiss also argued similar points.&lt;ref&gt;George N. H. Peters, ''The Theocratic Kingdom'', Vol. 2, Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1988 [1884], 479–488. Joseph A. Seiss, ''The Last Times and The Great Consummation'', rev. ed. Philadelphia: Smith, English &amp; Co, 1863, 62–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, elements of Pember's arguments against brutality to animals had already been anticipated by Christian writers  in the previous two hundred years&lt;ref&gt;For general discussion of changing Christian attitudes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries see Thomas, ''Man and the Natural World'', 137–191. Also for an anthology of Christian writings from this era see Andrew Linzey and Tom Regan eds. ''Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings'', London SPCK, 1989. {{ISBN|0-281-04373-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in July 1910 aged 73 at Budleigh Salterton in Devon.&lt;ref&gt;See death notice in the ''Devon and Exeter Daily Gazette'', 13 July 1910, p. 1; UK Death Index, 1910 July–September, Vol. 5b, p. 18, St. Thomas, Devonshire, available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gennaro Auletta''' (born August 27, 1957 in [[Naples]], Italy) is an Italian philosopher of science actively involved in scientific research. He is an internationally acknowledged expert in quantum mechanics and in the foundation and interpretation of this discipline. His main interests in quantum information led him to focus his further research on the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information. He is also active in the field of the dialogue between science, philosophy and theology, and has been the Vice-Director of the international conference on ''Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories'', held at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] on March 2009.

==Academics==
Auletta graduated from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] where he took his PhD and completed his post-doctoral research work. He is an Aggregate Professor at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] where, from 2003 to 2012, held the position of Scientific Director of the Specialization in Science and Philosophy. He is also a Senior Researcher at the [[University of Cassino]] (Italy).
From 2003 to 2010, Auletta has been the Scientific Coordinator of the STOQ Project (“Science, Theology and the Ontological Quest”, a project under the patronage of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] involving seven Roman Pontifical Universities and supported by the [[John Templeton Foundation]]).

Since 2009, Auletta is a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]] and of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]].

==Research interests and projects==
One of the main results of Auletta’s original research on the foundations and interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] is the publication (together with [[Giorgio Parisi]] and Mauro Fortunato) of a handbook of ''Quantum Mechanics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item2327390/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Quantum Mechanics &amp;#124; Quantum Physics Quantum Information and Quantum Computation &amp;#124; Cambridge University Press |website=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cambridge University Press, 2009). Auletta has stressed that there are three basic forms of dealing with information: processing, sharing, selecting. 
This pathway of research eventually led him to consider [[quantum information]] as a fruitful approach for studying the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information at all scales. He has now published a book on ''Cognitive Biology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LifeSciences/Neurobiology/CognitiveScience/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199608485 |title=Cognitive Biology - Gennaro Auletta - Oxford University Press |website=Oup.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Oxford University Press, 2011), in which an attempt is made to show the consistence of such an approach with the recent impressive achievements in life sciences, within the perspective of a thorough reflection on the current paradigm dominating biological disciplines. In particular, Auletta is interested in the relevance of notions like ''information control'', ''functional equivalence class'', ''formal constraints'' and ''top-down causation'' as to the organisms’ capability of dealing with a challenging environment at the ontogenetic and epigenetic levels, eventually leading to the [[emergence]] of new biological functionalities at the phylogenetic level. Top-down causation mechanisms via information control may be considered as the way in which initial and random perturbations disturbing the [[homeostasis]] of an organism are subsequently framed in the organism’s network of formal constraints thus giving raise to a process of fine-tuning that ends up in an eventual stable form able to realize a new adaptive fit with certain environmental conditions and challenges. Such process of top-down fine-tuning bridging between randomicity and fitness may be at the basis of the [[emergence]] of new functionalities at the phylogenetic scale. Top-down causation via information control may also be enquired in developmental and epigenetic processes (as well as in regeneration processes) when the organism is forced to deal with unpredicted, uncontrollable and in principle noxious environmental stimuli. Finally, information control may be assumed to play a fundamental role also in the ontogenetic action of the organism on the environment (e.g. from [[chemotaxis]] up to [[niche construction]] as well as to planned actions). Accordingly, his efforts are aimed at both developing a theoretical framework and designing possible experiments and research projects based on the latter standpoints.
Recently, he has published a book on the mechanization of inferences, ''Mechanical Logic in Three-Dimensional Space'', (Pan Stanford Pub., Singapore, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panstanford.com/books/9789814411509.html |title=Pan Stanford Publishing - Mechanical Logic in Three-Dimensional Space |website=Panstanford.com |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here a reduction of logic to combinatorics is provided. In particular, a logical 3D space is built as a substrate of the logical algebra. Arithmetic operations on propositions allow a new logical calculus.

In Christian [[heresiology]], there have been historical claims that certain Christian sects worshipped the [[devil]]. This was especially an issue in the reaction of the early Church to [[Gnosticism]] and its [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], where the [[creator deity]] is understood as a [[demiurge]] subordinate to the actual, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] God.

==Satan in the Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Satan}}
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] God is depicted as the source of both light and darkness, as in [[Isaiah]] 45:6-7.&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Quinn-Miscall Reading Isaiah: poetry and vision p93 2001 - 224 "I make peace and I create evil. I the Lord make all these things. (45:6-7) "I create evil" is a shocking statement that is usually softened in translations, except for KJV."&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of "darkness" or "evil" was not yet personified as "the [[devil]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible DDD p245 ed. K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst - 1999 "The value of this complex dualism and eschatology for some factions of post-exilic Judaism was that it provided an ... the source of both opposites: "I form light and I create darkness: I make wholeness and I create evil" (Isa 45:7)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[Books of Chronicles]] is thought to have first introduced the notion of "divine intermediaries", which was not found in the earlier parts of the Hebrew Bible. The main evidence adduced by theologians to support this is 1 Chronicles 21, a reworked version of 2 Samuel 24.

This change is made most evident in the Chronicler's treatment of 2 Samuel 24:1:

{{quote|And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.|[[King James Version]]}}

which, in 1 Chronicles 21:1, becomes:

{{quote|And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.|King James Version}}

In the Book of Samuel, [[YHWH]] himself is the agent in punishing Israel, while in 1 Chronicles an "adversary" is introduced. This is usually taken to be the result of the influence of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] on Israelite demonology.

Scholars are divided on whether in Chronicles, "the adversary" had already become a proper name, "the Adversary" (Satan). The traditional opinion has been that this is the case, arguing from the absence of the definite article in שטן "adversary". S. Japhet in her ''The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles and its Place in Biblical Thought'' (1989) argued against mainstream opinion in suggesting that שטן still had the generic meaning and only became the proper name "Satan" at a later date, by about the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsw.org/?l=71851&amp;a=Comm17.html ''Divine Intermediaries in 1 Chronicles 21: An Overlooked Aspect of the Chronicler’s Theology''] by Paul Evans in ''Biblica'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Christianity==
[[File:Apostle John and Marcion of Sinope, from JPM LIbrary MS 748, 11th c.jpg|thumb|Marcion of Sinope, right]]
[[Tertullian]] accuses [[Marcion of Sinope]], the first major [[heretic of Christianity]] in the 1st century, that he "[held that] the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful [...] and [...] accounted for it by postulating [that Jehovah was] a secondary deity, a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]], who was god, in a sense, but not the supreme God; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="Marcion"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marcionites}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church|Church]] condemned his writings as heretical.

[[John Arendzen]] (1909) in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1913) mentions that [[Eusebius]] accused [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]], the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel.&lt;ref name="Apelles"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Gnosticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hegemonius]] (4th century) accuses the Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], founder of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean sect]] in the 3rd century AD, identified Jehovah as "the devil god which created the world"&lt;ref name="Mani1"&gt;[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/m/manichaenism.html ''Manichaeism''] by Alan G. Hefner in ''The Mystica'', undated&lt;/ref&gt; and said that "he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests [...] is the [Prince] of Darkness, [...] not the god of truth."&lt;ref name="Mani2"&gt;''Acta Archelai'' of Hegemonius, Chapter XII, c. AD 350, quoted in [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf ''Translated Texts''] of Manicheism, compiled by Prods Oktor Skjærvø, page 68. History of the ''Acta Archelai'' explained in the [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_I_Intro.pdf ''Introduction''], page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their critics, these heretics referred to the Abrahamic God variously as "a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]]",&lt;ref name="Marcion" /&gt; "an evil angel",&lt;ref name="Apelles" /&gt; "the devil god",&lt;ref name="Mani1" /&gt; "the Prince of Darkness",&lt;ref name="Mani2" /&gt; "the source of all evil",&lt;ref name="Albigenses" /&gt;

==Medieval Christianity==
Nicholas Weber in the Catholic Encyclopedia article ''Albigenses'' (1907) notes that the enemies of the Albigenses, a Christian sect in 12th- and 13th-century France, a branch of the [[Catharism|Cathari]], accused them that their doctrine held that "the creator [...] of the material world [...] is the source of all evil [...] He created the human body and is the author of sin [...] The Old Testament must be either partly or entirely ascribed to him; whereas the New Testament is the revelation of the beneficent God."&lt;ref name="Albigenses"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm ''Albigenses''] by Nicholas Weber in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1907&lt;/ref&gt; They ultimately came into conflict with both the civil order and the [[Catholic Church|Church]] which led to the [[Albigensian Crusade]].

{{Contains special characters}}
{{nihongo|'''[[Gyaru]]-moji'''|ギャル文字||"gal's alphabet"}} or {{nihongo|'''Heta-moji'''|下手文字||"poor handwriting"}}, is a style of obfuscated ([[cant (language)|cant]]) [[Japanese writing system|Japanese writing]] popular amongst urban [[Japan]]ese youth.

Like the [[English language|English]] phenomenon of [[SMS language]], it is most often used for sending [[cell phone]] [[text messages]], but while text is used as a form of informal shorthand, a message typed in gyaru-moji usually requires more characters and effort than the same message typed in plain Japanese. Since writing in gyaru-moji requires extra effort, and due to the perception of [[confidentiality]], sending gyaru-moji messages to a peer is seen as a sign of informality or friendship. The origin of this style is unclear but it has been proposed that magazines targeted at teenage girls first made it popular, and the phenomenon started to gain wider attention in media around 2002.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The style has been met with increasing criticism, as its use continues to expand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  Reported instances of girls using the writing in school work, [[Office lady|OL]]s (Office Ladies) adopting the style in the workplace, and gyaru-moji being used in [[karaoke]] subtitling, are examples of this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Laura Miller has analyzed gyaru moji as an example of gender resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller. 2011. “Subversive script and novel graphs in Japanese girls’ culture.” ''Language &amp; Communication'' Vol. 31, Issue 1: 16-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Like [[leet]], gyaru-moji replaces characters with visually similar characters or combinations of characters. [[Hiragana]] consisting of connected strokes are replaced by symbols or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters: for example, す (''su'') may be rendered as the [[section sign|section symbol]] &lt;code&gt;§&lt;/code&gt;. Hiragana consisting of detached elements are replaced by sequences of kana, Western letters, or symbols. For example, ほ (''ho'') may be typed as &lt;code&gt;|ま&lt;/code&gt; ([[vertical bar]] and hiragana ''ma'') or &lt;code&gt;(ま&lt;/code&gt; (open [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parenthesis]] and ''ma''), け (''ke'') may be typed as &lt;code&gt;レナ&lt;/code&gt; (katakana ''re na''), &lt;code&gt;Iナ&lt;/code&gt; (capital i, ''na''), or &lt;code&gt;(†&lt;/code&gt; (open parenthesis, [[dagger (typography)|dagger]]), and た (ta) may be typed as &lt;code&gt;ナ=&lt;/code&gt; (katakana ''na'', equals sign) or &lt;code&gt;†こ&lt;/code&gt; (dagger, hiragana ''ko'').  [[Katakana]] is frequently replaced by similar-looking [[kanji]], such as 世 for セ (se) or 干 for チ (chi), in a reversal of the process that turned [[man'yōgana]] into [[kana]]. Kana and [[romaji|rōmaji]] may be mixed freely, even within a word, and [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]] in rōmaji may be replaced with similar-looking [[Cyrillic]] letters, such as replacing N with И ([[I (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic I]]). Compound [[kanji]] are decomposed into left and right elements, which are written as individual kanji or kana. For example, the kanji 好 in 好き, meaning "like, enjoy" may be split into 女子 (the kanji for woman and child, respectively).

In addition to the basic obfuscation provided by character replacement, another technique used to disguise the content of the message is to use vocabulary and grammar that is uncharacteristic of standard usage.&lt;ref name="GalMojiDotCom"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:『ギャル文字一括変換装置』|url=http://www.gal-moji.com/moji/gyaru_moji.asp
|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with character substitution, this can make the meaning of the message almost unintelligible to those not “in the know”. This is analogous to the use of leet’s specialized grammar. However, the flexible nature of the [[Japanese language]] means that although gyaru-moji phrases sound peculiar to someone expecting formal or even commonly [[colloquial]] Japanese, they are often technically still grammatically correct.

For example, the sentence {{Nihongo2|「私は今とても良い気分です。」}} (“Watashi wa ima totemo yoi kibun desu.”) is “Right now I am feeling very good.” in standard normal-polite Japanese.
By first rewording this as {{Nihongo2|「超気持ちいい！」}} or {{Nihongo2|「チョーキモチイイ！」}} (“Chōkimochi ii!”) – which roughly translates as “(I have a) Super good feeling!” – and then converting to gyaru-moji to get {{Nihongo2|「走召 氣 持 ち ぃ ぃ !」}} or {{Nihongo2|「于∋─≠モ于ｲｲ！」}}, the message could prove difficult for those not versed in the style to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4616">'''(Elsie) Helen Knight''' (née Weil, 24 November 1899 – 1984) was a British [[philosopher]]. She was one of few women active in the early days of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeglin Brand|first=Peggy|title=Feminism and Tradition in Aesthetics|year=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271043968|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Helen Knight, Moral Science Club, 1953.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Knight, 1936]]

==Life and education==
Knight was born in Swiss Cottage, London and attended Fremarch School, Hampstead. She began her BA at [[Bedford College, London]], before coming to [[Cambridge University]] in 1921 where she took Part II Moral Sciences in 1923 and obtained a first class degree. From 1923 to 1925 she was a Research Student at [[Newnham College]]. She married psychologist [[Arthur Rex Knight|Rex Knight]] on 30 January 1926 (they divorced in 1936), and then appears to have taken a break from academic philosophy until 1932 when she returned to Newnham as Sarah Smithson Research Fellow. She obtained her PhD in 1935.  
During the war she was Principal at the [[Board of Trade]], a position that had been temporarily filled by fellow philosopher [[Margaret MacDonald (philosopher)|Margaret MacDonald]]. She also taught English at an independent girls boarding school, [[North Foreland Lodge]] in Kent from 1942 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''Newnham College Roll Card''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Knight was one of a select group to whom [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] dictated his [[Blue and Brown Books]] in the 1930s, which outline the transition in Wittgenstein's thought between his two major works, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' and ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=0742512703|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight became a member of the [[Aristotelian Society]] in 1922, acting in its Executive Committee for several terms. Between 1935 and 1941 she was a researcher in Aesthetics at Cambridge. During this time she published occasional papers on aesthetics for different philosophical journals (''Mind'', ''Philosophy'' and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waithe|first=Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers Vol. 4|year=1995|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 she addressed the [[Aristotelian Society]] talking about the Women’s Graduate Club in Cambridge. “Judging by the calibre of co-presenters, discussants and commentators of her papers, her work was admired and taken seriously.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waithe|first=Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers Vol. 4|year=1995|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Knight emigrated to Australia where she was a tutor in English Literature at Janet Clarke Hall, [[University of Melbourne]] until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppy|first=Graham|title=The Antipodean Philosopher|year=2011|publisher=Lexington|isbn=9780739127339|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Melbourne, Australia aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Births, Deaths and Marriages|url=https://online.justice.vic.gov.au/bdm/indexsearch.doj|website=Family History Search|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=6427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Although she published scantly, her work was well received and continues to be included in modern anthologies of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsley|first=Monroe|title=Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism|year=1981|publisher=Hackett|isbn=0915145081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Laudato si{{'}}''''' (Medieval Central [[Italian language|Italian]] for "Praise Be to You") is the second [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]]. The encyclical has the subtitle "On care for our common home".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; In it, the Pope critiques [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment|irresponsible development]], laments [[environmental degradation]] and [[global warming]], and calls all people of the world to take "swift and unified global action."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.&lt;ref name=strong /&gt;

The encyclical is the second published by Francis, after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"), which was released in 2013. Since ''Lumen fidei'' was largely the work of Francis's predecessor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], ''Laudato si{{'}}'' is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

== Content ==
[[File:John Zizioulas presents the encyclical Laudato si' at the press conference in Rome.webm|thumb| [[w:John Zizioulas|John Zizioulas]],  [[w:Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]  [[w:Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[w:Pergamon|Pergamon]], presents the encyclical ''Laudato si''' at the [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Press Conference Presentation Laudato si'|Press conference]] in Rome ]]
The title of the social encyclical is an [[Central Italian|Umbrian]] phrase&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt; from Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 13th-century "[[Canticle of the Sun]]" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;

The tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as "cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue."&lt;ref name=good/&gt;  For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds that "Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer "'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice."&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

Francis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  This has resulted in a "[[throwaway culture]]" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  This subtext makes the document "more profoundly subversive" than it appears on the surface.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

The real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]].&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Thus we see "other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination" and do not realize that "the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having "dominion" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a "kind of universal family".&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Francis "pulls no punches" when lamenting pollution, [[global warming|climate change]], a lack of clean water, loss of biodiversity, and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; "Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years," he states.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

He "describe[s] a relentless [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[Environmental degradation|destruction]] of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; ''Laudato si''' "unambiguously accepts the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that [[global warming|changes in the climate]] are largely man-made"&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; and states that "climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day" and warns of "unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us" if prompt [[climate change mitigation]] efforts are not undertaken.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical highlights the role of [[fossil fuel]]s in causing climate change. "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay," Francis says. "Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the [[scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

===Poverty===
The encyclical states that [[developed nation]]s are morally obligated to assist [[developing nation]]s in combating the climate-change crisis.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to the effects of climate change]] and will bear the brunt of its [[Effects of global warming|effects]].&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  Linking the issues of [[poverty]], which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must "hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

He does not believe, according to [[R. R. Reno]], that "for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference ''Statement on Environmental Issues'', Francis asks "what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Science and modernism===
"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both," according to the pontiff.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Religions, including Christianity, can make "rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  However, "the scientific and experimental method" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

The editor of ''[[First Things]]'' R. R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing ''Laudato si''' makes "many fierce denunciations of the current global order." This global order "destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this "perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the [[Syllabus of Errors]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of [[Gaudium et Spes]], would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

===Technology===
Modern technology, the "dominant technological paradigm", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. "The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology…  Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Technology is not value neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. "The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; The encyclical warns against "blind confidence in technical solutions," particularly in view of the fact that "the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture," which "can actually become a form of ignorance."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: "Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Given these significant short-comings of technology, "scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with progress of humanity and history," and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that "ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  A profound redefinition of progress and "liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm" are needed, i.e., "we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that "technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power," and that "the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a "development in human responsibility, values, and conscience."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Other topics===

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' summary, the encyclical is "sweeping" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages/45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as [[urban planning]], [[agricultural economics]], and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to [[abortion]], [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell research]] and [[population control]] – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt; "Since everything is interrelated," Francis says, "concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion."&lt;ref name="TheIndependent" /&gt; According to the Pope, we can't in fact "genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

''Laudato si''' opposes [[gender theory]] and supports "valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity." In acknowledging differences, the Pope states "we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment."&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;

===Sources===

The encyclical has 172 footnoted citations,&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; many to Francis's immediate predecessors, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The encyclical also "draws prominently from" [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Church of Constantinople]] and an ally of the pope.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  More than 10% of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the [[global south]].&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences.&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The encyclical also cites Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]; [[Ali al-Khawas]], a 9th-century [[Islamic mysticism|Sufi mystic]];&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mystic /&gt; [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]; and [[Romano Guardini]].&lt;ref name=Faggioli /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early stages ===
Speculation about an "environmental encyclical" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013.&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt; On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. The Rev. [[Federico Lombardi]], the [[Holy See Press Office]] director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the "ecology of man").&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt;

Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the second section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and the [[theologian of the Papal Household]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Edits were made based on their responses.&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt;

In drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months.&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt; One of the experts consulted was [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], the founder and head of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

On 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president [[Rafael Correa]] and American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name=weight /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchgaessner" /&gt;

The title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a [[Twitter]] message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015.&lt;ref name=titled /&gt; The Vatican confirmed that the title would be ''Laudato si' '' on 10 June.&lt;ref name=confirms /&gt; While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called ''Laudato Sii'', this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single ''i''.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

On 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was "already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change" – would be released on 18 June.&lt;ref name=released /&gt;

=== Leak ===
Four days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' posted a leaked draft of the document online.&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; The leaked document "almost exactly matched" the final document.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The leak angered [[Vatican Curia|Vatican officials]]&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who called it a "heinous act"&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; and revoked the press credentials of the longtime ''L'Espresso''  Vatican correspondent [[Sandro Magister]].&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' and the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt;

=== Release ===
The encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and [[John Zizioulas]] (the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], representing the Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name=expert /&gt; On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt; It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the [[United Nations]] on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

== Reception ==
{{globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=July 2015}}
After the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many  people tried to read it.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  It has been described as "one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century" and "has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  It contains, according to [[Paul Vallely]], "a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== Within Roman Catholic Church ===
The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], led by its president [[Joseph Edward Kurtz]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|archbishop of Louisville]], described the encyclical as "our marching orders for advocacy"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and with the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=cama /&gt;  Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] of Boston said that the "constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect "Our Common Home" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis."&lt;ref name=omalley/&gt;

Filipino Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], wrote that "In ''Laudato si''' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must "give, and not simply give up." We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family."&lt;ref name=tagle/&gt;

The three bishops of Northern and Central California, [[Stephen Blaire]], [[Armando Xavier Ochoa]], and [[Jaime Soto]], issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor.  "The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand," the trio said. "We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks."&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

Bishop [[Richard Pates]] of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which has the first major [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good will, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change."&lt;ref name=plates/&gt;

[[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg|Archbishop of Hamburg]] [[Stefan Heße]] praised the encyclical, calling it "valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation." He commented further, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/ebhh/layer/layer_suchergebnis.php?we_objectID=4408&amp;pid=2|title = Erzbischof würdigt Umwelt-Enzyklika des Papstes|last =|first =|date = 18 June 2015|work = Erzbistum Hamburg|language = German|trans-title = Archbishop commends environmental papal encyclical|access-date = 11 March 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/bishops-react-to-laudato-si/|title = Bishops react to Laudato si'|last = de Vries|first = Mark|date = 19 June 2015|website = In Caelo et in Terra|publisher =|access-date = 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Vaticanology|Vaticanologist]] [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], said in an analysis, "''Laudato si''' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the [[dignity]] of human life and [[economic justice]] as a cornerstone of [[Catholic social teaching]]. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change."&lt;ref name=earthquake /&gt;

Catholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;

====Criticism====
Samuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian [[Acton Institute]], has criticized "the sheer overreach that plagues" ''Laudato si'''.&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  [[RealClearReligion]] editor Nicholas Hahn has said that "Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

This criticism comes despite the fact that Francis took "care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes," especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== From other faiths ===
Three days before the encyclical was released, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] issued a Twitter message stating: "Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity."&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

Two days before the encyclical was released, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]], head of the [[Anglican Communion]], issued a "green declaration" (also signed by the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Conference]] as well as representatives of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a [[low-carbon economy]] and fasting and prayer for success at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=joins /&gt;

The same day, the [[Lausanne Movement]] of global [[evangelical Christian]]s said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;  The encyclical was also welcomed by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Pope Francis's environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|''Laudato si''']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths – Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

=== From world leaders ===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=spokesman /&gt; [[Kofi Annan]], the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the [[Africa Progress Panel]], also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating "As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?"&lt;ref name=chair /&gt;

[[Christiana Figueres]], the executive secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], said: "Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Vidal" /&gt;

On the same day, [[Jim Yong Kim]], the president of the [[World Bank Group]], also praised the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

=== From the scientific community ===
Science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] observes that ''Laudato si''' "insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic."&lt;ref name=Heald/&gt;&lt;ref name=oreskes/&gt;

The encyclical gave a boost to the [[fossil fuel divestment]] movement.&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt;  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] (PIK) and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]], who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that "the science of ''Laudato si' '' is watertight" and gave the pontiff an "A" for command of the subject.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' praised the encyclical for its statements about [[sustainability]] and global poverty and the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to [[renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]: "The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; However it criticized Francis for ignoring important issues like [[family planning]] and [[birth control]]. "Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;

A review by nine climate scientists under the [[Climate Feedback]] project concluded the encyclical "rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change" and "fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community."&lt;ref name=feedback/&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]], chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that "The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues.... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

{{anchor|Daly's comment}}
Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it "... unifies the main divisions of [[Christianity]] on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the [[Earth]] out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures." Daly even believes that the Pope "skates fairly close to the idea of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]]," although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible [[family planning]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] were "conspicuously near-absent" in the encyclical.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt;

===Impact on the United States political system===
[[Stephen F. Schneck]], the director of Institute for Policy Research &amp; Catholic Studies at [[The Catholic University of America]], has said that "Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that "it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt; Nonetheless, she added, "Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge," could influence political culture in Washington. "If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift."

[[Miami]] Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]], chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that "The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  He also asked them to "resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  Schneck opined that "This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

Cornell anthropologists [[Annelise Riles]] and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: "We find ''Laudato Si''' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think."&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/09/26/442485534/excited-about-the-popes-visit-read-laudato-si "Excited About The Pope's Visit? Read 'Laudato Si'"] Cosmos &amp; Culture, NPR.org (26 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party nomination for president of the United States]] in 2016, including [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who "have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels."&lt;ref name=davenport /&gt; Jeb Bush said: "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt;

====Neoconservative critique and counterarguments====
[[Neoconservative]] circles in the United States have criticized the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;  Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', [[Irwin M. Stelzer]] has argued that

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Pope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of "savage capitalism". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, [[St. Basil of Caesarea]], who called money "the devil's dung", has railed against the "anonymous influences of mammon" and a "new colonialism" that includes "free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity," and stated a preference for "cooperatives". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing "a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses," and that "there is an urgent need of a true world political authority," and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.&lt;ref name=Stelzer/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From industry ===
A [[lobbyist]] of [[Arch Coal]] sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope "does not appear to address the tragedy of global [[energy poverty]]." The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor.&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt; The email suggested "talking points" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: "Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result." In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/122052/climate-deniers-say-nope-red-pope  Climate Deniers Say Nope to "Red Pope"], ''The New Republic'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From other groups ===

The [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the [[transsexuality]] movement, calling for "the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift."&lt;ref name="TheAdvocate"/&gt;

[[Bill McKibben]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' reviewed the encyclical.&lt;ref name="McKibben"/&gt;

== In music ==
On behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Diocese of Limburg]], [[Peter Reulein]] wrote the music for the [[oratorio]] ''[[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si' – a Franciscan Magnificat]]'' to the [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]].&lt;ref name="Laudato si-score"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reulein | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | authorlink2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | pages = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is based on the Latin version of the [[Magnificat]], corresponds to the ''[[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]],'' and includes texts from the [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' and the [[encyclical]] ''Laudato si'''.

[[Liberalism]] in the [[Netherlands]] started as an anti-monarchical effort spearheaded by the Dutch statesman [[Thorbecke]], who almost single-handedly wrote the 1848 [[Constitution of the Netherlands]] that turned the country into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. 

In contemporary politics, there are both [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties that refer to themselves as "[[Liberalism|liberal]]", with the former more often espousing [[social liberalism]] and the latter more often espousing [[classical liberalism]]. A common characteristic of these parties that they are nominally [[irreligious]], in contrast to the traditionally dominant and still popular Christian parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.expatica.com/nl/about/Whats-liberal-politics-in-the-Netherlands_104646.html What's liberal politics in the Netherlands?], ''Expatica''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article gives an overview of liberalism in the Netherlands. It is limited to [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]] with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. 

==Background==
The Netherlands has a long liberal political tradition. From the founding of the [[Dutch Republic]] in the 16th century to beginning of the 19th century the main political conflict was between the liberal urban patriciate and the supporters of the [[House of Orange]], from the lower class and orthodox variants of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudy Andeweg|Andeweg, R.B.]] and G.A. Irwin (2002) ''Governance and Politics of the Netherlands'' Basingstoke: MacMillan, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The urban patriciate favoured [[religious tolerance]]. Between mid-19th century to the late-1800 they were a dominant force in shaping the Dutch [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentary democratic]] ''[[rechtsstaat]]''. In the early 20th century the liberals split between [[progressive liberalism|progressive liberals]] and [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]]. Due to their political division and the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] the liberals disappeared from the political stage. After the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Second World War]] the liberals were united again under one roof, the [[VVD]], but the party remained small. It entered some administration coalitions as a junior party. A progressive liberal party, [[D'66]] was founded in 1966. Since the 1970s however liberalism has been on the rise again electorally. Since 1977 the largest, more conservative, liberal party, VVD has been in government for twenty two years. In early 21st century the VVD saw major splits over the issue of integration and migration. In 2010, they won the national elections for the first time in its history.

=== Before 1918 ===
[[File:Johan Heinrich Neuman - Johan Rudolf Thorbecke.jpg|thumb|left|Johan Rudolph Thorbecke in 1852, during his first term as Prime Minister.]]

In the early years of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1814–1848) the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] was dominated by conservatives supportive of the policy of government of [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] and later [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]]. From 1840 onward, the amount of liberals in the House gradually increased. These liberals advocated a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected House of Representatives and in which the ministers, not the King, had executive power. In 1844, nine liberal representatives led by the jurist and historian [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]] attempted in vain to amend the constitution and introduce parliamentary democracy. In 1848, amidst a [[Revolutions of 1848|wave of revolutions]] across Europe, the balance of power shifted in favour of the liberals. In order to prevent civil unrest in the Netherlands, William II formed a commission, chaired by Thorbecke, which would draft a new [[constitution of the Netherlands|constitution]].&lt;ref name=Liberalen&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrqlywl/liberalen |title=Liberalen |website=Parlement &amp; Politiek |language=Dutch |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution, which was introduced in October 1848, limited the power of the king by introducing [[ministerial responsibility]] and by giving parliament the right to amend laws and hold investigative hearings. It also extended the [[census suffrage]] and codified [[civil rights]], such as the [[freedom of assembly]], the [[privacy of correspondence]], freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the [[freedom of education]].

In the period following the constitutional amendment, liberalism was the dominant political force in the Netherlands. Liberalism also dominated the universities, the media and business.&lt;ref name="Andeweg, R.B 2002 p.48"&gt;Andeweg, R.B. and G.A. Irwin (2002) ''Governance and Politics of the Netherlands'' Basingstoke: MacMillan, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The liberals supported a [[laissez-faire]] economy, [[free trade]], civil rights and a gradual expansion of suffrage.&lt;ref name=Liberalen/&gt; Thorbecke became [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] in 1849, and would serve two more terms throughout his lifetime. Because of their dominant position, the liberals did not deem it necessary to organise themselves in a political party. Instead there was a loose liberal [[parliamentary group]] and locally organised liberal [[caucus]]es. The liberals also did not organize their own [[pillarization|pillar]], a system of like-minded social organisations. The liberals were politically allied with the [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholics]], whom the liberals granted considerable [[freedom of religion]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} After Thorbecke's death in 1872, the liberals grew increasingly disunited. By 1897, a division had emerged between the supporters of the progressive liberal [[Jan Kappeyne van de Coppello]] on the one side, and those of the conservative liberal [[Johan George Gleichman]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrq0xzq/bond_van_vrije_liberalen |title=Bond van Vrije Liberalen |website=Parlement &amp; Politiek |language=Dutch |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in the late 19th century, when the opposition began to organise itself in the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] and the [[Roman Catholic State Party]], the liberals followed suit. On 4 March 1885, the [[Liberal Union (Netherlands)|Liberal Union]] was established. In the 1890s some liberals, such as [[Samuel van Houten]], [[Johannes Tak van Poortvliet]] and Kappeyne van de Coppello started to propose a more active role of the government, breaking with the Thorbeckian laissez-faire ideal. This led to the establishment of the progressive [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] in 1901. The liberals saw a second split with the establishment of the more conservative liberal [[League of Free Liberals]] in 1906. There are different names for these two tendencies. The more progressive liberals have been called "radical", "freeminded" or "democratic" liberals, while the more conservative liberals have been called "free" or "old" liberals. The issue which divided the liberals most was the question whether to extend the [[Householder Franchise|census]] or even to introduce [[universal suffrage]], the progressive liberals favoured universal suffrage, the conservative liberals did not. The progressive liberals also favoured government intervention in the economy, such as Van Houten's ban on child labour.

Due to the [[Two-round system|two round electoral system]] the liberals were required to cooperate. In order to prevent the [[Coalition (Netherlands)|coalition of Catholics and Protestants]] win the second round of the elections, all the liberals united behind their candidates in the second round, often joined by [[socialism in the Netherlands|social democrats]]. This alliance was called the [[concentration (Netherlands)|concentration]]. On basis of concentration pluralities, often supported by social democrats for a majority several cabinets were formed in the early 20th century.

In 1917 under one of these liberal minority cabinets [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] was introduced, as well as a [[proportional electoral system]] and [[School struggle (Netherlands)|equal finance for religious schools]], this compromise was called the [[pacification of 1917]]. The extension of suffrage however severely weakened the position of the liberals. Of the 37 seats they had in [[Dutch general election, 1917|1917]], they were left with 14 in [[Dutch general election, 1918|1918]].

=== 1918-1994 ===
{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
In 1922 the liberal parties reorganized: all conservative liberals, from the Liberal Union and the League Free Liberals as well as more conservative liberals from smaller parties, joined to form the [[Liberal State Party]]. The progressive liberals remained separate in the [[Vrijzinnig Democratische Bond|Freeminded Democratic League]], a merger of the Radical League and progressive liberals, that had already been formed in 1901. In the [[interbellum]] the liberals grew even smaller. Under pressure of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the rise of the [[Nationaal Socialistische Beweging|National Socialist Movement]]. The liberals did cooperate as junior partners in several cabinets in the crisis.

After the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Second World War]] the conservative liberal Liberal State Party refounded itself as [[Partij van de Vrijheid|Freedom Party]]. The progressive liberal Freeminded Democratic League joined the new ''[[Doorbraak]]'' leftwing [[Partij van de Arbeid|Labour Party]]. Several progressives were unhappy with the social-democratic course of the PvdA and joined the Freedom Party to found the [[VVD|People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] in 1948.

The VVD remained a small party until the 1970s, with about 10% of the vote. They did however form part of the government both in the [[grand coalition]] with social-democrats, Catholics and Protestants in the late 1940s early 1950s, and with the Catholics and Protestants over the course of the 1960s. The party was led by the former leader of the Freeminded Democratic League, [[Pieter Oud]]. In the Dutch [[pillarization|pillarized]] political system the liberals mainly appealed to urban, secular upper and middle class. The liberals did not have a strong pillar of social organization, such as trade unions and news papers, like the other political families had. Instead they were aligned with the weak neutral pillar&lt;ref&gt;Andeweg, R.B. and G.A. Irwin (2002) ''Governance and Politics of the Netherlands'' Basingstoke: MacMillan, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[democracy|democratic]] party was founded, [[Democrats 66]]. In the foundation several progressive liberals from the VVD had been involved. The party sought to radically democratize the political system, the society and the economy. D66 was led by the charismatic [[Hans van Mierlo]]. The party joined forces with the social-democratic PvdA and the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals|PPR]] to work for a more fair and democratic Netherlands. The party participated in the leftwing [[Netherlands cabinet Den Uyl|cabinet Den Uyl]]. Over the course of the 1980s however the party began to espouse a more progressive liberal course, especially under [[Jan Terlouw]]. The party remained an ally of the PvdA however, joining a short-lived centre-left coalition [[Netherlands cabinet Van Agt-2|cabinet]] with the PvdA and the Christian democratic [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]] in 1981.

In the meanwhile the VVD had grown considerably. Under the leadership of [[Hans Wiegel]] the VVD has taken a more conservative course.&lt;ref name="Andeweg, R.B 2002 p.48"/&gt; The party began to criticize the large and inefficient [[welfare state]]. The party combined this [[economic liberalism]] with progressive positions on social issues, which characterized the 1970s, such as [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], homosexuality and women's rights. The VVD capitalized the weakening of religious and [[pillarization|depillarization]] of the 1970s and made considerable electoral gains: in 1967 the party won just over 10% in 1981 this had more than doubled to 23%.

Between 1982 and 1986 the VVD cooperated in the centre-right [[Netherlands cabinet Lubbers-1|cabinets Lubbers]], which implemented a far reaching reform of the welfare state the VVD had advocated since the 1970s.

=== After 1994 ===
In [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994]] the Christian democratic CDA lost its traditional electoral power base. The VVD and D66 won considerably. A progressive [[purple (cabinet)|purple]] [[First cabinet of Wim Kok|cabinet]] was formed by D66, the VVD and the PvdA. The cabinet managed a [[economy of the Netherlands|thriving Dutch economy]], implemented progressive social legislation on [[euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]], [[gay marriage in the Netherlands|gay marriage]] and [[prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]]. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 election campaign]] the purple coalition came under heavy criticism of the populist politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] for mismanaging the public sector, migration and the integration of migrants. The two liberal parties lost considerably in the elections. Liberalism in the Netherlands came under attack after the shock assassination of Fortuyn just days before the election.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1977511.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The VVD however joined a [[First Balkenende cabinet|coalition cabinet]] with the [[Pim Fortuyn List|heirs of Fortuyn]] and the CDA. The cabinet fell shortly. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]] the D66 replaced the LPF. The centre-right cabinet implemented reforms of the welfare state and oversaw declining migration figures.

The issue of migration and integration however, and especially the place of the [[Islam in the Netherlands]].{{Incomprehensible inline|date=June 2016}} In 2003 the VVD had invited social-democratic critic of Islam, [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] to join their parliamentary party. She together with MP [[Geert Wilders]] caused considerable controversy with her direct criticism of the Islam. In the cabinet VVD minister [[Rita Verdonk]] sought to limit migration and stimulate integration of minorities. Two years after Fortuyn's assassination, another murder, this time of filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], put the country's liberal tradition at further risk.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Geert Wilders left the VVD to form the [[Party for Freedom]], which combined uncompromising criticism of Islam with a plea for lower taxation and [[Euroskepticism|skepticism towards European integration]]. In 2006 a conflict between Hirsi Ali and Verdonk over her status as an asylum seeker caused the downfall of the cabinet after D66 had revoked its confidence of Verdonk, whose positions on migration the party had already distanced itself from.

In the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the VVD and D66 lost considerably: D66 lost three of its six seats, the VVD six of its 28 seats. Wilders' PVV won nine seats. Rita Verdonk, second on the list of the VVD won more [[voorkeursstem|preference votes]] than the party's [[lijsttrekker|top candidate]] [[Mark Rutte]]. After demanding the leadership of the party, Verdonk left the VVD to form her own nationalist party, [[Proud of the Netherlands]].

In the European Parliament election of 2009, the VVD and D66 both won 3 seats each, while PVV picked up 4 seats. The PVV will be assigned the additional seat that becomes the Netherlands after the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] is signed. The VVD and D66 joined the Liberal fraction in the European Parliament, while the PVV did not register as member of any fraction.

In the [[Dutch general election, 2010|2010 general election]] the VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, making a liberal-led coalition a possibility for the first time [[Liberalism in the Netherlands#Before 1918|since 1918]]. Also D66 increased their number of seats to 10.  Ultimately, the VVD opted for a coalition with the CDA, with VVD leader [[Mark Rutte]] as prime minister—the first liberal to hold the post since 1918.

In [[contract law]], a '''mistake''' is an erroneous belief, ''at contracting'', that certain facts are true.  It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found [[Void (law)|void ''ab initio'']] or [[voidable]], or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'.  The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.

Another breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Mistake in Contract Law" by Melvin A. Eisenberg|url = http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol91/iss6/3/|website = scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
'''Mistake''' can be-
(1) Mistake of Law; or
(2) Mistake of Fact

'''Mistake of law''': when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is ''induced'' to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Illustration''': Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Mistake of Fact''': Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.

'''Explanation''': An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.{{R|"McRae v Commonwealth"}}

'''Illustration''': A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood v. Walker (MI).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Illustration''': Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.&lt;ref&gt;Wood v. Boynton (WI)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unilateral mistakes==
{{Contract law}}
A unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract.&lt;ref name="Taylor v Johnson"/&gt; This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ordinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;  Traditionally, [[Caveat Emptor]] (let the buyer beware), and under Common Law [[Caveat emptor#Caveat venditor|Caveat Venditor]] (let the seller beware).

===Exceptions===

A contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:

:(1)  One party relied on a statement of the other about a material fact that the second party knew or should have known was mistaken by the first party.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|page=227|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(2)  “clerical error that did not result in [[gross negligence]]”&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

::For mechanical calculations, a party may be able to set aside the contract on these grounds provided that the other party does not try to take advantage of the mistake, or 'snatch up' the offer (involving a bargain that one did not intend to make, betrayed by an error in arithmetic etc.). This will be seen by an objective standard, or if a reasonable person would be able to know that the mistake would not make sense to one of the parties. Unless one of the parties 'snatched up' the one-sided offer, courts will otherwise uphold the contract.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

:(3)  The mistake was “[[Unconscionability|unconscionable]]”, i.e. so serious and unreasonable to be outrageous.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

==Mutual mistake==
A mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same ''material'' fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. ''Collateral'' mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be ''material'' (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.

This is easily confused with [[mutual assent]] cases such as ''Raffles v Wichelhaus''.{{R|"Raffles v Wichelhaus"}}

In ''Raffles'', there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named ''Peerless'', but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.

In this case, both parties believed there was a "meeting of the minds," but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract.  Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.

==Common mistake==
A common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.

The [[House of Lords]] case of ''[[Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.]]''{{R|"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd"}} established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.

Later in ''Solle v Butcher'',{{R|"Solle v Butcher"}} [[Lord Denning]] added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as ''[[Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd]]''.{{R|"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd"}}. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in [[Queensland]]), see ''Svanosio v McNamara''.{{R|"Svanosio v McNamara"}}  For Queensland, see ''Australian Estates v Cairns City Council''.{{R|"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council"}}

Those categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a "decisional mistake," which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an "ignorant mistake," unaware of the true state of affairs.

The difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.

===''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.''===
Under [[New Mexico]] law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. ''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.'', 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):

‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.
‘…
‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’

56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act{{R|"Uniform Fiduciaries Act"}}).

===''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456''===
Roswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Mexico]], and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably ''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456'', 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.

The Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:

:‘At what point does negligence cease and bad faith begin? The distinction between them is that bad faith, or dishonesty, is, unlike negligence, wilful. The mere failure to make inquiry, even though there be suspicious circumstances, does not constitute bad faith, unless said failure is due to the deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction, – that is to say, where there is an intentional closing of the eyes or stopping of the ears.’

===''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.''===
''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. [[Girard Trust Co.]]'', 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).

:A firm processing information in order to transfer title using information provided by customers lacked the intent to commit illegal or improper acts when the information furnished to it was wrong. It was not part of its job description to know better, and it did not know better, and charged only a nominal fee for the clerical work, clearly not including any investigation. Further, it could not be in a conspiracy with another party or several parties who knew the information was wrong but failed to inform the title firm. The title firm could not unknowingly become part of a conspiracy of which it was never informed, and from which it could derive no benefit. The attempt to enhance liability or shift blame by filtering data through an innocent party has been tried before, but where the conduit providing document preparation does not know more than its informants, and was not hired or paid to investigate, it is not liable in their place for using their bad facts without guilty knowledge.

===''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States''===
The law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in ''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States'', 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce "anti-dumping" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.

The ''Hynix'' court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” ''Century Importers, Inc. v. United States'', 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and a mistake of fact, “…where either (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to [exist],” quoting ''Hambro Auto. Corp. v. United States'', 66 C.C.P.A. 113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (“A mistake of fact is any mistake except a mistake of law.” Id. at 855) Hynix, 414 F. Supp. 2d. at 1325.

''Hynix'', in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between “decisional mistakes” and “ignorant mistakes.” Id. at 1326; ''G &amp; R Produce Co, v. U.S.'', 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); ''Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S.'', 140 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (2001); ''Universal Cooperatives, Inc. v. United States'', 715 F. Supp. 1113, 1114 (1989).

‘Decisional mistakes are mistakes of law and occur when “…a party [makes] the wrong choice between two known, alternative sets of facts.” ''Universal Cooperatives'', (citation partly omitted), 715 F. Supp. at 1114. On the other hand, an ignorant mistake occurs where “…a party is unaware of the existence of the correct alternative set of facts.” Id. “In order for the goods to be reliquidated under 1520 (c) (1), the alleged mistake of fact must be an ignorant mistake.” Prosegur, (citation partly omitted), 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1378.’ ''Hynix'' at 1326.

''Hynix'' provided one more criterion, and that is “materiality,” citing to extensive development of that requirement in ''Degussa Canada Ltd. v. United States'', 87 F.3d 1301, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and ''Xerox Corp. v. United States'', 2004 C.I.T. (Sept. 8, 2004) (“[A] mistake of fact … is a factual error that, if the correct fact had been known, would have resulted in a different classification.”) The error must be “material” in order to be corrected without consequence.

{{War}}
The '''philosophy of war''' is the area of [[philosophy]] devoted to examining issues such as the causes of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the [[ethics]] of war. Certain aspects of the philosophy of war overlap with the [[philosophy of history]], [[political philosophy]], [[international relations]] and the [[philosophy of law]].

==Works about the philosophy of war==
[[File:Carl von Clausewitz.PNG|thumb|Carl von Clausewitz, painting by [[Karl Wilhelm Wach]].]]Perhaps the greatest and most influential work in the [[philosophy]] of war is ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. It combines observations on strategy with questions about [[human nature]] and the purpose of war. Clausewitz especially examines the [[teleology]] of war: whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself. He concludes that the latter cannot be so, and that war is "[[politics]] by different means"; i.e. that war must not exist only for its own sake. It must serve some purpose for the state.

[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war (and broader [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculations derived from [[Christianity]] and from Tolstoy's observations of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). It was influential on later thought about war. Tolstoy's [[Christian]]-centered philosophy of war (especially his essays "[[A Letter to a Hindu]]" and "[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]") was a direct influence on [[Gandhi]]'s [[Hinduism]]-centered [[non-violent resistance]] philosophy.

While [[Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu's]] ''[[The Art of War]]'', focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy, his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself (see the main Wikipedia article on ''The Art of War'' for a discussion of the application of Sun Tzu's philosophy to areas other than war). Parts of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli's]] masterpiece ''[[The Prince]]'' (as well as ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]]'') and parts of his own work titled ''The Art of War'' discuss some philosophical points relating to war, though neither book could be said to be a work in the philosophy of war.

==Just war theory==
[[Just war theory]] is a sect of war philosophy thought to have been founded by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].  The philosophy of just war theorizes what aspects of war are justifiable according to morally acceptable principles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Augustine/augustine_justwar.html|title=Great Philosophers: Augustine on War|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just war theory is based upon four core criteria to be followed by those determined to go to war. The four principles are as follows: just authority; just cause; right intention; last resort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just authority===
The criterion of just authority refers to the determined legality of going to war, has the concept of war and the pursuit of it been legally processed and justified?&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.equip.org/article/just-war-tradition/|title=Just War Tradition - Christian Research Institute|work=Christian Research Institute|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just cause===
Just cause is a justifiable reason that war is the appropriate and necessary response. If war can be avoided, that must be determined first, according to the philosophy of just war theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Right intention===
To go to war, one must determine if the intentions of doing so are right according to morality. Right intention criterion requires the determination of whether or not a war response is a measurable way to the conflict being acted upon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Last resort===
War is a last resort response, meaning that if there is a conflict between disagreeing parties, all solutions must be attempted before resorting to war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traditions of thought==
Since the philosophy of war is often treated as a subset of another branch of philosophy (for example, political philosophy or the philosophy of law) it would be difficult to define any clear-cut schools of thought in the same sense that, e.g., [[Existentialism]] or [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] can be described as distinct movements. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Carl von Clausewitz is "the only (so-called) philosopher of war", implying that he is the only (major) philosophical writer who develops a philosophical system focusing ''exclusively'' on war. However, discernible traditions of thought on war have developed over time, so that some writers have been able to distinguish broad categories (if somewhat loosely).

===Teleological categories===
[[Anatol Rapoport]]'s introduction to his edition of the [[J. J. Graham]] [[translation]] of Clausewitz's ''On War'' identifies three main teleological traditions in the philosophy of war: the cataclysmic, the [[eschatology|eschatological]], and the political. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). These are not the only possible teleological philosophies of war, but only three of the most common. As Rapoport says,

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;To put it [[metaphor]]ically, in political philosophy war is compared to a game of strategy (like [[chess]]); in eschatological philosophy, to a mission or the dénouement of a [[drama]]; in cataclysmic philosophy, to a [[fire]] or an [[epidemic]].

These do not, of course, exhaust the views of war prevailing at different times and at different places. For example, war has at times been viewed as a pastime or an [[adventure]], as the only proper occupation for a [[nobleman]], as an affair of [[honor]] (for example, the days of [[chivalry]]), as a [[ceremony]] (e.g. among the [[Aztecs]]), as an outlet of aggressive [[instinct]]s or a manifestation of a "[[Suicide|death wish]]", as [[nature]]'s way of ensuring the [[survival of the fittest]], as an [[absurdity]] (e.g. among [[Eskimos]]), as a tenacious custom, destined to die out like [[slavery]], and as a [[crime]]. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 17)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

*The '''Cataclysmic''' school of thought, which was espoused by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', sees war as a bane on humanity – whether avoidable or inevitable – which serves little purpose outside of causing destruction and suffering, and which may cause drastic change to [[society]], but not in any teleological sense. Tolstoy's view may be placed under the subcategory of global cataclysmic philosophy of war.  Another subcategory of the cataclysmic school of thought is the [[ethnocentric]] cataclysmic, in which this view is focused specifically on the plight of a specific [[ethnicity]] or [[nation]], for example the view in [[Judaism]] of war as a [[punishment]] from [[God]] on the [[Israelites]] in certain books of the [[Tanakh|Tenakh]] ([[Old Testament]]). As the Tenakh (in certain books) sees war as an ineluctable act of God, so Tolstoy especially emphasizes war as something that befalls man and is in no way under the influence of man's "[[free will]]", but is instead the result of irresistible global forces. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction 16)
*The '''Eschatological''' school of thought sees all wars (or all major wars) as leading to some goal, and asserts that some final conflict will someday resolve the path followed by all wars and result in a massive upheaval of society and a subsequent new society free from war (in varying theories the resulting society may be either a [[utopia]] or a [[dystopia]]). There are two subsets of this view: the Messianic and the Global theory. The [[Marxist]] concept of a [[communist]] world ruled by the [[proletariat]] after a final worldwide [[revolution]] is an example of the global theory, and the [[Christian]] concept of an [[Armageddon]] war which will usher in the [[second coming]] of [[Christ]] and the final defeat of [[Satan]] is an example of a theory that could fall under Global or Messianic. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) The [[messiah|messianic]] eschatological philosophy is derived from the Jewish-Christian concept of a [[Messiah]], and sees wars as culminating in unification of humanity under a single [[faith]] or a single ruler. [[Crusades]], [[Jihad]]s, the [[Nazi]] concept of a [[Master Race]] and the 19th century American concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] may also fall under this heading. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) (See main articles for more information: [[Christian eschatology]], [[Jewish eschatology]])
*The '''Political''' school of thought, of which Clausewitz was a proponent, sees war as a tool of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. On page 13 Rapoport says,

{{quote|Clausewitz views war as a rational instrument of national [[policy]]. The three words "[[Rationality|rational]]", "[[Tool|instrument]]" and "national" are the key concepts of his paradigm. In this view, the decision to wage war "ought" to be rational, in the sense that it ought to be based on estimated costs and gains of war. Next, war "ought" to be instrumental, in the sense that it ought to be waged in order to achieve some goal, never for its own sake; and also in the sense that strategy and tactics ought to be directed towards just one end, namely towards victory. Finally, war "ought" to be national, in the sense that its objective should be to advance the interests of a national state and that the entire effort of the nation ought to be mobilized in the service of the military objective.}}

:He later characterizes the philosophy behind the [[Vietnam War]] and other [[Cold War]] conflicts as "Neo-Clausewitzian". Rapoport also includes Machiavelli as an early example of the political philosophy of war (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). Decades after his essay, the [[War on Terrorism]] and the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq War]] begun by the [[United States]] under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2001 and 2003 have often been justified under the [[doctrine of preemption]], a political motivation stating that the United States must use war to prevent further attacks such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

===Ethical categories===
Another possible system for categorizing different schools of thought on war can be found in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see external links, below), based on [[ethics]]. The SEP describes three major divisions in the ethics of war: the realist, the pacifist, and the just war Theory. In a nutshell:

* '''Realists''' will typically hold that systems of [[morals]] and ethics which guide ''individuals'' within societies cannot realistically be applied to societies as a whole to govern the way they, as societies, interact with other societies. Hence, a state's purposes in war is simply to preserve its national interest. This kind of thinking is similar to Machiavelli's philosophy, and [[Thucydides]] and [[Hobbes]] may also fall under this category.
* '''[[Pacifism]]''' however, maintains that a moral evaluation of war is possible, and that war is always found to be immoral. Generally, there are two kinds of modern secular pacifism to consider: (1) a more consequentialist form of pacifism (or CP), which maintains that the benefits accruing from war can never outweigh the costs of fighting it; and (2) a more deontological form of pacifism (or DP), which contends that the very activity of war is intrinsically wrong, since it violates foremost duties of justice, such as not killing human beings. [[Eugene Victor Debs]] and others were famous advocates of pacifistic [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] methods instead of war.
* '''[[Nonviolence]]''' also holds that a moral evaluation of war is a duty, and that war is always found to be immoral. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all famous advocates of [[power of truth]], [[law]]fulness, [[soft power]], [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]] methods instead of war and to prevent war. Gandhi said he disliked more cowardice than violence.
* '''[[Just war theory]]''', along with pacifism, holds that morals do apply to war. However, unlike pacifism, according to just war theory it ''is'' possible for a war to be morally justified. The concept of a morally justified war underlies much of the concept [[International Law]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Hugo Grotius]] are among the philosophers who have espoused some form of a just war philosophy. One common just war theory evaluation of war is that war is only justified if 1.) waged in a state or nation's self-defense, or 2.) waged in order to end gross violations of [[human rights]]. Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] advocated these criteria as justification for war.

{{Criminology and penology|schools}}

In [[criminology]], the '''Positivist School''' has attempted to find scientific objectivity for the measurement and quantification of criminal behavior. As the [[scientific method]] became the major paradigm in the search for knowledge, the [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical School]]'s [[social philosophy]] was replaced by the quest for scientific laws that would be discovered by experts. It is divided into Biological, Psychological and Social.

==Biological positivism==
If [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of evolution]] was scientific as applied to animals, the same approach should be applied to "man" as an "animal".
===Physical characteristics===
Historically, [[medicine]] became interested in the problem of crime, producing studies of [[physiognomy]] (see [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]] and [[Franz Joseph Gall]]) and the science of [[phrenology]] which linked attributes of the mind to the shape of the [[Human brain|brain]] as reveal through the [[Human skull|skull]]. These theories were popular because they absolved [[society]] and any failures of its [[government]] of responsibility for criminal behavior.  The problem lay in the propensities of individual offenders who were biologically distinguishable from law-abiding [[citizen]]s. This theme was amplified by the [[Italian school of criminology|Italian School]] and through the writings of [[Cesare Lombroso]] (see ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''The Criminal Man'' and [[Anthropological criminology]]) which identified physical characteristics associated with [[Devolution (biology)|degeneracy]] demonstrating that criminals were [[atavism|atavistic]] throwbacks to an earlier evolutionary form. Charles Goring (1913) failed to corroborate the characteristics but did find criminals shorter, lighter and less intelligent, i.e. he found criminality to be "normal" rather than "pathological" (cf the work of [[Earnest Hooton|Hooton]] found evidence of biological inferiority). [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] identified three basic body or [[somatotype]]s (i.e. ''endomorphs, mesomorphs'', and ''ectomorphs''), and introduced a scale to measure where each individual was placed. He concluded that delinquents tended to mesomorphy. Modern research might link physical size and athleticism and aggression because physically stronger people have the capacity to use violence with less chance of being hurt in any retaliation. Otherwise, such early research is no longer considered valid. The development of [[genetics]] has produced another potential inherent cause of criminality, with [[chromosome]] and other genetic factors variously identified as significant to select heredity rather than environment as the cause of crime (''see: [[nature versus nurture]]''). However, the evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies shows no conclusive [[empirical evidence]] to prefer either cause.

===Intelligence===
There are a number of reputable studies that demonstrate a link between lower intelligence and criminality. But the evidence is equivocal because studies among the prison population simply test those criminals actually caught, which might be because they failed to plan the crimes properly or because they were unable to resist interrogation techniques and admitted their crimes. If their intelligence is poor, they are also less likely to be deterred.

===Other medical factors===
[[Testosterone]] and [[adrenaline]] have been associated with [[aggression]] and [[violence]], and the [[arousal]] and excited state associated with them. The excessive consumption of alcohol can lower blood sugar levels and lead to aggressiveness, and the use of chemicals in foods and drinks has been associated with hyper-activity and some criminal behaviour.

==Psychological positivism==
[[Sigmund Freud]] divided the personality into the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|id]], the primitive biological drives, the [[superego]], the internalised values, and the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]], [[memory]], [[perception]], and [[cognition]]. He proposed that criminal behaviour is either the result of [[mental illness]] or a weak conscience. [[John Bowlby]] proposed an [[attachment theory]] in which maternal deprivation was a factor that might lead to delinquency. This has been discounted in favour of general privation ([[Michael Rutter]]: 1981) or "broken homes" (Glueck: 1950) in which absentee or uncaring parents tend to produce badly behaved children.

[[Hans Eysenck]] (1987) stated that, "... certain types of personality may be more prone to react with anti-social or criminal behaviour to environmental factors of one kind or another."  He proposed three dimensions of personality: [[introversion]]/[[extroversion]], neuroticism, and [[psychoticism]]. For these purposes, personality is the settled framework of reference within which a person addresses the current situation and decides how to behave. Some traits will be dominant at times and then in a balanced relationship to other traits, but each person's traits will be reasonably stable and predictable (see Marshall: 1990 and Seidman: 1994). Hence, once conditioned into a criminal lifestyle, the relevant personality traits are likely to persist until a countervailing conditioning force re-establishes normal social inhibitions. Some forms of criminal behavior such as sexual offences, have been medicalised with treatment offered alongside punishment.

==Social positivism==
{{Main|Social positivism}}
In general terms, positivism rejected the Classical Theory's reliance on free will and sought to identify positive causes that determined the propensity for criminal behaviour. Rather than biological or psychological causes, this branch of the School identifies "society" as the cause. Hence, [[environmental criminology]] and other sub-schools study the spatial distribution of crimes and offenders (see [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who discovered that crimes rates are relatively constant, and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] which, under the leadership of [[Robert E. Park]], viewed the city as a form of superorganism, zoned  into areas engaged in a continuous process of invasion, dominance, and succession).  Meanwhile, [[Émile Durkheim]] identified society as a social phenomenon, external to individuals, with crime a normal part of a healthy society. Deviancy was nothing more than "boundary setting," pushing to determine the current limits of morality and acceptability.

In the [[history of biology]], '''preformationism''' (or '''preformism''') is a formerly-popular theory that organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves. Instead of assembly from parts, preformationists believed that the [[platonic forms|form]] of living things exist, in real terms, prior to their [[ontogeny|development]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Maienschein, Jane, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/epigenesis/ Epigenesis and Preformationism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that all [[organism]]s were created at the same time, and that succeeding generations grow from [[Homunculus|homunculi]], or [[animalcule]]s, that have existed since the beginning of creation.

[[Epigenesis (biology)|Epigenesis]]&lt;ref name=OED1&gt;According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: {{quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean 'partium super-exorientium additamentum', 'the additament of parts budding one out of another'.}}  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., "The formation of an organic germ as a new product"): {{quote | '''theory of epigenesis''': the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. ... The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (or neoformism),&lt;ref&gt;Callebaut, Marc, 2008: [http://www.naturalsciences.be/institute/associations/rbzs_website/bjz/back/pdf/BJZ%20138(1)/138_1_20_35html/Volume%20138(1),%20pp.%2020-35.html Historical evolution of preformistic versus neoformistic epigenetic thinking in embryology]. Belgian Journal of Zoology 138(1): 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt; then, in this context, is the denial of preformationism: the idea that, in some sense, the form of living things comes into existence.  As opposed to "strict" preformationism, it is the notion that "each embryo or organism is gradually produced from an undifferentiated mass by a series of steps and stages during which new parts are added" (Magner 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;154).&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;Magner, Lois. ''A History of the Life Sciences''. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This word is still used, on the other hand, in a more modern sense, to refer to those aspects of the generation of form during ontogeny that are not strictly genetic, or, in other words, ''[[epigenetics|epigenetic]]''.

Furthermore, apart from those distinctions (preformationism-epigenesis and genetic-epigenetic), the terms preformistic development, epigenetic development and [[somatic embryogenesis]] are also used in another context, in relation to the [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of a distinct [[germ cell]] line. In preformistic development, the germ line is present since early development. In epigenetic development, the germ line is present, but it appears late. In somatic embryogenesis, a distinct germ line is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, L.W. (1987). ''The Evolution of Individuality''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfj_AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Leo%20W.%20Buss%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors call [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist]] development (either preformistic or epigenetic) that in which there is a distinct germ line.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical ideas of preformationism and epigenesis, and the rivalry between them, are obviated by our [[genetics|contemporary understanding]] of the [[genetic code]] and its [[nucleic acid|molecular basis]] together with [[developmental biology]] and [[epigenetics]].

==Philosophical development==
[[Pythagoras]] is one of the earliest thinkers credited with ideas about the origin of form in the biological production of offspring. It is said&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;e.g. by Ian Johnston, Malaspina University-College, Nanaimo, BC, in "...And Still We Evolve:
A Handbook on the History of Modern Science", [http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect5.htm Section Five: Heredity and Modern Genetics], May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; that he originated "spermism", the doctrine that fathers contribute the essential characteristics of their offspring while mothers contribute only a material substrate. [[Aristotle]] accepted and elaborated this idea, and his writings are the vector that transmitted it to later Europeans. Aristotle purported to analyse ontogeny in terms of the material, formal, efficient, and teleological causes (as they are usually named by later anglophone philosophy) &amp;ndash; a view that, though more complex than some subsequent ones, is essentially more epigenetic than preformationist. Later, European physicians such as [[Galen]], [[Realdo Colombo]] and [[Girolamo Fabrici]] would build upon Aristotle's theories, which were prevalent well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

In 1651, [[William Harvey]] published ''On the Generation of Animals'' (''[[William Harvey|Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium]]''), a seminal work on [[embryology]] that contradicted many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas on the matter. Harvey famously asserted, for example, that ''ex ovo omnia''—all animals come from eggs. Because of this assertion in particular, Harvey is often credited with being the father of ovist preformationism. However, Harvey's ideas about the process of development were fundamentally epigenesist.&lt;ref name=Pinto-Correia&gt;Clara Pinto Correia, ''The Ovary of Eve: Egg and Sperm Preformation'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-66952-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[gametes]] (male sperm and female ova) were too small to be seen under the best magnification at the time, Harvey's account of fertilization was theoretical rather than descriptive.  Although he once postulated a "spiritous substance" that exerted its effect on the female body, he later rejected it as superfluous and thus unscientific. He guessed instead that fertilization occurred through a mysterious transference by contact, or contagion.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Harvey's epigenesis, more mechanistic and less vitalist than the Aristotelian version, was, thus, more compatible with the [[natural philosophy]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia"/&gt; Still, the idea that unorganized matter could ultimately self-organize into life challenged the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] framework of [[Cartesianism]], which had become dominant in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Because of technological limitations, there was no available mechanical explanation for epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1974) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VCnI02FwHAC&amp;pg=PA202 "On Heroes and Fools in Science."] ''Natural History'' 83 (7): 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was simpler and more convenient to postulate preformed miniature organisms that expanded in accordance with mechanical laws. So convincing was this explanation that some naturalists claimed to actually see miniature preformed animals ([[animalcule]]s) in eggs and miniature plants in seeds.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In the case of humans, the term [[homunculus]] was used.

== Elaboration ==

After the discovery of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] in 1677 by Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], the epigenist theory proved more difficult to defend: How could complex organisms such as human beings develop from such simple organisms? Thereafter, Joseph de Aromatari and then [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]] made observations using microscopes in the late 17th century, and interpreted their findings to develop the preformationist theory. For two centuries, until the development of [[cell theory]], preformationists would oppose epigenicists, and, inside the preformationist camp, spermists (who claimed the homunculus must come from the man) to ovists, who located the homunculus in the ova.

Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was one of the first to observe spermatozoa. He described the spermatozoa of about 30 species, and thought he saw in semen "all manner of great and small vessels, so various and so numerous that I do not doubt that they be nerves, arteries and veins...And when I saw them, I felt convinced that, in no full grown body, are there any vessels which may not be found likewise in semen." (Friedman 76-7)&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Friedman, David M. [[A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis]]. New York: The Free Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeuwenhoek discovered that the origin of semen was the testicles and was a committed preformationist and spermist. He reasoned that the movement of spermatozoa was evidence of animal life, which presumed a complex structure and, for human sperm, a soul. (Friedman 79)&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

In 1694, [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]], in his ''Essai de Dioptrique'' concerning things large and small that could be seen with optical lenses, produced an image of a tiny human form curled up inside the sperm, which he referred to in the French as ''petit l'infant'' and ''le petit animal''. This image, depicting what historians now refer to as the [[homunculus]], has become iconic of the theory of preformationism, and appears in almost every textbook concerning the history of embryological science.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia" /&gt;

Philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] was the first to advance the hypothesis that each embryo could contain even smaller embryos [[ad infinitum]], like a [[Matryoshka doll]]. According to Malebranche, "an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence." (Magner 158-9)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In fact, Malebranche only alleged this, observing that if microscopes enabled us to see very little animals and plants, maybe even smaller creatures could exist. He claimed that it was not unreasonable to believe that "they are infinite trees in only one seed," as he stated that we could already see chickens in eggs, tulips in bulbs, frogs in eggs. From this, he hypothesized that "all the bodies of humans and animals," already born and yet to be born, "were perhaps produced as soon as the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]." &lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Malebranche]], ''De la recherche de la vérité'' (The Search After Truth), book I, chapter VI, first section (1674-1675)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovum|Ova]] were known in some non-mammalian species, and [[semen]] was thought to spur the development of the preformed organism contained therein. The theory that located the homonculus in the egg was called [[ovism]]. But, when spermatozoa were discovered, a rival camp of [[spermism|spermists]] sprang up, claiming that the homunculus must come from the male. In fact, the term "spermatozoon," coined by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], means "seed animals."&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

With the discovery of sperm and the concept of spermism came a religious quandary. Why would so many little animals be wasted with each ejaculation of semen? [[Pierre Lyonet]] said the wastage proved that sperm could not be the seeds of life. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] supported a theory called [[panspermism]] that the wasted sperm might actually be scattered (for example, by the wind) and generate life wherever they found a suitable host.

Leibniz also believed that “death is only a transformation enveloped through diminution,” meaning that not only have organisms always existed in their living form, but that they will always exist, body united to soul, even past apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Justin Erik. “Leibniz’s Preformationism: Between Metaphysics and Biology.”Analecta Husserliana, the Yearbook of Phenomenological Research. Volume LXXVII. (2002) 161-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, some animalculists thought that an animal's sperm behaved like the adult animal, and recorded such observations. Some, but not all, preformationists at this time claimed to see miniature organisms inside the sex cells. But, about this time, spermists began to use more abstract arguments to support their theories.

[[Jean Astruc]], noting that parents of both sexes seemed to influence the characteristics of their offspring, suggested that the animalcule came from the sperm and was then shaped as it passed into the egg. [[Georges Louis Leclerc|Buffon]] and [[Pierre Louis Moreau]] also advocated theories to explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Preformationism, especially ovism, was the dominant theory of generation during the 18th century. It competed with [[spontaneous generation]] and [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]], but those two theories were often rejected on the grounds that inert matter could not produce life without God's intervention.
      
Some animals' [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] capabilities challenged preformationism, and [[Abraham Trembley]]'s studies of the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] convinced various authorities to reject their former views.
             
[[Lazaro Spallanzani]], Trembley's nephew, experimented with regeneration and semen, but failed to discern the importance of spermatozoa, dismissing them as parasitic worms and concluding instead that it was the liquid portion of semen that caused the preformed organism in the [[ovum]] to develop.

== Criticisms and cell theory ==

[[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]], an epigenicist, was an 18th-century exception who argued for objectivity and freedom from religious influence on scientific questions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Despite careful observation of developing embryos, epigenesis suffered from a lack of a theoretical mechanism of generation. Wolff proposed an "essential force" as the agent of change, and [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] proposed a "developing drive" or ''[[:de:Bildungstrieb|Bildungstrieb]]'', a concept related to [[self-organization]].

Naturalists of the late 18th century and the 19th century embraced Wolff's philosophy, but primarily because they rejected the application of mechanistic development, as seen in the expansion of miniature organisms. It was not until the late 19th century that preformationism was discarded in the face of [[cell theory]]. Now, scientists "realized that they need not treat living organisms as machines, nor give up all hope of ever explaining the mechanisms that govern living beings." (Magner 173)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

When [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] of matter [[scientific revolutions|superseded]] Descartes' philosophy of [[infinite divisibility]] at the beginning of the 19th century, preformationism was struck a further blow. There was not enough space at the bottom of the spectrum to accommodate infinitely stacked animalcules, without bumping into the constituent parts of matter. (Gee 43)&lt;ref name=Gee&gt;[[Henry Gee|Gee, Henry]]. ''Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roux and Driesch ==
Near the end of the 19th century, the most prominent advocates of preformationatism and epigenesis were [[Wilhelm Roux]] and [[Hans Driesch]]. Driesch's experiments on the development of the embryos of [[sea urchin]]s are considered as deciding the case in favor of epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard C.

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

==Early controversy and resolution==
Quantum mysticism in the sense of consciousness playing a role in quantum theory first appeared in Germany during the 1920s when some of the leading quantum physicists, such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]], leaned toward such interpretations of their theories. Others, such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Max Planck]], objected to these interpretations. Despite the accusation of mysticism from Einstein, [[Niels Bohr]] denied the charge, attributing it to misunderstandings. By the second half of the twentieth century the controversy had run its course&amp;mdash;Schrödinger's 1958 lectures are said to "mark the last of a generation that lived with the mysticism controversy"&amp;mdash;and today most physicists are [[scientific realism|realists]] who do not believe that quantum theory is involved with consciousness.&lt;ref name=notforgotten&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://phys.org/news163670588.html |title=Quantum Mysticism: Gone but Not Forgotten |publisher=Phys.org |author=Zyga, Lisa |date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wigner==
In 1961 [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote a paper, titled ''Remarks on the mind–body question'', suggesting that a conscious observer played a fundamental role in quantum mechanics,&lt;ref name=notforgotten/&gt;&lt;ref name=reading&gt;{{cite book |title=Reading Popular Physics: Disciplinary Skirmishes and Textual Strategies |author=Leane, Elizabeth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvnYaN8VnesC |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|93}} a part of the [[Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation]]. While his paper would serve as inspiration for later mystical works by others,&lt;ref name=notforgotten/&gt; Wigner's ideas were primarily philosophical and are not considered "in the same ballpark" as the mysticism that would follow.&lt;ref name=freewheeling&gt;{{cite journal |title=How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival |journal=Physics Today |date=September 2011 |author=Schweber, Silvan |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/64/9/10.1063/PT.3.1261 | doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1261 |volume=64 |pages=59|bibcode=2011PhT....64i..59S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appropriation by New Age thought==
In the early 1970s [[New Age]] culture began to incorporate ideas from quantum physics, beginning with books by [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Lawrence LeShan]], and others which suggested that purported [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena could be explained by quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=reading/&gt;{{rp|32}} In this decade the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]] emerged, a group of physicists who embraced quantum mysticism while engaging in parapsychology, [[Transcendental Meditation]], and various New Age and [[Eastern mysticism|Eastern mystical]] practices.&lt;ref name=hippies&gt;{{cite book |author=Kaiser, David |title=How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival |date=2011 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i59PHb9XhJcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by Wigner,&lt;ref name=notforgotten/&gt; [[Fritjof Capra]], a member of the Fundamental Fysiks Group,&lt;ref name=hippies/&gt; wrote ''[[The Tao of Physics|The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism]]'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism |location=Boston |publisher=Shambhala Publications |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book espousing New Age quantum physics that gained popularity among the non-scientific public.&lt;ref name=reading/&gt;{{rp|32}} In 1979 came the publication of ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]'' by [[Gary Zukav]],&lt;ref name=wuli&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dancing Wu Li Masters |author=Zukav, Gary |publisher=William Morrow And Company, Inc. |date=1979 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-scientist and "the most successful of Capra's followers".&lt;ref name=reading/&gt;{{rp|32}} The Fundamental Fysiks Group is said to be one of the agents responsible for the "huge amount of pseudoscientific nonsense" surrounding interpretations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=fun&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/fun-with-fysiks |title=Fun with Fysiks |journal=American Scientist |author=Woit, Peter |date=July–August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage and examples ==
In contrast to the mysticism of the early twentieth century, today quantum mysticism typically refers to its New Age incarnation that combines ancient mysticism with quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=stenger1997/&gt; Called a [[pseudoscience]] and a "hijacking" of quantum physics, it draws upon "coincidental similarities of language rather than genuine connections" to quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Collins2010/&gt; Physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]] coined the phrase "quantum flapdoodle" to refer to the misuse and misapplication of quantum physics to other topics.&lt;ref name=gods&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Gods: Creation, Chaos and the Search for Cosmic Consciousness |author=Stenger, Victor J. |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UwaiVz7ZlwC&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such misuse is New Age guru [[Deepak Chopra]]'s "quantum theory" that aging is caused by the mind, expounded in his books ''Quantum Healing'' (1989) and ''[[Ageless Body, Timeless Mind]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name=gods/&gt; In 1998 Chopra was awarded the parody [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in the physics category for "his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1998 The 1998 Ig Nobel Prize Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' dealt with a range of New Age ideas in relation to physics. It was produced by the [[Ramtha School of Enlightenment]] which was founded by [[J.Z. Knight]], a [[channeler]] who said that her teachings were based on a discourse with a 35,000-year-old disembodied entity named [[Ramtha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/09/16/bleep_2/ |title="Bleep" of faith |author=Gorenfeld, John |date=16 September 2004 |magazine=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring Fundamental Fysiks Group member [[Fred Alan Wolf]],&lt;ref name=fun/&gt; the film misused some aspects of quantum mechanics—including the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] and the [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]—as well as biology and medicine.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/06/30/2839498.htm |title=What the bleep are they on about? |first=Bernie |last=Hobbs |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 June 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous critics dismissed the film for its use of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Wilson |title=What the Bleep Do We Know?! |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |date=2005-01-13 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/reelscience/reviews/whatthe_bleep/ |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TGU"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/may/16/g2.science |title=Britain's best scientific brains give us their verdicts on a film about quantum physics |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">'''Resource justice''' (also referred to as "'''resource equity'''" or "'''resource governance'''") is a term in [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental ethics]]. It combines elements of [[distributive justice]] and [[climate justice]] and is based on the observation that many countries rich in [[natural resource]]s such as [[mineral]]s and other [[raw material]]s nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This [[resource curse]] is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.

== Factors leading to resource injustice ==

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|500px| Countries' income inequality according to their [[Gini coefficient]] – red = high, green = low inequality (World Bank, 2014)]]
The term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:
* [[Surface mining|Mining]] or [[Oil well|oil drilling]] result in severe damage to the environment, for example through [[oil spill]]s, [[environmental degradation]], or [[Pollution|contamination]].
* The extraction of resources leads to extreme forms of [[exploitation of labour]] and / or creates very [[Work accident|hazardous working conditions]].
* Resources are being controlled by a small elite that makes or embezzles all the profits. This often goes along with [[corruption]].
* People are forced off their land to make place for resource extraction or for large [[Monoculture|monocultural]] plantations.
* Resources in the developing world are being extracted by companies from industrialised countries, with most of the profits going to the latter.
* Companies extract genetic material, which is then commercially farmed or bred – and often [[Biological patent|patented]].

== Approaches towards greater resource justice ==

[[Capacity building]] and external support in order to empower "communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations" so that they themselves  are able to determine how local resources are being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/campaign/natural-resource-justice/ Natural Resource Justice], [[Oxfam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://namati.org/lawyers-for-resource-justice/ Lawyers for Resource Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mechanisms have to be developed to make sure that finite resources are distributed in an equitable way so that poor nations' right to development is not denied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books/about/Fair_Future.html?id=_l9U7olOSA0C Wolfgang Sachs, Tilman Santarius, Fair Future: Limited Resources and Global Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future, published by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] lists three criteria for a "fair and sustainable Resource Politics", namely:
* to "secure the rights of people and nature over markets and profits" and empower them to demand their rights;
* to return the "control over natural resources, financial capital and technologies (...) into the hands of the people;
* to "transform production, consumption and livelihoods" in ways that enable people to live in a world of glbal equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/resource-politics_for-a-fair_future.pdf Resource Politics for a Fair Future, p.12-13], PDF, Berlin 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6422">The history of [[logic]] as a subject has been characterised by many disputes over what the topic deals with, and the main article '[[Logic]]' has as a result been hesitant to commit to a particular definition of logic.  This article surveys various definitions of the subject that have appeared over the centuries through to modern times, and puts them in context as reflecting rival conceptions of the subject.

==Rival conceptions of logic==

In the periodic of scholastic philosophy, logic was predominantly [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotelian]].  Following the decline of scholasticism, logic was thought of as an affair of ideas by early modern philosophers such as Locke and [[David Hume|Hume]] (1711-1716). [[Immanuel Kant]] took this one step further.  He begins with the assumption of the empiricist philosophers, that all knowledge whatsoever is internal to the mind, and that we have no genuine knowledge of 'things in themselves'.  Furthermore, (an idea he seemed to have got from Hume) the material of knowledge is a succession of separate ideas which have no intrinsic connection and thus no real unity.  In order that these disparate sensations be brought into some sort of order and coherence, there must be an internal mechanism in the mind which provides the ''forms'' by which we think, perceive and reason.

Kant calls these forms ''Categories'' (in a somewhat different sense than employed by the Aristotelian logicians), of which he claims there are twelve:

* Quantity (Singular, Particular, Universal)
* Quality (Affirmative, Negative, Infinite)
* Relation (Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive)
* Modality (Problematic, Assertoric, Apodictic)

However, this seems to be an arbitrary arrangement, driven by the desire to present a harmonious appearance than from any underlying method or system.  For example, the triple nature of each division forced him to add artificial categories such as the infinite judgment.

This conception of logic eventually developed into an extreme form of [[psychologism]] espoused in the nineteenth by Benno Erdmann and others.  The view of historians of logic is that Kant's influence was negative.

Another view of logic espoused by Hegel and others of his school (such as [[Rudolph Hermann Lotze|Lotze]], [[Frances Herbert Bradley|Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]] and others), was the 'Logic of the Pure Idea'.  The central feature of this view is the identification of Logic and Metaphysics.  The Universe has its origin in the categories of thought.  Thought in its fullest development becomes the Absolute Idea, a divine mind evolving itself in the development of the Universe.

In the modern period, [[Gottlob Frege]] said "Just as 'beautiful' points the way for aesthetics and 'good' for ethics, so do words like 'true' for logic", and went on characterise the distinctive task of logic "to discern the laws of truth".&lt;ref&gt;From 'Der Gedanke', ''Beitraege zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' I, 1918, pp.58--77, translated as 'Thought' in Beaney (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, [[W. V. Quine]] (1940, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3) defined logic in terms of a logical vocabulary, which in turn is identified by an argument that the many particular vocabularies &amp;mdash;Quine mentions geological vocabulary&amp;mdash; are used in their particular discourses together with a common, topic-independent kernel of terms.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ferreiros, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  These terms, then, constitute the logical vocabulary, and the [[logical truth]]s are those truths common to all particular topics.

Hofweber (2004) lists several definitions of logic, and goes on to claim that all definitions of logic are of one of four sorts.  These are that logic is the study of: (i) artificial formal structures, (ii) sound inference (e.g., Poinsot), (iii) [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] (e.g., Watts), or (iv) general features of thought (e.g., Frege).  He argues then that these definitions are related to each other, but do not exhaust each other, and that an examination of [[formal ontology]] shows that these mismatches between rival definitions are due to tricky issues in ontology.

== Informal and colloquial definitions ==
Arranged in approximate chronological order.

* The tool for distinguishing between the true and the false ([[Averroes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zekai Sen Philosophical, Logical and Scientific Perspectives in Engineering page 114&lt;/ref&gt;
* The science of reasoning, teaching the way of investigating unknown truth in connection with a thesis ([[Robert Kilwardby]]).
* The art whose function is to direct the reason lest it err in the manner of inferring or knowing ([[John Poinsot]]).
* The art of conducting reason well in knowing things ([[Antoine Arnauld]]).
* The right use of reason in the inquiry after truth ([[Isaac Watts]]).
* The Science, as well as the Art, of reasoning ([[Richard Whately]]).
* The science of the operations of the understanding which are subservient to the estimation of evidence ([[John Stuart Mill]]).
* The science of the laws of discursive thought ([[James McCosh]]).
* The science of the most general laws of truth ([[Gottlob Frege]]).

'''Robert Antoine''' (1914 in Belgium &amp;ndash; 1981) was a Belgian [[Jesuit]] priest, missionary in India. Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at the [[Jadavpur University]], he was a [[Sanskritist]] and musician. He was co-founder, with [[Pierre Fallon]], of Shanti Bhavan, a dialogue centre at [[Calcutta]].

==Education==
Antoine entered the Society of Jesus in 1932, was sent to [[Calcutta]] in 1939, dedicated himself to the study of [[Sanskrit]], and became the first Jesuit to obtain a Master's Degree from the [[University of Calcutta]] in Sanskrit philology.&lt;ref&gt;"Avant-propos," R. De Smet and J. Neuner, eds., ''La quete de l'eternel: Approches chretiennes de l'Hindouisme'', tr. Roger Demortier, Museum Lessianum, section missiologique n. 48 (Desclee de Brouwer, 1967) 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he held a Licentiate in Philosophy, a Licentiate in Theology, a B.A. Classics.

==Work==
Antoine arrived in India in 1939 and became an Indian citizen in 1950. His untimely death from liver cancer occurred in 1981. During the 42 years he spent in India, mainly in [[Calcutta]], he contributed much to the Bengali culture, the diffusion of Sanskrit and the life of the Church in Bengal. In the words of Felix Raj, “he was an eminent priest, a scholar, an accomplished teacher, a gifted musician and singer and a dear friend.” From 1956, he was lecturer in the Department of Comparative Literature of the [[Jadavpur University]]. He also taught at [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta]]. In 1950 he founded the dialogue center ''Shanti Bhavan'' with [[Pierre Fallon]] as a center of inter-faith, inter-cultural dialogue and their home amidst a population of middle-class intelligentsia. For many years, their periodical, ''Darśan Cakra'', attracted keen professors of philosophy and other intellectuals. But Shanti Bhavan was above all a centre of friendly conversations, music, songs, bhajans and Eucharistic liturgy. From there Antoine produced his ten books (Sanskrit manual, Bengali hymn book, translations, Indological essays, ecumenical dialogue, etc.) and as many articles.&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, “Foreword,” ''Religious Hinduism'', 4th rev. edition, ed. R. De Smet and J. Neuner (Mumbai: St Pauls, 1997) 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Special mention must be made of ''Religious Hinduism'', which Antoine, with some other Jesuit friends, had planned, first as a series of 24 monthly letters which appeared from June 1957 to June 1959, then, with Joseph Neuner and [[Richard De Smet]] as editors, as an enlarged book in 1964. Antoine contributed himself nine of the chapters of this book; a 'third' revised edition was produced in 1968, and a fourth in 1997.

'''''The Matrix''''' is a 1999 [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] written and directed by [[The Wachowskis]]&lt;!--Per consensus established at [[Talk:The Matrix/Archive 5#RfC: How should the directors of this film be presented in the lead?]] --&gt;{{refn|group=note|Previously known as the ''Wachowski Brothers''}} and starring [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], [[Hugo Weaving]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. It depicts a [[dystopia]]n future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a [[simulated reality]] called "the Matrix", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. [[Cybercriminal]] and computer programmer [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the "dream world".

''The Matrix'' is known for popularizing a visual effect known as "[[bullet time]]", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a [[Shot (filmmaking)|shot]] to progress in [[slow-motion]] while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the [[cyberpunk]] [[subgenre]].&lt;ref name="williamgibson" /&gt; It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and pays homage to works such as [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]],&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'',&lt;ref name="Salon philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title="The Matrix and Philosophy" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'',&lt;ref name="Salon review" /&gt; and [[Masamune Shirow]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''.&lt;ref name = "Look of the Matrix"/&gt; The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for [[Anime|Japanese animation]]&lt;ref name="Wachowski transcript"/&gt; and [[martial arts film]]s, and the film's use of [[Fight choreography|fight choreographers]] and [[wire fu]] techniques from [[Hong Kong action cinema]] influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions.

''The Matrix'' was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999 and grossed over $460 million worldwide.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
A woman is cornered by police in an abandoned hotel; after overpowering them with superhuman abilities, a group of sinister superhuman grey green-suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] leads the police in a rooftop pursuit. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.

[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, living a [[Alter ego|double life]] as the [[Security hacker|hacker]] "[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase "the Matrix". The woman, [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]], contacts him, saying that a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by [[Agent Smith]], apprehend Neo and attempt to threaten him into helping them capture the "[[terrorism|terrorist]]" Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a [[red pill and blue pill|red pill]] that will show him the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, his reality disintegrates and Neo awakens, naked, weak and hairless, in a liquid-filled pod, among countless others connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.

As Neo recuperates, Morpheus explains the truth: in the 21st century, [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]] [[AI takeover|waged war against their human creators]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines retaliated by harvesting the humans' [[Bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power. The Matrix is a shared [[simulated reality|simulation]] of the world, in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified. All free humans live in [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], the last refuge in the real world. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to "unplug" enslaved humans and recruit them. Their understanding of the simulated reality enables them to bend its [[physical law]]s, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents are powerful sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credence to Morpheus' belief that Neo is "the One", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humans and end the war.

The group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], an all-knowing prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns Neo that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police alerted by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Smith in exchange for a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo and the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. As he prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him.

In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, believing that he is not the One, decides himself worth sacrificing if need be to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar''. Trinity whispers to Neo that he can't be dead because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix just as the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon disables the attacking Sentinels.

Later, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners "a world where anything is possible". He hangs up and flies into the sky as "[[Wake Up (Rage Against the Machine song)|Wake Up]]" by [[Rage Against the Machine]] plays.

* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Thomas A. Anderson/Neo]]: A computer programmer in Metacortex corporation who moonlights as a hacker.

That's probably the only one that I turned down that I shouldn't have, but when you see somebody do it like Keanu you think, "Thank God."

* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]: A human freed from the Matrix, captain of the ''Nebuchadnezzar''. Fishburne stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he had a doubt if the movie would ever be made, because it was "so smart".&lt;ref name = "Screenplay"/&gt; The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]] in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2003/06/you-must-be-this-tall-to-ride-this.asp|title=Neil Gaiman's Journal: You must be this tall to ride this website...|last=Gaiman|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Gaiman|work=neilgaiman.com|date=June 10, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Samuel L.

* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]: Freed by Morpheus, crewmember of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them.&lt;ref name = "Screenplay"/&gt; Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently.&lt;ref name = "Training"&gt;{{cite AV media| people =Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) | title =[[The Matrix Revisited]] | section = Training | url = | medium =DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]: A sentient "Agent" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other agents, he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that the character was enjoyable to play because it amused him. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that Larry and Andy Wachowski's deep voices had influenced his voice in the film.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' to [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. After [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]], the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, ''[[Bound (1996 film)|Bound]]'' and ''The Matrix'', in the contract. The first movie The Wachowskis directed, ''Bound'', then became a critical success. Using this momentum, the siblings later asked to direct ''The Matrix''.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt;

Producer [[Joel Silver]] soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, ''The Matrix'' was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60&amp;nbsp;million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists [[Geof Darrow]] and [[Steve Skroce]] to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Miller |title=Matrix Revelations; The Wachowski Brothers FAQ |url=https://www.wired.com/2003/11/matrix/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |date=November 2003 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CepTZz1Q?url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/matrix.html |archivedate=December 4, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; Soon, ''The Matrix'' became a co-production of Warner Bros. and the Australian company [[Village Roadshow Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://from.ph/422513 |title='The Matrix' film poster |author=Powerhouse Museum |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-production===
The actors of the film were required to be able to understand and explain ''The Matrix''.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew.&lt;ref name="Simulacra"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/movies/philosophers-draw-on-a-film-drawing-on-philosophers.html |title=Philosophers Draw on a Film Drawing on Philosophers |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=May 24, 2003 |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |author=Rothstein, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves stated that the Wachowskis had him read ''Simulacra and Simulation'', ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', and Dylan Evans’s ''Introducing Evolutionary Psychology'' even before they opened up the script,&lt;ref name = "Screenplay"/&gt; and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.&lt;ref name = "Screenplay"/&gt;

The directors had also been admirers of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] for a long time, so they decided to hire the Chinese [[fight choreography|martial arts choreographer]] and film director [[Yuen Woo-ping]] to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the [[wire fu]], the actors had to train hard for several months.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt;

Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves' diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision, and Moss's feminine grace.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; Yuen designed Moss' moves to suit her deftness and lightness.&lt;ref name = "Trinity"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=Trinity |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros. Pictures]] |location=United States |date=November 20, 2001 |accessdate=January 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the pre-production, Reeves suffered a two-level fusion of his cervical spine which had begun to cause paralysis in his legs, requiring him to undergo neck surgery. He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt;

===Production design===
{{See also|Matrix digital rain}}
In the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley,&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt; which includes mirror images of [[half-width kana]] characters and Western [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters and [[Arabic numerals|numerals]].&lt;ref name = "Look of the Matrix"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=Look of the Matrix |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.&lt;ref name="Museum" /&gt;

''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[production design]]er, [[Owen Paterson (production designer)|Owen Paterson]], used methods to distinguish the "real world" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the "real world". In addition, the Matrix scenes' [[set construction|sets]] were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the "real world", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.&lt;ref name = "Look of the Matrix"/&gt;

The ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like ''[[Star Trek]]''. The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as "a marriage between Man and Machine".&lt;ref name = "The Nebuchadnezzar"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=The Nebuchadnezzar |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

[[Kym Barrett]], costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.&lt;ref name = "Costume"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=Costume |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

===Filming===

The dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Because of Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to the filming, he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.&lt;ref name = "Construct Kung Fu"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=Construct Kung Fu |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

The filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, [[Chad Stahelski]], Reeves' stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder.

To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look.

===Visual effects===
[[File:The Matrix Bullet Time Effect.ogv|thumb|The "[[bullet time]]" effect was created for the film. A scene would be computer modeled to decide the positioning of the physical cameras. The actor then provided their performance in a [[chroma key]] setup, while the cameras were fired in rapid succession, with fractions of a second delay between each shot. The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at (0:33).|alt=Video sample of the film]]

{{quote|As for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit [[Otomo Katsuhiro]], who co-wrote and directed ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', which definitely blew me away, along with director [[Michel Gondry]]. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around – rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.|[[John Gaeta]]&lt;ref name="gaeta-empire"&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 2006 |title=200 Things That Rocked Our World: Bullet Time |journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |issue=200 |page=136 |publisher=[[Emap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film is known for popularizing a [[visual effect]]&lt;ref name="Lane City of God" /&gt; known as "[[bullet time]]", which allows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] to progress in [[slow-motion]] while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.&lt;ref name="guardian-sfx"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/05/features2 |title=Better than SFX |last1=Green |first1=Dave |date=June 5, 1999 |newspaper=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullet time has been described as "a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Joshua |title=The Matrix |year=2004 |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=1844570452 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Aylish |authorlink= |title=Digital Encounters |publisher=Routledge |series= |volume= |edition=New |date=April 17, 2007 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0415410665 |mr= |zbl= |jfm=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When [[John Gaeta]] read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at [[Manex Visual Effects]] to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor.&lt;ref name="Wired VFX" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2003/05/matrix2/ |title=Matrix2 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=December 25, 2012 |author=Silberman, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera is a still-picture camera not a motion picture camera, and it contributes just one frame to the video sequence. When those pictures are shown in sequence, they create the effect of "virtual camera movement"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.&lt;ref name="guardian-sfx" /&gt;

The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion.&lt;ref name="gaeta-empire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired VFX" /&gt; The cameras' positions and exposures were [[previsualization|previsualized]] using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect.&lt;ref name="guardian-sfx" /&gt; When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a [[frame frequency]] of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side.&lt;ref name="guardian-sfx" /&gt; To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.

The photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene,&lt;ref name="Wired VFX" /&gt; and linear interpolation filled in any gaps of the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scis.nova.edu/~rbuckley/Film%20Essay.pdf |title=Film Essay on The "Bullet Time" Scene In "The Matrix" |last=Buckley |first=Robert |publisher=Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences, Nova Southeastern University |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DDCoEQOC?url=http://scis.nova.edu/~rbuckley/Film%20Essay.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the computer-generated "lead in" and "lead out" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbc.ac.in/voice/bullet.htm |title=Bullet Time Technique |last=Tiwari |first=Abhishek |work=Voice |publisher=School of Broadcasting and Communication |location=Mumbai |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DDEpIOzU?url=http://www.sbc.ac.in/voice/bullet.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manex Visual Effects used a [[cluster (computing)|cluster]] farm running the [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] [[FreeBSD]] to render many of the film's visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAsYz5pVwyc#t=5m45s |title=Comment about the use of FreeBSD (5:50) |work=YouTube |date=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/news/press-rel-1.html |title=FreeBSD Used to Generate Spectacular Special Effects |date=April 22, 1999 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.&lt;ref name = "Post-production"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) |title=[[The Matrix Revisited]] |section=Post-production |url= |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

The photogrametric and image-based [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] background approaches in ''The Matrix''{{'}}s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of "Universal Capture", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.&lt;ref name="Wired VFX" /&gt;

[[Dane A. Davis]] was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film.

Interpretations of ''The Matrix'' often reference Baudrillard's philosophy to demonstrate that the film is an [[allegory]] for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of [[Bracha Ettinger]] articulated in a series of books and essays from the end of the 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Griselda |last=Pollock |editor1-first=Dana |editor1-last=Arnold |editor2-first=Margaret |editor2-last=Iversen |title=Art and Thought |date=April 21, 2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0631227156 |chapter=Does art think? |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Griselda |last=Pollock |editor1-first=Catherine |editor1-last=De Zegher |title=Inside the Visible |date=March 6, 1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0262540819 |chapter=Inscritions in the Feminine |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Heinz Peter |last=Schwerfel |title=Kino und Kunst |date=February 28, 2005 |publisher=Dumont Literatur U. Kunst |language=German |isbn=3832175326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bracha Ettinger's matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression "primal matrix" but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their "co-birthing" in a womb-like "shareable time-space", their co-existence in different dimension at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her "archaic" matrix is always in the now and the future, depends on human affects and desires, and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the mechanical coded simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of "transconnectedness" in proximity and in distance, which is not global and can't form a "web of webs". Its webs are always specific, invested by an "Eros of borderlinking" and related to different processes that Ettinger has named "metramorphosis" (feminine-maternal-material morpheus).&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrix and Metramorphosis." In: ''Differences''. Vol. 4, nº 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Metramorphic Borderlinks and Matrixial Borderspace." In: Welchman, John, ed.

Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'' (Essays from 1994–1999), University of Minnesota Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.

''The Matrix'' belongs to the [[cyberpunk]] genre of science fiction,&lt;ref name="williamgibson" /&gt; and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]]. For example, the film's use of the term "Matrix" is adopted from Gibson's novel,&lt;ref name="Neuromancer Natali interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2012/01/06/Neuromancer-Movie/ |title=Is William Gibson's 'Neuromancer' the Future of Movies? |author=Leiren-Young, Mark |date=January 6, 2012 |work=[[The Tyee]] |quote=One of the obstacles in the selling of this movie to the industry at large is that everyone says, 'Oh, well, ''The Matrix'' did it already.'

The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has also been noted. As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Condon |title=The Matrix Unlocked |date=July 26, 2003 |publisher=Contender Books |location= |isbn=1843570939 |page= |pages=141–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical influences===
The Matrix as a generated reality - the invention of malicious machines - is a reference to [[Descartes]]' [[First Meditation]], or [[evil demon]]. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Salon philosophy" /&gt; One can also make a connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]]; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] also has an influence on how individuals within The Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means we ourselves are our own agents of deceit, and so in order for one to know truth, one must choose to openly pursue truth. One may examine this explicitly in the scene with Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed to be a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith exclaims, "it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost." The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived The Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. This is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content to remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans are not easy to make content.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, William.

Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] when he asks Neo, “Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you weren’t able to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toropov |first=Brandon |title=The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Taoism |year=2002 |publisher=The Penguin Group |location= |isbn=0028642627 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits."&lt;ref name="TV Guide review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/the-matrix/review/133979 |title=The Matrix: Review |first=Maitland |last=McDonagh |authorlink=Maitland McDonagh |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that ''The Matrix'' is a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film ("It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the overamped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside"), but concluded, "as in ''Bound'', there's an appealing scope and daring to The Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for ''movies''—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep."&lt;ref name="Salon review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/reviews/1999/04/02reviewa.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523103506/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/reviews/1999/04/02reviewa.html |title=Short attention spawn |author=O'Hehir, Andrew |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 2, 1999 |archivedate=May 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of ''The Matrix''.

==Legacy==
''The Matrix'' had a strong effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of [[wire fu]] techniques, including the involvement of [[fight choreography|fight choreographer]] [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and other personnel with a background in [[Hong Kong action cinema]], affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films,&lt;ref name="xmen"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jensen, Jeff |title=Generating ''X'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Warner |date=July 21, 2000 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276737,00.html |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |quote=There was also debate over the style of the film's fight sequences, thanks to the new standard set by The Matrix, which hit while X-Men was in pre-production. Hence, the movie features some high-flying Matrix-y martial-arts choreography by Corey Yuen ([[Romeo Must Die]]).}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving them towards more Eastern approaches.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; The success of ''The Matrix'' created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000)&lt;ref name="xmen"/&gt; and ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name="Influence EW"/&gt; and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=364 |title=From Angels to Devils |last=Reid |first=Craig |work=[[Kung Fu Magazine]] |publisher=TC Media, Inc |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DCgOxmkn?url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=364 |archivedate=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Matrix''{{'}}s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.&lt;ref name="Influence BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3028249.stm |title=Under The Matrix influence |work=BBC.co.uk |publisher=BBC |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |author=Dowling, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''The Matrix'', films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the [[bullet time]] effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them.&lt;ref name="Lane City of God"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/01/20/030120crci_cinema |title=The Current Cinema: Trouble in the Streets |date=January 20, 2003 |last=Lane |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Lane |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |quote=What I think of as the "Matrix" shot, a lone figure frozen while the camera circles around him, has travelled quickly from novelty to cliché, but Meirelles just about keeps it alive by using it to track the passage of time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', in which the feature was explicitly referred to as "bullet time".&lt;ref name="Influence BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Max Payne: Official Police Dossier (game manual) |section=The Game World: Bullet Time |version=PC CD ROM version |publisher= |year=2001 |quote=When pressed into a tight spot, Max can activate Bullet Time, which will slow the action around him, while allowing him to aim his weapons in real-time.

The original ''[[Tron]]'' (1982) paved the way for ''The Matrix'', and ''The Matrix'', in turn, inspired [[Disney]] to make its own Matrix with a ''Tron'' sequel, ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name="Influence EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20478022,00.html |title='The Matrix': A Groundbreaking Cyberthriller |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Warner |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |author=Vary, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carrie-Anne Moss]] asserted that prior to being cast in ''The Matrix'', she had "no career". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a ''[[New York Daily News]]'' interview, she stated, "''The Matrix'' gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much".&lt;ref name="cany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/walked-zombie-article-1.220372|title=She's walked with a zombie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since ''[[Star Wars]]'', and was even briefly blamed for the [[Columbine High School massacre|shootings at Columbine High School]].&lt;ref name="Influence EW2" /&gt; The combined success of the ''Matrix'' trilogy, the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' films]] and the [[Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequels]] made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies.&lt;ref name="Influence Screened" /&gt; Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that ''The Matrix''{{'}}s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.&lt;ref name="Influence BBC" /&gt;

The franchise also contains three video games: ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Gerstmann |title=Enter the Matrix Review |url=http://asia.gamespot.com/enter-the-matrix/reviews/enter-the-matrix-review-6028627/ |publisher=Gamespot |work= |date=May 20, 2003 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CWnqImIB?url=http://asia.gamespot.com/enter-the-matrix/reviews/enter-the-matrix-review-6028627/ |archivedate=November 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' (2004), an [[MMORPG]] which continued the story beyond ''The Matrix Revolutions'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Butts |title=The Matrix Online, I changed my mind; I want the blue pill. |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/15/the-matrix-online |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=April 15, 2005 |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CWr2IU9o?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/15/the-matrix-online |archivedate=November 29, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Kasavin |title=The Matrix Online Review |url=http://asia.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/reviews/the-matrix-online-review-6121636/ |publisher=Gamespot |work= |date=April 4, 2005 |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CWrQ8nhD?url=http://asia.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/reviews/the-matrix-online-review-6121636/ |archivedate=November 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'' (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Dunham |title=The Matrix: Path of Neo, There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/17/the-matrix-path-of-neo |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=November 17, 2005 |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CWp2R8nN?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/17/the-matrix-path-of-neo |archivedate=November 29, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The franchise also includes ''[[The Matrix Comics]]'', a series of [[comic book|comics]] and short stories set in the world of ''The Matrix'', written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry.

In March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with [[Zak Penn]] in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting [[Michael B. Jordan]] attached to star. According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' neither The Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of The Wachowskis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Borys Kit |author2=Kim Masters |author3=Rebecca Ford |title='The Matrix' Reboot in the Works at Warner Bros.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6374">The '''Transcendental Club''' was a group of [[New England]] intellectuals of the early-to-mid-19th century which gave rise to [[Transcendentalism]].

==Overview==
[[Frederic Henry Hedge]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], and [[George Putnam (minister)|George Putnam]] (1807–1878; the Unitarian minister in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]])&lt;!--http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/George-Putnam.php--&gt; met in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club; their first official meeting was held eleven days later at Ripley's house in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].&lt;ref name=Packer47&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 47. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the club included [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Orestes Brownson]], [[Theodore Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32–33. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[William Henry Channing]], [[James Freeman Clarke]], [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]], [[Convers Francis]], [[Sylvester Judd]], and [[Jones Very]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7–8. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female members included [[Sophia Ripley]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Elizabeth Peabody]],&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ellen Sturgis Hooper]].

Originally, the group went by the name "Hedge's Club" because it usually met when Hedge was visiting from [[Bangor, Maine]].&lt;ref name=Packer47/&gt; The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. The name was coined in a January 1837 review of Emerson's essay "[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]" and was intended disparagingly.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, Barry. ''The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004: 24. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Elliot Cabot]], a biographer of Emerson, wrote of the group as "the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality".&lt;ref name=Gura5&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 5. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedge wrote: "There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women".&lt;ref name=Gura5/&gt; It was sometimes referred to by the nickname "the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'".&lt;ref name=Gura5/&gt;

The club was a meeting-place for these young thinkers and an organizing ground for their idealist frustration with the general state of American culture and society at the time, and in particular, the state of [[intellectualism]] at [[Harvard University]] and in the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Much of their thinking centered on the shortcomings of Unitarianism.&lt;ref name=Hankins23&gt;Hankins, Barry. ''The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004: 23. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many well-known American journals, including the ''North American Review'' and the ''Christian Examiner'', refused to accept submissions from the Transcendental Club for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 51. {{ISBN|0-440-03944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1839, members of the Transcendental Club had the idea of establishing their own periodical as a platform for their ideals.&lt;ref name=Gura128&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 128. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Brownson suggested utilizing his ''Boston Quarterly Review'', though others thought their own magazine was necessary.&lt;ref name=VonMehren120&gt;Von Mehren, Joan. ''Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller''. Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994: 120. {{ISBN|1-55849-015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedge, Parker, and Emerson declined the role of editor.&lt;ref name=Gura128/&gt; Ripley served as the managing editor&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 61–62. {{ISBN|0-440-03944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fuller accepted the editor position on October 20, 1839, though she was unable to begin work on the publication until the first week of 1840.&lt;ref name=VonMehren120/&gt; The first issue of ''[[The Dial]]'', with an introduction by Emerson calling it a "Journal in a new spirit", was published in July 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 129. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Transcendental Club likely did not have official meetings after September 1840, though they continued to correspond and attend each other's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 165. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dial'' continued to be published, though it was never financially stable. In 1843, then business manager [[Elizabeth Peabody]] counted only two hundred subscribers and that its income was not covering production costs. It finally ceased publication in April 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 130. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson's speech/essay "[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]" has been considered a manifesto of Transcendentalist ideas.&lt;ref name=Hankins23/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">:''Not to be confused with [[Transcendental realism (Schelling)|F. W. J. Schelling's transcendental realism]], [[Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)|Arthur Schopenhauer's transcendental realism]], or [[Transcendental realism (Evola)|Julius Evola's transcendental realism]].''
Initially developed by [[Roy Bhaskar]] in his book ''A Realist Theory of Science'' (1975), '''transcendental realism''' is a [[philosophy of science]] that was initially developed as an argument against [[Epistemological realism|epistemic realism]] of [[positivism]] and [[hermeneutics]]. The position is based on Bhaskar's [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Kant (and modern philosophy)|transcendental]] arguments for certain [[Ontology (philosophy)|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] positions based on what reality must be like in order for scientific knowledge to be possible. 

The overview of transcendental realism that follows is largely based on [[Andrew Sayer]]'s ''Realism and Social Science''.

==Transitive and intransitive domains==
A ''Realist Theory of Science'' starts with a proposed paradox: how it is that people create knowledge as a product of social activities and at the same time knowledge is 'of' things that are not produced by people at all.

The former is inspired by [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhnian]] arguments of how scientific communities develop knowledge and asserts all observation is theory-laden based on previously acquired concepts. As such, it is not a [[Philosophical realism#Na.C3.AFve realism|naïve realist]] perspective that knowledge is a direct acquisition of facts through observation of the real world, but rather that knowledge is fallible. This ontological position is described as the ''transitive domain of knowledge'', in that knowledge can change over time.

The second part of the paradox is asserted to be based on a real world, which exists and behaves in the same manner regardless of whether or not people exist or whether they know about the real world. This is described as the ''intransitive domain of knowledge''. Reducing knowledge to ontology is referred to as the ''epistemic fallacy'', a fallacy that Bhaskar asserts has been made repeatedly over the last 300 years of philosophy of science.

==Real, actual, and empirical==
The exposition of transcendental realism continues that not only is the world divided into a real world and our knowledge of it, but it is further divided into the ''real'', the ''actual'' and the ''empirical''. The ''real'' is the intransitive domain of things that exist (i.e. the real world): objects, their structures and their causal powers. It is important to note that even though these objects and structures may be able to perform certain action, those actions may go unrealized. This gives rise to the ''actual'', which is the events that actually occur, regardless of whether or not people are aware of them. The ''empirical'' contains the events that people have actually experienced. It is important to note that experience may directly refer to the real and/or to the actual.

==Stratification and emergence==
Transcendental realism further argues for a stratified reality. The relationships between objects and the combinations of their causal powers may create entirely new structures with new causal powers. The typical example of this is of water, which has a causal power of extinguishing fire, but is made up of hydrogen and oxygen that have causal powers of combustion.
This stratification spans through all sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, etc. This implies that objects in sociology – labor markets, capitalism, etc. – are just as real as that of physics. This is not a [[Reductionism|reductionist]] position: while each stratum is dependent on the objects and their relationships in the strata below it, the difference in causal powers means that they are necessarily different objects.

==Causality and mechanisms==
Other philosophies of science based on the [[David Hume|Humean]] tradition assert that causality is based on regularity among sequences of events. For transcendental realism, this explanation of causation holds little weight — "what causes something to happen has nothing to do with the number of times we have observed it happening".{{cn|date=August 2018}} Instead of referring to events, transcendental realism refers to causal mechanisms, the internal processes of objects which give rise to events. These mechanisms may lie dormant or may counteract each other and prevent events from occurring.

The '''''Treatise on Tolerance on the Occasion of the Death of Jean Calas from the Judgment Rendered in Toulouse''''' (''Pieces Originales Concernant la Mort des Sieurs Calas det le Jugement rendu a Toulouse'')  is a work by French philosopher [[Voltaire]], published in 1763, in which he calls for tolerance between religions, and targets religious [[fanaticism]], especially that of the [[Jesuit]]s (under whom Voltaire received his early education), indicting all [[superstition]]s surrounding religions.

Voltaire's work follows the trial of [[Jean Calas]] (1698-1762), a Protestant accused of murdering his son Marc-Antoine to prevent his conversion to the Church and executed in [[Toulouse]] on March 10, 1762 despite enduring torture after the prosecution used perjured witnesses, in a case which Voltaire took to display Catholic prejudice and fanaticism.  In 1765, after the king fired the chief magistrate and the case was retried by another court, Calas was posthumously exonerated and his family paid 36 thousand francs.

Voltaire's argument is illustrated in the following passages:

"There are about forty millions of inhabitants in Europe who are not members of the Church of Rome; should we say to every one of them, 'Sir, since you are infallibly damned, I shall neither eat, converse, nor have any connections with you?'";

"O different worshippers of a peaceful God!  If you have a cruel heart, if, while you adore he whose whole law consists of these few words, "Love God and your neighbor'..."

"I see all the dead of past ages and of our own appearing in His presence.  Are you very sure that our Creator and Father will say to the wise and virtuous [[Confucius]], to the legislator [[Solon]], to [[Pythagoras]], [[Zaleucus]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], the divine [[Antonins]], the good [[Trajan]], to [[Titus]], the delights of mankind, to [[Epictetus]], and to many others, models of men: 'Go, monsters, go and suffer torments that are infinite in intensity and duration.  Let your punishment be eternal as I am.  But you, my beloved ones, [[Jean Châtel]], [[François Ravaillac|Ravaillac]], [[Robert-François Damiens|Damiens]], [[Louis Dominique Bourguignon|Cartouche]], etc. who have died according to the prescribed rules, sit forever at my right hand and share my empire and my felicity.'  You draw back with horror at these words; and after they have escaped me, I have nothing more to say to you."

==Publication and reception==
Voltaire finished the work by January 2, 1763, and it was printed by the [[Cramer brothers]] in Geneva in April 1763. After copies had been distributed to selected recipients include [[Madame de Pompadour]], ministers of the French privy council, the king of Prussia, and some German princes, it began to be distributed in October 1763 and was quickly banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Ian|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_p9Z8z9-wYC&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;pg=PA328#v=onepage&amp;q=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Profile|isbn=1846682266|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Simon|title=Voltaire: Treatise on Tolerance (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnZNwHWdB-UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521649692|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marocaster coronatus MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2 (Close up).jpg|thumb|right|Type specimen for ''[[Marocaster coronatus]]'' - [[Muséum de Toulouse]]]]
In biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock/&gt;

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251–255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, &amp; standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type specimen==
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.&lt;ref name="MarshallEvenhuis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117–127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.

This process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.

Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

Note that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CANBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant names – a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]].

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word "type" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first ''Laws of Botanical Nomenclature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.P.|year=1867|title=Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée à la congrès|publisher=J.-B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fr|Ce seul caractère permet de distinguer ce type de toutes les autres espèces de la section. … Après avoir étudié ces diverses formes, j'en arrivai à les considérer comme appartenant à un seul et même type spécifique.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{anchor|botany|Botany}}In botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached." (article 7.1)&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny "plant" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the "plant" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).

Note that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "big" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "small" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.
# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).
# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).

The ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

* holotype
* lectotype
* isotype
* syntype
* paratype
* neotype
* epitype

Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the ''ICN'': for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==
[[File:JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lycaenidae|gossamer-winged butterfly]], ''[[Jamides elioti]]'':&lt;br&gt;1) [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] and 2) ventral aspect of holotype,&lt;br&gt;3) dorsal and 4) ventral aspect of paratype]]
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens.  The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "name-bearing type" is a specimen or image that "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined."

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].
* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===
[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]
Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930–993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====
{{main|Holotype}}
When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====
{{main|Paratype}}
When the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"/&gt; The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====
{{Main|Syntype}}
A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.
In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

A notable example is that [[Carl Linnaeus]] is the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W. T. 1959. "The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology", ''Systematic Zoology'' 8 (1): 4-22, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707–711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hapantotype====
A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.

==== '''Iconotype''' ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, ''[[Burmese python|Python bivittatus]],'' is one of many species that are based on illustrations by [[Albertus Seba]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/62760#/summary|title=Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium Thesauri accurata Descriptio, et Iconibus artificiosissimus Expressio, per universam Physices Historiam.

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in [[hymenopteran]]s which have polymorphic castes.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawksworth |first=D.L. |title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature. The naming of organisms (and plant communities) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-92020-09-7 |pages=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=ergatotype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vec4jfleDx&amp;sig=QmCXOeWRVuPYbjtVKFC7OPfaC5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MtErU7mTL866oQSsn4C4CQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ergatotype&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion parakeet]], which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|ISSN=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
{{Main|Type species}}
[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Type genus===
{{Main|Type genus}}
A type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Vajradhara''' (Sanskrit: वज्रधर.  Also, the name of [[Indra]], because 'Vajra' means diamond, as well as the thunderbolt, anything hard more generally) Tibetan: རྡོ་རྗེ་འཆང། rdo rje 'chang (Dorje Chang); Chinese: 金剛總持; Javanese: Kabajradharan; Japanese: 執金剛; English: Diamond-holder; Vietnamese: Kim Cang Tổng Trì) is the ultimate primordial  [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], or [[Adi Buddha]], according to the [[Sakya]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/88546.html&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gelug]] and [[Kagyu]] schools  of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;* Getty, Alice (1914). [https://archive.org/details/godsofnorthernbu00gettrich The gods of northern Buddhism], their history, iconography, and progressive evolution through the northern Buddhist countries, Oxford: The Clarendon press, pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evolution of Indian Buddhism, Buddha Vajradhara gradually displaced [[Samantabhadra]], who is the 'Primordial Buddha' in the [[Nyingma]], or 'Ancient School.' However, the two are [[metaphysically]] equivalent. Achieving the 'state of Vajradhara' is synonymous with complete realisation.

According to the Kagyu lineage, Buddha Vajradhara is the primordial Buddha, the [[Dharmakaya]] Buddha. He is depicted as dark blue in color, expressing the quintessence of [[buddhahood]] itself and representing the essence of the historical Buddha's realization of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Images-Enlightenment-Tibetan-Art-Practice/dp/1559390247 ''Images of Enlightenment: Tibetan Art in Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, Buddha Vajradhara is thought to be the supreme [[essence]] of all (male) Buddhas (his name means "Ruler of the Vajra Beings"); It is the [[tantra|Tantric]] form of [[Sakyamuni]] which is called Vajradhara. [[Tantras]] are texts specific to Tantrism and are believed to have been originally taught by the Tantric form of Sakyamuni called Buddha Vajradhara. He is an expression of Buddhahood itself in both single and yabyum form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thangka.de/Gallery-3/Misc/12-13/Karmapa5.htm|title=Dharmapala Thangka Centre|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6At6ubVkH?url=http://www.thangka.de/Gallery-3/Misc/12-13/Karmapa5.htm|archivedate=23 September 2012|deadurl=no|access-date=14 September 2012|df=dmy-all}} Vajrayana View&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha Vajradhara is considered to be the prime Buddha of the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Father Tantras|Father tantras]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202522/Father-Tantra Father Tantra]&lt;/ref&gt; (tib. pha-rgyud) such as [[Guhyasamaja]], [[Yamantaka]], and so on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thangka.de/Gallery-1/otherbuddhas/3-27/vajradhara-0.htm|title=Dharmapala Thangka Centre|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6At5ThrsG?url=http://www.thangka.de/Gallery-1/otherbuddhas/3-27/vajradhara-0.htm|archivedate=23 September 2012|deadurl=no|access-date=19 August 2011|df=dmy-all}} ''Vajradhara is an emanation of Adibuddha,'' some people say.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the primordial Buddha Vajradhara/Samantabhadra Buddha /Dorje Chang were manifested the [[Five Wisdom Buddhas]] (Dhyani Buddhas):
*[[Akshobhya]]
*[[Amoghasiddhi]]
*[[Amitabha]]
*[[Ratnasambhava]]
*[[Vairocana]]

Buddha Vajradhara and the Wisdom Buddhas are often subjects of [[mandala]].

Buddha Vajradhara and Samantabhadra Buddha are cognate deities in Tibetan Buddhist [[religious cosmology|cosmology]] with different names, attributes, appearances and iconography.  Both are [[Dharmakaya]] Buddhas, that is primordial Buddhas: Samantabhadra is unadorned, that is depicted without any attributes; conversely, Buddha Vajradhara is often adorned and bears attributes, which is generally the iconographic representation of a [[Sambhogakaya]] Buddha.  Both Buddha Vajradhara and Samantabhadra are generally depicted in [[yab-yum]] unity with their respective consorts and are primordial Buddhas, embodying [[shunyata|void and ultimate emptiness]].

==Dharmakaya as part of the Trikaya==
[[File:Thangka of Vajradhara.jpg|thumb|right|Tibetan thangka of Vajradhara]]
The '''Trikaya doctrine''' ([[Sanskrit]], literally "Three bodies or personalities"; 三身 [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Sānshēn'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sanjin'') is an important Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and what a Buddha is. By the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]], the Trikaya Doctrine had assumed the form that we now know.

Briefly, the doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kayas'' or ''bodies'': the ''[[nirmanakaya]]'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space; the ''[[sambhogakaya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is an archetypal manifestation; and the ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' or ''reality body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''. Source:  http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm (accessed:  Saturday January 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the '[[Mindstream]]' (Sanksrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"/&gt; The Trikaya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

==Literature==
'[[Shining Relics of Enlightened Body]]' ({{bo|t=སྐུ་གདུང་འབར་བ|w=sku gdung 'bar ba}}) is numbered amongst the '[[Seventeen Tantras]] of [[Menngagde]]' ({{bo|t=མན་ངག་སྡེའི་རྒྱུད་བཅུ་བདུན|w=man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun}}) within [[Dzogchen]] discourse and is part of the textual support for the [[Vima Nyingtik]]. In the Dzogchen tantric text rendered in English as "Shining Relics" ({{bo|t=སྐུ་གདུང་འབར་བ|w=sku gdung 'bar ba}}), an enlightened personality entitled Buddha Vajradhara and a Dakini whose name may be rendered into English as "Clear mind" engage in discourse and dialogue which is a common convention in such esoteric Buddhist literature and tantric literature in general.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Dan (1994). 'Pearls from Bones: Relics, Chortens, Tertons and the Signs of Saintly Death in Tibet'. ''Numen'', Vol. 41, No. 3. (Sep., 1994), p.274.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">'''Victor Delbos''' (26 September 1862, [[Figeac]] – 16 June 1916, [[Paris]]) was a Catholic philosopher and historian of philosophy.

Delbos was appointed a lecturer at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1902. In 1911 he became a member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]]. He died in July 1916 as a result of an infectious [[myocarditis]] brought on by pleurisy. [[Maurice Blondel]], a close friend, wrote an obituary account of Delbos and saw various posthumous publications through the press.&lt;ref name=Blanchette&gt;Oliva Blanchette, ''Maurice Blondel: A Philosophical Life'', 2010, p.30-76&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote on [[Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. A series of lectures on post-Kantian philosophy, which Delbos viewed as shaped by contingent psychological and social factors rather than through the unfolding of some internal logic, were published posthumously and later (1942) collected in a single volume.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Chimisso, ''Writing the history of the mind: philosophy and science in France, 1900 to 1960s'', 2008, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a past president of the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ghum.kuleuven.be/lcis/members/desmond.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his trilogy, ''Being and The Between'', ''Ethics and The Between'', and ''God and The Between'', Desmond works out an entirely new and complete metaphysical/ontological philosophical system based on what he calls the '''potencies of being''' and the '''senses of being'''.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond (1995). ''Being and the Between''. SUNY. {{ISBN|0-7914-2272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most original contribution in his [[metaphysics]] is the notion of the "metaxological", which will be explained below. Desmond's program consists mainly in exploring the senses in which modernity has devalued being and what "to be" and "the good" might mean.

== The ethos ==
The '''ethos''' can be defined as the ontological matrix of value at any given time. For Desmond the human self always lives in what he calls the ethos. The ethos is where we bring morality and concrete good through our power of affirming. Simultaneously, we receive the hospitality of the ethos through what Desmond calls the "[[agape]]ic origin of the good".&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;William Desmond (2001). ''Ethics and the Between''. SUNY. {{ISBN|0-7914-4847-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''origin''' is the "original givenness that frees beings into their freedom"&lt;ref name=Ethics/&gt; and must be understood as an agapeic gift which is overdetermined and thus cannot be aptly described or determined univocally or dialectically. As a consequence of this overdetermined origin as gift, we both generate and are generated by the

== The potencies of being ==
Within the ethos there are seven potencies of being. This "enabling repertoire of self becoming" has the "character of an endowment", and is thus seen as a gift. The potencies are not a program to follow; they simply are all together the powers from which ethical selvings, expressed through particular senses of being, take their endowment. The seven potencies are:
# The Idiotic: By definition something which cannot be defined specifically. Related closely to the aesthetic, the idiotic potency is always with us as we dwell in the ethos. It is the potency of being present before all dianoetic reduction or understanding. As incarnate beings (thus related to the aesthetic potency) the idiotic concerns our pre-determined being. It is the original intimation of the good of the "to be". Dwelling in the ethos we generally expect being to be good. This is seen in the immediate expectation of newborns to be healthy; when we see an unhealthy baby we are shocked and sad. Our original expectation of being is goodness.
# The Aesthetic: Our being in the world is always incarnate. We live through our bodies and basic to our being is our embodied relationship with the world. The aesthetic is the idiotic incarnate. In beauty and the sublime we get physical intimations of the good of the to be. The aesthetic potency refers to much more than the "Kantian" purified realm of the aesthetic. The aesthetic potency deals with our embodied sensual communication and interaction with the world. In the experience of the sublime, for instance-again not taken in the Kantian sense-we get an intimation of the overdetermination of the origin. The exceeding power and force of being is intimated aesthetically to us through the sublime; our reaction is a sensual one through which we come to know the overdetermined power of the "to be". Our relationship with the ethos is always communicative.
# The Dianoetic: The rational potency of lawmaking and determination. The dianoetic potency looks at the world through laws and determinate formulas. Within the equivocity of the ethos and the interplay of sameness and difference there emerge some subtle constancies which we can determine through the dianoetic potency. There are some regularities which prove helpful to live in the ethos, and these are determined by this potency. The dianoetic are constancies always already at work in forms of being together.
# The Transcendental: The potency of a binding universality or '''condition of possibility'''. Some constancies in the ethos are so prevalent so as to be called transcendental. The transcendental potency is that which empowers us within the ethos to look for the more general and unconditional condition of possibility. Taken in a Platonic sense, as opposed to Kantian, this condition of possibility is something more akin to the original "good" that always qualifies the ethos. We come to the realisation of the 'agapeic origin' thanks to the transcendental potency. Itself not free of equivocities, the search for the unconditioned condition of possibility must include evil and death in whatever condition of possibility it finds. The origin that gives the 'to be' is thus itself not free of equivocities. To see the transcendental we must die. The transcendental is not a metaphysical qualification but rather ontological as referring to the Good itself. The origin as the agapeic good that gives all being has an ontological determination as Good. There are two transcendental relationships: 1) that between the origin and the ethos: having the characteristic of agapeic; and 2) that between the self and other: having the characteristic of being metaxological.
# The Eudaimonistic: The sense of wholeness of how we are in the world. This potency, calling up the 'daimon' as the between is the potency of the possibility for a more general wholeness that calls up the idiotic and aesthetic as well as the dianoetic and transcendental. Seen metaxologically, eudaimonic wholeness in this sense might be made concrete by either the "erotic sovereign" (Nietzsche) or the "agapeic servant" (Jesus). Desmond finds it problematic whether the erotic sovereign can be regarded as being truly whole, given that it doesn't fully consider the otherness of the ethos, which is overdetermined. The erotic sovereign is in the end transcendence without transcendence, because it only transcends again into itself, even if as a higher form, and there is never another involved. The eudaimonistic, calling up Aristotle's original conception of a man of phronesis as happy, is the potency that can take both the dianoetic and transcendental as constancies and law, and apply them to specific instances within the chiaroscuro involved in the idiotic and aesthetic. This being in between of the daimon correlates to a higher sense of wholeness being both involved in and transcending the ethos.
# The Transcending: This is the potency of the "between" itself; the mystery of self-surpassing and the excess of the overdetermined milieu itself. The transcending potency can only be seen metaxologically because it is itself a move towards the open overdeterminate, which is only seen thus. A movement towards the agapeic cannot be done dialectically or univocally because both narrow and define, nor equivocally since transcending requires movement in the between, not mere equivocity.
# The Transcendent: The ultimate power that itself allows for the possibility of all transcending. "For this we have the extraordinary word God." The Good itself, the power behind everything, is what is always intimated in the between. It allows for self-development and transcending to the Good.

== The senses of being ==
Within the ontological matrix of being, the different potencies can be expressed differently through the senses of being. These ways in which to express the potencies help explore the relations of sameness and difference within the ethos. The four potencies are:
# Univocal: This potency is that of intelligibility and identity. It is a potency most clearly seen as the driving force behind modernity. The univocal potency helps manifest intelligibility and gives determination to the ethos.
# Equivocal: The equivocal potency is marked by its indefiniteness and difference.
# Dialectic: Characterized by mediation, the dialectic sense places emphasis on self mediated wholeness.
# The Metaxological: From the Greek [[Metaxa|'metaxu']] meaning 'between', the metaxological is a view of the ethos from the between as overdetermined. Emphasizing mediation, it leaves the between open (as opposed to the dialectical) and emphasises the interplay between sameness and difference. The metaxological considers the between as overdetermined and does not attempt to constrict or define the between or the ethos as whole or progressing teleologically. It is a more robust consideration of the agapeic origin as overdetermined good

== Critique of other philosophers ==
Different philosophers can be seen as embodying different potencies and senses of being throughout the history of philosophy. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], for instance, is best defined as a transcendental univocalist. [[Nietzsche]] would come close to something like an aesthete given his acknowledgment of the aesthetic/sensual part of being; he is, however, described by Desmond as being defined by the transcending potency and being both equivocal and a dialectician. [[Hegel]] might be defined as a dialectician. Desmond believes, however, that all of these philosophers are somehow haunted by those potencies which they seek to ignore or devalue. There is a dialectics in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and there are equivocities in [[Nietzsche]]. "Metaxological vigilance" shows a clearer picture of the ethos than do any views that restrict philosophical considerations to the other senses of being and potencies.&lt;ref name=Ethics/&gt;

{{Other people|William Wallace}}
'''William Wallace''' (11 May 1844 &amp;ndash; 18 February 1897) was a Scottish [[philosopher]] and academic who became fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] and [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at [[Oxford University]]. He was best known for his studies of German philosophers, most notably Hegel, some of whose works he translated into highly regarded English editions. Although he had a somewhat forbidding manner, he was known as an able and effective teacher and writer who succeeded in greatly improving the understanding of German philosophy in the English-speaking world. He died at the age of 52 after a bicycle accident near Oxford.

==Life==
Wallace was born at Railway Place in [[Cupar]], [[Fife]], the son of master-builder James Wallace and Jane Kelloch. He was the elder of two brothers and was educated at Madras Academy (now [[Bell Baxter High School]]) in Cupar before going on to [[St Andrews University]] to study arts. He developed a strong interest in the natural world, which led him to spend much time on walks in the countryside, cycling, botany and mountaineering.&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=173|title=William Wallace|last=DeLashmutt|first=Michael W.|publisher=Templeton Press|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his parents had encouraged him to take up the study of [[theology]] as a precursor to a career in the clergy, Wallace realised that this would not best suit him and chose instead to study the [[Classics]]. He was awarded an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he studied from 1864. In 1867 he became a [[fellow]] of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. He gained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] the following year, gaining a first class in [[Honour Moderations|Moderations]] and in [[Literae Humaniores]]. He was also awarded the [[Gaisford Prize]] in 1867 for his work on Greek prose, becoming a tutor at Merton in the same year, and was elected as a [[Craven Scholarship|Craven Scholar]] in 1869.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; His [[Master of Arts]] followed in 1871 and he was appointed as Merton's librarian.&lt;ref name="Den Otter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=28546&amp;back=|last=den Otter|first=S.M.|title=Wallace, William (1843–1897)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace married Janet Barclay, a childhood friend from Cupar, on 4 April 1872. The couple had three children, a daughter and two sons. His younger brother Edwin Wallace studied at Oxford's [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and later served as vice-provost of [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]] between 1881 and his death in 1884. In 1882, Wallace became the successor to Thomas Hill Green as [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at Oxford, a position which he held along with the Merton tutorship until his death fifteen years later.&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt;

His "brusque and sarcastic" manner earned him the nickname "the Dorian", a nickname he acquired at Balliol,&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; though this was said to conceal a "generous and affectionate" nature.&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt; He was described as a man of "much genuine nobleness and a staunch uprightness of thought and speech" whose "acquaintances were numerous and friendly, but his intimates few and attached."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary - Professor William Wallace|work=The Times|date=20 February 1897|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's work focused primarily on the study and diffusion of the ideas of the German philosophers [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], of whom it was said that his knowledge was exceptional.&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt; He was highly regarded as a teacher and lecturer, usually speaking without notes in a style described as "humorous, elegant, and yet earnest" that "produced a unique impression of insight and sincerity upon his students."&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt; He sought to encourage his students to think critically and aimed to explain the sometimes arcane and technical nature of philosophical constructs in a way that was both readily understandable and expressed imaginatively,&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt; for instance commenting in one of his works that "the Absolute Idea [of Hegel] may be compared to the old man who utters the same creed as a child, but for whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime".&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt;

==Published works==
His writings included ''The Logic and Prolegomena of Hegel'' (1873), a translation of Hegel's ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences''. It was still regarded as "the most masterly and influential of all English translations of Hegel" when it was republished in 1975.&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt; The translation was accomplished in a free and creative style accompanied by extensive explanatory notes on the text, drawing parallels between the philosophy of Hegel and classical figures such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. He published ''Epicurean Philosophy'' in 1880, tracing the origins of [[Epicureanism]] and highlighting the links between the life of [[Epicurus]] and the philosophy that he espoused.&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt;

Wallace's ''Kant'' (1882), part of Blackwood's Philosophical Classics series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Philosophy: Bentham to Russell|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|page=185|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1946|isbn=9780809100729}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed the German philosopher as engaged in a dialogue with [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], two of the most influential British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]]. He published ''The Life of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'' in 1890 in which his biographical account was accompanied by a critique of the philosopher's rejection of empiricism and materialism. He attacked Schopenhauer's "unconquerable vanity" but praised his insight into the power of art and his belief that "the best life is one predicated on the underlying unity of all experience".&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt; He travelled extensively to research both works, touring Germany to learn about the cultural and geographical environment in which the German philosophers had lived and worked.&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt;

A second edition of ''The Logic of Hegel'' followed in 1892 and a third edition was published in 1893 with a lengthy analytical introduction. Wallace's work on Hegel focused on the themes that most resonated with a British audience, such as unity and community, while giving relatively less attention to more alien ideas such as the [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]].&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt; In 1894 he published a translation of the last part of Hegel's ''Encyclopaedia'' under the title of ''The Philosophy of Mind'', accompanied by five essays commenting on questions such as the method of psychology and how it related to ethics and theology.&lt;ref name="DeLashmutt" /&gt; His final work, published posthumously by [[Edward Caird]], was his ''Lectures and Essays on Natural Theology and Ethics'' which he had delivered in 1892 at the [[University of Glasgow]] as part of the [[Gifford Lectures]] on the history of [[natural theology]].&lt;ref name="Den Otter" /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:RockOfGibraltar Enslow.JPG|right|thumb|The Rock of Gibraltar Inn near Enslow Bridge]]
Wallace died on 19 February 1897 as a result of a bicycle accident. While descending a steep hill at [[Enslow|Enslow Bridge]] at [[Bletchington]] near Oxford, he lost control of his bicycle and hit a parapet wall, fracturing his skull. He was found unconscious under his bicycle and was carried on a hurdle to The Rock of Gibraltar Inn, where he died early the next day without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial Notice|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=20 February 1897|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Holywell Cemetery]], Oxford, with his wife and one of his sons.
