Born in [[Kendal]], [[Cumbria]], Simpson was educated at [[Oakham School]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where he took a First in Law.

He was a fellow and tutor of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] from 1955-1973, before various professorships at the Universities of [[University of Kent|Kent]] (1975-1983), [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Toronto|Toronto]]. As a result of [[National Service in the United Kingdom|National Service]] with the [[Nigeria Regiment]], he retained an interest in Africa, and was Dean of the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Ghana]] in 1968-69.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;http://www.ukwhoswho.com/search/quick?quicksearch=simpson+brian{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most serious works of legal history were a ''History of the Land Law'' (2nd Edition, 1986) and a ''History of the Law of Contract'' (1975), but he is best remembered for his ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'' (1984) and ''Leading Cases in Common Law'' (1995). At the end of his career he also wrote two works on twentieth century human rights: ''In the Highest Degree Odious: Detention without Trial in Wartime Britain'' (1992) and ''Human Rights and the End of Empire: Britain and the Genesis of the European Convention'' (2001).&lt;ref name="whoswho" /&gt;

Simpson returned to an aspect of his own legal education at Oxford in a book published posthumously in September, 2011, ''Reflections on `The Concept of Law,''' delineating the environment in which [[H. L. A. Hart]] had produced the classic of jurisprudence in the setting of Oxford linguistic philosophy.

'''''Alexander the Great''''' is a 1956 [[epic film|epic]] [[historical drama film]] written, produced and directed by [[Robert Rossen]] about the life of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Greeks|Greek]] general and king [[Alexander the Great]]. It was released by [[United Artists]] and stars [[Richard Burton]] as [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] along with a large ensemble cast. Italian composer [[Mario Nascimbene]] contributed the [[film score]].

==Plot summary==
Greek statesman, [[Demosthenes]] of [[Athens]] is preparing for war to resist Greek king,  [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] of his planned invasion and takeover of all city-states and kingdoms of [[Greece]].

While Philip II is leading a campaign to take over [[Olynthus]], he is informed that his spouse [[Olympias]] has borne him a son who, she claims, is "a [[Greek god|god]] born of a god." Philip is angry because he suspects that Olympias has committed adultery and that she was not impregnated by a god; however, General Parmenio advises the king to let Alexander grow up and succeed him.

While growing up, Alexander receives instruction in history, mathematics, logic and other subjects from [[Aristotle]] in [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]]. Alexander is eager to rule and tells his tutor that like [[Achilles]] he would rather have a "short life with glory" than a "long life of obscurity." Philip then decides to send Alexander to the Macedonian capital, [[Pella]], as a regent to rule the city while Philip is away fighting wars. This is done to prevent Olympias from spreading rumors about her husband's death. Alexander uses this opportunity to rule in his own right — he becomes neither a pawn of his mother nor his father. Alexander later joins Philip and they go on campaigns of conquest together to places such as Athens in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BCE. After the battle is won, Alexander demands that no Greek city-state ever bear arms against Pella and that they supply men, arms, and ships for the war against Persia.

Philip II divorces Olympias accusing her of "unfaithfulness" and marries Attalus's niece [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]], thereby making her the new queen. This move creates a chasm between Alexander and his father, not only because Alexander's mother has been repudiated but also because his succession hangs in the balance since some men in Philip's court see him as a bastard.

[[Pausanias of Orestis|Pausanias]], a loyal friend of Alexander, assassinates Philip II whereupon Alexander kills Pausanias then and there. At this juncture, Alexander claims the loyalty of all Macedonians and assumes the titles of his father. He tells the Macedonians that the [[League of Corinth|Treaty of Corinth]] still stands. [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] is exiled for not pledging his loyalty to Alexander.

Alexander embarks on his mission to conquer the whole of Asia. Memnon, who is now in Darius III's court, advises him to retreat strategically and attack Alexander when his supplies run out. However, the lords of Persia underestimate the "boy" Alexander and resolve to fight him at [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]].

After the victory at Granicus, Alexander goes to [[Phrygia]] and unravels the [[Gordian Knot|knot]] tied by King [[Gordias|Gordius]] by cutting it.

Before the battle in Babylon, Alexander states that the [[lunar eclipse]] which some of his men thought was a bad omen means that "the Persian moon will be eclipsed by the Macedonian Sun" with which [[Aristander]] the seer agrees. After victory in Babylon, Darius III flees to the Caspian Gates to build and gather up an army; the dispirited commanders of Darius III kill him. In his will, Darius tells Alexander, "Take my daughter, [[Roxana|Roxane]], for your wife...that [[Melting pot|our worlds may become as one]]." Alexander then orders the lords of Persia that had committed [[regicide]] to be impaled upon stakes for their betrayal against their former kings.

At a drunken revelry in Babylon, Alexander declares, "I am the son of God" (Zeus) and "the world is my domain....We will march to the end of the world." In Athens, news reaches that Alexander is in [[India]] and is conquering there whereupon [[Aeschines]] proclaims, "He has outdone the gods."

Alexander takes his status to heart, his arrogance and paranoia increasing to unstable proportions, but the bold young leader's conquests come to an end after he kills his close friend, [[Cleitus the Black|Cleitus]], with his spear following a drunken argument. Grief-stricken and humbled, Alexander returns to Babylon from India, losing many of his men in the process. He marries Roxane at Susa, but falls ill soon after. When asked upon his deathbed to whom he will leave his empire, Alexander whispers, "To the strongest."

==Production==
[[Charlton Heston]] was sought for the title role, but turned it down, stating "Alexander is the easiest kind of picture to make badly". The decision to hire Richard Burton was later criticised as he looked too old for the part, despite being only 29 at the time.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048937/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=Alexander the Great|date=August 31, 1956|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, who reigned from the age of 20 until his death at age 32, was supposed to be a teenager in the first hour of the film.

Director Robert Rossen shot the film to run for over three hours, complete with an intermission, and was hugely disappointed when the producers cut the film down to 141 minutes.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film has a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes of "[[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|0%]]" derived from seven reviews averaging 3.7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000580-alexander_the_great/|title=Alexander the Great|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a psychiatric evaluation, it was determined that Moskvin suffered from a form of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. In May 2012, Moskvin was sentenced to [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3332823/ court-ordered psychiatric evaluation]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leninsky.nnov.sudrf.ru/modules.php?name=sud_delo&amp;srv_num=1&amp;name_op=case&amp;case_id=4702908&amp;delo_id=1540006|title = Criminal proceedings - CASE number 1-167 / 2012|date = 25 May 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = Leninsky District court of Nizhny Novgorod|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been held in a psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;

Vladimir Stravinskas, the head of the [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation]] for the Nizhny Novgorod region, called the case exceptional and unparalleled in modern forensics.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

==Personal life and education  ==

Moskvin lived in Nizhny Novgorod, the fifth largest city in Russia.&lt;ref name="depofinv"/&gt; Moskvin said he began wandering through cemeteries with friends when still a schoolboy.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In particular, they visited the Krasnaya Etna Cemetery located in the [[Leninsky District, Russia|Leninsky district]] of Nizhny Novgorod.&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tankpreint"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kokina.ru/moskvin/interview.htm|title = Interview with Anatoly Moskvin|date = 2011|accessdate = 8 January 2016|website = |publisher = Tanya Tank|last = Kokin-Slavin|first = Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article written shortly before his arrest, Moskvin explained his interest in the dead, attributing it to a childhood incident during which he witnessed a funeral procession for an eleven-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="tankpreint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Moskvin alleged that the participants forced him to kiss the dead girl's face, writing that "an adult pushed my face down to the waxy forehead of the girl in an embroidered cap, and there was nothing I could do but kiss her as ordered."&lt;ref name="tank"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kokina.ru/art2011-38.htm|title = Detained local historian Anatoly Moskvin-nekropolist|date = 2011|accessdate = 8 January 2016|website = |publisher = Tanya Tank|last = Kokin-Slavin|first = Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tankpreint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

After graduating from the [[Philology|Philological]] faculty of [[Moscow State University]] Moskvin became well known in academic circles.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; His main areas of academic interests were [[Celts|Celtic]] history and [[folklore]], as well as languages and linguistics.&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Moskvin also had a deep interest in cemeteries, burial rituals,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; [[death]],&lt;ref name="tankpreint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; and the occult.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; He also kept a personal library of over 60,000 books and documents,&lt;ref name="komm"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1827172 |title=We are confident that it will release |first=Oleg|last=Kashin |work= |publisher=[[Kommersant]] |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large collection of dolls.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Fellow academics described him as both a genius&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt; and an eccentric.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

As an adult, Moskvin led a secluded life.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; He never married or dated,&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; instead preferring to live with his parents&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt; including his father, Yuri F.

A former lecturer in Celtic Studies at Nizhny Novgorod Linguistic University,&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt; Moskvin also previously worked at the Institute of Foreign Languages.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; A [[Philology|philologist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[polyglotism|polyglot]] who spoke thirteen languages, Moskvin wrote several books, papers and translations, all well-known in academic circles.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Moskvin also occasionally worked as a journalist&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/24/anatoly-moskvin-corpses-russia_n_6043662.html|title = Man, Anatoly Moskvin, Who Mummified Girl's Corpses Dressed Up For Parties 'Not Fit For Trial'|date = 24 October 2014|access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = The Huffington Post|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly contributed to local newspapers and publications.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Describing himself as a "necropolist", Moskvin was considered an expert on local cemeteries in the Nizhny Novgorod region.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

In 2005, Oleg Riabov, a fellow academic and publisher, commissioned Moskvin to summarize and list the dead in more than 700 cemeteries in forty regions of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/11/28/russian-historian-anatoly-moskvin-collected-dead-girls-at-home.html|title = Russian Historian Anatoly Moskvin Collected Dead Girls at Home|date = 28 November 2011|access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = The Daily Beast|last = Nemtsova|first = Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moskvin claimed to have gone on foot to inspect 752 cemeteries across the region from 2005 to 2007, walking up to 30&amp;nbsp;km (18.6 miles) a day.&lt;ref name="tankpreint" /&gt; During these travels, he drank from puddles, spent nights in haystacks and at abandoned farms, or slept in the cemeteries themselves, even going so far as to spend a night in a coffin being prepared for a funeral.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; Moskvin also claimed that on his extensive travels he was sometimes questioned by police on the suspicion of vandalism and theft, but that he was never arrested or reprimanded.&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; The work itself remains unpublished but has been described as "unique" and "priceless" by Alexei Yesin, the editor of ''Necrologies'', a weekly paper to which Moskvin was a regular contributor.&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Moskvin's arrest, Yesin stated that he was confident that there had been a mistake and Moskvin would soon be exonerated.&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; He also told the [[Associated Press]] that Moskvin was a loner who had "certain quirks" but who had given no indication that he was up to anything unusual.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Between 2006 and 2010, Moskvin worked as a freelance correspondent for the newspaper ''Nizhny Novgorod Worker'', publishing articles twice a month. His father also sometimes wrote for the paper.&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; During 2008, Moskvin wrote an extensive series of articles on the history of Nizhny Novgorod cemeteries that appeared in the paper.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt;

==Arrest and criminal proceedings==
Moskvin was arrested on November 2, 2011 by police investigating a spate of [[Desecration|grave desecrations]] in cemeteries in and around Nizhny Novgorod.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Investigators from the Center for Combating Extremism discovered the twenty-six bodies &lt;ref name="chan5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;(initially reported as twenty-nine&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15653074 |title=Russian 'grave robber made dolls from girls' corpses' |author= |work= |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8878306/Russian-grave-digger-dresses-up-29-bodies-and-puts-them-on-display-at-home.html |title=Russian grave digger dresses up 29 bodies and puts them on display at home |author= |work= |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Moskvin's flat and garage.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep8wcPP0kp4 Video] released by police shows the bodies seated on shelves and sofas in small rooms full of books, papers and general clutter.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Although only twenty-six bodies were discovered in his home, Moskvin was suspected of desecrating as many as 150 graves&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; after police found numerous grave accoutrements such as metal nameplates removed from headstones. Police also discovered instructions for making the "dolls", maps of cemeteries in the region, and a collection of photographs and videos depicting open graves and disinterred bodies, though none of these photos or videos could be conclusively connected to bodies found in the apartment.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; According to the investigation, the bodies were removed from cemeteries in the Nizhny Novgorod region as well as cemeteries in [[Moscow]] and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Moskvin actively cooperated with investigators.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;

After exhuming the corpses from their graves, Moskvin researched mummification theories and technique from books in an attempt to preserve the bodies.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; He dried the corpses using a combination of salt and baking soda and then cached the bodies in secure and dry places in and around cemeteries.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Once the bodies were dried, he carried the bodies back to his home where he used various methods to make "dolls" of the corpses.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Unable to prevent the bodies from withering and shrinking as they dried, he would wrap the limbs in strips of cloth to provide fullness, or he would stuff the bodies with rags and padding, sometimes adding wax masks decorated with nail polish over their faces before dressing them in brightly colored children's clothes and wigs.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; These details made the bodies appear to be large homemade dolls, which prevented their discovery by his parents. It was unclear if each dolls contained a full set of human remains.&lt;ref name="chan5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://5-tv.ru/news/47262/ |title=In Nizhny Novgorod, the scientist-ethnographer made a vault in his apartment|first=Oleg|last=Kashin |work= |publisher=[[Petersburg – Channel 5|Channel 5, Russia]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Moskvin claimed he made the dolls over the course of ten years. His parents, who were away for large portions of the year, were unaware of his activities.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt;

Moskvin was charged under Article 244 of the Criminal Code for the desecration of graves and dead bodies, a charge which carried up to five years in prison.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Originally Moskvin was also accused of having defaced the graves of Muslims,&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt; but this charge was later dropped.&lt;ref name="komm" /&gt;

After a psychiatric evaluation, it was determined that Moskvin suffered from a form of paranoid schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt; In a hearing on 25 May 2012, the [[Leninsky District, Russia|Leninsky District]] [[Judiciary of Russia|court]] of Nizhny Novgorod deemed Moskvin unfit to stand trial, releasing him from criminal liability. He was instead sentenced to "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3332823/ coercive medical measures]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leninsky.nnov.sudrf.ru/modules.php?name=sud_delo&amp;srv_num=1&amp;name_op=case&amp;case_id=4702908&amp;delo_id=1540006|title = Criminal proceedings - CASE number 1-167 / 2012|date = 25 May 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = Leninsky District court of Nizhny Novgorod|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution was satisfied with the decision and did not appeal the verdict.&lt;ref name="rgru"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rg.ru/2012/05/25/reg-pfo/moskvin-anons.html|title = Nizhny Novgorod necrophiliac sentenced to compulsory treatment|date = |access-date = 14 January 2016|website = |publisher = Rossiyskaya Gazeta|last = Makarova|first = Albina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moskvin was removed to a psychiatric clinic, with his stay to be reviewed regularly. In February 2013, a hearing approved an extension of his psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leninsky.nnov.sudrf.ru/modules.php?name=sud_delo&amp;srv_num=1&amp;name_op=case&amp;case_id=30426777&amp;delo_id=1540006|title = Criminal proceedings - CASE number 1-63 / 2013 (1-469 / 2012;)|date = 27 February 2013|access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = Leninsky District court of Nizhny Novgorod|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment was again extended April 2014,&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt;  and yet again in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1460902|title = Nekropolist Anatoly Moskvin continue compulsory treatment|date = 9 April 2014|access-date = 14 January 2016|website = Вести.Ru|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a spokesman stated, "After three years of monitoring him in a psychiatric clinic, it is absolutely clear that Moskvin is not mentally fit for trial...He will therefore be kept for psychiatric treatment at the clinic."&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; As of 2016, every request for the extension of Moskvin's treatment has been approved.

===Motive===
Moskvin has stated that he felt great sympathy for the dead children and felt that they could be brought back to life by either science or black magic.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; He enclosed the remains in the dolls in an attempt to give them functional bodies to be used when he eventually discovered a way to bring them back to life, feeling that their physical remains were too decayed and ugly for them to feel comfortable or happy. Moskvin said that he was aware that he was committing a crime, but felt the dead children were "calling out" to him, begging to be rescued. He believed that rescuing the children was more important than obeying the law.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; He was also motivated by his own desire to have children, specifically a daughter.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Moskvin often regretted that he never had children and at one point attempted to adopt a young girl against the wishes of his parents,&lt;ref name="tank" /&gt; but his application was declined due to his low income.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt; Moskvin denied any sexual attraction to the dolls and instead considered them to be his children. He would talk to and interact with the corpses, sing songs to them, watch cartoons with them, and even hold birthday parties and celebrate holidays for their benefit.&lt;ref name="depofinv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt;

In an interview after his arrest, Moskvin explained that as an expert on Celtic culture, he had learned that the ancient [[Druid]]s slept on graves in order to communicate with [[spirit]]s of their dead. He also studied the culture of the peoples of [[Siberia]], in particular, the culture of the ancient [[Yakuts]], and discovered they had a similar practice for communicating with the dead. Moskvin began searching for obituaries of recently dead children. When he found an obituary that "spoke" to him, he would sleep on her grave in order to determine if the child's spirit wished to be brought back to life. Moskvin claimed he had been doing this for around twenty years and insisted that when he began, he never dug up a grave without the permission of the child within. As he grew older, it became physically painful for him to sleep on the graves, so he began bringing the bodies home where it would be more comfortable to sleep near them. He hoped the spirits would be more willing to speak in a safe, welcoming home and that they might be easier for him to hear when they were no longer underground.&lt;ref name="crimcron" /&gt;

'''Andrés Pérez De Ribas''' (born at [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordova]], [[Spain]], 1576; died in [[Mexico]], 26 March 1655) was a Spanish [[Jesuit]] missionary, and historian of north-western Mexico.

==Life==
He joined the Society of Jesus in 1602, coming at once to America, and finishing his [[novitiate]] in Mexico in 1604. In the same year he was sent to undertake the Christianization of the [[Ahome]] and [[Suaqui]] of northern [[Sinaloa]], of whom the former were friendly and anxious for teachers, while the latter had just been brought to submission after a hard campaign. Within a year he had both tribes gathered into towns, each with a church, while all of the Ahome and a large part of the Suaqui had been baptized. The two tribes together numbered about 10,000.

In 1613, being then superior of the Sinaloa district, he was instrumental in procuring the submission of a hostile mountain tribe. In 1617, in company with other Jesuit missionaries whom he had brought from [[Mexico City]], he began the conversion of the powerful and largely hostile [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] tribe of [[Sonora]], whose population was estimated at 30,000. Within a few years, most of them had been gathered into eight mission towns.

In 1620 Ribas was recalled to Mexico to assist in the college.  He was ultimately appointed provincial, which post he held for several years. After a visit to Rome in 1643 to take part in the election of a general of the order, he devoted himself chiefly to study and writing until his death.

==Works==
He left numerous works, religious and historical, most of which are still in manuscript, but his reputation as an historian rests upon his history of the Jesuit missions of Mexico published at Madrid in 1645, one year after its completion, under the title: ''Historia de los Triunfos de Nuestra Santa Fe entre gentes las más bárbaras ... conseguidos por los soldados de la milicia de Ia Compañía de Jesús en las misiones de la Provincia de Nueva-España''.&lt;ref&gt;English translation 1999 by Daniel T. Reff, Maureen Ahern, and Richard K. Danford as ''History of the Triumphs of Our Holy Faith Amongst the Most Barbarous and Fierce Peoples of the New World''.{{ISBN|978-0-8165-1720-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this work [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]] says:

:"It is a complete history of Jesuit work in [[Nueva Vizcaya]], practically the only history the country had from 1590 to 1644, written not only by a contemporary author but by a prominent actor in the events narrated, who had access to all the voluminous correspondence of his order, comparatively few of which documents have been preserved. In short, Ribas wrote under the most favourable circumstances and made good use of his opportunities."

:''Not to be confused with the Bastion Point near [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].''
'''Bastion Point''' ({{lang-mi|Kohimarama}} or {{Lang|mi|Takaparawhā}}) is a coastal piece of land in [[Orakei]], [[Auckland]], New Zealand, overlooking the [[Waitematā Harbour]]. The area is significant in New Zealand history as the site of protests by Māori against forced [[Alienation (property law)|land alienation]] by {{Lang|mi|[[pākehā]]}} (non-Māori New Zealanders) in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="TE ARA1"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/Maori/5/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/3/en Police cordon At Bastion Point (3rd of 3)] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 31 July 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The land was occupied by [[Ngāti Whātua]], and before the [[History of New Zealand|colonisation of New Zealand]] it was part of important lands for the {{Lang|mi|[[iwi]]}} (tribe), overlooking rich fishing and farming areas.

The surrounding land was bought or confiscated by the [[New Zealand Government]] for [[public works]] and development over a period stretching from the 1840s into the 1950s.

==Occupation==
In 1885 the New Zealand Government built a military outpost at [[Kohimarama]], or Bastion Point, because of its commanding strategic position overlooking the [[Waitematā Harbour]].

When in 1941 the Crown no longer needed Bastion Point for defence, it did not return the land to its traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] owners but instead gifted it to the [[Auckland City Council]] for a reserve. (This was the last {{convert|60|acre|ha|1}} of uncommitted land at Orakei that the {{Lang|mi|[[hapū]]}} [[Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei]] still hoped to get back.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/publications-and-resources/school-resources/orakei/the-loss-of-the-orakei-block/|title=The Loss of the Orakei Block|publisher=[[Waitangi Tribunal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the Crown announced that it planned to develop Bastion Point by selling it to the highest bidder for high-income housing. [[Joe Hawke]], members of his {{Lang|mi|hapū}}, and other activists, formed the Orakei Māori Action Committee, taking [[direct action]] to stop the subdivision. In 1977–1978 the Orakei Māori Action Committee organised an [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] of the remaining Crown land, 2 days before construction of the housing was to start, to prevent its confiscation by the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Muldoon Government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The occupiers constructed a {{Lang|mi|[[marae]]}} and housing, and grew crops. A fire in one of the buildings caused the death of a young girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=49AF06E3-FBCB-45C5-9E97-2C2044B558C2&amp;chapter=63 |title=Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on the Orakei Claim – 9.4 The Assessment of Competing Claims |publisher=[[Waitangi Tribunal]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017142021/http://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=49AF06E3-FBCB-45C5-9E97-2C2044B558C2&amp;chapter=63 |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation lasted for 507 days; it ended on 25 May 1978,&lt;ref name="TE ARA1"/&gt; when 800 police and personnel of the [[New Zealand Army]] forcibly removed the occupiers and destroyed the temporary buildings—including vegetable gardens and the {{Lang|mi|marae}}. Two hundred and twenty two protesters were arrested. The occupation and the use of force to end it played a part in highlighting alleged injustices against Māori, and the occupation became a major landmark in the history of [[Māori protest movement|Māori protest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/104201927/dawn-service-marks-40-years-since-eviction-at-bastion-point|title=Dawn service marks 40 years since eviction at Bastion Point|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s New Zealand Government returned the land to Ngāti Whātua, with compensation, as part of a [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlement process.

In 1980, filmmakers [[Merata Mita]], [[Leon Narbey]], and Gerd Pohlmann released a documentary, ''Bastion Point Day 507'', in support of the protest about the takeover of Māori land.

The '''Buxton Memorial Fountain''' is a memorial and [[drinking fountain]] in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], that commemorates the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] of [[slavery|slave]]s in the [[British Empire]] in 1834.

It was commissioned by [[Charles Buxton]] MP, and was dedicated to his father [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]] along with [[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]], [[Henry Brougham, 3rd Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] and [[Stephen Lushington (judge)|Stephen Lushington]], all of whom were involved in the abolition. It was designed by Charles Buxton, who was himself an amateur architect, in collaboration with the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] architect [[Samuel Sanders Teulon]] (1812–1873) in 1865, coincidentally with the passing of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which effectively ended the western slave trade.&lt;ref name="BHO45180"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45180 Westminster – King St, Great George St and the Broad Sanctuary] in ''Old and New London: Volume 4'' (1878), pp. 26–35, from British History Online&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was completed in February 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | ref = harv | last = Ward-Jackson | first = Philip | year = 2011 | title = Public Sculpture of Historic Westminster: Volume 1 | series = Public Sculpture of Britain | volume = 14 | location = Liverpool | publisher = Liverpool University Press | page = 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally constructed in [[Parliament Square]], erected at a cost of £1,200.   As part of the postwar redesign of the square it was removed in 1949 and not reinstated in its present position in [[Victoria Tower Gardens]] until 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2241.aspx Listing of 18 historic buildings amended to highlight their links to the abolition of slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929040755/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2241.aspx |date=2009-09-29 }} DCMS/English Heritage Press Release 20 December 2007
&lt;/ref&gt;
There were eight decorative figures of British rulers on it, but four were stolen in 1960 and four in 1971. They were replaced by fibreglass figures in 1980. By 2005 these were missing, and the fountain was no longer working.  Between autumn 2006 and February 2007 restoration works were carried out.  The restored fountain was unveiled on 27 March 2007 as part of the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the act to abolish the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6497935.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Protest disrupts slavery service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial plaque commemorating the 150th anniversary of the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was added in 1989.

==Description==
[[File:David Harewood on Buxton Memorial Fountain.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the memorial by [[David Harewood]]]]
The base is octagonal, about twelve feet in diameter, having open arches on the eight sides, supported on clustered shafts of polished Devonshire marble around a large central shaft, with four massive granite basins. Surmounting the pinnacles at the angles of the octagon are eight figures of bronze, representing the different rulers of England; the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] represented by [[Caractacus]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the [[Danes (ancient people)|Danes]] by [[Canute the Great|Canute]], the [[Saxons]] by [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]], the [[Normans]] by [[William the Conqueror]], and so on, ending with [[Queen Victoria]]. The fountain bears an inscription to the effect that it is "intended as a memorial of those members of Parliament who, with Mr. [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]], advocated the abolition of the British slave-trade, achieved in 1807; and of those members of Parliament who, with Sir T. Fowell Buxton, advocated the emancipation of the slaves throughout the British dominions, achieved in 1834. It was designed and built by Mr. Charles Buxton, M.P., in 1865, the year of the final extinction of the slave-trade and of the abolition of slavery in the United States."&lt;ref name="BHO45180"/&gt;

'''Colonies in antiquity''' were [[city-state]]s founded from a mother-[[city]] (its "metropolis"),&lt;ref&gt;See [[Metropolis#Etymology and modern usage|metropolis]] for etymology&lt;/ref&gt; not from a territory-at-large.

While Greek colonies were often founded to solve [[Stasis (political history)|social unrest]] in the mother-city, by expelling a part of the population, Hellenistic, Roman, and Carthaginian colonies were used for [[Imperialism|empire-building]].

==Phoenician colonies==
{{see also|Phoenicia#Important_cities_and_colonies}}
The [[Phoenicia]]ns were the major [[trade|trading]] [[Power in international relations|power]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in the early part of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BC]]. They had trading contacts in [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]], and established colonies as far west as modern [[Spain]], at Gadir (modern [[Cádiz]]).

From Gadir the Phoenicians controlled access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[trade route]]s to [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The most famous and successful of Phoenician colonies was founded by settlers from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in 814–813 BC and called Kart-Hadasht (''Qart-ḥadašt'',&lt;ref name="Carpio1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martín Lillo Carpio|title=Historia de Cartagena: De Qart-Ḥadašt a Carthago Nova / colaboradores: Martín Lillo Carpio ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEH6PgAACAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2013|year=1992|publisher=Ed.

The [[Carthaginians]] later founded their own colony in the southeast of Spain, [[Carthago Nova]], which was eventually [[Roman conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by their enemy, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

According to María Eugenia Aubet, Professor of Archaeology at the [[Pompeu Fabra University]], Barcelona: "The earliest presence of Phoenician material in the West is documented within the precinct of the ancient city of [[Huelva]], Spain... The high proportion of Phoenician pottery among the new material found in 1997 in the Plaza de las Monjas in Huelva argues in favor of a regular presence of Phoenician people from the start of the 9th century BC. The recent radiocarbon dates from the earliest levels in Carthage situate the founding of this Tyrian colony in the years 835–800 cal BC, which coincides with the dates handed down by Flavius Josephus and Timeus for the founding of the city." &lt;ref name=Aubet2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Political and Economic Implications of the New Phoenician Chronologies|url=http://www.upf.edu/larq/_pdf/AubtCrono.pdf|publisher=Universidad Pompeu Fabra|accessdate=24 February 2013|author=Maria Eugenia Aubet|page=179|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Empuries MaisonduPeristyle.jpg|thumb|Ruins of a [[peristyle]] home from the Greek period of [[Empúries]], [[Catalonia]], Spain]]
In [[Ancient Greece]] a vanquished people would sometimes found a colony, leaving their homes to escape subjection at the hand of a foreign enemy; sometimes colonies formed as a sequel to [[civil disorder]]s, when the losers in internecine battles left to form a new city elsewhere; sometimes to get rid of surplus population, and thereby to avoid internal convulsions; and sometimes as a result of [[ostracism]]. But in most cases colony-founders aimed to establish and facilitate relations of trade with foreign countries and to further the wealth of the mother-city (in [[Greek language|Greek]] μητρόπολις ''[[metropolis|mētropolis]]''). Colonies were established in [[Ionia]] and [[Thrace]] as early as the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="HornblowerSpawforth2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hornblower | first1 = Simon | last2 = Spawforth | first2 = Antony | title = The Oxford Classical Dictionary | url = https://books.google.com/?id=flSVuAAACAAJ | accessdate = 24 February 2013 | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-956738-6 | page = 1515 | quote = From the 8th century BC the coast of Thrace was colonised by Greeks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More than thirty Greek city-states had multiple colonies. They became dotted across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world, with the most active colony-founding city, [[Miletus]], of the [[Ionian League]], spawning ninety colonies stretching throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]], from the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and [[Anatolia]] (modern Turkey) in the east, to the southern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west, as well as several colonies on the Libyan coast of northern [[Africa]],&lt;ref name="Hammond1959"&gt;{{cite book|author= Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond|title= A history of Greece to 322 B.C.|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0FoAAAAMAAJ|accessdate= 8 August 2013|year= 1959|publisher= Clarendon Press|page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 9th to the 5th centuries BC.

Greeks founded two similar types of colony, one known as an ἀποικία ''[[wikt:ἀποικία#Ancient_Greek|apoikía]]'' – a designation reflecting the [[Ancient Greek | Greek]] roots ἀπό (''[[wikt:ἀπό#Ancient_Greek|apó]]'' “away from”) + οἶκος ([[wikt:οἶκος#Ancient_Greek|oîkos]] “home”) (pl.: ἀποικίαι ''apoikiai'') – and the other as an ἐμπόριov – ''[[Emporium (antiquity)|emporion]]'' (pl.: ἐμπόρια ''emporia''). The first type of colony was a city-state on its own; the second was a Greek trading-colony.

The Greek city-states began establishing colonies around 900&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/angk/hd_angk.htm Ancient Greek Colonization and Trade and their Influence on Greek Art | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – 800&amp;nbsp;BC, at first at [[Al Mina]] on the [[coast]] of [[Syria]] and the Greek emporium Pithekoussai at [[Ischia]] in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]], both established about 800&amp;nbsp;BC by [[Euboea#Ancient|Euboeans]].&lt;ref name="Fox2010"&gt;{{cite book | author = Robin Lane Fox | title = Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer | url = https://books.google.com/?id=NZFM-TUwFxgC | accessdate = 24 February 2013 | date = 9 March 2010 | publisher = Random House Digital, Inc. | isbn = 978-0-679-76386-4 | page = 131 | quote = Robin Lane Fox examines the cultural connections made by Euboean adventurers in the 8th century }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greek colonies of the Euxine Sea.svg|thumb|upright=1.35| Ancient Greek colonies of the [[Black Sea]], 8th-3rd century BC]]
Two waves of new colonists set out from Greece at the transition between the "[[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]]" and the start of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]] – the first in the early 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC and a second burst of the colonizing spirit in the 6th century. Population growth and cramped spaces at home seem an insufficient explanation, while the economical and political dynamics produced by the competitive spirit between the frequently kingless Greek city-states – newly introduced as a concept and striving to expand their spheres of economical influence – better fits as their true incentive. Through this Greek expansion the use of coins flourished throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

Influential Greek colonies in the western Mediterranean&amp;nbsp;– many of them in today's Italy&amp;nbsp;— included [[Cumae|Cyme]], [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegium]] (Rhegion) by [[Chalcis]] and [[Messina|Zankle]] (c.&amp;nbsp;8th century), [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] by [[Corinth]]/[[Tenea]] (c.&amp;nbsp;[[730s BC|734&amp;nbsp;BC]]), [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] by Chalcis (c.&amp;nbsp;734&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Marseille|Massalia]] (the later [[Marseille]], [[France]], c.&amp;nbsp;[[590s BC|598&amp;nbsp;BC]]) and [[Agde|Agathe]] (shortly after Massalia) by [[Phocaea |Phokaia]], [[Velia|Elea]] (Italy) and [[Empúries| Emporion]] (present-day [[Spain]]) by Phokaia/Massalia (c.&amp;nbsp;[[540s BC|540&amp;nbsp;BC]] and early 6th century), [[Antibes|Antipolis]] (nowadays France) by [[Achaea]], [[Aléria|Alalia]] ([[Corsica]]) by Phokaia/Massalia (c.&amp;nbsp;545&amp;nbsp;BC) and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] ([[Cyrenaica]], present-day Libya) by [[Santorini|Thera]] (762/61 and 632/31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[:Category:Greek colonies|A list of Greek colonies with individual articles.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks also [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|colonised]] modern-day [[Crimea]] in the [[Black Sea]]. The settlements they established there included the city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)| Chersonesos]], at the site of modern-day [[Sevastopol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chersonesos.org/?p=index&amp;l=eng|title= About Chersonesos, Sevastopol|last= |first= |date= |publisher= |work= National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos|accessdate= 7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area with significant Greek colonies was the coast of ancient [[Illyria]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] (e.g. the ancient "Aspalathos", modern-day [[Split, Croatia]]).

[[File:Greek and Phoenician Colonies in The Iberian Peninsula.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The Iberian peninsula in 300 BC. Phoenician cities in blue, Greek cities in red.]]
[[Cicero]] remarks on the extensive Greek colonization, noting that "It were as though a Greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De republica'', ii, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Several formulae generally shaped the solemn and sacred occasions when a new colony set forth. If a Greek city decided to send out a colony, the citizenry almost invariably consulted an [[oracle]], especially one such as the [[Delphi|Oracle of Delphi]], beforehand. Sometimes certain classes of citizens were called upon to take part in the enterprises; sometimes one son was chosen by lot from every house where there were several sons; and strangers expressing a desire to join were admitted. A person of distinction was selected to guide the emigrants and to make the necessary arrangements. It was usual to honor these founders of colonies, after their death, as heroes. Some of the sacred fire was taken from the public hearth in the [[Prytaneis|Prytaneum]], from which the fire on the public hearth of the new city was kindled. Just as each individual had his private shrines, so the new community maintained the worship of its chief domestic deities, the colony sending embassies and votive gifts to the mother-city's principal festivals for centuries afterwards.

After the conquests of the [[Macedonian Kingdom]] and [[Alexander the Great]], a further number of [[Hellenistic period| Hellenistic]] colonies were founded also in Asia (as far away as India), Europe and Africa.

===Greek colonies in Anatolia===
The [[Mycenaeans]] [[Greeks]] by the 15th century BC had reached [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]], where Teucer is said to have founded the first colony, and the shores of Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;"The Greeks". Encyclopædia Britannica. US: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. 2008. Online Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Criti, Maria; Arapopoulou, Maria (2007). A History of Ancient Greek: From the Beginnings to Late Antiquity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 417–420. {{ISBN|0-521-83307-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Greeks were settled in [[Ionia]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. [[Miletus]] in Ionia was an ancient Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia, near the mouth of the Maeander River. The Late [[Bronze Age]], 13th century BC, saw the arrival in the area of [[Luwian language]] speakers from south central Anatolia calling themselves the [[Carians]]. Later in that century other [[Greeks]] arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the [[Hittites]]. After the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000 BC was resettled extensively by the [[Ionian Greeks]]. Before the invasion from [[Persia]] in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered the greatest and wealthiest of Greek [[Polis]].&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of Greek Philosophy By John Marshall page 11 “For several centuries prior to the great Persian inversion of Greece, perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek world was Miletus”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Greek civilization By David Sansone page 79 “In the seventh and sixth centuries BC the city of Miletus was among the most prosperous and powerful of Greek Poleis.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek [[city-states]] were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started [[Western philosophy]] on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl Roebuck, The World of Ancient Times, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Diogenes of Apollonia]] were among of the renowned [[Milesian school]] philosophers. [[Heraclitus]] lived in [[Ephesus]] (/ˈɛfəsəs/;[1] Greek: Ἔφεσος Ephesos; Turkish: Efes) another ancient Greek city&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gagarin (2010).

Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist. {{ISBN|978-81-269-0775-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anaxagoras]] was from [[Clazomenae]], a city on the coast of [[Ionia]] and a member of the [[Ionian League]].  All [[Ancient Greek dialects]] were spoken in Anatolia depending on the origin of the City states and the [[list of ancient Greek theatres]] in Anatolia is one of the longest among all places Greeks had settled.  In [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Greeks]] traditionally lived in the region of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], on the shores of today's Turkey's Black Sea and in the [[Pontic Alps]], in northeastern [[Anatolia]] and the former Armenian province of Kars in Caucasus, and also in Georgia. Those from southern Russia, the Ukraine, and Crimea are often referred to as 'Northern [[Pontic Greeks]]', in contrast to those from 'South Pontus', which strictly speaking is [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] proper. Those from Georgia, northeastern Anatolia, and the ones who lived in present-day Armenia are often referred to as 'Eastern [[Pontic Greeks]]' or Caucasus Greeks. The Greeks have founded well known cities to this day.  The cities of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] (Greek: Σινώπη, Sinōpē) and [[Trabzon]] (Greek: Τραπεζοῦς Trapezous), were founded by [[List of ancient Milesians|Milesian]] traders (756 BC) as well as [[Samsun]], [[Rize]] and [[Amasya]].  Greek was the lingua franca of Anatolia from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] up to the invasion of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] in the eleventh century AD.

===Relations of colony and metropolis===

The relation between colony and mother-city, known literally as the ''[[metropolis]]'', was viewed{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} as one of mutual affection. Any differences that arose were resolved by peaceful means whenever possible, war being deemed excusable only in cases of extreme necessity. (Note though that the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 431 -404 BC broke out in part as a result of a dispute between [[Corinth]] and her colony of [[Corfu|Corcyra]] (Corfu).) The charter of foundation contained general provisions for the arrangement of the affairs of the colony, and also some special enactments. A colony would usually adopt the constitution of the mother-city, but the new city remained politically independent. The "holy fire" of the ''metropolis'' was preserved in a special place to remind people of the common ties. If the colony sent out a fresh colony on its own account, the mother-city was generally consulted, or was at least requested to furnish a leader. Frequently the colonies, declaring their commitment to the various metropolitic alliances formed in the Greek mainland and for religious reasons, would pay tribute in religious centres, like Delphi, [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] or [[Delos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cl135/Students/Maria_Daniels/colonies.html |title= Ancient Greek colonies &amp;#124; 5.97 &amp;#124; Maria Daniels |publisher= Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate= 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cleruchy|cleruchs]] (κληροῦχοι, ''klêrouchoi'') formed a special class of Greek colonists, each being assigned an individual plot of land (κλῆρος, ''klêros'') in the place to which they had been assigned. The trade factories set up in foreign countries, such as [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], were somewhat different from the ordinary colonies, the members retaining the right of domicile in their own [[homeland]] and confining themselves to their own quarter in the foreign city.

==Roman colonies==
{{main|Colonia (Roman)}}
[[File:Romancoloniae.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|right|Map showing Roman colonies. Augustus' "roman coloniae" in north Africa are depicted in red.]]

It was an old custom in [[History of Italy during Roman times|ancient Italy]] to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests. The [[Roman Republic|Romans]], having no [[standing army]], used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison. These bodies would consist partly of [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]], usually to the number of three hundred; partly of members of the [[Latin League]], in larger numbers. The third part of the conquered territory was handed over to the settlers. The ''coloniae civium Romanorum'' (colonies of Roman citizens) were specially intended to secure the two seacoasts of Italy, and were hence called ''coloniae maritimae''. The ''coloniae Latinae'', of which there was a far greater number, served the same purpose for the mainland.

The duty of leading the colonists and founding the settlement was entrusted to a commission usually consisting of three members. These men continued to stand in the relation of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons (''patroni'')]] to the colony after its foundation. The colonists entered the conquered city in military array, preceded by banners, and the foundation was celebrated with special solemnities. The coloniae were free from taxes, and had their own [[Roman Constitution|constitution]], a copy of the Roman, electing from their own body their [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and other officers of State. To this constitution the original inhabitants had to submit. The ''coloniae civium Romanorum'' retained [[Roman citizenship]], and were free from military service, their position as outposts being regarded as an equivalent. The members of the ''coloniae Latinae'' served among the ''[[socii]]'', the allies, and possessed the so-called ''[[Latin Right|ius Latinum]]'' or Latinitas. This secured to them the right of acquiring property, the concept of ''commercium'', and the right of settlement in Rome, and under certain conditions the power of becoming Roman citizens; though in course of time these rights underwent many limitations.

From the time of the [[Gracchi]] the colonies lost their military character. Colonization came to be regarded as a means of providing for the poorest class of the [[Plebs|Roman Plebs]]. After the time of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] it was adopted as a way of granting land to veteran soldiers. The right of founding colonies was taken away from the people by [[Julius Caesar]], and passed into the hands of the [[Roman Emperor|Roman emperors]], who used it mainly in the [[Roman province|provinces]] for the exclusive purpose of establishing military settlements, partly with the old idea of securing conquered territory. It was only in exceptional cases that the provincial colonies enjoyed the immunity from taxation which was granted to those in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Most of this text is taken from [[Harry Thurston Peck]]'s ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' (1898)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair''' (April 6, 1837 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1921) was the American born [[matriarch]] of [[Glenveagh Castle]] in [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], now an Irish [[national park]].  Cornelia Adair was born to privilege in the United States, became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] subject, lived much of her life in [[Ireland]], but also maintained residence on the [[JA Ranch]] of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]], a still-active cattle [[ranch]], and in [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]], the seat of [[Donley County, Texas]].  She is also remembered for having become a [[naturalization|naturalised]] [[British subject]] and as a published [[diarist]].

Though she could not vote in the United States, Cornelia Adair was active in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], to which her family had been devoted since its founding in 1854.  A noted philanthropist, Cornelia is known for inviting Belgian [[refugee]]s to stay at Glenveagh Castle during [[World War I]].

==Early life==
Cornelia was the second of six children born to a prominent couple, future General [[James S. Wadsworth|James Samuel Wadsworth, Sr.]] (1807–1864), and the former Mary Craig Wharton (1811–1872). Though she was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the Wadsworth family lived at the Hartford House estate in the village of [[Geneseo, New York|Geneseo]] in [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]] in western [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=JA&gt;[http://www.ranches.org/JAranch.htm JA Ranch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Among her siblings was brother [[James Wolcott Wadsworth]], father of [[U.S. Senator]] [[James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.|James W. Wadsworth Jr.]], and sister, Elizabeth Wadsworth, who married [[Arthur Smith-Barry, 1st Baron Barrymore]] in 1889, becoming Lady Barrymore.

In 1855, the Wadsworths travelled to England and [[France]] on a two-year sojourn.

===Marriages and children===
On their return in 1857, Cornelia married Montgomery Harrison Ritchie of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], a descendant of [[Federalist Party]] leader [[Harrison Gray Otis (lawyer)|Harrison Gray Otis]].  The Ritchies had two sons, Arthur Ritchie, who died in childhood, and [[J. Wadsworth Ritchie|James Wadsworth "Jack" Ritchie]] (1861–1924), who outlived his mother by only three years.&lt;ref name=PPHM&gt;JA Ranch exhibit, [[Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum]], [[Canyon, Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband fought in [[North Carolina]] in 1862 in the [[American Civil War]] under [[Union Army]] [[General]] [[Ambrose E. Burnside]].  In 1864, he entered a battlefield to retrieve her father, General Wadsworth, who was mortally wounded in the head in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].  Ritchie brought Wadsworth's body to Geneseo for burial. Not long afterwards, Ritchie himself died of an illness contracted in battle and was also interred in Geneseo.&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

Widowed with her two young sons, Cornelia decided to have the children educated in [[Paris]]. On returning to the United States, she attended a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political reception in New York.&lt;ref name=hbook&gt;Nancy Baker Jones, "Cornelia Adair", '’The Handbook of Texas'’, Online edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Ritchie family was staunchly Republican from 1854, when the party was established. At the gathering, she first met [[John George Adair]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-Irish businessman and [[landowner]] from County Donegal. The two married in 1869 and lived in Ireland, in Great Britain, and in [[New York City]], where Adair, also known as "Jack Adair", opened a [[brokerage]] house.&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

Adair disliked living in New York City and wished to see the [[American West]]. For a time he established his brokerage firm in [[Denver, Colorado]]. In 1874, the Adairs joined a [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunt along the [[South Platte River]] in [[Nebraska]] and northeastern Colorado. Cornelia's brother had served as an aide to General [[Philip H. Sheridan]], and, according to Nancy Baker Jones in ''The Handbook of Texas'', Cornelia may have used Sheridan's influence to obtain a military escort under Colonel [[Richard Irving Dodge]] to accompany the party, which departed from [[Sidney, Nebraska|Sidney]] in [[Cheyenne County, Nebraska|Cheyenne County]] in western Nebraska. Cornelia kept a diary (published 1918) of the two-month journey, which included details of a meeting near the South Platte of [[cavalry]] officers and [[Oglala Sioux]].&lt;ref name=hbook/&gt;

==Career==
In the summer of 1877, the Adairs partnered with the Texas [[cattleman]] [[Charles Goodnight]], who told them about the [[Palo Duro Canyon]] country where cattle could graze in abundance in summers, with adequate grass and water, and then winter under the protection of the canyon walls. Goodnight drove the first herd of cattle to the Palo Duro, part of a larger landscape known as the [[Llano Estacado]], or "Staked Plains" of the Texas Panhandle. The most prominent feature of the JA is the canyon on the southwest. In the centr of the ranch is a large plain. To the east are the rolling hills of Mulberry and Halls Creek. To the north is the [[Caprock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranches.org/JAranchDesc.htm JA Ranch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their contract, John Adair put up two-thirds of the capital to establish the ranch, and Goodnight was able to borrow his one-third at 10 percent interest from Adair as well as supply the initial cattle. The Adairs rarely stayed at the ranch, because of their other properties in England and Ireland. The ranch still bears Adair's initials, the JA. Goodnight and Adair signed two five-year contracts. In 1885, Adair died of natural causes while he was in [[St. Louis]]. At the time, he was returning with a servant to Ireland. Cornelia, who did not accompany Adair on that trip, had his body returned for burial in the Protestant Church graveyard at Killenard Co. Laois, Ireland.&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

===Overseeing the JA Ranch===
After John Adair's death, despite the distance and difficulty of travel at the time, Cornelia took an active interest in the JA and divided her time between the ranch, the castle in Ireland, and the house in England. She insisted that Goodnight pay high wages and recruit only upstanding [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name=hbook/&gt;

Sometimes, she questioned Goodnight's judgment in the management of the ranch. For instance, she hired John Edward Farrington as the manager after Goodnight withdrew from their arrangement even though Goodnight had specifically trained Henry Webster Taylor, Goodnight's nephew, as his successor. As the first JA manager, Goodnight had quarrelled with Cornelia's son, Jack, whom he claimed to have caught drinking alcohol and shooting craps with the cowboys in violation of the JA's strict [[code of ethics]]. Goodnight demoted Jack Ritchie, who moved to New York City and sold JA horses to the [[New York Police Department]].&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt; In 1887, she traded the Quitaque Ranch for Goodnight's one-third interest in the JA, a share that comprised {{convert|336000|acre|km2}}, 48,000 cattle as well as [[mule]]s, horses, and rights to the JA brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography|author=Dan L. Thrapp|year=1991|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0-8032-9419-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hc35mM0PqSQC&amp;pg=PA570&amp;lpg=PA570&amp;dq=cornelia+adair&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rS2yaIZfHK&amp;sig=XRyoLa_HTSxDSVI_zoH2KhQ7svY&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, while she was in London, Cornelia came upon her nephew, [[James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.]], then a former Speaker of the [[New York Assembly]]. She persuaded Wadsworth to take the vacant position of JA manager. He agreed, but after four years left again in 1915, having been elected in 1914 as a Republican to the [[United States Senate]] from New York, the first class elected under the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

One of the JA managers was [[Timothy Dwight Hobart]], a [[Vermont]] native whose experience was more in real estate than in raising cattle. He had surveyed the five million acres (20,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of the New York and Texas Land Company in [[Mobeetie, Texas|Mobeetie]], one of the first three settlements in the Panhandle. He was affiliated with the White Deer Land Company in [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]] in [[Gray County, Texas|Gray County]]. He was also a president of the [[Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association]]. Cornelia trusted him to be co-executor of her estate, of which there were many outstanding debts, not settled for two decades. Hobart was elected mayor of Pampa in 1927 but served only a few months.&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

===Clarendon, Texas===
Being a naturalised British subject who spent most of her time in Ireland, Cornelia maintained a home in [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]] n [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]], away from the ranch. She contributed generously to various civic projects about the JA Ranch, which by the time of her death covered half a million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²). She provided funds to build the Adair Hospital, later the [[Saints' Roost Museum]] in Clarendon. She contributed to the first [[Young Men's Christian Association]] building and to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church in Clarendon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintsroost.org/adair.htm The Saints' Roost Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703164517/http://www.saintsroost.org/adair.htm |date=3 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelia Adair died just days before she was planning another trip to the Texas Panhandle. Her passing had a profound effect on her Texas friends. A memorial service was held in Clarendon on the same day as her funeral in Ireland. Among the mourners was the 85-year-old Goodnight who said that except for the passing of his mother and former partner [[Oliver Loving]] no other death had so affected him as that of Mrs. Adair's. Hobart called her "one of the noblest characters I have ever known." Lester Fields Sheffy, Hobart's biographer, wrote that Mrs. Adair "loved the prairies, its hills and canyons, and its vast herds She held in highest esteem the hundreds of people who had been connected with her in this great ranching enterprise. She frequently [had] expressed a desire that her last resting place might be in the little cemetery near the [ranch] headquarters."&lt;ref&gt;Lester Fields Sheffy, ''The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855–1935: Colonization of West Texas'' (Canyon, Texas: Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, 1950), pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she was interred next to Adair at the Killenard Churchyard in Ireland.

===Glenveagh Castle===
Glenveagh was completed between 1867 and 1873. After Cornelia inherited the estate, she added a new wing and round tower to the building. She planted [[Scots Pine]] and [[rhododendron]] in her garden. Before he married Cornelia, John Adair had become notorious for having driven poor tenants off the land to improve the aesthetic beauty of Glenveagh. Cornelia though was renowned as a kind landlady and a benefactor. During [[World War I]], she used the castle to house wounded Belgian soldiers and [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ireland-fun-facts.com/glenveagh-castle.html glenveagh castle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A personal friend of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], Cornelia donated generously to establish the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]]. In the years after Cornelia's death, Glenveagh fell into disrepair. In 1984, it became an Irish national park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenveaghnationalpark.ie/history.html Glenveagh National Park – History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401123000/http://www.glenveaghnationalpark.ie/history.html |date=1 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Timothy Dwight Hobart had great difficulty with the British government and the State of Texas in disposing of Mrs. Adair's property. The governments demanded tax payments which could be raised only with the sale of parts of the ranch at a time when the market for beef prices was particularly poor. The British demands required Hobart to make several trips abroad to explain the situation to the government agents. Hobart said his greatest concern was in meeting the needs of Mrs. Adair's heirs. He also tried to honor her wishes that the ranch be sold in small parcels to settlers, a processed that dragged on for many years. He hoped petroleum would be found on Adair lands to ease in the financial consideration in the disposal of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Sheffy, "Timothy Hobart", pp. 221–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, after Hobart's death, the management of the JA passed to Mrs. Adair's grandson, [[Montie Ritchie|Montgomery Harrison Wadsworth Ritchie]], son of Jack Rithie. He managed the ranch, along with another spread in Colorado, until his retirement in 1993. The ranch then passed to Montie Ritchie's daughter, Cornelia Wadsworth "Nina" Ritchie, later the first wife of Republican [[Texas State Senate|Texas State Senator]] [[Teel Bivins]] of Amarillo, from whom she was divorced. Andrew M. Bivins, the son of Teel and Nina Bivins, since joined the JA management team. Teel Bivins served prior to his death in 2006 as [[US Ambassador]] to [[Sweden]] during the second administration of [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=PPHM/&gt;

An [[American Quarter Horse]] was named in 1940 in honour of Cornelia Adair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/cornelia+adair Cornelia Adair Quarter Horse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2015, the [[West Texas Historical Association]], at its 92nd annual meeting in Amarillo, presented a program at [[Amarillo College]] on the life of Cornelia Adair. The presentations include "Early Years and Marriages" by William Green of [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]], and from three from [[West Texas A&amp;M University]] in Canyon: Dollie Lookingbill, "Cornelia Out West: A Hunting Trip and the Formation of the JA Partnership"; Maureen Hubbart, "The Timothy Dwight Hobart Letters: Cornelia Adair's Management of the JA Ranch", and Allen Hunt, "Cornelia's Transatlantic Connections: The Later Years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swco.ttu.edu/WestTexas/conferences/Amarillo2015/2015WTHAprogram.pdf|title=The Life of Cornelia Adair|publisher=[[West Texas Historical Association]]|accessdate=21 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103005/http://swco.ttu.edu/WestTexas/conferences/Amarillo2015/2015WTHAprogram.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">'''Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum''' is an international project with the goal to publish all existing [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] bronze mirrors. The first three volumes were published in 1981. A total of thirty-four [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s has been produced.

==Background==
The first major systematic study of Etruscan mirror was [[Eduard Gerhard]]'s ''Etruskische Spiegel''. The work consists of five volumes published between 1843 and 1897 (the final volume being published after Gerhard's death). In 1973 a decision was made to make a new publication that could replace Gerhard's outdated work.&lt;ref&gt;Review: "Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum", by G. Lloyd-Morgan ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' 73 (1983), p. [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/300109%20 233-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical basis==
The basis for many creationists' beliefs is a literal or quasi-literal interpretation of the [[Old Testament]], especially from stories from the [[book of Genesis]]:

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1–2) describes how [[God]] brings the Universe into being in a series of creative acts over six days and places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a divine garden (the [[Garden of Eden]]). This story is the basis of creationist cosmology and biology.
* The [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6–9) tells how God destroys the world and all life through a great flood, saving representatives of each form of life by means of [[Noah's ark]]. This forms the basis of creationist geology, better known as [[flood geology]].

A further important element is the interpretation of the [[Biblical chronology]], the elaborate system of life-spans, "generations," and other means by which the Bible measures the passage of events from the creation (Genesis 1:1) to the [[Book of Daniel]], the last biblical book in which it appears. Recent decades have seen attempts to de-link creationism from the Bible and recast it as science; these include [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Carlson, Tremper Longman III, Science, Creation and the Bible: Reconciling Rival Theories of Origins, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Christian forms of creationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml |title=Creationism and intelligent design |date=2 June 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Islamic creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html |title=Creationism, Minus a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/16/darwin-evolution-china-politics |title=Darwinism, through a Chinese lens |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=16 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Young Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
[[File:ICR building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) is a young-Earth creationist organization.]]
Young Earth creationists such as [[Ken Ham]] and [[Doug Phillips]] believe that God created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)—based in both the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]]—has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

Old Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called "restoration creationism," holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–2|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1–2 is consequently translated:

: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." (Original act of creation.)
: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was "without form and void." This allows an indefinite "gap" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a "primordial creation" of biological life within the "gap" of time. This is thought to be "the world that then was" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this "world that then was," which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-age creationism====
{{Main|Day-age creationism}}
Day-age creationism states that the "six days" of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each "day" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "yôm," in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as "age."

Strictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Philosophic and scientific creationism===
====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Okasha's full statement is that "virtually all professional biologists regard creation science as a sham{{snd}}a dishonest and misguided attempt to promote religious beliefs under the guise of science, with extremely harmful educational consequences."&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. Common features of creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in "created kinds" or "[[Baraminology|Baramin]]" (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.

====Neo-creationism====
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Neo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=morris_neo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=425 |title=Neocreationism |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |title= Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=October 2004 |website= DarwinReconsidered.org |accessdate=Sep 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards [[supernatural]] elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term "[[Darwinism]]", which they generally mean to refer to [[evolution]], but which they may extend to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Unlike their philosophical forebears, neo-creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a young Earth, or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]].

ID originated as a re-branding of creation science in an attempt to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, teaching of intelligent design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a [[United States district court|federal district court]] to be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol=04 |reporter=cv |opinion=2688 |date=December 20, 2005}}, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 136 of 139|Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 136]].&lt;/ref&gt; and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to evolution in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive precedent]], based on previous US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' and ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' (1968), and by the application of the [[Lemon v.

===Geocentrism===
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
In [[astronomy]], the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system), is a description of the [[Cosmos]] where Earth is at the orbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Greece]]. As such, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and [[Classical planet|naked eye planets]] circled Earth, including the noteworthy systems of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis for example, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and [[Psalms]] 93:1 where the world is described as immobile.&lt;ref name="Numbers1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L. |year=1993 |origyear=Originally published 1992; New York: [[Alfred A.

=== Omphalos hypothesis ===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gosse 1857|Gosse 1857]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [[Creationist cosmologies#Starlight problem|"starlight problem"]]. The idea has been criticised as [[Last Thursdayism]], and on the grounds that it requires a deliberately deceptive creator.

==Theistic evolution==
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, is a belief that "the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sweet &amp; Feist 2007|Sweet &amp; Feist 2007]], [https://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&amp;q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&amp;f=false p. 48], "''Evolutionary Creation'' (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Scientific Affiliation:

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', there was interest in ideas of Creation by [[divine law]]. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; When ''On the Origin of Species'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as "just as noble a conception of Deity."&lt;ref name="Darwinanddesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |website=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=Cambridge University Library |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021101910/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2534 |title=Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name="bowl202"&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], pp. 202–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including specifically evolution; it is also known as "evolutionary creation." In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 2005|Scott 2005]], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[Unmoved mover#First cause|first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age creationist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of the Book of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or allegory.

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name="The Origin of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |last=Moritz |first=Albrecht |date=October 31, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 1999|Scott 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, human evolution is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Catholic Church and evolution|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies "have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akin |first=Jimmy |date=January 2004 |title=Evolution and the Magisterium |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |journal=[[Catholic Answers|This Rock]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=1049-4561 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804102139/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |archivedate=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guntzel |first=Jeff Severns |url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/032505/032505ssn.htm |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |location=Kansas City, MO |publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company |issn=0027-8939 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as "creationism" in holding that [[Miracle|divine intervention]] brought about the origin of life or that divine laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all. In the [[creation–evolution controversy]], its proponents generally take the "evolutionist" side. This sentiment was expressed by Fr. [[George Coyne]], (the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]'s chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18504 |title=Text of talk by Vatican Observatory director on 'Science Does Not Need God.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

&lt;/ref&gt; churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polkinghorne 1998|Polkinghorne 1998]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and geologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, Philo, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref name="Philo_Chapter2"&gt;[[#Philo|Philo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.earlychurch.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php |title=Philo of Alexandria (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}c.

In the US, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of evangelical Protestant (70%), [[Mormons|Mormon]] (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Social and Political Views |page=95 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-19}} Report 2: Religious Beliefs &amp; Practices, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]], asserting that scientific evidence about the age of the universe is compatible with the Bible, but that the 'days' after Genesis 1:1 were each thousands of years in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810862692|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx6nUwZzeCsC&amp;pg=PA37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1–2:3 and Genesis 2:4–25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title=Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |last=Jackson |first=Wayne |website=Apologetics Press |location=Montgomery, Al |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |last=Tobin |first=Paul N. |year=2000 |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |website=The Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity |publisher=Paul Tobin |location=Singapore |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008175621/http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in science classes, mainly in American schools. Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific. Many religious groups teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early Christian Church Fathers there were allegorical interpretations of the Book of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;[[#Forster &amp; Marston 1999|Forster &amp; Marston 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]], a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or "spiritual" point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Hp547&gt;[[#Eddy 1934|Eddy 1934]], p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
According to Hindu creationism, all species on Earth including humans have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath 2010|McGrath 2010]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of old Earth creationism, according to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]], the creation myths of which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carper &amp; Hunt 2009|Carper &amp; Hunt 2009]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dasgupta 1922|Dasgupta 1922]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
[[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. It usually views the Book of Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Islam also has its own school of theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some [[Muslims]] believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Drake Bennett noted: "Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims."&lt;ref name="Bennett 4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Drake |date=October 25, 2009 |title=Islam's Darwin problem |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030044754/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |archivedate=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya), do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name="PrizeforFossil"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3102103/Creationist-Adnan-Oktar-offers-trillion-pound-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution.html |last=Irvine |first=Chris |date=September 29, 2008 |title=Creationist Adnan Oktar offers trillion-pound prize for fossil proof of evolution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2004 |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html |title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools |newspaper=The Guardian |type=Conferences |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement actively promotes evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13"&gt;[[#Masood 1994|Masood 1994]], [http://www.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html Chapter 13, "Every Wind of Doctrine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208191324/http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |date=2013-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis interpret scripture from the Qur'an to support the concept of [[macroevolution]] and give precedence to scientific theories. Furthermore, unlike orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that humans have gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{spaced ndash}}as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13" /&gt; Rather than wholly adopting the theory of natural selection, Ahmadis promote the idea of a "guided evolution," viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf |title=Guided Evolution: Proof From Punctuated Equilibrium |last1=Lahaye |first1=Ataul Wahid |last2=Shah |first2=Zia H. |website=Al Islam |publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] |location=London |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' (1998) that evolution did occur but only through God being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
For [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the [[Torah]] and if there seems to be a problem, [[Epistemology|epistemological]] limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for "world" in the [[Hebrew language]]—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]], former philosophy professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Also, relatively old [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]]. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the [[Sefer HaTemunah]], including the medieval Jewish scholar [[Nahmanides]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]], and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]]. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aviezer 1990|Aviezer 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carmell &amp; Domb 1976|Carmell &amp; Domb 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schroeder 1998|Schroeder 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tigay |first=Jeffrey H. |date=Winter 1987–1988 |title=Genesis, Science, and 'Scientific Creationism' |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/sci.htm |journal=[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |issn=0010-6542 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.

Some contemporary writers such as Rabbi Gedalyah Nadel have sought to reconcile the discrepancy between the account in the Torah, and scientific findings by arguing that each day referred to in the Bible was not 24 hours, but billions of years long.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the Earth was created a few thousand years ago, but was deliberately made to look as if it was five billion years old, e.g. by being created with ready made fossils. The best known exponent of this approach being Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;   Others state that although the world was physically created in six 24 hour days, the Torah accounts can be interpreted to mean that there was a period of billions of years before the six days of creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahai Faith and science#Creation}}
In the creation myth taught by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]] founder, the universe has "neither beginning nor ending," and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982|`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982]], [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace''. `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

Poland saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006, when the Deputy Education Minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as "one of many lies" taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory."

Besides the US the study also compared data from 32 European countries, Turkey, and Japan. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the US was Turkey (25%).&lt;ref name="Science survey" /&gt;

====Education controversies====
[[File:Truth fish.jpg|thumb|right|The Truth fish, one of the many creationist responses to the [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]] ]]
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
In the US, creationism has become centered in the political controversy over [[Creation and evolution in public education#United States|creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the separation of church and state. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the intelligent design movement who wish to "[[Teach the Controversy]]" in science classes have conflated [[Relationship between religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name="kitz" /&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief system]]s, in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale. Political creationists are opposed by many individuals and organizations who have made detailed critiques and given testimony in various court cases that the [[objections to evolution|alternatives to scientific reasoning offered by creationists]] are opposed by the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of the scientific community.&lt;ref name="aaas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|location=Washington, D.C.|format=PDF|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221125539/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-09}}

==Criticism==
===Christian criticism===
Most Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |first1=Roger |last1=van Harn |first2=David F. |last2=Ford |first3=Colin E. |last3=Gunton |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8192-8116-6 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ Extract of page 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism |first1=Aron |last1=Ra |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-63431-079-6 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182 Extract of page 182]&lt;/ref&gt; Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=Statements from Religious Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2011-03-10|date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an "endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible."

In his 2002 article "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes [[Phillip E. Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ." The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or "empty" himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is "unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis." He argues that "...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in belief that everything depends on God, or better, all is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Brendan|title=From Big Bang to Big Mystery: Human Origins in the Light of Creation and Evolution|date=2012|publisher=New City Press of the Focolare|isbn=978-1565484337|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was "a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories." He also said: "My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]{{snd}}a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion{{snd}}on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006" /&gt;

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, from the biology program at the [[University of Minnesota]], reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article "The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?" They conclude that "Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Randy |last2=Cotner |first2=Sehoya |date=May 2009 |title=The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=429–35 |doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10 |issn=0006-3568 |jstor=25502451|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence, and the development of theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name="SEaC"&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=10 p. 10], "In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the origins, [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[Phylogenetics|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[History of science|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |year=2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Futuyma 2005|Futuyma 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name="RoA"&gt;[[#Gould 1999|Gould 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=March 1997 |title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=106 |pages=16–22 |issue=3 |issn=0028-0712 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[Unmoved mover|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref name="RoyalSociety_2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design|date=April 11, 2006|website=[[Royal Society]]|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602213726/http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archivedate=2008-06-02|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism |title=Ten Major Court Cases about Evolution and Creationism |last1=Matsumura |first1=Molleen |last2=Mead |first2=Louise |date=February 14, 2001 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-11-04}} Updated 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=June 18, 2006 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809011055/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dacorum Heritage Trust''' (DHT) is a [[local history]] [[advocacy group]] in the United Kingdom. It collects and records the history of the [[Dacorum|Borough of Dacorum]], [[Hertfordshire]], in the [[Southern England|south of England]], and aims to encourage the appreciation of the heritage of Dacorum.&lt;ref name="values"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Vision and Values|url=http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/about-us/vision-and-values/|website=www.dacorumheritage.org.uk|publisher=The Dacorum Heritage Trust Ltd.|accessdate=6 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206111343/http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/about-us/vision-and-values/|archivedate=6 February 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1979 the Dacorum Museum Advisory Committee (DMAC) was formed to advise [[Dacorum Borough Council|Dacorum District Council]] on heritage matters. In September 1993 the Dacorum Heritage Trust was founded and set up an artefact collection and archive in an old fire station building in Berkhamsted in 1994.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Trust|url=http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/about-us/history-of-the-trust/|website=www.dacorumheritage.org.uk|publisher=The Dacorum Heritage Trust Ltd.|accessdate=6 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206113327/http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/about-us/history-of-the-trust/|archivedate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, DHT took on responsibility for the paper [[archive]] of the local newspaper, the ''[[Hemel Hempstead Gazette &amp; Express]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian-gazette"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenslade|first1=Roy|title=Local newspaper heads into the future by relinquishing its office|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/10/local-newspapers-digital-media|accessdate=6 February 2018|work=the Guardian|date=10 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206104728/https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/10/local-newspapers-digital-media|archivedate=6 February 2018|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trust has also been involved in the preservation of a set of rare pre-reformation religious [[wall painting]]s which were uncovered inside a 15th-century cottage at [[130–136 Piccott's End]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/dht-news/heritage-open-day-at-piccotts-end Heritage Open Day at Piccotts End].

'''Jerome Leocata''' (''c.'' 1664–1745) was a major Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in metaphysics. His long academic career in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] was very hampered by his many administrative commitments. His writings, however, bear witness to his thinking skills and his philosophical prowess. He possessed a clear and systematic mind, consistently endeavouring to give a sound philosophical basis to his speculations. No portrait of him is yet known to exist.

==Life==
Leocata must have been born in 1664 or whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. I, pp. 291f}}&lt;/ref&gt; He most probably hailed from [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], for it was there that he joined the [[Dominican Order]] around 1680. He must have been sixteen years of age or perhaps a year or two older. He was still a student ten years later, in 1690, at the ''[[Studium generale|studium]]'' of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at [[Valletta]]. In 1694, he was already teaching theology at the same ''studium''

We might somewhat gauge the intellectual capabilities of Leocata from the great esteem in which [[Ramon Perellos y Roccaful]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the Order of [[Knights Hospitallers]], had for him. Documentary evidence exists which shows that the Grand Master recommended him to foreign diplomats for his wisdom and general abilities.

Leocata became a Bachelor of Theology by sitting to a special exam in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], in 1700. Immediately, he was sent to [[Tripani]], [[Sicily]] as Master of the Dominican students there, and also as Regent of Studies at the Dominican ''studium''. He was instituted in these offices in 1701. After two years (1703) in [[Sicily]], Leocata returned to [[Malta]] to teach [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the Bishop’s Seminary. He stayed here barely two years, for in 1705 he was sent once more to [[Tripani]] at Regent of Studies there.

Put forward by [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Ramon Perellos y Roccaful]], in 1707 Leocata was recommended to the Master of the [[Dominican Order]] for the office of Vicar-General of the Dominicans in Malta on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial, a proposal which was accepted the following year (1708). In the meantime, the Dominican community at the Priory of Portus Salutis of Valletta elected Leocata as its superior. Thus, Leocata lived there and lectured at the ''Studium Generale'' of [[Valletta]]. Though juridically his office was subordinate to a higher one in [[Sicily]], he was given wide decision-making powers to be almost independent. When, in 1710, his office as Vicar-General expired, Leocata was appointed for a second term. In 1712, Grand Master [[Ramon Perellos y Roccaful]] recommended for a third period (which was quite exceptional), however Rome declined the suggestion. He was appointed to the same office in 1717 and again in 1719.

Between 1729, Leocata was elected Priory to the community at [[Vittoriosa]], [[Malta]], and a year later, in 1730, to that at [[Valletta]]. At each place, Leocata lectured at their respective ''Studium Generale''. In 1730, he was chosen to be the Prior Provincial in [[Sicily]]. However, Rome objected, and instead appointed him, for the fifth time, Vicar-General in [[Malta]]. In 1738, he was also Prior of the community at [[Valletta]].

Leocata died at [[Valletta]] in 1745.

==Known works==
The extant works of Leocata are not penned down by his own hand. They are manuscripts inscribed word for word by a student of his, John Mary Gatt. It seems that Leocata himself endorsed the manuscripts produced by Gatt, since they remained in his possession, and probably used them for his lectures. All of them are in Latin.

===The transcriber===
Very little is known about Gatt except that he hailed from [[Zebbug, Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. I, p. 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, we do possess one manuscript composed by him, called ''Propositiones Damnate'', which was finished in 1700. For sure, this work was part of Gatt’s learning experience while frequenting Leocata. In fact, it is add to the bound volume containing Leocata’s lectures as transcribed by Gatt himself. All of these (Leocata’s and Gatt’s manuscripts) are held at the archives of the Dominican priory of Portus Salutis at [[Valletta]]. Gatt’s manuscript is a collection of seven propositions (statements or sentences) containing beliefs condemned by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. II, p. 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and study===
Since all of Leocata’s extant manuscripts deal the [[Catholic]] [[Sacraments]], it might be taken for granted that they are of solely theological interest. However, this is not the case. Leocata deals with each subject in a purely philosophical manner, consistently venturing to provide philosophical arguments and foundations to the religious or spiritual themes he deals with.

Unfortunately, no manuscript of Leocata has been transliterated, much less translated into any modern language, or even freshly read and studied. He might well be one of the rich mediaeval philosophical treasures of Malta who are still to be fittingly noticed and suitably appreciated.

Leocata’s extant works are all of an Aristotelian-Thomist approach. Both in content and in methodology they are very much in the style of [[Scholasticism]]. As might be expected, than, he holds [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] as his major authorities and mentors.

===List===
As indicated above, all the lectures contained in Leocata’s extant manuscripts were delivered by him at the ''Studium Generale'' of Portus Salutis at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. They are the following:

* 1697 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Sacramentis in Genere'' ("A Brief Study of Sacraments in General"); 85 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. II, p. 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1698 – ''Tractatus De Sacrosancto Eucharistiæ'' ("A Study on the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist"); 22 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. I, p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1699 – ''Tractatus Scholasticus de Sacramento Pœnitentia'' ("A Scholastic Study on the Sacrament of Penance"); 29 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. II, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1699 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Sacramento Ordinis simul et Matrimonii'' ("A Brief Study on the Sacrament of Holy Orders and the same on Matrimony"); 11 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. II, p. 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1699 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Confessariis Sollicitantibus'' ("A Brief Study on Confessors who Sollicit [Sexual Favours]"); 31 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. I, p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  ''c.''1700 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Sacramento Baptismi'' ("A Brief Study on the Sacrament of Baptism"); 19 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. I, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  ''c.''1700 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Confirmationis Sacramento'' ("A Brief Study on the Sacrament of Confirmation"); 31 folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=vol. Ip. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further manuscript attributed to Leocata is:
*  1692 – ''De Virtutibus Theologicis'' ("On the Theological Virtues"); 145 folios.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Home as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|John Home as depicted on the Scott Monument]]

Rev '''John Home''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (13 September 1722 – 4 September 1808) was a Scottish [[Minister of the Kirk|minister]], soldier and author.&lt;ref name=e1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Home, John|volume=13|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; His play ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' was a standard Scottish school text until the [[Second World War]], but his work is now largely neglected. In 1783 he was one of the joint founders of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Ancrum]] in [[Roxburghshire]], but moved to [[Leith]], near [[Edinburgh]], in early childhood when his father, Alexander Home, a distant relation of the [[Earl of Home|earls of Home]], became [[town clerk]]. He was born on 13 September and christened on 22 September 1722

John was educated at the [[Leith Grammar School]], and at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated MA, in 1742. Though interested in being a soldier, he studied divinity, and was licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh in 1745. In the same year he joined as a volunteer against [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and was taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]]. With many others he was carried to [[Doune castle]] in Perthshire, but soon escaped.

In July 1746, Home was presented to the parish of [[Athelstaneford]], East Lothian, left vacant by the death of [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]. 
He had leisure to visit his friends and became especially intimate with [[David Hume]] who belonged to the same family as himself. 
His first play, ''[[Agis: a tragedy]]'', founded on [[Plutarch]]'s narrative, was finished in 1747. He took it to London, England, and submitted it to [[David Garrick]] for representation at [[Drury Lane]], but it was rejected as unsuitable for the stage. 
The tragedy of ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' was suggested to him by hearing a lady sing the [[ballad]] of ''Gil Morrice'' or ''[[Child Maurice]]'' ([[Francis James Child|FJ Child]], ''Popular Ballads'', ii. 263). 
The ballad supplied him with the outline of a simple and striking plot.

After five years, he completed his play and took it to London for Garrick's opinion. 
It was rejected, but on his return to Edinburgh his friends resolved that it should be produced there. 
It was performed on 14 December 1756 with overwhelming success, in spite of the opposition of the [[presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]], who summoned [[Alexander Carlyle]] to answer for having attended its representation. 
Home wisely resigned his charge in 1757, after a visit to London, where ''Douglas'' was brought out at [[Covent Garden]] on 14 March. [[Margaret Woffington|Peg Woffington]] played Lady Randolph, a part which found a later exponent in [[Sarah Siddons]]. [[David Hume]] summed up his admiration for ''Douglas'' by saying that his friend possessed "the true theatric genius of Shakespeare and [[Thomas Otway|Otway]], refined from the unhappy barbarism of the one and licentiousness of the other." Gray, writing to [[Horace Walpole]] (August 1757), said that the author "seemed to have retrieved the true language of the stage, which has been lost for these hundred years," but [[Samuel Johnson]] held aloof from the general enthusiasm, and averred that there were not ten good lines in the whole play (Boswell, ''Life'', ed. Croker, 1348, p.&amp;nbsp;300).

In 1758, Home became private secretary to [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], then secretary of state, and was appointed tutor to the prince of Wales; and in 1760 his patron's influence procured him a pension of £300 per annum and in 1763 a sinecure worth another £500. Garrick produced ''Agis'' at Drury Lane on 21 February 1758. By dint of good acting and powerful support, according to Genest, the play lasted for eleven days, but it was lamentably inferior to ''Douglas''. In 1760 his tragedy, ''The Siege of Aquileia'', was put on the stage, Garrick taking the part of Aemilius. In 1769 another tragedy, ''The Fatal Discovery'' ran for nine nights; ''Alonzo'' also (1773) had fair success; but his last tragedy, ''Alfred'' (1778), was so coolly received that he gave up writing for the stage.&lt;ref name=e1911/&gt; 
[[File:John Home's grave, South Leith Parish Church.jpg|thumb|John Home's grave South Leith Parish Church]]

Home was also an active participant in the social life of Edinburgh, and joined the Poker Club in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fzc.dk/Boswell/Misc/The_Poker_Club.php Poker Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050812014136/http://www.fzc.dk/Boswell/Misc/The_Poker_Club.php |date=12 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1763 he succeeded [[George Lind]] as MP for Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Magazine May 1763 vol 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, he joined a regiment formed by the [[Duke of Buccleuch]].  He sustained severe injuries in a fall from horseback which permanently affected his brain, and was persuaded by his friends to retire. 
From 1767, he resided either at Edinburgh or at a villa which he built at Kilduff near his former parish. 
It was at this time that he wrote his ''History of the Rebellion of 1745'', which appeared in 1802. 

Home died at Merchiston Bank, near Edinburgh, in his eighty-sixth year.&lt;ref name=e1911/&gt; He is buried in [[South Leith Parish Church]].&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leithhistory.co.uk/2003/12/20/south-leith-gravestones/|title= South Leith Gravestones, LeithHistory.co.uk, 2003|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 4 September and was buried on the 5th.

==Works==

The ''Works of John Home'' were collected and published by [[Henry Mackenzie]] in 1822 with "An Account of the Life and Writings of Mr John House," which also appeared separately in the same year, but several of his smaller poems seem to have escaped the editor's observation. These are--"The Fate of Caesar," "Verses upon Inveraray," "Epistle to the Earl of Eglintoun," "Prologue on the Birthday of the Prince of Wales, 1759" and several "Epigrams," which are printed in vol. ii. of ''Original Poems by Scottish Gentlemen'' (1762).

==Memorials==

Home is amongst the sixteen writers and poets depicted on the lower capital heads of the [[Scott Monument]] on [[Princes Street]] in [[Edinburgh]]. He appears at the far right side on the east face.

A small bronze plaque stands near the site of his home on Maritime Street in [[Leith]]. His house was demolished in the 1950s and now holds a modern housing development (Bell's Court).

'''Khasan Zayndinovich Bakayev''' ({{lang-ce|Зайндин кӀант Бакаев Хьасан}}) is a prominent historian of the [[Chechen Republic]]. The Russo-Chechen wars in 1994-2001 contributed to his inability to obtain his doctoral degree at a Russian university in St. Petersburg. Bakayev transitioned from a scholar to a dissident. Nevertheless, Bakayev managed to publish hundreds of articles in newspapers and magazines. His books are widely known in Chechnya and recognized by scientific community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://vaydahar.eu/glossary/1814/bakaev-hasan Бакаев Хасан]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1976, Khasan Bakayev graduated from the High School №1in Gekhi, Chechen Republic. From 1977 to 1979 he served in the Soviet army, which was a mandatory duty for youngsters. From 1983 to 1988 he studied History at the Chechen-Ingush State University and received his master's degree. In the last two years of his University studies, Bakayev began to specialize in studying the History of the Ancient East. As a student, he published around 40 scientific articles related to Vainakh (Chechen and Ingush) ethnogenesis. In the same period of time, Kh. Bakayev was actively involved in archaeological excavations in the former Chechen-Ingush Republic.

In 1987, Kh. Bakayev was recognized as the best scientifically oriented student for his achievements in the regional archaeological conferences and, as a result, he was sent to Moscow to participate in the XXII All-Union student archeological conference, where Khasan was awarded a diploma of the winner of the first degree. And in the same year, Bakayev was invited to participate at the top level All-Union Scientific Conference titled "Caucasus and civilizations of the Ancient East", in Vladikavkaz, Russia. This opportunity allowed him to contact and even debate with many scientists like I.M. Dyakonov, G.A. Melikishvili, Viacheslav Vsev. Ivanov, O.M. Japaridze, S.A. Starostin, A.Y. Militarёv, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

From 1988 to 1990, after completing his studies at the University, Bakayev was engaged in archaeology at the professional level. During these years, he published a number of scientific papers and essays that identified the ethnic and cultural ties of the Vainakh peoples with the Ancient East.

In 1990, Bakayev got an opportunity to begin studies at the graduate school of Oriental Studies of St. Petersburg University under the leadership of famous Oriental scientists as I.M. Dyakonov and B.B. Piotrowski. His topic of doctoral degree was the ancient Hurro-Urartian civilization, which existed from 2300 BC until 590 BC, and its ethno-cultural ties with the origin of the Chechens. At the same time, along with Dr. Rostunov, H. Bakaev was developing a theory of the Indo-European nature of the Kura–Araxes archeological culture (3400 BC - 2000 BC).  During this period of time (1990-1992), Bakayev managed to publish a number of scientific reports in Moscow and St. Petersburg based academic magazines.

In 1992 Kh. Bakayev’s scientific career was interrupted due to the complicated political circumstances related to the [[Russian-Chechen conflict]]. Instead of continuing his academic career, he became a journalist specializing in human rights and ethnic identity.

For this purpose, Bakayev published articles in the "Ichkeria" (“Ичкерия”) newspaper, the official daily gazette of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. In 1995, he became the Chief Editor of this newspaper. In November 1996, when the First Russo-Chechen war was over, Kh. Bakayev founded another private newspaper named “The Chechen” (“Чеченец”) to focus on the historical roots of the origin of the Chechens and their historical ties with other ancient and presently existing peoples.

Meanwhile, Russian-Chechen conflict increased. Bakayev made make several trips to Baku, Azerbaijan, to prepare an alternative newspaper office there. The second Russo-Chechen war found Bakayev in Baku. He stayed in Azerbaijan for a time. However, in a few years, Bakayev immigrated to Western Europe, where he has been living until today. Bakayev resumed his scientific work and journalism. For the past several years he has published a few books related to Chechen (Vainakh) ethnic history.

On March 6, 2015, through March 7, 2015, the Chechen Government in exile invited Bakayev to participate in the International Conference in Brussels, Belgium. Immediately prior to the conference, Bakayev published a book titled "The Forever War. Chechens through eyes of friends and enemies.” On behalf of the government and the Chechen people, Mr. Ahmed Zakaev, the Prime-Minister of the Chechen Government, awarded Mr. Khassan Bakayev "Qoman Si" ("Honor of the Nation"), the highest National Order of Merit, with the wording: "For The Selfless Service For The Motherland. For The Selfless Work On The Information Front. And For The Long And Fruitful Scientific Work For The Chechen People.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechechenpress.com/developments/9240-6-8-2015.html Отчет о работе Конференции 6-8 марта 2015 г. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Location hypotheses of Atlantis''' are various proposed real-world settings for the fictional island of [[Atlantis]], described as a lost civilization mentioned in [[Plato]]'s dialogues ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', written about 360 B.C. In these dialogues, a character named [[Critias]] claims that an island called Atlantis was swallowed by the sea about 9,200 years previously. According to the dialogues, this story was passed down to him through his grandfather, also named Critias, who in turn got it from his father, Dropides, who had got it from [[Solon]], the famous [[Athens|Athenian]] lawmaker, who had got the story from an Egyptian sanctuary. Plato's dialogues locate the island in the Atlantic Pelagos "Atlantic Sea",&lt;ref&gt;Babiniotis, Lexicon of the Greek Language. Pelagos = Small Open sea&lt;/ref&gt; "in front of" the [[Pillars of Hercules]] (Στήλες του Ηρακλή) and facing a district called modern [[Cádiz|Gades]] or Gadira (Gadiron), a location that some modern Atlantis researchers associate with modern [[Gibraltar]]; however various locations have been proposed.

==North-West of Egypt: From Greece to Spain==
[[File:Location hypothesis of Atlantis in Med.jpg|thumb|380px|left|Hypothesized locations of Atlantis in the Mediterranean]]

Most theories of the placement of Atlantis center on the Mediterranean, influenced largely by the geographical location of [[Egypt]] from which the [[Egyptian mythology|story allegedly is derived]].

===Island of Pharos===
[[Robert Graves]] in his ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955), argues Atlantis was the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria#Origin|Island of Pharos]] off the western coast of the [[Nile Delta]], that is, before Alexander the Great connected the island to mainland Egypt by building a causeway.&lt;ref&gt;"The Egyptian legend of Atlantis—also current in folk-tale along the Atlantic seaboard from Gibraltar to the Hebrides, and among the Yorub in West Africa—is not to be dismissed as pure fancy, and seems to date from the third millennium BC. But Plato's version, which he claims that Solon learned from his friends the Libyan priests of Sais in the Delta, he apparently been grafted on a later tradition: how the Minoan Cretans who had extended their influence to Egypt and Italy, were defeated a Hellenic confederacy with Athens at its head; and whom, perhaps as the result of a submarine earthquake, the enormous harbour works built by the Keftiu ('sea-people', meaning the Cretans and their allies) on the island of Pharos and, subsided under seven fathoms of water—where they have lately been rediscovered by dive: These works consisted of an outer and an inner basin, together covering some two hundred and. fifty acres (Gaston Jondet: Les Ports submerges l'ancienne île de Pharos). Such an identification of Atlantis with Pharos would account for Atlas’s being sometimes described as a son of Iapetus—the Japhet of Genesis, whom the Hebrews called Noah’s son and made the ancestor of the Sea-people’s confederacy—and sometimes as a son of Poseidon and, though in Greek myth Iapetus appears as Deucalion’s grandfather, this need mean no more than that he was the eponymous ancestor of the Canaanite tribe which brought the Mesopotamian Flood legend rather than the Atlantian, to Greece. Several details in Plato’s account such as the pillar sacrifice of bulls and the hot-and-cold water systems in Atlas’s palace, make it certain that the Cretans are being described, and no other nation." (Graves, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thera (Santorini)===
[[File:Santorini Landsat.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Island of Thera, also called Santorini. Clockwise from center: Nea Kameni; Palea Kameni; [[Aspronisi]]; Therasia; Thera]]

The [[Minoan civilization]] on [[Crete]] was the dominant sea power of the eastern Mediterranean, with large cities and temples, but after 1400 BC only small villages existed. Archaeologists believe that some abrupt event changed society, but an invasion is unlikely because of the Minoan fleet.{{r|ley196706}} After the discovery of the Minoans at [[Knossos]] on the island by Sir [[Arthur Evans]] in 1900, theories linking the disappearance of the empire with the destruction of Atlantis were proposed by [[K. T. Frost]] in 1913 and [[E. S. Balch]] in 1917. This theory was revived by [[Spyridon Marinatos]] in 1950, [[Angelos Galanopoulos]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Galanopoulos, Angelos G. (1960): On the Location and Size of Atlantis, in: Praktika Akademia Athenai 35 (1960) 401-418.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|ley196706}}
and [[P. B. S. Andrews]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, K. T. (1913): "The Critias and Minoan Crete", in: Journal of Hellenic Studies 33 (1913) 189-206. Balch, E. S. (1917): "Atlantis or Minoan Crete", in: The Geographical Review 3 (1917) 388-392. Marinatos, Spyridon (1950): "Peri ton Thrulon tes Atlantidos", in: Kretica Chronica 4 (1950) 195-213. Andrews, P. B. S. (1967): "Larger than Africa and Asia?", in: Greece and Rome 14 (1967) 76-79, Charles Pellegrino (1991): Unearthing Atlantis: An Archaeological Odyssey.&lt;/ref&gt; Galanopoulos argued that Plato's dating of 9,000 years before [[Solon]] (said by Plato to have translated Egyptian records of Atlantis)'s time was the result of an error in translation, probably from Egyptian into Greek, which produced "thousands" instead of "hundreds". Such an error would also rescale Plato's Atlantis to the size of Crete, while leaving the city the size of the crater on Thera; 900 years before Solon would be the fifteenth century BC.&lt;ref name="ley196706"&gt;{{Cite magazine

(Recent arguments for Akrotiri being Atlantis have been popularized on television in shows such as [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] show ''Lost Worlds'' episode "Atlantis".&lt;ref name=LostWorlds&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Worlds: CGI: Atlantis |publisher=History.com |url=http://www.history.com/media.do?id=lostworlds_atlantis_broadband&amp;action=clip |accessdate=2008-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070319023223/http://www.history.com/media.do?action=clip&amp;id=lostworlds_atlantis_broadband |archivedate=March 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LostWorldUK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/World_history/programme_3306.php |title=Lost Worlds: Atlantis |publisher=History Channel UK |accessdate=2008-03-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230122/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/World_history/programme_3306.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Evidence said to advance this idea includes:

*The Minoan palace and buildings discovered at the digs at Knossos on Crete and at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of Thera have revealed that the Minoans possessed advanced engineering knowledge enabling the construction of three- and four-story buildings with intricate water piping systems, advanced air-flow management, and earthquake-resistant wood and masonry walls. This level of technology was, it is said, far ahead of that found on mainland Greece at the time.
*There are no classical records of an Atlantis-related volcanic eruption in the eastern Mediterranean so it must have occurred before the development of writing, perhaps before 1000 BC.{{r|ley196706}} Thera (also called Santorini) is the site of a massive volcanic [[caldera]] with an island at its center. Vulcanologists have determined that the island was engulfed by a volcanic eruption around 1600 BC. The event, referred to as the [[Minoan eruption]], was among the most powerful eruptions occurring in the history of civilization, ejecting approximately 60&amp;nbsp;km³ of material, leaving a layer of pumice and ash 10 to 80 meters thick for 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;km in all directions and having widespread effects across the eastern Mediterranean region.&lt;ref name=URI2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/?id=3654|title=Santorini eruption much larger than originally believed|date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic events of this magnitude are known to generate tsunamis and archaeological evidence suggests that such a tsunami may have devastated the Minoan fleet and coastal settlements on Crete.&lt;ref name=BBCWave/&gt;{{r|ley196706}} Such an event would have been noticed as far as Egypt, as a period of darkness. Egyptians could have told Solon about such an event.{{r|ley196706}} Plato did not describe a volcanic eruption, although the events he described as "sunk by an earthquake" or "violent earthquakes, and only a flood (in singular)", could perhaps be interpreted as consistent with such an eruption and the resulting tsunami.&lt;ref name=decadevolc1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decadevolcano.net/santorini/atlantis.htm |accessdate=2008-07-12 |title=Santorini and the legend of Atlantis: The Minoan eruption on Santorini as possible origin?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ferdinand André Fouqué]] reported that two golden rings were found under the pumice at Thera. Gold is not found in the area so they must have come by trade.{{r|ley196706}}
*Egyptians may have also told Solon of the [[Sea Peoples]]' invasion. The event may have been combined, accidentally or intentionally, with the Santorini eruption about 250 years before the invasion.{{r|ley196706}}
*Plato described quarries on Atlantis where "one kind of stone was white, another black, and a third red",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret of Plato's Atlantis |year=1885 |last=Arundell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oEQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |accessdate=2008-07-12 |page=92 |publisher=Burns and Oates}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are common colors of [[volcanic rock]].
*The center of the metropolis of Atlantis was described as being laid out in circular manner, surrounded by three circular concentric pits of seawater and two earth-rings, each connected to the sea by a deep canal. Docks for a large number of ships, with a causeway, were also mentioned. Scientists reconstructing the shape of the island prior to the eruption have concluded that there was a ring configuration with only one narrow entrance to a larger lagoon with islands inside, much as Plato described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decadevolcano.net/santorini/preminoan.htm |accessdate=2008-07-12 |title=Models of the Pre-Minoan Island (prior to ca. 1645 BC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One fresco in the ruins of Akrotiri is believed to be a landscape of the city.  It shows a large city in an island in the center of the caldera lagoon.

===In mainland Greece===
The classicist [[Robert L. Scranton]] argued in an article published in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' that Atlantis was the "Copaic drainage complex and its civilization" in [[Lake Copais]], Boeotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scranton, R. L.|date=1949|title=Lost Atlantis found again?|journal=Archaeology|volume=2|pages=159–162|jstor=41662314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archaeological discoveries have revealed a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]]-era drainage complex and subterranean channels in the lake.

===Near Cyprus===
It has been argued by [[Robert Sarmast]], an American architect, that the lost city of Atlantis lies at the bottom of the eastern Mediterranean within the Cyprus Basin.&lt;ref name="Sarmast2006a"&gt;Sarmast, R., 2006, ''Discovery of Atlantis: The Startling Case for the Island of Cyprus''. Origin Press, San Rafael, California. 195 pp. {{ISBN|1-57983-012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book and on his web site, he argues that images prepared from sonar data of the sea bottom of the Cyprus Basin southeast of [[Cyprus]] show features resembling man-made structures on it at depths of 1,500 meters. He interprets these features as being artificial structures that are part of the lost city of Atlantis as described by [[Plato]]. According to his ideas, several characteristics of Cyprus, including the presence of [[copper]] and extinct [[Cyprus dwarf elephant]]s and local place names and festivals (Kataklysmos), support his identification of Cyprus as once being part of Atlantis. As with many other theories concerning the location of Atlantis, Sarmast speculates that its destruction by catastrophic flooding is reflected in the story of Noah's Flood in ''Genesis''.

[[File:AKROTIRI SHIP-PROCESSION-FULL PANO-3.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0|&lt;center&gt;Fresco found at Akrotiri&lt;/center&gt;]]

In part, Sarmast&lt;ref name="Sarmast2006a"/&gt; bases his theory that Atlantis can be found offshore of Cyprus beneath 0.9 mile (1.5&amp;nbsp;km) of water on an abundance of evidence that the Mediterranean Sea dried up during the [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]] when its level dropped by 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.9&amp;nbsp;km) below the level of the Atlantic Ocean as the result of tectonic uplift blocking the inflow of water through Strait of [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=ClauzonOthers1996&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clauzon | first1 = G. | last2 = Suc | first2 = J.-P. | last3 = Gautier | first3 = F. | last4 = Berger | first4 = A. | last5 = Loutre | first5 = M.-F. | year = 1996 | title = Alternate interpretation of the Messinian salinity crisis: Controversy resolved? | url = http://geology.gsapubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/363 | journal = Geology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 363–366 | doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0363:aiotms&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separated from the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea either partly or completely dried up as the result of evaporation. As a result, its formerly submerged bottom turned into a desert with large saline and brackish lakes. This area all was flooded when a ridge collapsed allowing the catastrophic flooding through the Straits of Gibraltar. However, Sarmast disagrees with mainstream geologists, oceanographers, and paleontologists&lt;ref name="StanleyOthers1985"&gt;Stanley, D.J., and F.-C. Wezel, 1985, "Geological Evolution of the Mediterranean Basin" Springer-Verlag, New York. 589 p. {{ISBN|1-897799-66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HallOthers2005c"&gt;Hall, J.K., V.A.

Additional PDF files of a related book and maps can be downloaded from [http://www.cybaes.org/archive/downloads/index.html "CYBAES manuscript downloads"]&lt;/ref&gt;  in arguing that the closing of the Straits of Gibraltar; the [[desiccation]] and subaerial exposure of the floor of the Mediterranean Sea; and its catastrophic flooding has occurred "forty times or more times in its long and turbulent existence" and that "the age of each of these events is unknown."&lt;ref name="Sarmast2003"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031014101413/http://www.discoveryofatlantis.com/questions.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he also contradicts what mainstream geologists, oceanographers, and paleontologists argue&lt;ref name="StanleyOthers1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HallOthers2005c"/&gt; in claiming that "Scientists know that roughly 18,000 years ago, there was not just one Mediterranean Sea, but three." However, he does not specify who these scientists are; nor does he cite peer-reviewed scientific literature that supports this claim.

Hübscher of the Institut für Geophysik, Universität Hamburg, Germany, and others of the salt tectonics and mud volcanism within the Cyprus Basin, eastern Mediterranean Sea, demonstrated that the features which Sarmast interprets to be Atlantis consist only of a natural compressional fold caused by local salt tectonics and a slide scar with surficial compressional folds at the downslope end and sides of the slide.&lt;ref name="HubscherOthers2009aa"/&gt; This research collaborates seismic data shown and discussed in the ''Atlantis: New Revelations 2-hour Special'' episode of ''[[Digging for the Truth]]'', a History Channel documentary television series. Using [[reflection seismology]], this documentary demonstrated techniques that what Sarmast interpreted to be artificial walls are natural tectonic landforms.

Furthermore, the interpretation of the age and stratigraphy of sediments blanketing the bottom of the Cyprus Basin from sea bottom cores containing Pleistocene and older marine sediments and thousands of kilometers of seismic lines from the Cyprus and adjacent basins clearly demonstrates that the Mediterranean Sea last dried up during the  [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]] between 5.59 and 5.33 million years ago.&lt;ref name=ClauzonOthers1996/&gt;&lt;ref name="HubscherOthers2009aa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EmeisOthers2005a"&gt;Emeis, K.-C., A.H.F.

Thus, these cores came from parts of sea bottom of the eastern Mediterranean Sea that either lie above or at the depth of Sarmast's Atlantis, which lies at depths between 1460 and 1510 meters (4820 and 4950&amp;nbsp;ft) below mean sea level.&lt;ref name="HubscherOthers2009aa"/&gt; These cores provide a detailed and continuous record of sea level that demonstrates that for millions of years at least during the entire [[Pliocene]], [[Pleistocene]], and [[Holocene]] epochs that the feature that Sarmast interprets to be Atlantis and its adjacent sea bottom were always submerged below sea level.&lt;ref name="EmeisOthers2005a"/&gt; Therefore, the entire Cyprus Basin, including the ridge where Sarmast claims that Atlantis is located, has been submerged beneath the Mediterranean Sea for millions of years.&lt;ref name="HallOthers2005c"/&gt; Since its formation, the sea bottom feature identified by Sarmast as "Atlantis" has always been submerged beneath over a kilometer of water.&lt;ref name="HubscherOthers2009aa"/&gt;

===Helike===
A. Giovannini has argued that the submergence of the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Helike]] in 373 BC, i.e. while [[Plato]] was alive, may have been the inspiration for a fictional story about Atlantis.&lt;ref name="Giovannini1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giovannini | first = A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1985 | month = | title = Peut-on démythifier l'Atlantide? | journal = Museum Helveticum | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 151–156 | issn = 0027-4054 | url = | language = French | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that [[Helike]] is the inspiration for Plato's Atlantis is also supported by Dora Katsonopoulou and Steven Soter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Kronfield |url=http://www.helike.org/paper.shtml |title=Helike Foundation - Discoveries at Ancient Helike |publisher=Helike.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sardinia===
The concept of the identification of Atlantis with the island of Sardinia is the idea that the Italians were involved in the [[Sea Peoples]] movement (a similar story to Plato's account), that the name "Atlas" may have been derived from "[[Italos]]" via the Middle Egyptian language, and Plato's descriptions of the island and the city of Atlantis share several traits with Sardinia and its Bronze Age culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thorwald C. Franke]]: King Italos = King Atlas of Atlantis? A contribution to the Sea Peoples, in: Stavros P.

Retrieved 2011-05-08&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the antiquarian [[Giorgio Grognet de Vassé]] published a short compendium detailing the theory that Malta was the location of Atlantis. His theory was inspired by the discovery of the megalithic temples of [[Ġgantija]] and [[Ħaġar Qim]] during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 2 G–Z|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|page=989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Malta fdal Atlantis'' (''Maltese remains of Atlantis'') (2002), [[Francis Galea]] writes about several older studies and hypotheses, particularly that of Maltese architect Giorgio Grongnet, who in 1854 thought that the Maltese Islands are the remnants of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110904154008/http://www.atlantipedia.com/index.php?Itemid=53&amp;option=com_jfusion&amp;do=show&amp;id=malta Atlantipedia: ''The Maltese proponents''] Retrieved 2011-05-08&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1828, the same Giorgo Grongnet was involved in a scandal concerning forged findings which were intended to provide a "proof" for the claim that Malta was Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.

==North-East of Egypt: From Middle East to the Black Sea==
===Turkey===
[[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], in his book ''The Sunken Kingdom'', identifies Atlantis with the kingdom of [[Zippasla]]. He argues that [[Solon]] did indeed gather the story on his travels, but in [[Lydia]], not [[Egypt]] as Plato states; that Atlantis is identical with Tantalis, the city of [[Tantalus]] in Asia Minor, which was (in a similar tradition known to the Greeks) said to have been destroyed by an earthquake; that the legend of Atlantis' conquests in the Mediterranean is based on the revolution by King Madduwattas of Zippasla against [[Hittites|Hittite]] rule; that Zippasla is identical with [[Mount Sipylus|Sipylus]], where Greek tradition placed Tantalis; and that the now vanished lake to the north of Mount Sipylus was the site of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Peter |title=The Sunken Kingdom. The Atlantis Mystery Solved |publisher=Jonathan Cape |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troy===
The geoarchaeologist [[Eberhard Zangger]] has proposed the hypothesis that Atlantis was in fact the city state of [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;Zangger, Eberhard (1993): "Plato's Atlantis Account – A Distorted Recollection of the Trojan War", in: Oxford Journal of Archaeology 18 (1993) 77-87
&lt;/ref&gt; He both agrees and disagrees with [[Rainer W. Kühne]]: He too believes that the Trojans-Atlanteans were the sea peoples, but only a minor part of them.  He proposes that all Greek speaking city states of the [[Aegean civilization]] or [[Mycenae]] constituted the sea peoples and that they destroyed each other's economies in a series of semi-fratricidal wars lasting several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zangger |first=Eberhard |authorlink=Eberhard Zangger |title=The Flood from Heaven: Deciphering the Atlantis Legend |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Company |year= 1992 |isbn=0-688-11350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German researchers Siegfried and [[Christian Schoppe]] locate Atlantis in the [[Black Sea]]. Before 5500 BC, a great plain lay in the northwest at a former freshwater-lake. In 5510 BC, rising sea level topped the barrier at today's [[Bosporus]]. They identify the [[Pillars of Hercules]] with the Strait of [[Bosporus]].&lt;ref name="Siegfried Schoppe and Christian Schoppe"/&gt; They gave no explanation how the ships of the merchants coming from all over the world had arrived at the harbour of Atlantis when it was 350 feet below global sea-level.

They claim [[Oreichalcos]] means the [[obsidian]] stone that used to be a cash-equivalent at that time and was replaced by the [[spondylus]] shell around 5500 BC, which would suit the red, white, black motif. The geocatastrophic event led to the [[neolithic]] diaspora in Europe, also beginning 5500 BC.

In 2000, the ''Guardian'' reported that [[Robert Ballard]], in a small submarine, found remains of human habitation around 300 feet underwater in the Black Sea off the north coast of Turkey. The area flooded around 5000 BC. This flood is also thought to have inspired the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Noah's Ark]] known as the [[Black Sea deluge theory]].

The Great Atlantis Flood, by Flying Eagle &amp; Whispering Wind, locates Atlantis in the [[Sea of Azov]]. The theory proposes that the Dialogues of Plato present an accurate account of geological events, which occurred in 9,600 BC, in the Black Sea-Mediterranean Corridor. Glacial melt-waters, at the end of the [[Younger Dryas]] Ice Age caused a dramatic rise in the sea level of the [[Caspian Sea]]. An earthquake caused a fracture, which allowed the Caspian Sea to flood across the fertile plains of Atlantis. Simultaneously the earthquake caused the vast farmlands of Atlantis to sink, forming the present day Sea of Azov, the shallowest sea in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantis-today.com/Atlantis_Great_Atlantis_Flood.htm |title=Great Atlantis Flood |website=Atlantis-today.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around Gibraltar: Near to the Pillars of Hercules==
===Andalusia===
[[Andalusia]] is a region in modern-day southern Spain which once included the "lost" city of [[Tartessos]], which disappeared in the 6th century BC.  The Tartessians were traders known to the Ancient Greeks who knew of their legendary king [[Arganthonios]]. The Andalusian hypothesis was originally developed by the Spanish author [[Juan de Mariana]] and the Dutch author Johannes van Gorp ([[Johannes Goropius Becanus]]), both of the 16th century, later by [[José Pellicer de Ossau Salas y Tovar]] in 1673, who suggested that the metropolis of Atlantis was between the islands Mayor and Menor, located almost in the center of the Doñana Marshes,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Pellicer de Ossau Salas y Tovar (Spaniard). Aparato a la mvonarchia antigua de las Españas en los tres tiempos del mundo, el adelon, el mithico y el historico : primera parte... / por don Ioseph Pellicer de Ossau y Touar... (En Valençia : por Benito Macè..., 1673 (the first extensive study  about Atlantis in Iberia, with the hypothesis about Doñana)&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded upon by [[Juan Fernández Amador y de los Ríos]] in 1919, who suggested that the metropolis of Atlantis was located precisely where today are the 'Marismas de Hinojo'.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Fernández Amador de los Ríos (Spaniard). Antigüedades ibéricas / por Juan Fernández Amador de los Rios. Pamplona : Nemesio Aramburu, 1911. (first part about the Atlantis in Iberia, with the hypothesis about Doñana, Sea Peoples, etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were made again in 1922 by the German author [[Adolf Schulten]], and further propagated by [[Otto Jessen]], [[Richard Hennig]], [[Victor Berard]], and [[Elena Wishaw]] in the 1920s.  The suggested locations in Andalusia lie outside the Pillars of Hercules, and therefore beyond but close to the Mediterranean itself.

In 2005, based upon the work of [[Adolf Schulten]], the German teacher [[Werner Wickboldt]] also claimed this to be the location of Atlantis.&lt;ref name="WernerWickboldt"&gt;Werner Wickboldt: Locating the capital of Atlantis by strict observation of the text by Plato. In: Proceedings of the International Conference on "The Atlantis Hypothesis: Searching for a Lost Land" (Milos island 2005) {{ISBN|978-960-89882-1-7}} pp. 517-524&lt;/ref&gt; Wickboldt suggested that the war of the Atlanteans refers to the war of the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked the Eastern Mediterranean countries around 1200 BC and that the [[Iron Age]] city of Tartessos may have been built at the site of the ruined Atlantis.  In 2000, Georgeos Diaz-Montexano published an article explaining his theory that Atlantis was located somewhere between Andalusia and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Magazine ''Más Allá de la Ciencia'', March–April of the 2000 (nº 134), where was published a report about the Georgeos Díaz-Montexano's theory of Atlantis between Andalusia and Morocco.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Andalusian location was also supported by [[Rainer Walter Kühne]] in his article that appeared in the journal  ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Plato declared that his Atlantis tale is [[philosophical fiction]] invented to describe his fictitious ideal state in the case of war. Kühne suggests that Plato has used three different historical elements for this tale. (i) Greek tradition on Mycenaean Athens for the description of ancient Athens, (ii) Egyptian records on the wars of the Sea Peoples for the description of the war of the Atlanteans, and (iii) oral tradition from Syracuse about Tartessos for the description of the city and geography of Atlantis." According to Wickboldt, [[Satellite image]]s show two rectangular shapes on the tops of two small elevations inside the marsh of Doñana which he hypothesizes are the "temple of [[Poseidon]]" and "the temple of Cleito and Poseidon".&lt;ref&gt;

===Spartel Bank===
Two hypotheses have put [[Spartel|Spartel Bank]], a submerged former island in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], as the location of Atlantis. The more well-known hypothesis was proposed in a September 2001 issue of ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences'' by French [[geology|geologist]] [[Jacques Collina-Girard]].&lt;ref&gt;Collina-Girard, Jacques (2001): "L'Atlantide devant le détroit de Gibraltar? Mythe et géologie", in: Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences (2a) 333 (2001) 233-240.&lt;/ref&gt; The lesser-known hypothesis was first published by Spanish-Cuban investigator Georgeos Díaz-Montexano in an April 2000 issue of Spanish magazine ''Más Allá de la Ciencia'' (Beyond Science), and later in August 2001 issues of Spanish magazines ''El Museo'' (The Museum) and ''[[Año Cero]]'' (Year Zero).&lt;ref name="DiazAtlantis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usuarios.lycos.es/atlantisiberia/release_news.htm |title=Atlantis in Gibraltar, between Iberia and Africa |author=María Fdez-Valmayor (Secretary and sentimental partner of Diaz-Montexano in those time) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405084606/http://usuarios.lycos.es/atlantisiberia/release_news.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of Collina-Girard's hypothesis is disputed, with Díaz-Montexano claiming it as plagiarism of his own earlier hypothesis, and Collina-Girard denying any plagiarism. Both individuals claim the other's hypothesis is [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="DiazAtlantis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AtlantisInsider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mysterious-america.net/atlantisinsider.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904000106/http://www.mysterious-america.net/atlantisinsider.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2004-09-04 | title=Atlantis Insider: Brief Reviews of the Latest in the Search for Atlantis | first=Greg | last=Little | date=September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collina-Girard's hypothesis states that during the most recent Glacial Maximum of the [[Ice Age]] sea level was 135 m below its current level, narrowing the Gibraltar Strait and creating a small half-enclosed sea measuring 70&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. The Spartel Bank formed an archipelago in this small sea with the largest island measuring about 10 to 12 kilometers across. With rising ocean levels the island began to slowly shrink, but then at around 9400 BC (11,400 years ago) there was an accelerated [[sea level rise]] of 4 meters per century known as [[Meltwater pulse 1A]], which drowned the top of the main island. The occurrence of a great earthquake and tsunami in this region, similar to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake (magnitude 8.5-9) was proposed by marine geophysicist [[Marc-Andrè Gutscher]] as offering a possible explanation for the described catastrophic destruction (reference&amp;nbsp;— Gutscher, M.-A., 2005. Destruction of Atlantis by a great earthquake and tsunami? A geological analysis of the Spartel Bank hypothesis. Geology, v. 33, p.&amp;nbsp;685-688.) .&lt;ref name="Ornekas 2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/722/1 |first=Genevra |last=Ornekas |year=2005 |volume=722 |issue=1 |journal=Science |title=Atlantis Rises Again |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621180622/http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/722/1 |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collina-Girard proposes that the disappearance of this island was recorded in prehistoric Egyptian tradition for 5,000 years until it was written down by the first Egyptian scribes around 4000-3000 BC, and the story then subsequently inspired Plato to write a fictionalized version interpreted to illustrate his own principles.

A detailed review in the [[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]] comments on the discrepancies in Collina-Girard's dates and use of coincidences, concluding that he "has certainly succeeded in throwing some light upon some momentous developments in human prehistory in the area west of Gibraltar. Just as certainly, however, he has not found Plato's Atlantis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-09-64.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2009.09.64 |website=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papamarinopoulos, Athens | date =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach to the analysis of Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias is described. By means of a [[hierarchical constraint satisfaction]] procedure, a variety of geographically relevant indications from Plato's accounts are used to infer the most probable location of Plato's ''Atlantis Nesos''. The outcome of this is the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-West Morocco. This plain is surrounded by the High ''Atlas'', the Anti-''Atlas'', the Sea of ''Atlas'' ([[Atlantis Thalassa]], today's Atlantic Ocean). Because of this isolated position, Hübner argued, this plain was called ''Atlantis Nesos'', the ''Island of Atlas'' by ancient Greeks before the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. The [[Amazigh]] (Berber) People actually call the [[Souss-Massa-Drâa|Souss-Massa]] plain ''island''. Of major archaeological interest is the fact that in the North-West of the Souss-Massa plain a large annular caldera-like geomorphologic structure was discovered. This structure has almost the dimensions of Plato's capital of Atlantis and is covered with hundreds of large and small prehistoric ruins of different types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ruins were made out of rocks coloured red, white and black. Hübner also shows possible harbour remains, an unusually geomorphological structure, which applies to Plato's description of ''roofed over docks, which were cut into red, white and black bedrock''. These 'docks' are located close to the annular geomorphological structure and close to ''Cape Ghir'', which was named ''Cape Heracles'' in antiquity.  Hübner also argued, that Agadir is etymologically related to the semitic ''g-d-r'' and probably to Plato's ''Gadir''. The semitic ''g-d-r'' means ''enclosure'', ''fortification'' and ''sheep fold''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Atlantic Ocean: West==
[[File:Location hypothesis of Atlantis - Worldwide.jpg|thumb|400px|Hypothesized locations of Atlantis]]

It has been thought that when Plato wrote of the ''Sea of Atlantis'', he may have been speaking of the area now called the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]". Plato remarked that, in describing the origins of Atlantis, this area was allotted to Poseidon. In Ancient Greek times the terms "Ocean" and "Atlas" both referred to the 'Giant Water' which surrounded the main landmass known at that time by the Greeks, which could be described as [[Eurafrasia]] (although this whole supercontinent was far from completely known to the Ancient Greeks), and thus this water mass was considered to be the 'end of the (known) world', for the same reason the name "Atlas" was given to the mountains near the Ocean, the [[Atlas Mountains]], as they also denoted the 'end of the (known) world'.

===Azores Islands===
One of the suggested places for Atlantis is around the [[Azores Islands]], a group of islands belonging to Portugal located about 900 miles (1500&amp;nbsp;km) west of the Portuguese coast. Some people believe the islands could be the mountain tops of Atlantis. [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], an American [[congressman]], was perhaps the first one to talk about this possible location in his book ''Atlantis: The Antediluvian World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Charles Schuchert]], in a paper called "Atlantis and the Permanency of the North Atlantic Ocean Bottom" (1917), discussed a lecture by [[Pierre-Marie Termier]]  in which Termier suggested "that the entire region north of the Azores and perhaps the very region of the Azores, of which they may be only the visible ruins, was very recently submerged", reporting evidence that an area of 40,000 sq. mi and possibly as large as 200,000 sq. mi. had sunk 10,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Schuchert's conclusion was: "(1) that the Azores are volcanic islands and are not the remnants of a more or less large continental mass, for they are not composed of rocks seen on the continents; (2) that the tachylytes dredged up from the Atlantic to the north of the Azores were in all probability formed where they are now, at the bottom of the ocean; and (3) that there are no known geologic data that prove or even help to prove the existence of Plato's Atlantis in historic times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Atlantis and the Permanency of the North Atlantic Ocean Bottom |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=1917|volume=3|pages=65–72|pmc=1091177|pmid=16586698 |doi=10.1073/pnas.3.2.65 | last1 = Schuchert | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is evidenced by relict, Pleistocene wave-cut platforms and beach sediments that now lie well above current sea level. For example, they have been found on [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]] at elevations of 15-20, 35-45, ~100, and ~250 meters above current sea level.&lt;ref name=AzevedoOther1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Azevedo | first1 = J.J.M. | last2 = Ferreira | first2 =  | year = 1999 | title = Volcanic gaps and subaerial records of palaeo-sea-levels on Flores Island, Azores: tectonic and morphological implications. | url = | journal = Geodynamics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 117–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canary Islands, Madeira and Cape Verde===
The Canary Islands have been identified as remnants of Atlantis by numerous authors. For example, in 1803, [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Bory de Saint-Vincent]] in his ''Essai sur les îles fortunées et l'antique Atlantide'' proposed that the [[Canary Islands]], along with the [[Madeira]], and [[Azores]], are what remained after Atlantis broke up. Many later authors, i.e. [[Lewis Spence]] in his ''The Problem of Atlantis'', also identified the Canary Islands as part of Atlantis left over from when it sank.

Detailed geomorphic and geologic studies of the Canary Islands clearly demonstrate that over the last 4 million years, they have been steadily uplifted, without any significant periods of subsidence, by geologic processes such as erosional unloading, gravitational unloading, lithospheric flexure induced by adjacent islands, and volcanic underplating.&lt;ref name="MenendezOthers2009"&gt;Menendez, I., P.G.

===Northern Spain===
According to Jorge Maria Ribero-Meneses,&lt;ref&gt;"Cantabria cuna de la Humanidad", 1985. "Sant'Ander es Bizcaya, la fuente de la vida". "El verdadero origen de los vascos, la primera humanidad". "El origen cantábrico del homo sapiens". "El euskera madre del castellano" "Genealogical Tree Language"&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantis was in northern Spain. He specifically argues that Atlantis is the underwater plateau, known internationally as "Le Danois Bank" and locally as "The Cachucho". It is located about 25 kilometers from the continental shelf and about 60&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of Asturias, and Lastres between Ribadesella. Its top is now 425 meters below the sea. It is 50 kilometers from east to west and 18&amp;nbsp;km from north to south. Ribero-Meneses hypothesized that is part of the continental margin that broke off at least 12000 years ago as the result of tectonic processes that occurred at the end of the last ice age. He argues that they created a tsunami with waves with heights of hundreds of meters and that the few survivors had to start virtually from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iberiacunadelahumanidad.net |title=(Investigaciones Jorge María Ribero-Meneses San José) |publisher=Iberia cuna de la humanidad |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Le Danois Bank represents part of the continental margin that have been uplifted by thrust faulting when the continental margin overrode oceanic crust during the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods. Along the northern edge of the Le Danois Bank, [[Precambrian]] [[granulite]] and [[Mesozoic]] sedimentary rocks have been thrust northward over [[Miocene]] and [[Oligocene]] marine sediments. The basin separating the Le Danois Bank from the Cantabrian continental margin to the south is a [[graben]] that simultaneously formed as a result of normal faulting associated with the thrust faulting.&lt;ref name=ViejoOther2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=FugenschuhOther2003&gt;Fugenschuh, B., N.

==Atlantic Ocean: North==
===Irish Sea===
In his book ''Atlantis of the West: The Case For Britain's Drowned Megalithic Civilization'' (2003), [[Paul Dunbavin]] argues that a large island once existed in the [[Irish Sea]] and that this island was Atlantis. He argues that this [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic civilization in Europe]] was partially drowned by rising sea levels caused by a [[comet]] impact that caused a [[pole shift]] and changed the [[Rotation|earth's axis]] around 3100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Great Britain===
[[William Comyns Beaumont]] believed that Great Britain was the location of Atlantis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British ... |author=Karl Shaw |page=188 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish journalist [[Lewis Spence]] claimed that the ancient traditions of Britain and Ireland contain memories of Atlantis.

On December 29, 1997, the BBC reported that a team of Russian scientists believed they found Atlantis in the ocean 100 miles off of [[Land's End]], [[Cornwall]], Britain. The BBC stated that Little Sole Bank, a relatively shallow area, was believed by the team to be the capital of Atlantis. This may have been based on the myth of [[Lyonesse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Ireland===
The idea of Atlantis being located in Ireland was presented in the book ''Atlantis from a Geographer's Perspective: Mapping the Fairy Land'' (2004) by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[geography|geographer]] Dr. Ulf Erlingsson from [[Uppsala]] University. It hypothesized that the empire of Atlantis refers to the [[Neolithic]] [[Megalithic tomb]] culture, based on their similar geographic extent, and deduced that the island of Atlantis then must correspond to Ireland. Erlingsson found the similarities of size and landscape to be statistically significant, while he rejected his null hypothesis that Plato invented Atlantis as fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===North Sea===
[[File:NASA NorthSea1 2.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of the [[North Sea]], which has also been suggested as the location of Atlantis]]
The [[North Sea]] is known to contain lands that were once above water; the medieval town of [[Dunwich]] in [[East Anglia]], for example, crumbled into the sea.  The land area known as "[[Doggerland]]", between England and Denmark, was inundated by a [[tsunami]] around 8200BP (6200BC), caused by a submarine landslide off the coast of Norway known as the [[Storegga Slide]],&lt;ref name=weninger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sprint.clivar.org/soes/staff/ejr/Rohling-papers/2008-Weninger%20et%20al%20Documenta%20Praehistorica.pdf|format=PDF|author=Bernhard Weninger et al.|title=The catastrophic final flooding of Doggerland by the Storegga Slide tsunami|publisher=Documenta Praehistorica XXXV|date=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011052807/http://sprint.clivar.org/soes/staff/ejr/Rohling-papers/2008-Weninger%20et%20al%20Documenta%20Praehistorica.pdf|archivedate=2010-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prehistoric human remains have been dredged up from the [[Dogger Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Britain's Atlantis under the North Sea | date = 2007-09-02| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2368630.ece | accessdate = 2008-05-12 | work=The Times | location=London | first1=Jonathan | last1=Leake | first2=Joanna | last2=Carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantis itself has been identified besides [[Heligoland]] off the north-west [[Germany|German]] coast by the author Jürgen Spanuth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ulf Erlingsson hypothesized that the island that sank referred to Dogger Bank, and the city itself referred to the [[Silverpit crater]] at the base of Dogger Bank. A book allegedly by [[Oera Linda]] claims that a land called [[Atland]] once existed in the North Sea, but was destroyed in 2194 BC.

===Denmark===
In his book ''The Celts: The People Who Came Out of the Darkness'' (1975), author [[Gerhard Herm]] links the origins of the Atlanteans to the end of the ice age and the flooding of eastern coastal Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Herm ''The Celts: The People Who Came Out of the Darkness'' Book Club Associates, London 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Finnish eccentric [[Ior Bock]] located Atlantis in the Baltic sea, at southern part of Finland where he claimed a small community of people lived during the [[Ice Age]]. According to Bock, this was possible due to [[Gulf Stream]] which brought warm water to the Finnish coast. This is a small part of a large "[[wikt:saga|saga]]" that he claimed had been told in his family through the ages, dating back to the development of language itself. The [[family saga]] tells the name Atlantis comes from Swedish words ''allt-land-is'' ("all-land-ice") and refers to the last Ice-Age. Thus in the Bock family saga it's more a time period than an exact geographical place. According to this the Atlantis disappeared in 8016 BC when the Ice-Age ended in Finland and the ice melted away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bocksaga.com/links.html|first=Ior|last=Bock|publisher=bocksaga.com|title=Atlantis rising magazine|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005154349/http://bocksaga.com/links.html|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}

===Sweden===
[[File:Atlantica.jpg|thumb|[[Olaus Rudbeck]]'s ''Atlantica'']]
In 1679 [[Olaus Rudbeck]] wrote ''[[Atland]]'' (''Atlantica''), where he argues that Scandinavia, specifically Sweden, is identical with Atlantis. According to Rudbeck the capital city of Atlantis was identical to the ancient burial site of Swedish kings ''[[Gamla Uppsala]]''.

==Americas==
Until the [[discovery of the New World]] scholars believed that Atlantis was either a metaphor for teaching philosophy, or just attributed the story to Plato without connecting the island with a real location. When Columbus returned from his voyage to the west historians began identifying the Americas with Atlantis. The first was [[Francisco López de Gómara]],{{r|ley196706}}&lt;ref&gt;Gómara, Francisco López de, ''Historia de las Indias'' (Hispania Victrix; First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the whole discovery and notable things that have happened since they were acquired until the year 1551, with the conquest of Mexico and New Spain), Zaragoza 1552&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1552 thought that what Columbus had discovered was the Atlantic Island of Plato.

In 1556 [[Agustín de Zárate]] stated that the Americas was Atlantis which at one time began from the straits of Gibraltar and extended westwards to include North and South America{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} and that it was as a result of Plato that the new continent was discovered. He also said it had all the attributes of the continent described by Plato yet at the same time mentioned that the ancient peoples crossed over by a route from the island of Atlantis. Zarate also mentions that the 9,000 "years" of Plato were 9,000 "months" (750 years).&lt;ref&gt;Zárate, Agustín de, '' Historia del descubrimiento y conquista del Perú (1556) '' published in English as ''The Discovery and History of Peru''   trans by  J.M. Cohen, Pub Penguin Classics 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also repeated and clarified by historian  [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]  in 1572 in his "History of the Incas",&lt;ref&gt;Gamboa, Pedro Sarmiento de ''Historia de los Incas.'' (History of the Incas) Peru 1572 and Buenos Aires: Emecé Editores, 1943. trans. by Clements Markham, (1907) as ''History of the Incas,'' UK, The Hakluyt Society, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who by calculation of longitude stated that Atlantis must have stretched from within two leagues of the strait of Gibraltar westwards to include "all the rest of the land from the mouth of the Marañon (Amazon River) and Brazil to the South Sea, which is what they now call America."  He thought the sunken part to be now in the Atlantic Ocean but that it was from this sunken part that the original Indians had come to populate Peru via one continuous land mass. He says that South America was also known by the name of the Isla Atlanticus.{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}

It first appeared as the Atlantic Island (Insula Atlantica) on a map of the New World by cartographer [[Sebastian Münster]] in 1540&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/lewis_clark/exploring/ch1-2.html|author= Sebastian Münster|title=munster map new world|year=1540}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and again on the map titled Atlantis Insula by [[Nicolas Sanson]] and son (1669) which identified both North and South America as "Atlantis Insula", the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean as "Oceanus Atlanticus" and the western part of the Atlantic Ocean plus the Pacific Ocean as "Atlanticum Pelagus". This edition was further embellished with features from the Atlantis legend by his son Guillaume Sanson including the names of the ten kings of Atlantis with Atlas' portion being in Mexico. Sanson's map supposedly showed what the earth looked like 200,000 years before there were any humans on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantis Insula, à Nicolao Sanson Antiquitati Restituta|url=http://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/JCB~1~1~833~950003:Atlantis-Insula,-%C3%A0-Nicolao-Sanson-A|publisher=[[John Carter Brown Library]], Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] also identified America with Atlantis; Janus Joannes Bircherod said in 1663 ''orbe novo non novo'' ("the New World is not new").{{r|ley196706}}

==Other locations==
There have been suggestions for Atlantis to be placed outside of the Mediterranean Sea or the Atlantic Ocean. Such locations are outside of the known world of the original sources of the legend.

===Antarctica===
The theory that [[Antarctica]] was Atlantis was particularly fashionable during the 1960s and 1970s, spurred on partly both by the isolation of the continent, and also the [[Piri Reis map]], which purportedly shows Antarctica as it would be ice free, suggesting human knowledge of that period. [[Flavio Barbiero]], [[Charles Berlitz]], [[Erich Von Däniken]] and [[Peter Kolosimo]] are some of the popular authors who made this proposal.

More recently Rose and [[Rand Flem-Ath]] have proposed this in their book, ''When the Sky Fell''; the theory was revised and made more specific in Rand's work with author [[Colin Wilson]], in ''The Atlantis Blueprint'' (published in 2002).  The second work theorized that Atlantis was to be found in Lesser Antarctica, near the coast of the Ross Ice Shelf. A geological theory known as "Earth Crust Displacement" forms the basis of their work. The Atlantis Blueprint uses both scientific and pseudoscientific (such as mere speculation and assumptions) means to back up the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Charles Hapgood]] came up with the "[[Earth Crustal Displacement]] theory". Hapgood's theory suggests that Earth's outer [[crust (geology)|crust]] is able to move upon the upper mantle layer rapidly up to a distance of 2,000 miles, placing Atlantis in Antarctica, when considering the movements of the crust in the past. It is to be noted that [[Albert Einstein]] was one of the few voices to answer Hapgood's theory. Einstein wrote a preface for Hapgood's book ''Earth's shifting crust'', published in 1958. This theory is particularly popular with [[Hollow Earth]]ers, and can be seen as a mirror of the [[Hyperborea]]n identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===North Pole===
The professor of systematic theology at Boston University [[William Fairfield Warren]] (1833–1929) wrote a book promoting his theory that the original centre of mankind once sat at the North Pole entitled ''Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole'' (1885). In this work Warren placed Atlantis at the North Pole, as well as the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Mount Meru]], [[Avalon]] and [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/pf/pf46.htm |title=Paradise Found: Index of Subjects |website=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren believed all these mythical lands were folk memories of a former inhabited far northern seat where man was originally created.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/pf/pf17.htm |title=Paradise Found: Part Fourth: Chapter I.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
A '''logarithmic timeline''' is a timeline laid out according to a [[logarithmic scale]].  This necessarily implies a [[wikt:zero-point|zero point]] and an [[infinity point]], neither of which can be displayed. The most natural zero point is the [[Big Bang]], looking forward, but the most common is the ever-changing present, looking backward. (Also possible is a zero point in the present, looking forward to the infinite future.)

The idea of presenting history logarithmically goes back at least to 1932, when [[John B. Sparks]] copyrighted his chart "Histomap of Evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/08/12/the_1931_histomap_the_entire_history_of_the_world_distilled_into_a_single.html?wpisrc=obnetwork

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time it was also explored by the [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] [[Heinz von Foerster]], who used it to propose that memories naturally fade in an exponential manner. Logarithmic timelines have also been used in [[future studies]] to justify the idea of a [[technological singularity]].

A logarithmic scale enables events throughout time to be presented accurately, but enables more events to be included closer to one end. Sparks explained this by stating:
: ''As we travel forward in geological time the more complex is the evolution of life forms and the more are the changes to be recorded. Further, the most recent periods of evolution hold the most interest for us. We need therefore increasingly more space for our outline the nearer we approach modern times, and the logarithmic scale fulfills just this condition without any break in the continuity.''

Two examples of such timelines are shown below, while a more comprehensive version (similar to that of Sparks' "Histomap") can be found at [[Detailed logarithmic timeline]].

== Example of a forward-looking logarithmic timeline ==

In this table each row is defined in seconds after the [[Big Bang]], with earliest at the top of the chart. (see [[Cosmological decade]])

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt; 
|rowspan=4| [[Timeline of the Big Bang|Epoch]] of [[Grand Unification]]
|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-

|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; 
|rowspan=2| [[Electroweak]] Epoch
|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; || [[Hadron]] Epoch
|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || [[Lepton]] Epoch

|-
| align=center|10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

The present time is approximately {{val|4.3|e=17}} seconds after the Big Bang; the Sun and Earth formed about {{val|2|e=17}} seconds after the Big Bang. 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds is 3&amp;nbsp;trillion years ({{val|3|e=12}} years) in the future.

== Example of a backward-looking logarithmic timeline ==

In this table each row is defined in ''years ago'', that is, years before the present [[calendar date|date]], with the most recent at the top of the chart. Each event is an occurrence of an observed or inferred process.  (Note that the logarithmic scale never actually gets to zero.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">'''Lucius Lucceius''', [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[orator]] and historian, friend and correspondent of [[Cicero]]. A man of considerable wealth and literary tastes, he may be compared with [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]. Disgusted at his failure to become consul in 60 BC, he retired from public life, and devoted himself to writing a history of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social]] and [[Roman Civil War|Civil Wars]]. This was nearly completed, when Cicero earnestly requested him to write a separate history of his (Cicero's) consulship. Cicero thought that a [[panegyric]] by Lucceius, who had taken considerable interest in the affairs of that critical period, would have great weight in his campaign to rehabilitate himself after the exile stemming from his consulship. Cicero offered to supply the material, and hinted that Lucceius need not sacrifice laudation to accuracy. Lucceius almost promised, but did not perform. Subsequently, Cicero had to sing his own praises in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]], but nothing remains of any such work or of his history. In the civil war he took the side of [[Pompey]]; but, having been pardoned by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], returned to Rome, where he lived in retirement until his death.

'''Marxists Internet Archive''' (also known as '''MIA''' or '''Marxists.org''') is a non-profit website that hosts a multilingual library (created in 1990) of the works of [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Communism|communist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] writers, such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], as well as that of writers of related ideologies, and even unrelated ones (for instance, [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Adam Smith]]). The collection is maintained by volunteers, and is based on a collection of documents that were distributed by email and newsgroups, later collected into a single [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]] site in 1993.  It contains over 53,000 documents from over 600 authors in 61 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/admin/intro/main.htm|title=MIA Introduction|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[Image:Marx-Engels Archive (navigation screen - September 1996).jpg|thumb|250px| The forerunner of Marxists Internet archive was the Marx-Engels Archive, available on the Internet since 1993.]]
The archive was created in 1990 by a person — known only by his Internet tag, Zodiac — who started archiving Marxist texts by transcribing the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Engels]] into [[E-text]], starting with the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]''. In 1993 the accumulated text was posted on a gopher site at csf.colorado.edu. Volunteers joined and helped spread and mirror the main archive. However, the main site and its mirrors were hosted on academic servers and by the end of 1995 almost all had been shut down.&lt;ref name="History of MIA"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/admin/intro/history/index.htm History of MIA], Marxists Internet Archive, accessed 06 Sept, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Newman, [http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pkt/1995m06-d/msg00015.htm "Marx/Engels WWW Archive – REMOVED (fwd)"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031120155633/http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pkt/1995m06-d/msg00015.htm |date=2003-11-20 }}, message to PKT Mailing List, 20 Jun 1995 08:07:52 -0700; [http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pkt/index.htm PKT Mailing List archives] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020714091409/http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pkt/index.htm |date=2002-07-14 }}, retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 the website, Marx.org, was hosted by a commercial [[internet service provider|ISP]]. This was followed by an increased activity from the volunteers. In the following years, however, a conflict developed between the volunteers working on the website and Zodiac, who retained control of the project and domain name. As the scope of the archive expanded, Zodiac feared that the opening toward diverse currents of [[Marxism]] was a "slippery slope" toward sectarianism. The volunteers who had been undertaking the work of transcribing texts resented having little influence over the way in which the archive was organized and run. In early 1998 Zodiac decided that Marx.org would return to its roots and that all writers other than Marx and Engels would be removed.&lt;ref name="History of MIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marxism on the Web"&gt;Martin Empson,[http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=61&amp;issue=105  "Marxism on the Web",] ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'' no.105 (Jan. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1998 the present form of the Marxists Internet Archive (marxists.org) was created by volunteers transferring files and archives from Marx.org. This led to a further increase in activity and an enlargement of the scope of the archive. As for Marx.org, Zodiac closed it down in 1999, and in 2002 he gave up the domain name, which was purchased by the MIA.&lt;ref name="History of MIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marxism on the Web"/&gt; Along with marx.org and marxists.org, the MIA can be reached by two other domain names: lenin.org and trotsky.org.

The site, and the group of volunteers working on it, has dramatically changed since its early beginnings. By 2014 it had grown to encompass 62 volunteers in 33 different countries, and held over 50,000 items in 54 languages covering the works of over 600 authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/admin/intro/main.htm Introduction], Marxists Internet Archive, accessed 06 Sept, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the Marxists Internet Archive is a recognized [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for both Marxist and non-Marxist writers.&lt;ref&gt;Mills Kelly, 2003,[http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/r/39/index.html "Marxists Internet Archive"], a review on the [http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources World History Sources] website of George Mason University's Center for History and New Media (Fairfax County, Virginia, USA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Sullivan, ''Marx for a Post-Communist Era'', Routledge, 2002, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nestor Kohan and Pier Brito, ''Marxismo para principiantes: Leer a Marx desde el Siglo XXI'', Era Naciente, Buenos Aires, 2007, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Departamento de Filosofía, [[Universidad de Granada]] (Spain), [http://www.ugr.es/~pgomez/docencia/master-metod/temas/sitios-filosofia-contemporanea.htm Los mejores portales de filosofía contemporánea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622041359/http://www.ugr.es/~pgomez/docencia/master-metod/temas/sitios-filosofia-contemporanea.htm |date=2010-06-22 }}, 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed in the [[OCLC]] [[WorldCat]] catalog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AMarxists+Internet+Archive+%28Firm%29&amp;qt=hot_author Marxists Internet Archive] listing, [http://www.worldcat.org/ Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) Online Union Catalog], added 20 August 2003; entry retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been selected for archiving by institutions such as the [[British Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/target/120534 UK Web Archive], [http://www.bl.uk/ British Library], 2005– .&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland's [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/acad/socstud/tmp_store/mia/Library/ Archived copy of MIA] hosted by University College Cork's [http://www.ucc.ie/en/DepartmentsCentresandUnits/AppliedSocialStudies/ College of Arts, Celtic Studies, and Social Sciences]; entry retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 attacks===
As with many politically oriented internet sites, MIA has had problems with malicious attacks from online sources. Beginning in November 2006, the Marxists Internet Archive faced a number of serious [[denial-of-service attack]]s, attempting to exploit a misconfiguration in their server's operating system. By January 2007 the attacks had crippled much of the archive, and left volunteers with [[CPU]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/incidents.htm Attack Log] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212133602/http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/incidents.htm |date=2007-12-12 }}, Marxists Internet Archive, January 2007. Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; That the majority of systems involved in the attack were either in China or belonging to Chinese institutions led to speculation that the attacks may have been politically motivated and directed by the [[China|People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Noam Cohen, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/05/yourmoney/marx.php "Online Marxist archive blames China for electronic attacks"], ''International Herald Tribune'', February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the attack, coupled with other hosting issues, led to the closure of the Marxists Internet Archive's main server and several of its mirrors for a number of weeks in February and March 2007. The problem was rectified.

===Copyright issue on Marx/Engels Collected Works===
In late April 2014, the small British publishers [[Lawrence and Wishart]] chose to revoke their permission for their English language version of the [[Marx/Engels Collected Works]] to be reprinted in part on MIA.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Jennifer Howard [http://chronicle.com/article/Readers-of-MarxEngels/146251/ "Readers of Marx and Engels Decry Publisher’s Assertion of Copyright"], ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In an email in late April 2014, L&amp;W asked MIA to delete the contested material from their website by the end of April or face litigation.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Noam Cohen [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/arts/claiming-a-copyright-on-marx-how-uncomradely.html?hpw&amp;rref=books&amp;_r=0 "Claiming a Copyright on Marx? How Uncomradely"], ''New York Times'', 30 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-radicals-fight-over-a-karl-marx-copyright-20140429,0,303004.story#axzz30PWRhD34 "Radicals fight over a Karl Marx copyright"], by Hector Tobar, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; MIA chose to follow the request. An online petition was started against the L&amp;W decision, and had the support of more than 4,500 people by the end of the month.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The author of the petition, [[Ammar Aziz]], was quoted in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine: "You cannot privatize their writings—they are the collective property of the people they wrote for. Privatization of Marx and Engels' writings is like getting a trademark for the words 'socialism' or ‘communism.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherboard.vice.com/read/not-even-radical-communist-literature-is-immune-to-copyright-battles "Not Even Radical Communist Literature Is Immune to Copyright Battles"], ''Motherboard'', May 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative of MIA, Andy Blunden, did not dispute that L&amp;W has copyright over the material.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; He was quoted in the Washington D.C. based ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]]'': "The professors and the historians will be able to write learned articles about what Marx said, but the general population are going to be left back in 1975", the year when the publication of the Collected Works began.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt;

In response to widespread criticism, Lawrence and Wishart issued a statement objecting to the "campaign of online abuse."&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt;

== Structure ==

=== Management ===
The MIA is controlled by a [[Committee#Steering_committee|steering committee]]. The committee decides issues such as the categorization of writers, modifications to the [[bylaw]]s (by 3/4 majority), financial issues of all kinds, and similar matters. Administrators are unpaid volunteers who assume additional responsibilities over certain section(s) of MIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/admin/legal/bylaws.htm Bylaws of MIA], Marxists Internet Archive, ratified 21 March 2000, amended 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIA is incorporated in the U.S. state of [[California]] and registered with the U.S. tax service as a [[non-profit]], 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/admin/legal/nonprofit/index.htm Letter from U.S. Internal Revenue Service to Marxists Internet Archive], 1 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the MIA [[charter]], its content will always be offered 100% free, in compliance with all capitalist copyright laws. All the material stored in the archives is either [[public domain]], under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], or used with the copyright holders' permission. Any work created by MIA volunteers is under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribute, Share-Alike 2.0 license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/admin/legal/charter.htm Charter of the MIA], Marxists Internet Archive, ratified July 2000, amended 6 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical location and mirrors===
The website is primarily served via an [[ISP]] in [[Germany]], and four [[mirror website|mirrors]] exist, two of them in [[Europe]] (in [http://www.marxistsfr.org/ France], and [http://marxists.catbull.com/ Germany]), one in [http://marxists.anu.edu.au/ Australia], and one in [http://marxists.architexturez.net/ India].  In addition, there is a mirror of the MIA's Spanish-language Section in the US state of [http://www.1j4.org/index.htm Arizona].

===Distribution===
A 3 [[CD]]/[[DVD]] volume archive (containing the material on the website)  was sold, although many copies were distributed every year for free  to individuals and groups in developing and underdeveloped countries, through 2013. It was decided at this point given the size of the MIA at almost 120 GB to distribute a portable USB hardrive that contains the entire contents of the MIA on it. The DVD is now discontinued. As of March 2014, the MIA was 138 GB.

These measures are not only meant to allow easy access to the material in the archive, but also as a way of ensuring the continuity of the archive. As they put it: "If the Archive is shut down by a publishing conglomerate or the government, having this information widely dispersed around the world, essentially untraceable, with the content entirely intact, is a great thing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/admin/hd-external/ Marxists.org on 160GB HD], Marxists Internet Archive, retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MIA as a book publisher ===
In addition to distribution of its hard drive archives, in 2008 the MIA launched Marxist Internet Archive Publications, which has, as of November 2010, published seven titles in [[philosophy]], [[social history]], and Soviet [[psychology]] and [[pedagogy]], which it distributes through [http://www.erythrospress.com/ Erythrós Press].

== Archival structure ==
Most of material on the website is formatted in [[HTML]], and the style of the documents is determined with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]. [[PDF]] is sometimes used, especially for languages which don't yet have computer [[font]]s or [[Optical character recognition|OCR software]] available. Many PDFs have been added for the purposes of putting up revolutionary and socialist publications, presented as they were printed. This has added to the bulk of the growth of the MIA.

The [[Markup language|markup]] and style of the archive varies from one section to the other, depending on the volunteers who work there, but all are built on a common basic document template.

The archive includes section dedicated to specific historical topics, such as the history of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Paris Commune]] as well as broader subject topics, such as [[philosophy]]. It also includes a reference section called the "Encyclopedia of Marxism", containing definitions of Marxist terms, short biographies, and historical material.

The MIA is also divided into a number of non-English language sections. As of May 1, 2014, the MIA website included content in 61 languages.  Although each of the non-English sections is intended over time to replicate the basic structure of the main (English-language) section, in practice these vary widely in size and scope.   Some of these archives have only a few documents by Marx and Engels, while others are more extensive—for example, the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] section has the complete collected works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Frederick Engels|Engels]], and [[V.I. Lenin|Lenin]].

[[File:Wtc-2004-memorial.jpg|thumb|2004 ''[[Tribute in Light]]'' memorial]]
The first memorials to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of webmasters posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.&lt;ref&gt;For an assessment of the response of webloggers to the attacks, see [https://archive.is/20120711191548/http://news.com.com/2010-1074-281560.html?legacy=cnet When blogging came of age]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The ''[[Tribute in Light]]'' was the first major physical memorial at the [[World Trade Center site]]. A permanent memorial and museum, the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials are being constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Pier A|Pier A]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the ''[[Tribute in Light]]'' first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Hoboken Island|Hoboken Island]], was chosen in September 2004.

==List==

===Temporary memorials===
[[File:Ground Zero cross.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Trade Center cross]] was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero]]
Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

* On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [[World Trade Center cross]], two broken beams at the crash site which had formed a cross, and then had been welded together by iron-workers.
* On October 13, the [[North Charleston Coliseum]] raised a special banner featuring the retired number of Mark Bavis, who was on United Airlines Flight 175. Bavis had played for the ECHL's [[South Carolina Stingrays]], and his retired number hangs in a special corner, independently from the Stingrays' retired numbers (#14, #24) and awards banners (1997 and 2001 Kelly Cup Championships), with the years he played for the team (1994–96), the date of his death (September 11, 2001), and an American flag.
* Also on October 13, The [[September 11 Photo Project]] was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historical preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
* On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture, ''[[The Sphere]]'', formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [[Battery Park City]].&lt;ref name=Sphere&gt;{{cite web | author= | date= May 11, 2007 | title= Memorial Plaque at Battery Park, beneath "The Sphere" Sculpture, now a Temporary Memorial| work=photo | publisher=Flickr| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mapplegate/493397789/| accessdate= March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to [[Radio Farda]]'s website, when the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, [[United States Department of State]], published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiofarda.com/content/f12_us_state_department_thanks_iranian_sympathy_with_sept_11_victims_in_2001/24324962.html تشکر وزارت خارجه آمریکا از همدردی ایرانیان با قربانیان ۱۱ سپتامبر].

==Memorial flags==
The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.&lt;ref name="dnainfo.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shapiro |first=Julie |url=http://dnainfo.com/20100702/manhattan/patchwork-flag-symbolizing-911-recovery-unfurled-over-ground-zero |title=Patchwork Flag Symbolizing 9/11 Recovery Unfurled Over Ground Zero |publisher=DNAinfo.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426024049/http://www.dnainfo.com/20100702/manhattan/patchwork-flag-symbolizing-911-recovery-unfurled-over-ground-zero |archivedate=April 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag has made a number appearances across the country including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS ''New York'' Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight "Persons of the Week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://national911flag.org/?page_id=53 |title=Flag Facts |publisher=The National 9/11 Flag |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It will visit all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees will each add stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag will have a permanent home at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Beam |url=http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2010-02-01-65171.113122_All_50_states_helping_to_repair_911_flag.html |title=All 50 states helping to repair 9/11 flag |publisher=Legislativegazette.com |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=December 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802044821/http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2010-02-01-65171.113122_All_50_states_helping_to_repair_911_flag.html |archivedate=August 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc911memorialfield.org/ |title=FDNY – Powered by Chris A.

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

The 10th Anniversary September 11 Memorial Flag was designed by Carrot-Top Industries, a privately owned company in Hillsborough, NC. The exclusive 9/11 memorial flag was designed with the two World Trade Towers set inside a pentagon decorated with a ribbon to commemorate all of the Americans that lost their lives on September 11, 2001.

==Virtual memorials==
The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as [[Secondlife]] has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:
* Celestial Requiem NYC (SecondLife)&lt;ref name="sl-crnyc"&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://slurl.com/secondlife/Celestial%20Requiem%20NYC/143/122/21|
title=Celestial Requiem NYC, 11, 120, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the ''Reflected Absence'' memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.&lt;ref name="sl-crnyc-ann"&gt;{{cite web|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">A '''mental representation''' (or '''cognitive representation'''), in [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]], is a hypothetical internal cognitive [[symbol]] that represents external reality,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://philpapers.org/archive/MORRGM.pdf|title = Representations Gone Mental|last = Morgan|first = Alex|date = 2014|journal = Synthese |volume=191 |issue=2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 213–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else a [[mental process]] that makes use of such a symbol:  "a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marr|first=David|year=2010|isbn=978-0262514620|title=Vision. A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Monitoring a simulated test at Central Control Facility at Eglin Air Force Base (080416-F-5297K-101).jpg|thumb|Cyber-warriors, the implementation of thousands of Governmental Cyber Security Specialists displays the prevalence of the Cyber threat which has subsequently led to the '''Military-digital complex'''.]]

The '''military-digital complex''' (MDC) is the militarization of [[Cyber Operations]] by governments and corporations, often through monetary relationships between computer programmers in private companies and the military to combat the threat of cyber terrorism and warfare. Cyber operations since 2000 have increased dramatically, with the recent branch of the US Strategic Command the [[United States Cyber Command]]. Cyber operations has been defined by the Washington Post as,
:"Offensive and defensive cyber (or digital) warfare, including the fields of computer network attack, computer network exploitation and computer network defense; as well as traditional electronic warfare (e.g. jamming) intended to deny an adversary use of their electronically dependent equipment through "non-kinetic" means -- that is, by fighting with electrons rather than explosives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/functions/cyber-ops|title=Washington Post Official Site - Cyber Operations| accessdate=2011-03-11|publisher=projects.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As cyber attacks become an increasingly common threat to the security of civilians and highly classified governmental information, a need to combat the threat by means of [[Computer network operations]] and [[Computer Network Defense]] have arisen. It is important to note however that protection is only one component of the Military-digital complex and that the use of [[Information Warfare]] within the complex can be used to achieve military operations and an upper-hand in economic exploits.

The Military-digital complex contains many components which align it succinctly to its industrial counterpart, for example the use of defense contractors. Although hired Contractors may not be explicitly named as such they still expose the complex to complications such as the [[principal agent problem]] and consequently [[moral hazard]]. The '''MDC''' is seen as a progression as nations move globally towards [[cyberwarfare]], indeed the cyber war is increasingly being acknowledged as the "fifth domain of warfare"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478792|title=Cyber war in the fifth domain, Economist| accessdate=2010-07-19|publisher=www.economist.com|date=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The MDC is a necessity for governmental bodies in order to maintain high standards within their cyber army, for example the USA boasts over "143 private companies involved in top secret cyber operations programs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://risky.biz/wapost|title=military digital complex revealed| accessdate=2010-07-10|publisher=risky.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; however James Gosler a government specialist in cyber security indicates that the USA have a severe shortage of government cybersecurity specialists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128574055|title=Cyber war shortage threatens US security| accessdate=2010-07-19|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official photo portrait, May 29, 1959.jpg|thumb|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] famously coined the precursor phrase [[Military-industrial complex]] when describing the twinning of the arms industry to the military under the government; this paved the way for the emergence of the military-digital complex.]]

Technology has been a part of war since the dawn of warfare. Neolithic tools such as daggers were used as weaponry and clan rivalry long before recorded history. The [[bronze age]] and [[iron age]] saw technological improvements namely in the advancements of weaponry and subsequently the arrival of complex industries. It was not until the late 19th and early 20th Century that weaponry advanced in leaps and bounds to the armaments mankind witnesses today, however even then industry was relatively independent of the government and military. [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] were two important factors that led to the consequent [[military-industrial complex]]. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his book ''[[Age of Extremes]]'' outlines how categorically countries like Japan, USA and Russia had to develop their own military industry to support their militaristic efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/28|title=The Age Of Extremes, Eric Hobsbawm| accessdate=2011-01-01| publisher=www.history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a complex whereby the economies then straddled on this arms industry. Consequently, the procurement of [[missile]]s, [[ballistics]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[destroyers]] and [[submarine]]s shows a marked difference between the ancient acquisitions of countries.

At the dawn on the 21st Century, the world has seen an emergence of digital equipment in the use of warfare, spanning from satellite surveillance systems all the way to dedicated agencies such as [[United States Cyber Command]] fully equipped with thousands of professionals manning computers on a 24/365 basis in order to prevent a cyber attack.

The use of computers has long been an essential tool in warfare,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} however as warfare moves from the traditional frontiers of land, sea, air and space to "cyber space" the use of computers is becoming not only essential but vital.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Gregory Rattray, author of ''Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace'', explains how the history of warfare in the [[information age]] is far reaching and is well beyond military operation including financial crime and economic espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lVbQ4AxfYaMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=warfare+in+cyberspace&amp;ots=OGw1ozPIlE&amp;sig=-6gOJl7CcakbYhrxDbBfDgts7Y0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace| accessdate= 2011-03-11|publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this cyber warfare shows that it crosses global boundaries and encompasses political agendas, attacks on the USA such as [[Titan Rain]] show an attack from networks and computers situated in China for example. As the age of digital warfare progressed it has become evident that human reliance on technological equipment to monitor essential utilities such as our electricity grids has proven cataclysmic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10214898-54.html| title=Spies hack US electricity Grid| accessdate=2009-04-08|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat became increasingly relevant, the emergence of big corporate players on the '''MDC''' scene including names such as [[Symantec]], [[McAfee]] and traditional defense contractors such as [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Lockheed Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/29/us-security-cyberspace-sb-idUSTRE54S0XQ20090529|title=Pentagon plans new Cyberspace war command| accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the cyber threat grows so does mankind's reliance on corporate players such as the aforementioned, creating an [[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangle]] among government, military and these global security corporations.

'''Muslim supporters of Israel''' are [[Muslim]]s who support self-determination for the Jewish people, and a homeland for them in the [[State of Israel]].

Some Muslim clerics, such as Sheikh Prof. [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], Director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community,&lt;ref name = "fpm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Højsgaard"/&gt; and Imam Dr Muhammad Al-Hussaini&lt;ref name="hussaini"&gt;{{cite web | title = Muhammad Al-Hussaini.

In the [[Muslim world]], support of Israel is a minority orientation, and supporters of Israel have faced opposition and violence.&lt;ref name = "intolerance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mob"/&gt;

==History==
===Middle Ages===
[[File:Qur'an Tabari.jpg|thumb|right|According to Imam Muhammad Al-Hussaini, traditional Islamic commentators from the 8th and 9th century onwards, such as [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], have uniformly interpreted the Qur'an to say that the Land of Israel has been given by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual covenant.&lt;ref name="hussaini"/&gt;]]

According to British-based [[Imam]] Muhammad Al-Hussaini, traditional commentators from the 8th and 9th century onwards have uniformly interpreted the Qur'an to say explicitly that the Land of Israel has been given by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual covenant.&lt;ref name="hussaini"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What the Koran says about the land of Israel | publisher = JC| date = 2009-03-19| url = http://www.thejc.com/judaism/judaism-features/what-koran-says-about-land-israel | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussaini bases his argument upon Qur'an 5:21 in which [[Moses]] declares: "O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you, and turn not back in your traces, to turn about losers." He cites the Qur'an commentator [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], who says that this statement is "a narrative from God... concerning the saying of Moses... to his community from among the children of Israel and his order to them according to the order of God to him, ordering them to enter the holy land." He argued that this promise to the Jews is ever lasting, and further said: "It was never the case during the early period of Islam... that there was any kind of sacerdotal attachment to Jerusalem as a territorial claim." This interpretation of the promise to the Jews as ever-lasting is not uniformly accepted by all Islamic commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Qur'an: Israel Is Not for the Jews | publisher = Middle East Forum| date = Fall 2009| url = http://www.meforum.org/2462/the-quran-israel-not-for-jews | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a translation by the Islamic Law scholar [[Khaleel Mohammed]], [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1373) interpreted Qur'an 5:20–21 using the following terms: "'That which God has written for you' i.e. That which God has promised to you by the words of your father Israel that it is the inheritance of those among you who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Prof. Khaleel | last = Mohammed | title = For Whom the Holy Land? A Qur'anic Answer | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early twentieth century===
[[File:Weizmann and feisal 1918.jpg|thumb|Faisal (right) with [[Chaim Weizmann]] (also wearing Arab dress as a sign of friendship) in Syria, 1918.]]

After World War I, the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali and his son, the King Feisal of Hijaz and then of Iraq, proclaimed pro-Zionist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Near East report | volume = 19 | first = Isaiah L | last = Kenen | year = 1975 | page = 36 | quote = ...Sheriff Hussein and Emir Feisal proclaimed pro-Zionist views after World War I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, the [[Wahhabi]] position, in contrast, was extremely anti-Zionist.&lt;ref name="PalazziInterview"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Muslim Zionist|publisher=IsraPundit }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=February 2011}}

On March 23, 1918, [[Al Qibla]], the daily newspaper of Mecca, printed the following words in support of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The resources of the country [Palestine] are still virgin soil and will be developed by the Jewish immigrants (...) we have seen the Jews from foreign countries streaming to Palestine from Russia, Germany, Austria, Spain, and America. The cause of causes could not escape those who had a gift of deeper insight. They knew that the country was for its original sons [abna'ihi-l-asliyin], for all their differences, a sacred and beloved homeland. The return of these exiles [jaliya] to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually an experimental school for their brethren who are with them in the fields, factories, trades and all things connected to the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Al Qibla | date = March 23, 1918}}, as cited by {{Citation | first = Samuel Katz | title = Battlegound: Fact and Fantasy in Palestine | page = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 3 January 1919, Hussein's son, king [[Faisal I of Iraq]] and Dr. [[Chaim Weizmann]], President of the [[World Zionist Organization]] signed the [[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]] for Arab-Jewish cooperation, in which Faisal conditionally accepted the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] based on the fulfilment of British wartime promises of development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and on which subject he stated:

{{Quote |We Arabs... look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our deputation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist Organisation to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper. We will do our best, in so far as we are concerned, to help them through; we will wish the Jews a most hearty welcome home... I look forward, and my people with me look forward, to a future in which we will help you and you will help us, so that the countries in which we are mutually interested may once again take their places in the community of the civilised peoples of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://amislam.com/feisal.htm |type=letter |first=Emir |last=Feisal |title=To Felix Frankfurter |publisher=Amislam |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133823/http://amislam.com/feisal.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Reshaping Palestine: from Muhammad Ali to the British Mandate, 1831–1922 | first = Martin | last = Sicker | publisher = Greenwood | year = 1999 | page = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[As'ad Shukeiri]], a Muslim scholar ('alim) of the [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] area, and the father of [[PLO]] founder [[Ahmad Shukeiri]], has rejected the values of the Palestinian Arab national movement and was opposed to the [[anti-Zionist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Encyclopedia of the modern Middle East | volume = 4 | first1 = Reeva S | last1 = Simon | first2 = Philip | last2 = Mattar | first3 = Richard W | last3 = Bulliet | publisher = Macmillan Reference | place = USA | year = 1996 | page = 1661}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met routinely with [[Zionist]] officials and had a part in every pro-Zionist Arab organization from the beginning of the British Mandate, publicly rejecting [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]]'s use of Islam to attack Zionism.&lt;ref name="shadows1"&gt;{{harvnb | Cohen | 2009 | p = 84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hasan Bay Shukri.jpg|thumb|right|The president of the [[Muslim National Associations]] and the mayor of Haifa, Hassan Bey Shukri, voiced support for the [[Balfour Declaration]] and for Zionist immigration to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]].&lt;ref name="shadows"/&gt;]]
In the 1920s, the [[Muslim National Associations]] was established by Muslim Arabs who were employed by the Palestine Zionist Executive. The president of the Muslim National Associations and the mayor of [[Haifa]], [[Hassan Bey Shukri]], has founded the organization with Sheikh [[Musa Hadeib]] from the village of [[Dawaymeh]] near [[Hebron]] and head of the farmers' party of Mt. Hebron.&lt;ref name="shadows"&gt;{{harvnb | Cohen | 2009 | pp = 15–17, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/shadowplays | title = Shadowplays | first = Neve | last = Gordon | newspaper = The Nation | date = March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ocnus.net/artman2/publish/Research_11/The_Tangled_Truth_printer.shtml | title = The Tangled Truth | first = Benny | last = Morris | newspaper = The New Republic | date = May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1921, Shukri sent a telegram to the British government, declaring support for the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] and Zionist immigration to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]]:
{{Quote |We strongly protest against the attitude of the said delegation concerning the Zionist question. We do not consider the Jewish people as an enemy whose wish is to crush us. On the contrary. We consider the Jews as a brotherly people sharing our joys and troubles and helping us in the construction of our common country.&lt;ref name="shadows" /&gt;}}

In 1929, Hadeib was murdered in [[Jerusalem]], supposedly for his collaboration with the Zionists.&lt;ref name="shadows" /&gt;

In the late 1930s, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Amir Abdullah]], ruler of Transjordan, and the pro-Hashemite leader of Syria, Abd al-Rahman Shahabandar, offered the Zionists to create a Jewish autonomy in Palestine under the Transjordanian throne, although they did not propose an independent Jewish state.&lt;ref name="maoz2" /&gt;

===Modern times===
A number of Muslim groups that have histories of conflict with Arabs, including [[Kurds]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]], have also voiced support for Israel and Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Islam, Islam, Laïcité, and Amazigh Activism in France and North Africa | year = 2004 | format = paper | first = Paul A | last = Silverstein | publisher = Department of Anthropology, Reed College}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramin H. Artin, of the Kurdish-American Education Society, argues that the creation of Israel has been "a thorn in the eye of fascists who would rather eliminate the Jewish state". He concluded that an Israeli-Kurdish alliance is "natural", and that sincere mutual respect and recognition of each other's rights can lead to peace and prosperity.&lt;ref name="Why not a Kurdish-Israeli alliance?"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2004/august/israel_kurds_11804.shtml | title = Why not a Kurdish-Israeli alliance? | publisher = Iran Press Service | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palazzi noted that although in present days support for Israel among Muslims is a minority orientation, there are some exceptions, such as former President of Indonesia and leader of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], Shaykh [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], and the Grand Mufti of the Russian Federation, Shaykh [[Talgat Tajuddin]], the Mufti of European Russia, Shaykh [[Salman Farid]], who wrote a fatwa against the intifadah. According to Palazzi, more examples for Pro-Israeli Muslim clerics are the Muftis of Chechnya, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="PalazziInterview"/&gt;{{Self-published inline | date=February 2011}}&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bloom | first = Jack | title = Out of Step: Life-Story of a Politician Politics and Religion in a World at War | year = 2005 | publisher = Indiana University | isbn = 0-620-35374-0 | pages = 244, xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey]] also supports Israel, being one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yossi Verter8 hours ago 3 3 comments |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/comment-how-do-turkey-and-israel-measure-each-other-s-love-1.5928 |title=Comment How Do Turkey and Israel Measure Each Other's Love? |publisher=Haaretz |date=October 18, 2009 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also noted that trade between Turkey and Israel has broken records in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/middle-east/37649-140719-turkish-israeli-trade-ties-break-records |title=Turkish-Israeli trade ties break records &amp;#124; i24news - See beyond |publisher=I24news.tv |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Arab supporters of Israel==

===Muslim Bedouins===
{{partisan|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Bedouin IDF1949.jpg|thumb|right|Bedouin IDF soldiers of Rumat al-Heib (عرب الهيب) during a military parade in Tel-Aviv in June 1949.]]
During the [[Israeli War of Independence]] of 1948, many Bedouin switched sides to join the Zionist forces in opposing the invasion by the regular Arab armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917–1948 | url = http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/28043 | publisher = Canada Free Press | first = Dr. Norman | last = Berdichevsky | date = September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Negev Bedouin]]s, a Muslim minority which includes about 12% of Israeli Arabs, tend to identify more as Israelis than other Arab citizens of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New Identity/Identities Formulation in a Post-Nomadic Community: The Case of the Bedouin of the Negev| first =Steven | last = Dinero|publisher=National Identities|year=2004|volume= 6| issue = 3|pages= 261–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Negev Bedouins serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].  Each year, between 5%–10% of the Bedouin of draft age volunteer for the IDF (unlike [[Druze]] and [[Jewish]] Israelis, they are not required by law to do so&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2024.html?countryName=Israel&amp;countryCode=is&amp;regionCode=me&amp;#is | contribution = Field Listing: Military service age and obligation | publisher = CIA | title = World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

During the Palestinian Arab national movement's formation, Bedouins often perceived their tribe as their principal focus of identity, and they generally did not view themselves as a component of the emerging Palestinian identity.&lt;ref name="shadows8"&gt;{{harvnb | Cohen | 2009 | pp = 73, 154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedouins had long standing ties with nearby [[Jewish]] communities.  Bedouins of [[Tuba-Zangariyye]] helped defend these communities in the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Formal co-operation between Jews and Bedouin began in 1946, when tribal leader Sheik  [[Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef]] of the [[al-Heib]] tribe sent more than 60 of his men to fight alongside Zionist forces, forming the [[Pal-Heib]] unit of the [[Haganah]]. During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the Pal-Heib unit defended Jewish communities in the [[Upper Galilee]] against [[Syria]].  Sheik Abu Yussef was quoted in 1948 as saying, "Is it not written in the [[Koran]] that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations? Our friendship with the Jews goes back many years. We felt we could trust them and they learned from us too".&lt;ref name="shadows"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Palestine Post | title = Israel's Bedouin Warriors | first = Gene | last = Dison | date = August 12, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli Druze and Circassian Muslims===

====Background====
The [[Circassians in Israel]] are non-Arab, predominantly Sunni Muslims. The Circassians have had good relations with the Jewish community in Israel since the beginning of the [[Yishuv|Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel]]. The Circassian community in Israel helped the illegal immigration ([[Ha'apala]]) of Jews into Palestine during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] and fought on the Israeli side of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|War of Independence]]. In 1948, when Israel was created, Circassians of Palestine did not migrate to neighboring countries, but rather made the choice to stay within the borders of the new state and embrace full Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref name="merza"/&gt; Like the [[Druze]] population, since 1958 male Circassians perform Israeli mandatory military service upon reaching the age of majority, while females do not.  Many Circassians in Israel are employed in the security forces, including in the Border Guard, the Israel Defense Forces, the police and the Israel Prison Service. The percentage of army recruits among the Circassian community in Israel is particularly high. This loyalty to Israel is often considered as an act of betrayal by the Arab Muslims, who see Circassians as traitors to the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref name="merza"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bcrfj.revues.org/index5911.html | title = In search of a lost time, (Re) construction of identity in the Circassian diaspora in Israel | first = Eléonore | last = Merza | newspaper = Bulletin du Centre de recherche français de Jérusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berkley"&gt;{{Citation | title = Jews | first = George E | last = Berkley | publisher = Branden Books | year = 1997 | page = 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Druze]] are a religious community who consider themselves an Islamic Unist, reformatory sect. The Druze consider themselves to be Muslim, although they are considered non-Muslim by the general Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/recordinfo.asp?condition=populations.pop_uid='PO000008I | contribution = Druze | title = The Allele Frequency Database | first = Kenneth K | last = Kidd | publisher = Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Druze mostly do not identify with the cause of [[Arab nationalism]]. The bond between Jews and Druze is commonly known by the term "a covenant of blood".  Druze citizens are prominent in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and in [[Politics of Israel|politics]], and a considerable number of Israeli Druze soldiers have fallen in Israel's wars since the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].  [[Reda Mansour]], a Druze poet, historian and diplomat, explained: "We are the only non-Jewish minority that is drafted into the military, and we have an even higher percentage in the combat units and as officers than the Jewish members themselves. So we are considered a very nationalistic, patriotic community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Christensen|first=John |title=Consul General is an Arab Who Represents Israel Well|url= http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2008/11/15/mansour.html |newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date= November 15, 2008|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 more than 94% of Druze youngsters classified themselves as "Druze-Israelis" in the religious and national context.  Five Druze lawmakers currently have been elected to serve in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|18th Knesset]], a disproportionately large number considering their population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Stern |first = Yoav |date = January 1, 2009 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1060848.html | title = Elections 2009 Druze likely to comprise 5% of next Knesset, despite small population | newspaper = Ha’aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salman Abu-Salah, from the village [[Majdal Shams]], established the "Zionist Druze Club" in the Golan in the 1970s and advocated petitioning for Israeli citizenship, even prior to the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in 1980.&lt;ref name="nisan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Nisan | first = Mordechai | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2169290291.html | title = The Druze in Israel: Questions of Identity, Citizenship, and Patriotism | newspaper = The Middle East Journal | date = October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusuf Nasr al-Din, who believes that the Arab-Israeli Conflict is a historical struggle between Zionism and Arabism, established the Druze Zionist Movement, recommending that the Druze show solidarity with Israel and adopt the national Zionist ideology of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="nisan" /&gt;

"The state of Israel is Jewish state as well as a democratic state that espouses equality and elections.  We invalidate and reject everything that the Adalah organization is requesting," he said. According to A-din, the fate of Druze and Circassians in Israel is intertwined with that of the state. "This is a blood pact, and a pact of the living. We are unwilling to support a substantial alteration to the nature of this state, to which we tied our destinies prior to its establishment," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Stern | first=Yoav|title=Druze, Circassian forum: Israel should remain a Jewish state|url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/druze-circassian-forum-israel-should-remain-a-jewish-state-1.214417 |accessdate=June 22, 2010|newspaper=Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2005}} there were 7,000 registered members in the Druze Zionist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=641210&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=21&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 | script-title=he:הרצל והתקווה בחגיגות 30 לתנועה הדרוזית הציונית | language = Hebrew | first = Eli | last = Ashkenazi | newspaper = Ha’aretz | date = November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the movement held a Druze Zionist youth conference with 1,700 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://radiohaifa.mediacast.co.il/article.aspx?id=5252 |script-title=he:הציונות הדרוזית היא אהבת מדינת ישראל והתרומה למדינת ישראל |language=Hebrew |newspaper=Radio Haifa |date=December 9, 2009 |first=Samar |last=Odeh |publisher=Media cast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135621/http://radiohaifa.mediacast.co.il/article.aspx?id=5252 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Arab Israelis identifying with Israel===
Major Ala Wahib serves as the highest ranking Muslim officer in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and originates from the [[Galillee]] village of [[Reineh]].  He serves as the operations officer at an IDF ground forces training base, and describes himself as a "Zionist Israeli Arab". Wahib grew up in a society where [[Holocaust denial]] was common, but visited [[Poland]] while serving in the IDF and was shocked, saying that "there was something very powerful in the fact that I was standing on Polish soil, holding an Israeli flag and donning the uniform of the Israeli army, but this time from a position of power."  According to Wahib, there are quite a lot of Israeli Arabs who want to enlist, but do not do so since they don't know how this will be accepted by their environment. In regards to being a Muslim, Wahib explained that he believes in the Muslim faith, and will never abandon it, but believes that "Zionism... is something that fully represents my sense of belonging to the State of Israel and to Israeli society, and the immense commitment I have to protecting and guarding the country of which I am part."&lt;ref name="Ali Wahib"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5727 | title= An officer and a Muslim Zionist | last =Yitzhaki | first = Michal Yaakov | work = Israel Hayom | date=September 7, 2012 | accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anett Haskia is another outspoken Muslim supporter of Israel who was born and raised in [[Akko]]. A mother of three children who have served in the IDF, she says that Arabs in Israel live better than those living in any Arab state, and states, "I was born in Israel, and it is my homeland. I thank God every day that I was born in the Jewish state because of everything that happens in the Arab states in general and Syria, in particular. Not only do I support Israel, I am  also willing to sacrifice my family for the existence of this state. You have to understand, Israel is my homeland. Just because I am an Arab Muslim does not mean I will support Arab countries against Israel or identify with a murderous organization like Hamas that wants to destroy my homeland."{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jones.

===Canada===
[[Irshad Manji]], a Muslim Canadian author and an advocate of progressive interpretation of Islam, says that the Arabs' failure to accept the Jews' historical bond with Palestine is a mistake. Manji accepts that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and recognizes their right to a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties; that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers; and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also observes that Israel has a free Arab press; that road signs bear Arabic translations; and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews. She accuses Arab countries for the Palestinian refugees' plight, saying that they "interfered with every attempt to solve the problem" and that they would rather give "generous support to suicide bombers and their families" rather than help the needy refugees.&lt;ref name="Islam"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Irshad Manji| last = Manji | first = Irshad | title = The Trouble with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2005 | pages = 108–9 | isbn = 0-312-32699-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geneive Abdo, "Muslim Zionist" is a label which Manji "would no doubt accept".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=q1N2AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22muslim+zionist%22&amp;dq=%22muslim+zionist%22 | title = Mecca and Main Street: Muslim life in America after 9/11 | first = Geneive | last = Abdo | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | page = 121| isbn = 9780195311716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Dr. Tawfik Hamid, chair for the Study of Islamic Radicalism at the [[Potomac Institute for Policy Studies]], an Egyptian scholar and self-described former member of the militant [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], said that most Muslims correlate the word ''Israel'' in Arabic to the word ''[[Azrael|'Azra'il]]'' that sounds like ''Israel'' but means "Angel of death".{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2011}} This created a link in the minds of most children of Muslims the need to hate the word Israel. In an article titled "Why I loved Israel based on the Qur'an" he claims that according to the Qur'an, God gave the Israelites the land of Israel as their promised land (Quran 17:104): And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the land of promise". He explains the Quran went even further to consider the Promised Land as the permanent inheritance for the Israelites (26:59): "Thus it was, but we made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things (the Promised Land)"&lt;ref name=Hamid&gt;{{Citation | first = T | last = Hamid | title = Why I love Israel Based on the Quran |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued by saying "No Muslim has the right to interfere with the gathering of the Jews in Israel, as this is the will of God himself".&lt;ref name=Hamid /&gt;

The former Egyptian Muslim nuclear scientist Noha Hashad was arrested multiple times for conducting pro-Jewish Quran research, suffering beatings and torture at the hands of the authorities. During the chaos following the fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011, she managed to escape and fled to Israel. She claims that the Qur'an mentions Jewish rights to the land of Israel in a clear manner. In 2014, she renounced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=24603|title=Amrousi, Emily; 'The Quran is a Zionist book'.

In Italy, Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community,&lt;ref name="fpm"/&gt; represents a unique "Muslim Zionist",&lt;ref name="Højsgaard"/&gt; pro-Israel and pro-American position which according to Morten T. Højsgaard, Margit Warburg, although the organization is small in proportions, is a "thorn in the side of both moderate and radical Islamic fundamentalists in Italy".&lt;ref name="Højsgaard"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=klyYZDXUIu4C&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22muslim+zionist%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22muslim%20zionist%22&amp;f=false | title = Religion and cyberspace | first1 = Morten T | last1 = Højsgaard | first2 = Margit | last2 = Warburg | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005 | pages = 108–9| isbn = 9780415357630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian Quranic scholar Sheikh Ahmad al-Adwan, also called the 'Zionist Sheikh', claims that according to the Quran, the land of Israel is promised to the Jews. He wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, I recognize their sovereignty over their land. I believe in the Holy Koran, and this fact is stated many times in the book. For instance 'O my people!

===Kenya===
Abdalla Mwidau, mayor of Mombasa during the 1970s, and a Muslim supporter of Israel, was elected to Kenyan parliament as the representative of Mombasa-South. In 1979, Mwidau conducted an information campaign among Muslims in the USA, in which he praised Israel's assistance to developing African countries and specifically its assistance to Muslim education in Kenya. His political rivals, led by Sharif Kassir, denounced these activities, calling Mwidau a "Zionist agent". Mwidau remained in parliament until his death in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arye Oded]].

Responding to a question whether he believed that Muslims have a right to rule Jerusalem, Hadlaq said, "On the contrary, verse number 21 of Surat Al-Maeda of the Holy Quran emphasizes the right of '[[Children of Israel|Bani Israel]]'".

According to Al-Hadlaq, Israel has in the past made strategic concessions for peace, in [[Sinai]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[South Lebanon]], proving her desire for peaceful negotiations, but the response she earned was a hail of rockets from the "terrorists of Hizballah and Hamas".&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah al-Hadlaq, [http://alwatan.kuwait.tt/ArticleDetails.aspx?Id=120302&amp;YearQuarter=20112 "خطر الاعتراف المبكر بدولة «فلسطينية!": International agreements dealing with peace in the Middle East must be respected].

[[Tashbih Sayyed]], a Sunni Pakistani-American scholar, journalist, and author, was a supporter of Israel and critic of the Islamist movement. He said that Israel is vital for the stability of the region. Sayyed praised the treatment of Arabs in Israel, and applauded the "strength of the Jewish spirit that refuses to give in to evil forces despite thousand of years of [[anti-Semitism]]". He concluded by saying "I am convinced that it is true that God created this earth but it is also a fact that only an Israel can keep this earth from dying". Tashbih condemned the press that portrays the Israelis as villains, and "chooses to ignore all rules of ethical journalism when it comes to Israel."{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;Sayyed, Tashbih, "A Muslim in a Jewish Land," Muslim World Today (December 2, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Rachel, In Memoriam: Tashbih Sayyed.

In 2011, a pro-Israel advocacy group, British Muslims for Israel, was founded under the umbrella of the Institute for Middle Eastern Democracy. The group spokesperson, Hasan Afzal, a political economics student at the University of Birmingham, explained in an interview with Israeli Channel 10 that Muslims in Israel are freer than they are under oppressive regimes in Arab countries.  Afzal said that calls for Israel's destruction are "nonsense" and condemned Hamas who he says is "determined to kill indiscriminately."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mohammed Mostafa Kamal''' is a freelance journalist from [[Bangladesh]] based in the United Kingdom.  He has said, "No Muslim country boycotted [[East Timor]] or banned its citizens from traveling there after it became independent from mainly Muslim [[Indonesia]]. Christian-majority [[South Sudan]] became independent from mainly Muslim United [[Sudan]] in 2011. As with East Timor, we did not see any Muslim boycotts.  However, when Israel became independent in 1948, Muslim countries acted with unrelenting hostility. Why?"  Kamal has said that when comparing Israel's actions since 1948 with those of East Timor or South Sudan, "the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Muslim world's attitude toward Israel is totally illogical, unfair and unjust. Israel was established in the exact same manner as were Australia and America. History will not rewind."  Kamal further added that "anti-Israel activities have not brought the Muslim world anything but tension, conflict and economic ruin, keeping them relegated to third-world status."  Kamal also said that it was a lie to call Israel colonialist or expanionist, using proof that Israel has ceded territory since its formation for peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and had not committed aggression against these countries since those treaties.  Kamal believes that Muslim countries must recognize the state of Israel, and the Muslim world must boycott Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran if they rejected peace.&lt;ref name="Kamal"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=278385 | title=Why doesn't the Muslim world recognize Israel? | work=The Jerusalem Post | date=July 21, 2012 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | author=Kamal, Mohammed Mostafa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They're giving legitimacy to Hamas." When explaining why he voices his views, Zahran said, "I don't do it because I choose to, but rather because most of the people think this way and only I have the privilege of speaking out because I'm a British citizen.

He has noted that 70% of Palestinians in East Jerusalem want Israel to retain control over them, and has said that "we suffer because of our Arab brothers, but we are also dependent on them. It's a bizarre situation because the Arab countries don't really care what happens to the Palestinian people.

==In the Qur'an==
[[File:Bihari script.jpg|thumb|right|Surat Bani Isra'il (The Children of Israel), also known as Surat al-Isra'. According to Khaleel Mohammed, an Islamic Law scholar, medieval exegetes of the Qur'an, such as Ibn Kathir, interpreted this Sura as saying that the land of Israel is promised to the Jews&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Legal Foundation and Borders of Israel Under International Law. p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Imam Abdul Hadi Palazzi, leader of Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder and a co-chairman of the Islam-Israel Fellowship, quotes the Qur'an to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, "The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples." He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures also in Islam. He claims that the Qur'an "expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims".&lt;ref name="margolis"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margolis|first=David|title=The Muslim Zionist|journal=Los Angeles Jewish Journal|date=February 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked what the Qur'an says about the State of Israel, Palazzi replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Qur'an cannot deal with the State of Israel as we know it today, since that State came into existing in 1948 only, i.e. many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that – before the end of the time – the Jewish people will come from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good faith believes what other people say about this issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people – Imam Palazzi | journal = Weekly Blitz | volume = 5 | issue = 42 | date = October 13, 2010 | quote = When asked whether he see himself as a "Muslim Zionist", he replied: "If one means a Muslim who supports the right of the Jewish people to have their own independent and sovereign State, who is solidly behind the State of Israel when it is attacked by terror and when its existence in menaced, who thinks that developing friendly relations between the Muslim nations and the State of Israel is in the interest of the Muslims and of human civilization in general, then I think that the label of Muslim Zionist is appropriate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prof. Khaleel Mohammed, Islamic Law scholar of the San Diego State University, noted that Sura 5 verse 21 of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[medieval]] [[exegetes]] of the Qur'an, say that Israel belongs to the [[Jews]]. He translates it thus:
{{Quote |[Moses said]: O my people! Enter the Holy Land which God has written for you, and do not turn tail, otherwise you will be losers." Mohammed here understands "written" to mean this is the final word from God on the subject. In reaction, he was inundated with hate mail.&lt;ref name="citizen"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1 | title = The scathing scholar | publisher = The Ottawa Citizen | date = February 6, 2007 | quote = The academic has been inundated with hate mail for previously saying that despite what Muslims are taught, Islam's holy book, the Koran, supports the right of Israel to exist and for Jews to live there. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206070641/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1 | archivedate = December 6, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reactions towards Muslim supporters of Israel==
In the Muslim world, support of Israel is mostly met with opposition. In 2004, Sarah Nasser, a Muslim college student in Canada known for her pro-Israel views, received death threats after expressing support for the Jewish state's right to exist. "Being a supporter of the existence of Israel does not conflict with Islam, it complements Islam," she said. "The Koran does not have any verses that do not allow for the Jews to return to the Land of Israel (...) "I love Jews as I love true Muslims," she said. "Therefore, I believe Jews should have a right to live legitimately in their homeland."&lt;ref name="intolerance"&gt;{{Cite news|last= Freund|first= Michael|title= Muslim pro-Israel activist threatened | newspaper = The Jerusalem Post|date=January 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sarah | last = Nasser | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-116131837.html | title = A pro-Israel Muslim speaks out | newspaper = The Jerusalem Post | date = December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bangladesh, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, editor of the ''Weekly Blitz'' newspaper and self described "Muslim Zionist", was attacked and beaten in 2006 by a mob of nearly 40 people, leaving him with a fractured ankle.

In 2011, Alaa Alsaegh, a Muslim from Iraq who posted online a poem expressing support for Jewish people in Israel, was reportedly attacked in St. Louis, with a Star of David being carved into his back.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Zoga.

Mohammad Zoabi, a self-described Muslim Zionist from [[Nazareth]] who has voiced strong support for Israel, decided to take a break from social media and keep a low profile after he reportedly received death threats from fellow Arab Israelis.

{{Planned World Trade Center}}
'''Park51''' (originally named '''Cordoba House''') is a development that was originally envisioned as a 13-story [[Islamic]] [[community center]] and [[mosque]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The developers hoped to promote an [[interfaith dialog]]ue within the greater community. Due to its proposed location two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], it was widely and controversially referred to as the "'''Ground Zero mosque'''".&lt;ref name=CSM2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zraick|first1=Karen|last2=Dobnik|first2=Verena|title=Ground zero mosque opened to public Wednesday|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|accessdate=19 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 22, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221130220/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|archivedate=21 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project would replace an existing 1850s building of [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] that was damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The original design was by [[Michel Abboud]], principal of SOMA Architects, who wrestled for months with the challenge of making the building fit naturally into its lower Manhattan surroundings: on the one hand, it should have a contemporary design, and, at the same time, it should look Islamic. His design included a 500-seat auditorium, theater, [[performing arts center]], [[fitness center]], swimming pool, basketball court, childcare area, bookstore, [[culinary school]], art studio, food court, and memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. It also included a prayer space for the Muslim community, which would accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.

In late September 2011, a temporary {{convert|4000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} Islamic center opened in renovated space at the Park51 location. In summer 2014, it was announced that there would instead be a 3-story museum with a prayer space, as well as condos, at 49-51 Park Place. The plans were changed again in September 2015, when the owner announced a {{convert|667|ft|m|adj=on}}, 70-story luxury condominium building at the site. In May 2016, financing was secured for a 43-story condominium building with room for an Islamic cultural museum.

The project was originally called Cordoba House, then renamed Park51, in reference to the street address on Park Place.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Later, the Imam leading the project introduced some ambiguity by again referring to the project as "Cordoba House".&lt;ref name="nytimes7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|title=Building on Faith|author=Feisal Abdul Rauf|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506002307/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park51 website then clarified that Park51 is the community center, while Cordoba House is the "interfaith and religious component of the center".&lt;ref name="amira1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan Amira |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |title=Ground Zero Mosque Gets Less Muslim-Invasion-Sounding Name |work=New York |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719020940/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |archivedate=July 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes7"/&gt;

Cordoba Initiative said the name "Cordoba House" was meant to invoke [[Caliphate of Córdoba|8th–11th century]] [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], Spain, which they called a model of [[La Convivencia|peaceful coexistence]] among [[Al-Andalus|Muslims]], [[Mozarab|Christians]], and [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews]].&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lexington-5Aug"&gt;{{cite news|author=Editorial|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16743239|title=Build that mosque: The campaign against the proposed Cordoba centre in New York is unjust and dangerous|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2010|work=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819033331/http://economist.com/node/16743239|archivedate=August 19, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the name was chosen because Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a center of learning in Córdoba together.&lt;ref name="Lexington-5Aug"/&gt; The name was criticized; for example, [[Newt Gingrich]] said that it was "a deliberately insulting term" that symbolizes the Muslim conquerors' victory over Christian Spaniards, and noted that the Muslims had converted a Cordoba church into the third largest [[mosque]] in the world.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newt.org/newt-direct/newt-gingrich-statement-proposed-mosqueislamic-community-center-near-ground-zero |title=Newt Gingrich Statement on Proposed Mosque/Islamic Community Center near Ground Zero |work=Newt Direct|date=July 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820114339/http://www.newt.org/newt-direct/newt-gingrich-statement-proposed-mosqueislamic-community-center-near-ground-zero|archivedate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Raymond Ibrahim]], a former associate director of the [[Middle East Forum]], said the project and name were not "a gesture of peace and interfaith dialogue" but were "allusive of Islamic conquest and consolidation" and that Americans should realize that mosques are not "Muslim counterparts to Christian churches" but rather, "are symbols of domination and centers of radicalization".

The two buildings were connected internally, with common walls having been taken down. El-Gamal informed Con Ed in February 2010 that he wanted to exercise his purchase option on the lease. Although the price was reportedly estimated at $10–$20 million, El-Gamal said the cost "is not an issue".&lt;ref name="nypost3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/half_baked_mosque_8ItuaW0WIByZa5xZ0rCmpJ#ixzz0w1QbwRx5|title=Half-baked mosque|author1=Isabel Vincent|date=August 8, 2010|work=New York Post|accessdate=August 8, 2010|author2=Melissa Klein|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was to be reviewed by the [[New York Public Service Commission]], where it might face a vote by a five-member board controlled by the New York governor's office.&lt;ref name="nymag1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nypost3" /&gt;

The specific location of the planned facility, "where a piece of the wreckage fell", so close to the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], was a primary selling point for the Muslims who bought the building. Rauf said it "sends the opposite statement to what happened on 9/11" and "We want to push back against the extremists."&lt;ref name="nyt-2009-12-09" /&gt;

===Planned facilities===
While the media widely described the center as a mosque, and the protests were against the mosque, the Initiative's official blog portrayed it as a community center with prayer space, making comparisons to the [[YMCA]] or [[Jewish Community Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Community Center?|url=http://cordobainitiative.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/what-is-a-community-center/|date=July 1, 2010|publisher=The Cordoba Initiative|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative said that some services planned for Park51 such as the restaurant and performance center, disqualify it from being a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Prayer Space?|url=http://cordobainitiative.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/what-is-prayer-space/|publisher=The Cordoba Initiative|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Khan, Imam Rauf's wife and partner, in August 2010 also said:

The board's chairwoman, [[Julie Menin]], supported deletion of references to the building as a mosque and interfaith center that were in an earlier draft of the resolution, saying: "I personally was uncomfortable with the language that talked about the religious institution.

The meeting where the vote was held was contentious. Some of the speakers supporting the project were Muslims who lost family members in the attacks, and were booed by protesters.

===Landmark status declined and litigation===
As the controversy grew New York City's [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] agreed to reconsider the 1980s landmark application which it had not acted on previously. On August 3, 2010, it voted 9–0 against granting landmark status and historic protection to the building.

On July 10, 2011, Justice Paul G.

[[Adam Leitman Bailey]], the lawyer who represented the Islamic center's developer [[pro bono]], called the decision "a victory for America" and said, "Despite the tempest of religious hatred, the judge flexed our Constitution's muscles enforcing the very bedrock of our democracy."

In an interview September 8, 2010 Abdul Rauf was asked if he would have done anything differently had he known the controversy would erupt.

===Effects on recruitment of radical Islamists===
Counterterrorism analysts have noted that the developing controversy over Park51 has provided a "recruitment opportunity" for radical Islamist groups. According to Evan Kohlmann, the senior partner in the New York-based security firm Flashpoint Global Partners, "[t]he reaction is, at least on the part of extremists, fairly gleeful – that America is playing into our hands, that America is revealing its ugly face, and that even if it doesn't further radicalize people in the Middle East, there's no doubt that it will radicalize a kind of a key constituency that al-Qaida and other extremists are seeking to covet{{Sic}}, seeking to court, which is the small number of homegrown extremists here in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gary Thomas |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |title=Radical Islamists Try to Exploit Islamophobia |publisher=Voice of America |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830202224/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' quotes a [[Taliban]] operative as explicitly connecting increased opposition to the project with increased support for the Taliban's cause. "By preventing this mosque from being built, America is doing us a big favor," the Taliban operative stated. "It's providing us with more recruits, donations, and popular support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sami Yousafzai |author2=Ron Moreau |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |title=The Taliban vs. the Mosque |work=Newsweek |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902031055/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary===
In 2012, filmmaker David Osit produced a documentary about the Park51 controversy, specifically following the story through the experiences of developer Sharif El-Gamal. The film aired on [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]] in the fall of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itvs.org/films/building-babel |title='Building Babel – ITVS' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062836/http://www.itvs.org/films/building-babel |archivedate=2014-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polls===
[[File:Ground Zero Mosque Protesters 10.jpg|thumb|Opponents of Park51 protest on August 22, 2010.]]

Some polls tried to gauge public opinion of Muslims' right to build Park51 near ground zero. The [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll of New York State residents released August 31, 2010 found a 54–40 percent majority of voters agreeing 'that because of American freedom of religion, Muslims have the right to build the mosque near Ground Zero'.&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; A Fox News national poll taken August 10–11, 2010 found that 61% felt that the project developers had a right to build a mosque there (a majority of Democrats (63–32%), Republicans (57–36%), and Independents (69–29%).&lt;ref name="foxpolldata"/&gt; The [[Economist]]/YouGov poll taken the week of August 19, 2010 concurred that Democrats (57.5–24.9%) and Independents (62.3–25.2%) believed Muslims had a "constitutional right" to build a mosque at the site, but found that Republicans (31.8–53.2%) did not believe that Muslims had such a right. The poll found that 50.2%, overall, supported the constitutional right to build at the site, 32.7% were opposed and 17.1% had no opinion.&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

The Economist/YouGov poll also noted that 52% of Americans believe that "Muslims should be able to build mosques in the United States wherever other religions can build houses of worship", as opposed to 34% who believe that "there are some places in the United States where it is not appropriate to build mosques, though it would be appropriate to build other houses of worship" and 14% who believe "mosques should not be permitted anywhere in the United States".&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

===Opposition===

The prospect of building a mosque close to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] was offensive to some opponents of the construction project, since the hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] identified as Muslim.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt;  [[Newt Gingrich]] declared: "There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt;

====9/11 families====
Some relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks said they found the proposal offensive because the perpetrators who committed the attacks did so in the name of Islam.&lt;ref name="nydailynews2"/&gt; A number said that it was not an issue of freedom of religion, property rights, or racism, but rather one of sensitivity to the families of those killed, in choosing the specific location of the center.

A group of victims' relatives, 9/11 Families for a Safe &amp; Strong America, called the proposal "a gross insult to the memory of those who were killed on that terrible day".&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; [[Debra Burlingame]], a co-founder of the group whose brother died in the attacks, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a place which is {{convert|600|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} from where almost 3,000 people were torn to pieces by Islamic extremists... it is incredibly insensitive and audacious ... for them to build a mosque ... so that they could be in proximity to where that atrocity happened ...

[[Sally Regenhard]], whose son was a firefighter who was killed in the attacks, and who has testified before Congress on 9/11, said that the center would be "sacrilege on sacred ground", and that "People are being accused of being anti-Muslim and racist, but this is simply a matter of sensitivity."&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lisa Miller |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |title=War Over Ground Zero |magazine=Newsweek |date=August 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811004701/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Fire Department of New York|NY Fire Department]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches, whose son Jim was killed, said: "I don't want to have to go down to a memorial where my son died on 9/11, and look at a mosque," adding "this is all about location, location, location.

====Muslims====
The building of an Islamic community center near Ground Zero has been criticized by some Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] does not directly oppose the building of a mosque near ground zero but views that the sentiments of non-Muslims should not be unduly hurt. They state that there are other places where mosques can be built and they do not see why that particular location has been chosen.&lt;ref name="movemosque"/&gt; The head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]] in London, stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a mosque is built at the proposed site, then the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community would like to see churches, synagogues, Hindu places of worship and places of worship of all other religions also built near Ground Zero. That would be a good example of how from an act of evil and terror has emerged unity and peace.&lt;ref name="movemosque"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/08/23/michael-goodwin-ground-zero-mosque-obama-pelosi-rima-fakih-muslims-howard-dean |title=Good News – The 'Move the Mosque' Movement Is Growing |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=Fox News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914195513/http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/08/23/michael-goodwin-ground-zero-mosque-obama-pelosi-rima-fakih-muslims-howard-dean/ |archivedate=September 14, 2010 |df= }}/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LAzT6FJs0 |title=The Holy Qur'an:the Truth Revealed Part 2 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212003741/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LAzT6FJs0 |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another founding member of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, Zuhdi Jasser, who is also the founder of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], a group of Muslim professionals in the Phoenix Valley of Arizona, strongly opposed the project, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For us, a mosque was always a place to pray...not a way to make an ostentatious architectural statement. ''Ground Zero'' shouldn't be about promoting Islam. It's the place where war was declared on us as Americans."&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; ... American freedom of religion is a right, but … it is not right to make one's religion a global political statement with a towering Islamic edifice that casts a shadow over the memorials of Ground Zero. … Islamists in 'moderate' disguise are still Islamists. In their own more subtle ways, the WTC mosque organizers end up serving the same aims (as) separatist and supremacist wings of political Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Scholar: Don't Build Islamic Center |publisher=CBS News |date=September 11, 2010 |url=http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821235121/http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neda Bolourchi, a Muslim whose mother died in 9/11, said: "I fear it would become a symbol of victory for militant Muslims around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |author=Neda Bolourchi |title=A Muslim Victim of 9/11: 'Build your Mosque Somewhere Else{{'-}} |work=The Washington Post |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811032547/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors [[Raheel Raza]] and [[Tarek Fatah]], board members of the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York currently boasts at least 30 mosques so it's not as if there is pressing need to find space for worshipers. [W]e Muslims know ... [this] mosque is meant to be a deliberate provocation to thumb our noses at the infidel. The proposal has been made in bad faith, ... as ''[[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]'', meaning "mischief-making" that is clearly forbidden in the Koran.... As Muslims we are dismayed that our co-religionists have such little consideration for their fellow citizens, and wish to rub salt in their wounds and pretend they are applying a balm to soothe the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raheel Raza |author2=Tarek Fatah |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief+Manhattan/3370303/story.html |title=Mischief in Manhattan |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=August 9, 2010 |archivedate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818091927/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief%2BManhattan/3370303/story.html |accessdate=January 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akbar Ahmed]], Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at [[American University]], while noting that blaming all Muslims for 9/11 was "ridiculous", said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I don't think the Muslim leadership has fully appreciated the impact of 9/11 on America. They assume Americans have forgotten 9/11 and even, in a profound way, forgiven 9/11, and that has not happened. The wounds remain largely open [...] and when wounds are raw, an episode like constructing a house of worship – even one protected by the Constitution, protected by law – becomes like salt in the wounds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |title=U.S. Muslims underestimate 9/11 effect, Muslim thinker warns |publisher=CNN |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806125639/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |archivedate=August 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid, general manager of [[Al-Arabiya]] television, also criticized the project in a column titled "A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction?" in the Arab daily A-Sharq Al-Awsat, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Muslims do not aspire for a mosque next to the September 11 cemetery...the mosque is not an issue for Muslims, and they have not heard of it until the shouting became loud between the supporters and the objectors, which is mostly an argument between non-Muslim US citizens! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid |url=http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |title=A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction? |work=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]] |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511083703/http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |title=Ground Zero mosque debate swirls in world capitals |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902162513/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rima Fakih]], the first Muslim-American crowned [[Miss USA]] as [[Miss USA 2010]], opposed the project on the grounds of it being insensitive to families of 9/11 victims, telling ''[[Inside Edition]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I totally agree with President Obama with the statement on the constitutional rights of freedom of religion. [But] it shouldn't be so close to the World Trade Center.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have seen very clearly in the past weeks that building a mosque two blocks from ground zero will not promote necessary interfaith dialogue, but will continue to fracture the faiths and citizens of our city and this country.

Democratic Representative Tim Bishop of New York's 1st District also disagrees with the location, "As a New Yorker, I believe Ground Zero is sacred ground and should unite us.

New York City fireman Tim Brown opposed the project, saying: "A mosque ... that's using foreign money from countries with ''[[shariah]]'' law is unacceptable, especially in this neighborhood".

Notable British comedian and internet personality [[Pat Condell]] criticized the construction of Park51 in a video entitled "No mosque at Ground Zero"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Condell |first=Pat |title=No mosque at Ground Zero |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjS0Novt3X4 |publisher=YouTube |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106213158/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjS0Novt3X4 |archivedate=2016-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he claimed that it was representative of Islamic triumphalism and that the United States was soon on the verge of Islamization and have its freedoms trimmed, as Europe has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leiken |first=Robert S. |title=Why Is This Atheist So Smug? |work=Foreign Affairs |date=July 1, 2005 |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60829/robert-s-leiken/europes-angry-muslims |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812013755/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60829/robert-s-leiken/europes-angry-muslims |archivedate=August 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Charles Krauthammer]] also criticized the construction, saying that it could potentially serve as a breeding ground for [[Islamic extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Build the mosque anywhere but Ground Zero |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN |location=New York |work=Daily News |last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819024759/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2010, [[Greg Gutfeld]] stated that he planned on constructing New York City's first Islamic-friendly [[gay bar]] next to the proposed center. He stated that "As an American, I believe they have every right to build the mosque. [...] Which is, why, in the spirit of outreach, I've decided to do the same thing." He insisted that "this is not a joke," and further stated that the project was "an effort to break down barriers and reduce deadly [[homophobia]] in the Islamic world."&lt;ref name="Gutfeld-HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/10/greg-gutfeld-im-opening-g_n_676699.html |title=Fox Newser: I'm Opening Gay Bar Next To Mosque |date=August 10, 2010 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2010/08/11/glenn-beck-greg-gutfeld-wants-to-build-gay-bar-next-to-ground-zero-mosque/ |title=Glenn Beck: Greg Gutfeld Wants To Build Gay Bar Next To 'Ground Zero' Mosque |date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2010/08/19/left-tired-response-to-ground-zero-mosque/ |title=Left's Tired Response To Ground Zero Mosque |author=Greg Gutfeld |date=August 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/erecting_gay_bar_next_door_osyp6MY8mcK7BOgycwbyhN |title= Erecting a gay bar next door to Park51 |author=Jennifer Fermino |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date= August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===

Project supporters have argued that the Park51 building would not be visible from the World Trade Center site,&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt; and that some victims and victims' families have expressed support for the Park51 project, as well as acknowledging the fact that victims of the 9/11 attacks also included Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-09-03-1Amuslims911_CV_N.htm |title=For families of Muslim 9/11 victims, a new pain |author=Rick Hampton |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====9/11 families====
Some relatives of victims of the 9/11 attacks expressed support for the project. Colleen Kelley, who lost her brother William on 9/11, says, the "irony in the debate over the section of the building that would house a mosque is that one might assume that God (the same God to Jews-Christians-Muslims) would be pleased with any type of effort that involves prayer and service to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |title=Not All 9-11 Families Oppose The Mosque |date=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185609/http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orlando Rodriguez and Phyllis Schaefer Rodriguez, whose son died in the attack, say they "support the building of the Islamic community center in lower Manhattan" and "feel that it would honor our son and other victims".&lt;ref name=InOurSonsName&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inoursonsname.com/islamiccenter.html |title=Islamic center meant to foster peace, understanding |date=August 17, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ApQC0D2v?url=http://www.inoursonsname.com/islamiccenter.html |archivedate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herb Ouida, whose son Todd died, said: "To say that we're going to condemn a religion and castigate a billion people in the world because they're Muslims, to say that they shouldn't have the ability to pray near the World Trade Center – I don't think that's going to bring people together and cross the divide."&lt;ref name="aolnews1"/&gt;

Marvin Bethea, a former EMS worker who was forced to retire in 2004 because of breathing problems caused by working at the 9/11 site, believes racism is a factor in the controversy, He said "even though my life has changed, I don't hate the Muslims. Especially being a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against. I've lived with that."&lt;ref name="aolnews1" /&gt;

Donna O'Connor, whose pregnant daughter died on 9/11, expressed the opinion that "This building will serve as an emblem for the rest of the world that Americans ... recognize that the evil acts of a few must never damn the innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/aug/06/ed-damaj06-ar-414971/ |title=Damaj: To Build or Not to Build a New Mosque in New York |author=M.

[[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]], former [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] in the George W. Bush administration, whose wife, television commentator [[Barbara Olson]], died in the plane that crashed into [[the Pentagon]], has expressed support for the rights of the Park51 organizers to construct the new site. In remarks on [[MSNBC]], Olson said "we don't want to turn an act of hate against us by extremists into an act of intolerance for people of religious faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/08/tedolsonmosque.html/ |title=Ted Olson Joins NYC Mosque Debate |author=Brian Baxter |work=The AmLaw Daily |date=August 18, 2010 |postscript= |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922221509/http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/08/tedolsonmosque.html |archivedate=September 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ted Olson, Former Bush Solicitor General And Husband Of 9/11 Victim, Backs Obama On 'Ground Zero Mosque' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/liz-cheneys-keep-america-_n_686697.html |date=August 18, 2010 |author=Nick Wing |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |postscript= |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821112433/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/liz-cheneys-keep-america-_n_686697.html |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Wallace, whose nephew died as he rushed in to help the victims, says "the media seems eager to trumpet the feelings of those hurt by the idea of the center. They mostly ignore my feelings and those, like me, who feel the center is an important step for Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://121contact.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/08/aug-8-2010-ground-zero-mosque-and-media-distortion-of-feelings.html |title='Ground Zero Mosque' and the media's distortion of feelings |date=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717120913/http://121contact.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/08/aug-8-2010-ground-zero-mosque-and-media-distortion-of-feelings.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Keane, whose husband was killed on 9/11, says "To punish a group of Americans who live in peace for the acts of a few is wrong. The worst atrocities in history found their base in fear of those who were different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/letters/hc-le-keane-mosque-0817-20100817,0,7313519.story |title=Fear Is No Reason To Prohibit Islamic Culture Center |date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talat Hamdani, whose son was a first responder in the rescue effort and died in 9/11, co-wrote an article supporting the center in the interest of pluralism.&lt;ref name="newsweek1"/&gt; She has also criticized the argument about sensitivity arguing that it was more about the legality of the situation and "our rights as Americans. We are protected under the Constitution. There is freedom of religion." Implying that the ban could be the thin edge of the wedge she said "You know, if it's one faith today, it's going to be another faith tomorrow. That is scary. And to scapegoat the Muslims for the acts of a foreign terrorist, that is – that is hatred." She went on "...&amp;nbsp;if that argument is valid, then, by that token, [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s actions also makes all Christians terrorists. So, that is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/18/as_gop_and_some_top_dems |title=As GOP and Some Top Dems Unite in Opposing NY Islamic Community Center, a Roundtable Discussion with Mother of 9/11 Victim, Rabbi, Muslim Lawmaker and Islamic Scholar |work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821060206/http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/18/as_gop_and_some_top_dems |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-war group [[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]], released a statement in support of the center, saying "we believe that welcoming the Center, which is intended to promote interfaith tolerance and respect, is consistent with fundamental American values of freedom and justice for all," adding it will be "an emblem for the rest of the world that Americans stand against violence, intolerance, and overt acts of racism and that we recognize that the evil acts of a few must never damn the innocent".&lt;ref name="boston3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977 |title=9/11 Families Group Announces Support for Islamic Cultural Center in Lower Manhattan |date=May 20, 2010 |publisher=[[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528022831/http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977 |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2010, in a speech at the annual White House [[Iftar]] dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of [[Ramadan]], President [[Barack Obama]] acknowledged the right of Muslims to build the Islamic center.

New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] strongly endorsed the project, saying that Ground Zero was a "very appropriate place" for a mosque, because it "tells the world" that the U.S. has freedom of religion for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dorothy Rabinowitz |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703545604575407160266158170 |title=Liberal Piety and the Memory of 9/11; The enlightened class can't understand why the public is uneasy about the Ground Zero mosque |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725035032/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703545604575407160266158170 |archivedate=July 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to opposition, he said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The government should never, never be in the business of telling people how they should pray, or where they can pray.

Bloomberg was asked if he was satisfied that "he is indeed a man of peace given his background where he's supposedly supported Hamas, blamed the U.S. for 9/11 attacks?" The mayor responded: 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;My job is not to vet clergy in this city.... Everybody has a right to their opinions.

Former Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] gave his support to Park51, arguing that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] allows for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero. Ventura also argued that denying the right for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero would be similar to removing churches from [[Oklahoma City]], where the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] occurred (the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to 9/11), if [[Timothy McVeigh]], the man who perpetrated the attack, was a Christian. Ventura also demanded that opposition to the Ground Zero Mosque should be ignored because "people need to remember, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be written in stone. You cannot subject them to the popularity. They are there to protect unpopular things, like the First Amendment. The First Amendment is to protect unpopular speech simply because popular speech doesn't need to be protected. It's as simple as that. And you can't, you know, bend the Constitution to the blowing winds of whatever polls might say, otherwise it's a worthless, useless document which in many ways they're turning it to that anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcripts |url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061424/http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen]], professor of Jewish Civilization in the Near East in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], opined that "The presence of ... mosques like the one planned near Ground Zero, which will be an educational center as well as a place of prayer, is one good way of transcending ... ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark R.

Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis, of the [[University of North Texas]] Jewish Studies Program said that when it comes to the issue of freedom to practice religion in a private sphere, such as on a piece of private property in Lower Manhattan, [[freedom of religion]] is virtually inviolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/07/texas-faith-is-a-mosque-at-gro.html |title=Texas Faith: Is a mosque at Ground Zero religious freedom too far? |author=Wayne Slater |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723144149/http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/07/texas-faith-is-a-mosque-at-gro.html |archivedate=July 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]], argued that prayer leads to peace: "Build a Muslim house of prayer near Ground Zero? ... Hand me the shovel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Padraic O'Hare |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/house_of_prayer_near_ground_zero_yes.html |title=Guest Voices: House of prayer near Ground Zero?

During a CNN interview, [[Reza Aslan]], a professor of creative writing at the [[University of California, Riverside]], defended Imam Abdul Rauf as "cited by government's sources in the United States as one of America's most pluralistic peace promoting religious leaders in the country". He defended the center as an "American-Muslim" center similar to the Jewish center built close to it.&lt;ref name=CNN_debate&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/14/ec.01.html CAMPBELL BROWN: Mosque at Ground Zero?; NAACP Versus Tea Party; Deport Abuse Victims?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622085811/http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/14/ec.01.html |date=2011-06-22 }}, ''[[CNN News]]'', July 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[microbiome]] research, a group of [[species]] is said to show a '''phylosymbiotic''' signal if the degree of similarity between the species' microbiomes recapitulates to a significant extent their [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W. Brooks|first1=Andrew|title=Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History|journal=PLOS Biology|date=November 18, 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000225.g004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a phylosymbiotic signal among a group of species is evident if their microbiome similarity [[dendrogram]] could significantly
recapitulate their hosts phylogenic tree. For the analysis of the phylosymbiotic signal to be reliable, environmental differences
that could shape the host microbiome should be either eliminated or accounted for.
One plausible mechanistic explanation for such phenomena could be, for example, a result of host immune genes that rapidly evolve in a continues [[arms race]] with members of its microbiome.

Dr. '''Ray Neff''' was a health sciences professor at [[Indiana State University]] with a chemistry background. He was a leading proponent of an alternative theory about the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his killer, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Neff died on September 11, 2009. His wife, Augusta, accompanied him on his research trips. She was a frequent witness to his findings and is referred to in the notes of ''Dark Union'' [see below] when he uses ''we'' to describe or recount discoveries or findings. Augusta died on December 30, 2013. They are buried together in Marshall, Illinois. 

Neff is the co-author of ''Dark Union'' along with Leonard Guttridge, a writer of numerous other histories, many dealing with exploration and discovery. The book proposes an alternative view to the conventional version of Lincoln's assassination. While it mentions the theory that Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] was involved in the assassination conspiracy, the book dismisses it and suggests that [[John Wilkes Booth]] took on the role of assassin largely for personal reasons.  ''Dark Union'' also contends that Booth escaped, eventually settling in India, as it was James W. Boyd who was actually shot in the barn at Garrett's farm. Documents in a collection housed at [[Indiana State University]] and donated by Neff and Guttridge deal, in part, with the subject matter of ''Dark Union''. The theory advanced in the book is in marked contrast with the version of the assassination proposed by [[Edward Steers, Jr.]]

Neff is also one of many historians who traces the roots of Lincoln's assassination to the [[Dahlgren Affair]], one of the very few areas where he and Steers agree.

Ray Neff was the editor or author of other works. For example, he published a well-received family history and edited a new edition of Civil War memoirs written by Lafayette C. Baker. A book by Neff, ''China Gold'', was issued after his death by his son Robert and made available on Amazon.com. Neff never intended for this book to be published, as he felt it needed extensive revision. It deals only indirectly with any of the people mentioned in ''Dark Union''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24576">The '''Society of American Archivists''' is the oldest and largest [[archivist]] [[Voluntary association|association]] in [[North America]], serving the [[education]]al and [[information]]al needs of more than 5,000 individual archivist and institutional members. Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archivists.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as [[Encoded Archival Description]], the [[digitizing]] of archival materials, and [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]] and [[art conservation|conservation]] of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.

== History ==
The Society of American Archivist was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the [[American Historical Association]]. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The [[American Library Association]] created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=J. Frank|date=1983|title=The Blessings of Providence on an Association of Archivists|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/stable/pdf/40292896.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:4934456010e1ec9aa125fd478c5bf163|journal=The American Archivist|volume=46|pages=374–399}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by [[Margaret Cross Norton]] and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland-Swetland|first=Luke|date=1991|title=The  Provenance  of  a  Profession: The  Permanence  of  the  Public Archives  and  Historical Manuscripts  Traditions  in American  Archival  History|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=54|pages=160–175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first issue of the Society's journal, the [[American Archivist|''American Archivist'',]] appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents.&lt;ref name="&amp;quot;Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt to R.D.W. Connor&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1942|title=News Notes|journal=American Archivist|publisher=Society of American Archivists|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the [[International Council on Archives]] and an archives for the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A number of committees focused on various interests of the Society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the Society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with [[National Association of State Libraries]] over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.

By the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archives Power: Memory, Accountability, and Social Justice|last=Jimerson|first=Randall|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2009|isbn=1-931666-30-X|location=Chicago|pages=76–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social historians like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Sam Bass Warner]] brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 1980s, a large portion of the Society's focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and a standard for encoding archival [[finding aid]]s, allowing them to be made accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/das|title=Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Curriculum and Certificate Program {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018-2020, which outlined 4 major goal areas for the future. The 4 goal areas are advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/strategic-plan|title=SAA Strategic Plan {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
On top of book publications, SAA offers the following regular publications:

* ''[[American Archivist]]'': the peer-reviewed scholarly journal of SAA. Published semi-annually, it aims to cover theoretical and practical aspects of the profession, cultural, legal, technological, as well as social issues surrounding collecting, preserving, and accessing archival records and materials through journal articles, case studies, and product reviews.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/node/20534|title=Publications {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Archival Outlook'': formally the ''SAA Newsletter''. Started in the 1970s, the newsletter is published 6 times a year and focuses on best practices of the profession, day to day concerns of the archivist, and updates on organization business.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* ''In the Loop'': bi-weekly e-newsletter that offers updates on SAA activities and interests.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Awards Offered ==
The Society recognizes archivists' achievements with awards for advocacy, writing, and contributions to the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/recognition#.V6OCWvkrKM8|title=Awards Competition|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest honor is that of [[:Category:Fellows of the Society of American Archivists|Fellow]], a distinction awarded since 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/governance/handbook/section12-fellows#.V6OCJPkrKM8|title=Fellows of the Society of American Archivists|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, there is a new Distinguished Fellows Class, which cannot exceed 5% of the total SAA membership in a given year.

[[File:Stanley Elkins.jpg|thumb|Stanley M. Elkins]]
'''Stanley M. Elkins''' (April 27, 1925 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] - September 16, 2013 in [[Leeds, Massachusetts]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/gazettenet/obituary.aspx?n=Stanley-M-Elkins&amp;pid=167001369 www.legacy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[historian]], best known for his controversial comparison of [[slavery in the United States]] to [[Nazi concentration camps]], and for his collaborations (in a book and numerous articles) with [[Eric McKitrick]] regarding the early American Republic.  He obtained his BA from Harvard University using GI bill scholarship, Ph.D. in history from [[Columbia University]] and taught at the [[University of Chicago]], spending most of his career as a professor of history at [[Smith College]].

==Career==
Elkins was born in Boston to Frank and Frances Elkins (née Reiner).  He attended [[Boston English High School]] and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943, serving in the 36th{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Should this be '32nd', '36th' or something else?}} Infantry Regiment, fighting in France but primarily Italy during World War II. He served as initially a Scout and later a Prisoner Transport Guard (of German POWs). After the war, he married Dorothy Adele Lamken and attended [[Harvard University]] on the [[GI Bill]] (A.B. 1949), followed by Columbia University for graduate school in American history (M.A. 1951, Ph.D. 1958), where he studied under [[Richard Hofstadter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/gazettenet/obituary.aspx?n=stanley-m-elkins&amp;pid=167001369 Obituary: Stanley M. Elkins (1925-2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;  He and fellow graduate student [[Eric McKitrick]] received a joint appointment as assistant professors of history at the [[University of Chicago]], where they taught from 1955 to 1960.  In 1960 he joined the faculty at [[Smith College]], where he was appointed the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor Emeritus of History from 1969 until his death in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/history/faculty_elkins.php Smith College History Faculty: Stanley Elkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903123141/http://www.smith.edu/history/faculty_elkins.php |date=2013-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sambo thesis==
''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959), based on Elkins' doctoral dissertation at [[Columbia University]], was theoretically innovative and enormously influential in the years after its publication, although its arguments are largely superseded today.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Elkins made two major, and controversial, arguments in ''Slavery''. The first was that American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] undercut their own effectiveness by their insistence on ideological consistency and purity, and their refusal to compromise with the slave system. Elkins contrasted them with British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] who, he argued, were more pragmatic and therefore more politically effective; he noted that Britain had abolished slavery without war.

Elkins's second argument was that the experience of slavery was psychologically infantilizing to slaves, making them follow what he controversially called the "[[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]" model. He based his arguments on then-recent sociological and psychological research by [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and others on inmates of [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[World War II]], showing that the totalitarian environment systematically destroyed their ability to resist, to plan, and to form positive relationships with one another. Elkins speculated that antebellum slavery was a similar environment and instilled an infantilized, dependent personality pattern. One implication, only partially spelled out in Elkins's account, was that this personality pattern might persist in his own time, a century after the end of slavery. Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960s when [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] supported [[affirmative action]] programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture.

Thirdly Elkins argued that slavery in North America was strikingly different than in Latin America, a theme originated by historian [[Frank Tannenbaum]] regarding Brazil. That is, the [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] model did not appear in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://columba11.blogspot.com/2006/03/stanley-elkins-slavery-americas-thesis.html " Stanley Elkins' Slavery: The Americas Thesis and the Denial of the Soul ", March 19, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Age of Federalism''==
''The Age of Federalism: The Early Republic, 1788-1800'',  co-authored by Elkins and [[Eric McKitrick]], was described as a "dazzling book," featuring an "elegant and penetrating pen portrait of [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200404/noteworthy |title=The Atlantic: New &amp; Noteworthy |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803183516/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200404/noteworthy |archivedate=August 3, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;''The Age of Federalism'' won the [[Bancroft Prize]]. The book explores the  history of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist party]], discusses the relationships among key players, among them [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Jay]], and Alexander Hamilton, and analyzes the administrations of [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]].

==Criticism==
Initially ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' was heralded by the black community as an important and positive contribution, but subsequently the comparison of black slavery and Nazi concentration camps was considered offensive by many descendants of both oppressed groups. The controversy is discussed by Ann Lane in her 1971 compilation: ''The Debate Over Slavery, Stanley Elkins and His Critics''. Other historians began challenging Elkins's thesis, particularly [[John Wesley Blassingame|John W. Blassingame]]'s ''[[The Slave Community|The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South]]'' (1972).

The '''Talpiot Tomb''' (or '''Talpiyot Tomb''') is a [[rock-cut tomb]] discovered in 1980 in the [[East Talpiot]] neighborhood, five kilometers (three miles) south of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] in [[East Jerusalem]]. It contained ten [[ossuary|ossuaries]], six inscribed with [[Epigraphy|epigraph]]s, including one interpreted as "''Yeshua bar Yehosef''" ("Joshua, son of Joseph"), though the inscription is partially illegible, and its translation and interpretation is widely disputed.&lt;ref name="heiser"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heiser |first=Michael |title=Evidence Real and Imagined: Thinking Clearly About the "Jesus Family Tomb" |url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/Jesus%20Tomb%20article%20Heiser.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-06-08 |pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb also yielded various human remains and several carvings.

The Talpiot discovery was documented in 1994 in "Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries in the Collections of the State of Israel" numbers 701-709, and first discussed in the media in the [[United Kingdom]] during March/April 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Times Tomb Story |url=http://orion.huji.ac.il/orion/archives/1996a/msg00156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year an article describing the find was published in volume 29 of ''Atiqot'', the journal of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]]. A controversial documentary film, ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', was produced in 2007 by director [[James Cameron]] and investigative journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]], and was released in conjunction with a book by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino|Charles Pellegrino]] titled ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]''.  The book and film make the case that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, members of his extended family, and several other figures from the [[New Testament]]—and, by inference, that Jesus had not risen from the dead as the New Testament describes. This conclusion is disputed by many [[archaeologists]], [[theologians]], and linguistic and [[Bible|biblical]] scholars.&lt;ref name="heiser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="milstein"/&gt;

==History==
{{Death of Jesus}}
The archaeological team that excavated the tomb in 1980 determined it to be from the [[Second Temple]]-[[Herod's Temple|Herodian]] period,&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Bible - Revised Standard Version'', Dictionary p.30 (Melton Book Co., 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted from about 538 BC to AD 70. Typical of the area, a tomb of this type would be assumed to have belonged to a wealthy Jewish family. About 900 similar tombs have been unearthed in the same area.&lt;ref name="milstein"&gt;{{cite news |last=Milstein |first=Mati |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-jesus-tomb_2.html |title=Jesus' tomb claim slammed by scholars |publisher=National Geographic News |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and excavation==
The tomb was discovered on March 28, 1980, by construction workers laying the foundations for an apartment complex,&lt;ref name="tabor"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Passover in 1980 |last=Tabor|first=James |url=http://jesusdynasty.com/blog/2007/03/21/passover-1980/ |work=The Jesus Dynasty Blog |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103601/http://www.jesusdynasty.com/blog/2007/03/21/passover-1980/ |archivedate=13 July 2011}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when preparatory demolition work accidentally uncovered the tomb's entrance. The site was visited the next day by [[Amos Kloner]], the area supervisor for the [[Israel Antiquities Authority|Israel Department of Antiquities]] (IDA, now the Israel Antiquities Authority, or IAA.) Kloner drew up a set of preliminary sketches and requested a permit for a [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] to be directed by Yosef Gat. The permit was issued Monday, March 31, but work actually began the day before.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; Although it has been said that the team was given only three days to complete the work,&lt;ref name="laidlaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/185708 |title=Jesus tomb claim sparks furor |last=Laidlaw |first=Stuart |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gat's notes indicate that the work proceeded "intermittently" until its official end on April 11, with most of the work completed within the first two days.

Construction of the apartment buildings was completed in 1982. The children of Tova Bracha, a local resident, managed to get into the tomb and play inside. Bracha notified the authorities, who sealed the entrance for safety reasons.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paz |first=Shelly |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/E-Talpiot-residents-adjust-to-possibility-theyre-Jesuss-neighbors |title=E. Talpiot residents adjust to possibility they're Jesus's neighbors |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=February 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children found some discarded Jewish religious texts that had been placed in the tomb, which was being used as a [[genizah]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The tomb, which is not open to the public, is located in a courtyard on [[Dov Gruner]] Street, down a flight of stairs at the corner of [[Olei Hagardom]] and Avshalom Haviv Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewyeshua.com/articles/yeshua_tomb.html |last=Gordon |first=Nehemia |title=The Tomb of Yeshua son of Joseph in "East Talpiot" |accessdate=2007-06-08}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reopened in 2005 by Jacobovici, without permission from the Antiques Authority, during filming of his documentary ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', and resealed by officials shortly thereafter.   In 2008 Ruth Gat, the widow of the archaeologist who supervised the original excavation, claimed that her husband kept the discovery a secret until the mid-1990s because he feared a wave of [[antisemitism]] would ensue if the tomb's existence was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Lis |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Widow: Archeologist Kept 'Jesus Tomb' Discovery Secret for Fear of anti-Semitism |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/widow-archeologist-kept-jesus-tomb-discovery-secret-for-fear-of-anti-semitism-1.237411 |work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The tomb is carved from the solid [[limestone]] [[bedrock]].&lt;ref name="nissenbaum"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nissenbaum |first=Dion |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660198991,00.html |title='Lost Tomb' documentary jeered |publisher=McClatchy Newspapers |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within are six [[kokhim]], or burial shafts and two ''[[arcosolium|arcosolia]]'', or arched shelves where a body could be laid out for entombment. The ossuaries were found within the shafts.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt;

==Artifacts==

===Ossuaries===
Ten limestone&lt;ref name="nissenbaum"/&gt; [[ossuary|ossuaries]] were found, with six of them bearing epigraphs&lt;ref name="milstein"/&gt; although only four of them were recognized as such in the field.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; The archaeological team determined the ossuaries to be of little note, and delivered them to the [[Rockefeller Museum]] for analysis and storage.

According to Jacobovici, Cameron, and religious studies professor [[James Tabor]], one of the unmarked ossuaries later disappeared when it was stored in a courtyard outside the museum.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; This claim has been criticized by both [[Joe Zias]], former [[curator]] of the museum, and Kloner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zias |first=Joe |url=http://www.joezias.com/tomb.html |title=Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb ‘documentary’ to be aired on the Discovery Channel |date=March 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the ten ossuaries contained human remains, said to be in an "advanced state of deterioration" by Amos Kloner.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; The tomb may have been multi-generational, with several generations of bones stored in each ossuary, but no record was kept of their contents&lt;ref name="nathan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nathan |first=Peter |url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/religion-and-spirituality-a-critical-look-inside-the-jesus-tomb-2392.aspx |title=A Critical Look Inside the Jesus Tomb |publisher=Vision Media |date=March 2, 2007 }}{{tertiary source inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no analysis appears to have been done to determine how many individuals were represented by the bones found.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; In addition, three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb below the 0.5 metre fill layer,&lt;ref name="laidlaw" /&gt; and crushed bones were found in the fill upon the arcosolia.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt; The scattering of these bones below the fill indicated that the tomb had been disturbed in antiquity.&lt;ref name="nathan"/&gt; All the bones were eventually turned over to religious authorities for burial.&lt;ref name="tabor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

===Symbols===
A [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and circle pattern is visible above the entrance of the tomb.

==Media coverage==
The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] first aired a [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the Talpiot Tomb in 1996 as part of its ''Heart of the Matter'' [[news magazine]].&lt;ref name="laidlaw"/&gt; At that time, Amos Kloner, the first [[archaeologist]] to examine the site said the claims of a connection to Jesus did not hold up archaeologically, adding "They just want to get money for it." Others were similarly skeptical, although another of the archaeologists who discovered the tomb admitted "I'm willing to accept the possibility."&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gathman.org/pipermail/apologetics/2007-February/001337.html |title=Clergy, scholars assail tomb of Jesus film |publisher=The Courier-Journal |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Princeton Symposium===

Following a [[Academic conference|symposium]] ("Third Princeton Theological Seminary Symposium on Jewish Views of the Afterlife and Burial Practices in Second Temple Judaism: Evaluating the Talpiot Tomb in Context") held in Jerusalem in January 2008, the media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited with most notably ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html | work=Time | title=Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoting extensive coverage, hailing the case as being reopened. In particular Simcha Jacobovici is reported to have issued statements to the press saying the symposium has reopened the case and that he felt "totally vindicated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=811301 Princeton Conference Vindicates Associated Producers James Cameron and Simcha Jacobovici on "Lost Tomb of Jesus"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobovici has denied making any such press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bib-arch.org/scholars-study/jesus-tomb-11.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605124203/http://www.bib-arch.org/scholars-study/jesus-tomb-11.asp |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}

It was during this symposium that Ruth Gat, while accepting a posthumous award for Yosef Gat, announced: "My husband, the lead archaeologist of the East Talpiot tomb in southern Jerusalem, believed that the tomb he excavated in 1980 was, indeed, the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth and his family."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Princeton-Conference-Vindicates-Associated-Producers-James-Cameron-Simcha-Jacobovici-811301.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Following the media's portrayal scholars present at the symposium accused [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and [[James Cameron]] of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including significantly all of the archaeologists and epigraphers, who had delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth" and also "that the majority of scholars in attendance – including all of the archaeologists and epigraphers who presented papers relating to the tomb - either reject the identification of the Talpiot tomb as belonging to Jesus’ family or find this claim highly speculative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Zias]], Senior Curator of Archaeology/Anthropology for the Israel Antiquities Authority 1972-1997, cited a leaked memo{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} issued from James Tabor before the symposium as proof of "outside intervention by Simcha and Tabor in order to distort the agenda and skew the proceedings in a way that was favorable to their pre-conceived plan".{{cite quote|date=September 2015}} [[Géza Vermes]] issued a statement saying that the arguments for the Talpiot tomb are not "just unconvincing but insignificant".&lt;ref name="2007 Alumni/ae Reunion"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080127132945/http://www.ptsem.edu/NEWS/talpiottombsymposium.php 2007 Alumni/ae Reunion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That "Discounting a handful, headed by James Tabor and Simcha Jacobovici, the maker of the documentary, The Lost Tomb of Jesus, most of the fifty or so participants shared this opinion".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Princeton Theological Seminary issued a letter following the controversy and reiterated concerns that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the press following the symposium gave almost the exact opposite impression (''of the symposium's results''), stating, instead, that the conference proceedings gave credence to the identification of the Talpiot tomb with a putative family tomb of Jesus of Nazareth. As is abundantly clear from the statements to the contrary that have been issued since the symposium by many of the participants, such representations are patently false and blatantly misrepresent the spirit and scholarly content of the deliberations."&lt;ref name="2007 Alumni/ae Reunion"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proceedings of the symposium will be edited by [[James Charlesworth]] and published.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Charlesworth, [http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=751 Rebutting Sensational Claims Concerning a Symposium in Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt;

An edition of the scientific journal ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' (Vol. 69, Iss. 3/4, Sep-Dec 2006), published by ''The American Schools of Oriental Research'' contains several articles concerning the Talpiot Tomb, including an overview over the controversy.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' and ''The Jesus Family Tomb''===
{{Main article|The Lost Tomb of Jesus|The Jesus Family Tomb}}
''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' premiered on The [[Discovery Channel]] on March 4, 2007, timed to coordinate with publication of Jacobovici's book ''The Jesus Family Tomb''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Jacobovici argues that the bones of [[Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Mary Magdalene]], along with those of some of their relatives, were once entombed in this cave, working with [[statistician]]s, archaeologists, historians, [[DNA]] experts, robot-camera technicians, [[epigraphy|epigraphers]] and a [[forensic]] expert to argue his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Christopher A. |last1=Rollston |title=Prosopography and the Talpiyot Yeshua Family Tomb: Pensées of a Palaeographer |work=SBL Forum |date=March 2007 |url=http://sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleID=649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time. "I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," he told the BBC News website. "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6397373.stm Jesus tomb found, says film-maker], BBC News. Retrieved 2010-04-13/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Tabor and Jacobovici examined (although without fully excavating) the previously unexcavated 1st-century Jewish tomb next to the alleged 'Jesus Family tomb'. Tabor indicated that they would be released at a press conference in November 2011, and in a forthcoming book.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.simonandschuster.com/The-Jesus-Discovery/James-D-Tabor/9781442346475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical analysis==
A central question has regarded the probability that a tomb might contain the specific group of names as the Talpiot Tomb. Experts such as [[Richard Bauckham]],&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |title=Hollywood Hype: The Oscars and Jesus' Family Tomb, What Do They Share? (expanded version) |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073737/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mavorah&lt;ref name=pilkington&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,2022252,00.html |title=Is this really the last resting place of Jesus, Mary Magdalene—and their son? |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |author2=McCarthy, Rory  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amos Kloner&lt;ref name=pilkington /&gt; have asserted the commonness of archaeological inscriptions bearing the name "[[Jesus (name)|Jesus]]". Paul Maier, professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University, notes that there were at least 21 "Yeshuas" or Jesuses famous enough to be included in the histories of [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Maier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus and his family |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For their part, the filmmakers present a statistical study conducted by [[Andrey Feuerverger]], professor of statistics and mathematics at the [[University of Toronto]], which concluded that while the names are not uncommon, the conservative odds that such names would be found together in any one tomb around are (depending on variables) from 600 to 1&lt;ref name="Discovery News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |title=Jesus Family Tomb Believed Found |last=Viegas |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307120414/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1,000,000 to 1 in favor of its being authentic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Feuerverger later said, "It is not in the purview of statistics to conclude whether or not this tombsite is that of the New Testament family. Any such conclusion much more rightfully belongs to the purview of biblical historical scholars who are in a much better position to assess the assumptions entering into the computations. The role of statistics here is primarily to attempt to assess the odds of an equally (or more) 'compelling' cluster of names arising purely by chance under certain random sampling assumptions and under certain historical assumptions. In this respect I now believe that I should not assert any conclusions connecting this tomb with any hypothetical one of the NT family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://magicstatistics.com/2007/03/05/jesus-tomb-statistician-backtracks-from-original-claim/ magicstatistics.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710011642/http://magicstatistics.com/2007/03/05/jesus-tomb-statistician-backtracks-from-original-claim/ |date=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerverger's assessment was based on several assumptions:
* That the Maria on one of the [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] is the mother of the Jesus found on another box
* That Mariamne is his wife
* That Joseph (inscribed as the nickname Jose) is his brother

Support for these assumptions comes, according to the documentary, from the following claims:&lt;ref name="laidlaw"/&gt;
* Mariamne is the Greek form of Marya and, according to [[François Bovon]], the name describes Mary Magdelene in the [[Acts of Philip]], though this is speculation&lt;ref name=heiser /&gt;
* Mary Magdelene is believed to have spoken and preached in Greek

* The Talpiot Tomb is the only place where ossuaries have ever been found with the names Mariamne and Jose, even though the root forms of the name were very popular and thousands of ossuaries have been unearthed

According to geologist Aryeh Shimron the tomb could be authentic and linked to the [[James Ossuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Isabel |last1=Kershner |date=April 4, 2015 |title=Findings Reignite Debate on Claim of Jesus' Bones |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/world/middleeast/findings-reignite-debate-on-claim-of-jesus-bones.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the tomb is the tomb of the family of Jesus - Jesus, Mary Magdalene and their son Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=The lost tomb of Jesus?

According to Prof Kloner, the James Ossuary could not have come from the Talpiot tomb, because the so-called missing ossuary of the Talpiot tomb had no inscription and was of different dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Kloner-A-great-story-but-nonsense|title=Kloner: A great story, but nonsense|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2007, Feuerverger conducted a statistical calculation on the name cluster as part of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus''. He concluded that the odds are at least 600 to 1 that the combination of names appeared in the tomb by chance. The methodology of this study has been submitted to a journal, but in the meantime a summary can be found on the Discovery Channel&lt;ref name="Discovery News"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html Lost Tomb of Jesus : Explore the Tomb : Discovery Channel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227110330/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and documentary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/evidence/probability/jesus_equation.html The Jesus Family Tomb: Probability &amp; the "Jesus Equation"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; websites. A more detailed explanation of the statistical approach can be found also on Feuerverger's website&lt;ref name="OfficeHrs"&gt;http://fisher.utstat.toronto.edu/andrey/OfficeHrs.txt&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}} as well as in a recent interview given to ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Christopher |last1=Mims |date=March 2, 2007 |title=Q&amp;A With the Statistician Who Calculated the Odds That This Tomb Belonged to Jesus |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feuerverger-the-statistician-who-calculated-the-odds-the-talpiot-tomb-belonged-to-jesus/ |work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency distribution for names prevalent during the period of time during which ossuary burials took place was inferred by studying two key sources:
* Rahmani's Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries in the Collections of the State of Israel&lt;ref&gt;L. Rahmani, ''A Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries in the Collections of the State of Israel,'' (IAA/[[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], 1994){{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tal Ilan's Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity&lt;ref&gt;Ilan, Tal. 2002. ''LEXICON OF JEWISH NAMES IN LATE ANTIQUITY:'' PART I, ''PALESTINE 330 BCE-200 CE.'' Tubingen, Germany: Mohr Siebeck.{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Prof. Feuerverger, the goal of the statistical analysis is to assess the probability level of a [[null hypothesis]]:&lt;ref name="OfficeHrs"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''A 'null hypothesis' can be thought of here as asserting that this cluster of names arose purely by chance under random sampling from the [[wikt:Special:Search/onomasticon|onomasticon]]. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of this, in some sense. It is not in the purview of statistics to conclude whether or not this tombsite is that of the New Testament family.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feuerverger multiplied the instances that each name appeared during the tomb's time period with the instances of every other name. He initially found "Jesus Son of Joseph" appeared once out of 190 times, Mariamne appeared once out of 160 times and so on:
&lt;center&gt;
{|cellpadding=2 class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" align="center"
|-
!Jesus son of Joseph!!Mariamne!!Yosah!!Maria!!Product
|-
| 1/190||1/160||1/20||1/4||1/2,432,000
|-
| 0.53%||0.625%||5%||25%||~4.11X10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;%
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

He next divided 2,432,000 by 4 to account for bias in the historical record and further divided that result (608,000) by 1,000 to attempt to account for the number of explored tombs from first century Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-25-2007/0004533923&amp;EDATE= prnewswire.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.utstat.toronto.edu/andrey/OfficeHrs.txt fisher.utstat.toronto.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feuerverger's conclusions have been called into question:
* According to some, multiplying the individual name probabilities is wrong because many [[permutations]] of the same names are possible. 
* The inclusion of Mariamne in the calculation is based on two assumptions:{{Specify|reason=Only one assumption is listed.|date=August 2016}}
** Mary Magdelene in [[New Testament]] (NT) was Jesus’ wife. 
* The calculation adjusts only for the 1,000 tombs found in Jerusalem instead of the whole Jewish populace that lived in the area. This effectively assumes that Jesus family in NT did indeed have a family tomb and it was among the 1000 tombs found in Jerusalem area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntgateway.com/weblog/2007/03/correct-interpretation-of-dr-andrey.html NT Gateway Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103121756/http://ntgateway.com/weblog/2007/03/correct-interpretation-of-dr-andrey.html |date=2008-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntgateway.com/weblog/2007/03/jesus-family-tomb-statistics-further.html NT Gateway Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015141322/http://ntgateway.com/weblog/2007/03/jesus-family-tomb-statistics-further.html |date=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no historical evidence for this assumption. Some experts, including archaeologist Amos Kloner (the one who excavated the tombs) do not accept that the poor family from Nazareth had a family tomb in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.my-reflection.com/Story.aspx?NewsID=1451 |title=Archaeologist Amos Kloner Doesn't Buy The Jesus Christ's Coffin Story |last=Kloner |first=Amos |date=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330043621/http://www.my-reflection.com/Story.aspx?NewsID=1451 |archivedate=2008-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The inscription “Judah son of Jesus” is ignored in the calculation. Since most scholars considers the historical Jesus to be childless, some people believe this inscription should be included in the calculation to reduce the probability that the tomb belongs to the Jesus family.

Stephan Pfann (president of Jerusalem's [[University of the Holy Land]]) points out that the commonality of these names suggests that the probability is much lower. "Remarkably, a mere 16 of the 72 personal names [found on ossuaries] account for 75% of the inscribed names." Among these "top 16" names are Mary, Joseph, Jesus, Matthew, and Judas (and variations thereof)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhl.ac/JudeanTombsAndOssuaries.html |title=The Improper Application of Statistics in "The Lost Tomb of Jesus" |last=Pfann |first=Stephen |accessdate=2007-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416021228/http://www.uhl.ac/JudeanTombsAndOssuaries.html |archivedate=2008-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the submission of Feuerverger's paper to a journal and its publication, François Bovon noted that he had not made the statement about the name Mariamne which had been ascribed to him by Jacobovici and conveyed to Feuerverger.&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt; Specifically, although Feuerverger had factored into his calculations the understanding that Bovon had identified Mariamne as the most likely name of Mary Magdalene, Bovon did not hold that belief.&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt; Feuerverger noted in his rejoinder to comments that this false understanding so perturbed his calculation that
: "this means that we cannot (on the basis of our RR procedure) say that the Talpiyot find is statistically significant in any meaningful way".&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt;

[[Richard Bauckham]] (Professor of New Testament Studies and Bishop Wardlaw Professor at [[St Andrews]]) compiled the following data to show just how common the names on these ossuaries are:&lt;ref name=witherington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/02/jesus-tomb-titanic-talpiot-tomb-theory.html |title= The Jesus Tomb?

:"Out of a total number of 2625 males, these are the figures for the ten most popular male names among Palestinian Jews. The first figure is the total number of occurrences (from this number, with 2625 as the total for all names, you could calculate percentages), while the second is the number of occurrences specifically on ossuaries."

&lt;/center&gt;

Colin Aitken, a professor of forensic statistics at Edinburgh University, stated that the study is based on a number of assumptions, and that, "even if we accept the assumptions, 600 to one is certainly not the odds in favour of this tomb being Jesus",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1226604.0.0.php theherald.co.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309074441/http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1226604.0.0.php |date=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that even if it were true that to find this cluster of names is very unlikely, it does not follow that therefore this is probably the tomb of the family of Jesus. [[Peter Lampe]], professor of New Testament Studies at the University of Heidelberg and working in archaeology, pointed out that in the 120s/130s C.E. in the port town of Maoza at the southern end of the Dead Sea, one Jewish household comprised the following names: Jesus, Simon, Mariame, Jacobus and Judah (Papyri Babatha 17 from 128 C.E.; 25-26 and 34 from 131 C.E.). These people had nothing to do with the New Testament or the Talpiyot tomb. "According to the rationale of the filmmakers, these people should not have existed."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lampe, “MEXPI THC CHMEPON: A New Edition of Matthew 27:64b; 28:13 in Today’s Pop Science and a Salty Breeze from the Dead Sea,” ''Neutestamentliche Exegese im Dialog: Hermeneutik – Wirkungsgeschichte – Matthäusevangelium'' (eds. Peter Lampe, Moisés Mayordomo, Migaku Sato; Festschrift Ulrich Luz; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 2008), 355-366 (with further arguments against the Jesus family tomb theory).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Vikings]] are perhaps best known for accumulating wealth through [[plunder]], [[tribute]], and [[Conquest (military)|conquest]], they were also successful traders. The Vikings developed several trading centres and long-distance trade routes during the [[Viking Age]] (c. 8th Century AD to 11th Century AD). The Vikings also established a "bullion economy" in which weighed silver, and to a lesser extent gold, was used as a means of exchange.

== Trade routes ==  

The Vikings had a very vast, expansive, and planned out [[trade network]]. Trade took place on a gold level and over short distances. The majority of trade was conducted among the several ports that lined the [[Scandinavian coast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings also engaged in trade with merchants throughout Europe, Asia and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Volga trade route|Volga]] and [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|Dnieper]] Trade Routes were the two main trade routes that connected Northern Europe with [[Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Baghdad]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Several trade routes also ran through [[central Europe]] that connected [[Scandinavia]] with the [[Mediterranean]]. The Vikings are also believed to have sent merchants as far west as [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trading towns ==

At the beginning of the Viking Age, the first proper trading towns developed in Scandinavia. These appeared in central locations along Scandinavia’s coasts near natural harbors or fjords. Trading centers varied in size, character, and significance. Only a select few developed into international trading posts. Every town was ruled by a king who imposed taxes on imported and exported goods in exchange for military protection of the town’s citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest trading centers during the Viking Age were [[Ribe]] (Denmark), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Hedeby]] (Denmark), and [[Birka]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedeby was the largest and most important trading center.  Located along the southern border of Denmark in the inner part of the [[Schlei Fjord]], Hedeby controlled both the north/south trade routes (between Europe and Scandinavia) and the east/west routes (between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, Hedeby’s population was around 1000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribe, located on the West coast of Denmark, was established in the early 8th century as the eastern end of a trading and monetary network that stretched around the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also several Viking trading centers located along several rivers in modern-day Russia including Gorodische, Gnezdovo, Cherigov, Novgorod, and Kiev. These towns became major trade destinations on the trading route from the Baltic Sea to Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goods ==

===Imports===

''Silver, silk, spices, weapons, wine, glassware, quern stones (for grinding grain), fine textiles, pottery, slaves, both precious and non-precious weapons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imports in the Viking Age|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/imports/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham-Campbell|first1=James|author-link1=James Graham-Campbell|title=Silver Economy in the Viking Age|date=2007|publisher=Left Coast|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exports===

''Honey, tin, wheat, wool, various types of fur and hides, feathers, [[falcon]]s, [[whalebone]], [[walrus ivory]], reindeer antler, and [[amber]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikings as Traders|url=http://www.skwirk.com/p-c_s-56_u-473_t-1287_c-4945/SA/7/Vikings-as-traders/The-Viking-society/The-Vikings/SOSE-History/|website=SWIRK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashby"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashby|first1=Steven P.|last2=Coutu|first2=Ashley N.|last3=Sindbæk|first3=Søren M.|title=Urban Networks and Arctic Outlands: Craft Specialists and Reindeer Antler in Viking Towns|journal=European Journal of Archaeology|date=April 2015|volume=18|issue=4|pages=679–704|doi=10.1179/1461957115Y.0000000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slave]]s and furs were the most important trade items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imports in the Viking Age|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/imports/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings bought and sold slaves throughout their trade network. Viking slaves were known as ''thralls''. The majority of imported slaves came from the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the trade during the Viking Age took place at the local level primarily involving agriculture products such as vegetables, grains, and cereals. Domestic animals were also traded among local peoples. These items were brought into town by farmers and traded for basic necessities, such as tools and clothes, and luxury items, such as glassware and jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullion economy ==

The Viking Age saw the development of a bullion economy. In this economic framework, traders and merchants exchanged goods for [[bullion]] (precious metals, primarily [[gold]] and [[silver]]). Trade was usually accomplished by barter. Bullion lacked the formal quality control linked with coinage and therefore provided a highly flexible system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The durability of silver and gold made them more suited for a monetary role than many other commodities. By the 9th century, silver had become the basis for the Viking economy. Most of the silver was acquired from the Islamic world. When the silver mines near Baghdad ran dry in the late 10th century, the Vikings began to tap central Europe, specifically the [[Hraz Mountains]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham-Campbell|first1=James|title=Silver Economy in the Viking Age|date=2007|publisher=Left Coast|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullion took the form of coins, ingots, and jewelry. The value of bullion was determined by its purity and mass. Methods used to test the purity of the metal included “pricking" and “pecking” the surface to test the hardness of the alloy and reveal plating. Determining bullion’s mass required the use of weights and scales. Many of the bronze scales used by Viking traders folded on themselves making them compact and easy to carry for travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viking weight combined only reflection.jpg|thumb|Anglo-Saxon-Viking Coin weight. Used for trading bullion and hack-silver. Material is lead and weighs approx 36&amp;nbsp;g. Embedded with an Anglo-Saxon sceat (Series K type 32a) dating to 720-750 AD and minted in Kent. It is edged in dotted triangle pattern. Origin is the Danelaw region and dates 870-930CE]]

The two types of weights imported from foreign lands were '''''cubo-octahedral weights''''' (''Dice weights'') and '''''oblate spheroids''''' (''barrel weights''). Both were produced in various sizes with markings indicating the weights they represented. The majority of imported weights came from the Islamic world and contained Arabic inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikings also produced their own weights for measuring quantities of silver and gold. These lead weights were decorated with enameling, insert coins, or cut up ornamental metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viking Weight|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=32976b0a-e67c-4f06-9921-782f3ba135d1|website=The National Museum of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the dice weights or barrel weights, each lead weight was unique so there was no danger of them being rearranged or switched during the course of an exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange rates==
Estimated exchange rates at the beginning of the 11th century in Iceland were:
*8 ounces of silver = 1 ounce of gold
*8 ounces of silver = 4 milk cows
*8 ounces of silver = 24 sheep
*8 ounces of silver = 144 ells (roughly 72 meters) of [[wadmal]] 2 ells wide (about 1 meter)
*12 ounces of silver = 1 adult male slave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the weight of a piece of jewelry was more than needed to complete a purchase, it was cut up into smaller bits until the correct weight needed for the transaction was reached. The term [[hack silver]] is used to describe these silver objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver ingots were primarily used for large/high-value transactions. The largest found weights weigh more than 1 kilogram each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precious metals were also used to display personal wealth and status. For example, [[Rus trader]]s symbolized their wealth through silver [[neck ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gareth|first1=Williams|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver or gold gifts were often exchanged to secure social and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, he won the J.D. Bernal Prize from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] for "distinguished contributions to Science and Technology Studies over the course of [a] career".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4sonline.org/prizes/bernal, retrieved 19 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pinch was born in [[Lisnaskea]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.cornell.edu/stories/1999/10/christopher-ober-and-trevor-pinch-named-department-chairs|title=''Christopher Ober and Trevor Pinch named to department chairs at Cornell'', Cornell Chronicle|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
He has a degree in [[Physics]] from [[Imperial College London]] and a PhD in Sociology from the [[University of Bath]].

== Career ==
He taught sociology at the [[University of York]] before moving to the United States.

Together with [[Wiebe Bijker]], Pinch started the movement known as [[Social Construction of Technology]] (SCOT) within the sociology of science.

==Works==
He is a significant contributor to the study of [[Sound culture]], and his books include a major study of [[Robert Moog]].

Pinch's book, ''Confronting Nature'' is widely considered the definitive sociological account of the history of the solar neutrino problem, and was mentioned by Raymond Davis in his 2002 Nobel Prize autobiography.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web|title=Raymond Davis Jr. – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/davis-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walafrid''', alternatively spelt '''Walahfrid''', surnamed '''[[Strabo (disambiguation)|Strabo]]''' (or '''Strabus''', i.e. "[[strabismus|squint]]-eyed")  (c. 808 &amp;ndash; 18 August 849), was an [[Alemanni]]c [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] and [[theology|theological]] writer who lived on [[Reichenau Island]].

==Works==
Walafrid Strabo's works are theological, historical and poetical.

===Theological works===
There is an exposition of the first 20 [[Book of Psalms|psalms]] (published by Pez. in ''Thes. Anecdota nova'', iv.) and an epitome of [[Rabanus Maurus]]'s commentary on [[Leviticus]]. An ''Expositio quatuor Evangeliorum'' is also ascribed to Walafrid.
 
His ''De exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rerum'' was written between 840 and 842 for [[Reginbert of Reichenau|Reginbert the Librarian]].&lt;ref name=Airlie97&gt;Airlie, "The aristocracy in the service of the state in the Carolingian period", p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

It deals in 32 chapters with ecclesiastical usages, churches, altars, prayers, bells, pictures, baptism and the [[Holy Communion]]. Incidentally, he introduces into his explanations the current German expressions for the things he is treating of, with the apology that [[Solomon]] had set him the example by keeping monkeys as well as peacocks at his court. Of special interest is the fact that Walafrid, in his exposition of the [[Holy Mass|Mass]], shows no trace of any belief in the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] as taught by his famous contemporary [[Radbertus Paschasius|Radbertus]]; according to him, Christ gave to his disciples the sacraments of his [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] in the substance of bread and wine, and taught them to celebrate them as a memorial of his [[Passion of Christ|Passion]].

In the last chapter, Walafrid describes a hierarchical body of both lay and ecclesiastical officers, using [[Paul of Tarsus|Pauline]] metaphors (1 Cor 12:11-27) to underline the importance of such a body as an organic unity. In so doing, he articulates a view on the nature of public office, ideally based on a sense of responsibility with respect to society as a whole.&lt;ref name=Airlie98-9&gt;Airlie, "The aristocracy in the service of the state in the Carolingian period", pp. 98-9.&lt;/ref&gt; While Johannes Fried is wary of associating this idealised scheme too much with current ideas about state and court in Louis' reign, Karl Ferdinand Werner and Stuart Airlie are rather more sympathetic to its relevance for contemporary thought at court: what gives the text added interest is that it was written by a courtier (Walafrid), representing a "view from the centre".&lt;ref name=Airlie98-9 /&gt;

===Historical and poetical works===
Walafrid's chief historical works are the rhymed ''Vita sancti Galli'' (The Life of [[Saint Gall]]), which, though written down nearly two centuries after this saint's death, is still the primary authority for his life, and a much shorter life of [[Saint Othmar]], abbot of [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]] (died 759).&lt;ref&gt;A critical edition of these by [[Ernst Dümmler]] is in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' "Poetae Latini", ii. (1884), p.&amp;nbsp;259 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walafrid's poetical works also include a short life of Saint [[Blathmac]], a high-born monk of [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], murdered by the [[Danes]] in the first half of the 9th century; a life of [[Saint Mammes]]; and a ''Liber de visionibus Wettini''. This last poem, written in [[hexameter]]s like the two preceding ones, was composed at the command of "Father" Adalgisus and was based upon a prose narrative by [[Haito]], abbot of [[Abbey of Reichenau|Reichenau]] from 806 to 822.  It is dedicated to Grimald, brother of [[Wetti of Reichenau|Wettin]], his teacher. As Walafrid tells his audience, he was only eighteen when he sent it, and he begs his correspondent to revise his verses, because, "as it is not lawful for a monk to hide anything from his abbot", he fears he may deserve to be beaten.  In the vision, Wettin saw [[Charlemagne]] suffering torture in [[Purgatory]] because of his sexual incontinence.  The name of the ruler alluded to is not directly stated in the text, but "Carolus Imperator" form the initial letters of the relevant passage.  Many of Walafrid's other poems are, or include, short addresses to kings and queens ([[Lothair I|Lothar]], Charles, Louis, [[Pippin III|Pippin]], [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith]], etc.) and to friends ([[Einhard]]; Grimald; [[Rabanus Maurus]]; Tatto; [[Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims]]; [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo, bishop of Metz]]; etc.).

His most famous poem is the ''Liber de cultura hortorum'' which was later published as the ''Hortulus'', dedicated to Grimald.  It is an account of a little garden in [[Reichenau Island]] that he used to tend with his own hands, and is largely made up of descriptions of the various herbs he grows there and their medicinal and other uses, including beer brewing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://decodedpast.com/eden-lake-abbots-little-garden/14654 decodedpast.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common sage|Sage]] holds the place of honor; then comes [[rue]], the antidote of poisons; and so on through [[melon]]s, [[fennel]], [[lily|lilies]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], and many other plants, to wind up with the [[rose]], "which in virtue and scent surpasses all other herbs, and may rightly be called the flower of flowers."

The poem ''De Imagine Tetrici'' takes the form of a dialogue; it was inspired by an equestrian statue depicting a nude emperor on horseback believed to be [[Theodoric the Great]] which stood in front of [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Charlemagne's palace]] at [[Aachen]].

[[Codex Sangallensis 878]] may be Walafrid's personal ''[[Breviary|breviarium]]'', begun when he was a student at [[Abbey of Fulda|Fulda]].

===Ascribed works===
[[Johannes Trithemius]], [[Sponheim Abbey|Abbot of Sponheim]] (1462-1516), credited him with the authorship of the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'' or ''Ordinary Glosses'' on the [[Bible]]. The work dates, however, from the 12th century, but Trithemius' erroneous ascription remained current well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Karlfried Froehlich]], "The Printed Gloss," in  ''Biblia Latina cum Glossa Ordinaria, Facsimile Reprint of the Editio Princeps Adolph Rusch of Strassburg 1480/81'', intro. Karlfried Froehlich and Margaret T. Gibson (Brepols: Turnhout, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The work is now  attributed to [[Anselm of Laon]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David.

'''Wilhelm Klein''' (November 28, 1850 in [[Caransebeş|Karánsebes]] (today [[Caransebeş]]), [[Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 1924) was a Hungarian-[[Austria]]n [[archeologist]].

He was born in Karánsebes, [[Krassó-Szörény County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (today [[Caransebeş]], [[Caraş-Severin County]], [[Romania]]) 

He first studied [[Jewish]] theology and then philosophy at [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]]. The Austrian government subsequently sent him to [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], where he engaged in archeological investigations, studying especially antique pottery. Klein was a professor of archeology at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|German University of Prague]], and a member of the ''Gesellschaft zur Förderung Deutscher Wissenschaft, Kunst, und Literatur in Böhmen'', as well as of the [[German Archeological Institute]]. 

He has published: "''Euphronius''" (1886); "''Die Griechischen Vasen, mit Meisterinschriften''" (2d edition, Vienna, 1887); and "''Praxiteles''" (1897).
