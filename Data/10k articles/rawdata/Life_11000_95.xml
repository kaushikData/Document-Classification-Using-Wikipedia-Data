'''Abibon''' (fl. 1st century) was the son of [[Gamaliel]], the teacher of [[Paul the Apostle]]. He is said by some sources to have been baptized with his father and his brother Nicodemus. They are regarded as [[saints]] of the Christian church. The finding of their relics was celebrated as a [[feast day]] on August 3, and their [[feast day]]s especially commemorated on December 2 in [[Pisa]].

==Medical uses==
{{Main|Epinephrine (medication)}}
As a medication, it is used to treat a number of conditions including [[anaphylaxis]], [[cardiac arrest]], and superficial bleeding.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Epinephrine|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/epinephrine.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Aug 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nebulizer|Inhaled]] epinephrine may be used to improve the symptoms of [[croup]].&lt;ref name=PedN09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Everard ML | title = Acute bronchiolitis and croup | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–33, x–xi | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19135584 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2008.10.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used for [[asthma]] when other treatments are not effective.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; --&gt; It is given [[intravenously]], by injection into a muscle, by inhalation, or by injection just under the skin.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Common side effects include shakiness, [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and sweating.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; --&gt; A fast heart rate and high blood pressure may occur.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; --&gt; Occasionally it may result in an [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; --&gt; While the safety of its use during [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]] is unclear, the benefits to the mother must be taken into account.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

A case has been made for the use of Adrenaline (epinephrine) infusion in place of the widely accepted treatment of inotopes  for preterm infants with clinical cardiovascular compromise. Although there is sufficient data which strongly recommends Adrenaline infusions as a viable treatment, more trials are needed in order to conclusively determine that these infusions will successfully reduce morbidity and mortality rates among preterm, cardiovascularly compromised infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradisis|first=M.|last2=Osborn|first2=D. A.|date=2004|title=Adrenaline for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003958|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003958.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=14974048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological effects==
The [[adrenal medulla]] is a minor contributor to total circulating [[catecholamines]] ([[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]] is at a higher concentration in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizzo V, Memmi M, Moratti R, Melzi d'Eril G, Perucca E | title = Concentrations of L-dopa in plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis | volume = 14 | issue = 8–10 | pages = 1043–6 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8818013 | doi = 10.1016/s0731-7085(96)01753-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it contributes over 90% of circulating epinephrine. Little epinephrine is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered [[chromaffin cells]]. Following [[adrenalectomy]], epinephrine disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Physiology and pathophysiology of the human sympathoadrenal neuroendocrine system | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 303 | issue = 8 | pages = 436–44 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 6248784 | doi = 10.1056/nejm198008213030806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[adrenal gland]]s contribute about 7% of circulating [[norepinephrine]], most of which is a spill over from [[neurotransmission]] with little activity as a hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Isotope-derivative measurements of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine in man | journal = Diabetes | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1071–82 | date = November 1976 | pmid = 825406 | doi = 10.2337/diab.25.11.1071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gerich J, et al. Hormonal mechanisms of recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia in man|journal=Am J Physiol |year=1979|volume=236|pages=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacak|first=Karel|title=Catecholamines and adrenergic receptors. In: Pheochromocytoma Diagnosis, Localization, and Treatment|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Oxford|location=Chapter 6|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pharmacological doses of epinephrine stimulate [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] adrenoceptors of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Sympathetic nerve receptors are classified as adrenergic, based on their responsiveness to adrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barger G, Dale HH | title = Chemical structure and sympathomimetic action of amines | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 41 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 19–59 | date = October 1910 | pmid = 16993040 | pmc = 1513032 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1910.sp001392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "adrenergic" is often misinterpreted in that the main sympathetic neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), rather than epinephrine, as discovered by [[Ulf von Euler]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Euler|first=US|title=A specific sympathomimetic ergone in adrenergic nerve fibres (sympathin) and its relations to adrenaline and nor adrenaline|journal=Acta Physiol Scand|year=1946|volume=12|pages=73–97|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1946.tb00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Von Euler US, Hillarp NA | title = Evidence for the presence of noradrenaline in submicroscopic structures of adrenergic axons | journal = Nature | volume = 177 | issue = 4497 | pages = 44–5 | date = January 1956 | pmid = 13288591 | doi = 10.1038/177044b0 | bibcode = 1956Natur.177...44E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epinephrine does have a β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptor-mediated effect on [[metabolism]] and the [[airway]], there being no direct neural connection from the [[sympathetic ganglia]] to the [[airway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren J | title = The adrenal medulla and the airway | journal = British Journal of Diseases of the Chest | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3004549 | doi = 10.1016/0007-0971(86)90002-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Twentyman OP, Disley A, Gribbin HR, Alberti KG, Tattersfield AE | title = Effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on respiratory and metabolic responses to exercise | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 788–93 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 6795164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter EA, Galbo H, Christensen NJ | title = Control of exercise-induced muscular glycogenolysis by adrenal medullary hormones in rats | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–6 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7009527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the adrenal medulla and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] being involved in the flight, fight and fright response was originally proposed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canon|first=WB.|title=Studies on the conditions of activity in endocrine organs xxvii.

=== Exercise ===
One physiological stimulus to epinephrine secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated using the denervated pupil of a cat as an assay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartman FA, Waite RH, McCordock HA | title = The liberation of epinephrine during muscular exercise|journal=Am J Physiol|year=1922|volume=62|pages=225–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; later confirmed using a biological assay on urine samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Von Euler US, Hellner S | title = Excretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline in muscular work | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 26 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 183–91 | date = September 1952 | pmid = 12985406 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1952.tb00900.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=A|title=Simultaneous fluorimetric determinations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in blood|journal=Acta Pharmac Tox|year=1950|pages=137–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of epinephrine in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme-isotope derivate radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for epinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson GA, Kupiecki RM, Baker CA | title = Single isotope derivative (radioenzymatic) methods in the measurement of catecholamines | journal = Metabolism | volume = 29 | issue = 11 Suppl 1 | pages = 1106–13 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7001177 | doi = 10.1016/0026-0495(80)90018-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early REA plasma assays indicated that epinephrine and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when anaerobic metabolism commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galbo H, Holst JJ, Christensen NJ | title = Glucagon and plasma catecholamine responses to graded and prolonged exercise in man | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–6 | date = January 1975 | pmid = 1110246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winder WW, Hagberg JM, Hickson RC, Ehsani AA, McLane JA | title = Time course of sympathoadrenal adaptation to endurance exercise training in man | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 370–4 | date = September 1978 | pmid = 701121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kindermann W, Schnabel A, Schmitt WM, Biro G, Hippchen M | title = [Catecholamines, GH, cortisol, glucagon, insulin, and sex hormones in exercise and beta 1-blockade (author's transl)] | journal = Klinische Wochenschrift | volume = 60 | issue = 10 | pages = 505–12 | date = May 1982 | pmid = 6124653 | doi = 10.1007/bf01756096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During exercise the epinephrine blood concentration rises partially from increased secretion from the adrenal medulla and partly from decreased metabolism because of reduced hepatic blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren JB, Dalton N, Turner C, Clark TJ, Toseland PA | title = Adrenaline secretion during exercise | journal = Clinical Science | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–90 | date = January 1984 | pmid = 6690194 | doi=10.1042/cs0660087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infusion of epinephrine to reproduce exercise circulating concentrations of epinephrine in subjects at rest has little haemodynamic effect, other than a small β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated fall in diastolic blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitzgerald GA, Barnes P, Hamilton CA, Dollery CT | title = Circulating adrenaline and blood pressure: the metabolic effects and kinetics of infused adrenaline in man | journal = European Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 401–6 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 6777175 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2362.1980.tb00052.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren JB, Dalton N | title = A comparison of the bronchodilator and vasopressor effects of exercise levels of adrenaline in man | journal = Clinical Science | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 475–9 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6831836 | doi=10.1042/cs0640475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infusion of epinephrine well within the physiological range suppresses human airway hyper-reactivity sufficiently to antagonize the constrictor effects of inhaled histamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren JB, Dalton N, Turner C, Clark TJ | title = Protective effect of circulating epinephrine within the physiologic range on the airway response to inhaled histamine in nonasthmatic subjects | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 683–6 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6389647 | doi = 10.1016/0091-6749(84)90230-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A link between what we now know as the sympathetic system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine-induced airway constriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=M | name-list-format = vanc |title=Das muscarin-lungen-odem|journal=Z Klin Med|year=1887|volume=12|pages=550–591.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut at the level of the diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Jackson DE | title = The pulmonary action of the adrenal glands|journal=J Pharmac Exp Therap|year=1912|volume=4|pages=59–74.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with work load and is not prevented by beta blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kagawa J, Kerr HD | title = Effects of brief graded exercise on specific airway conductance in normal subjects | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 138–44 | date = February 1970 | pmid = 5413299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive dilation of the airway with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting vagal tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in airway resistance after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise induced asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren JB, Jennings SJ, Clark TJ | title = Effect of adrenergic and vagal blockade on the normal human airway response to exercise | journal = Clinical Science | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–85 | date = January 1984 | pmid = 6228370 | doi=10.1042/cs0660079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in airway resistance during exercise reduces the work of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jennings SJ, Warren JB, Pride NB | title = Airway caliber and the work of breathing in humans | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–4 | date = July 1987 | pmid = 2957350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional response===
Every emotional response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes the release of epinephrine, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The major emotion studied in relation to epinephrine is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with epinephrine expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects.&lt;ref name="Mezzacappa, E.S. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mezzacappa | first1 = E.S. | last2 = Katkin | first2 = E.S. | last3 = Palmer | first3 = S.N. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1999 | title = Epinephrine, arousal, and emotion: A new look at two-factor theory | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 181–199 | doi = 10.1080/026999399379320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of epinephrine. Overall, the greater amount of epinephrine is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that epinephrine elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which can be attributed to the feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between epinephrine and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film.&lt;ref name="Mezzacappa, E.S. 1999"/&gt; Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce epinephrine. Findings support the idea that epinephrine does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.&lt;ref name="Mate, T. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toth M, Ziegler M, Sun P, Gresack J, Risbrough V | title = Impaired conditioned fear response and startle reactivity in epinephrine-deficient mice | journal = Behavioural Pharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23268986 | pmc = 3558035 | doi = 10.1097/FBP.0b013e32835cf408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
It has been found that adrenergic hormones, such as epinephrine, can produce retrograde enhancement of [[long-term memory]] in humans. The release of epinephrine due to emotionally stressful events, which is endogenous epinephrine, can modulate memory consolidation of the events, ensuring memory strength that is proportional to memory importance. Post-learning epinephrine activity also interacts with the degree of arousal associated with the initial coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahill L, Alkire MT | title = Epinephrine enhancement of human memory consolidation: interaction with arousal at encoding | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 194–8 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12591227 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-7427(02)00036-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that suggests epinephrine does have a role in long-term stress adaptation and emotional memory encoding specifically. Epinephrine may also play a role in elevating arousal and fear memory under particular pathological conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="Mate, T. 2013" /&gt; Overall, "Extensive evidence indicates that epinephrine (EPI) modulates memory consolidation for emotionally arousing tasks in animals and human subjects.”&lt;ref name="Dornelles, A. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dornelles A, de Lima MN, Grazziotin M, Presti-Torres J, Garcia VA, Scalco FS, Roesler R, Schröder N | title = Adrenergic enhancement of consolidation of object recognition memory | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–42 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17368053 | doi = 10.1016/j.nlm.2007.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have also found that recognition memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors.&lt;ref name="Dornelles, A. 2007" /&gt; Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that [[sotalol]], a [[Beta blocker|β adrenoceptor antagonist]] that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roozendaal B, McGaugh JL | title = Memory modulation | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 125 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–824 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22122145 | doi = 10.1037/a0026187 | pmc=3236701}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine to have an effect on memory consolidation.

For noradrenaline to be acted upon by PNMT in the cytosol, it must first be shipped out of [[chromaffin granule|granules]] of the chromaffin cells. This may occur via the catecholamine-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger [[VMAT1]]. VMAT1 is also responsible for transporting newly synthesized adrenaline from the cytosol back into chromaffin granules in preparation for release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=193|title= SLC18 family of vesicular amine transporters|date= |website= Guide to Pharmacology|publisher= IUPHAR/BPS|access-date= 21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In liver cells, adrenaline binds to the [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|β adrenergic receptor]], which changes conformation and helps G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha and G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha binds to adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma binds to the calcium channel and allows calcium ions to enter the cytoplasm. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then binds to phosphorylase kinase and finishes its activation. Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates [[glycogen phosphorylase]], which then phosphorylates glycogen and converts it to glucose-6-phosphate. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Pathology ==
Increased epinephrine secretion is observed in [[pheochromocytoma]], hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction and to a lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldberg W, Minz B, Tsudzimura H | title = The mechanism of the nervous discharge of adrenaline | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 286–304 | date = June 1934 | pmid = 16994544 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1934.sp003136 | pmc=1394156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burn JH, Hutcheon DE, Parker RH | title = Adrenaline and noradrenaline in the suprarenal medulla after insulin | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–23 | date = September 1950 | pmid = 14777865 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1950.tb00591.x | pmc=1509946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Outschoorn AS | title = The hormones of the adrenal medulla and their release | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 605–15 | date = December 1952 | pmid = 13019029 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1952.tb00728.x | pmc=1509311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla from the rest of the sympathetic system.

[[Benign familial tremor]] (BFT) is responsive to peripheral β adrenergic blockers and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulation is known to cause tremor.

Low, or absent, concentrations of epinephrine can be seen in autonomic neuropathy or following adrenalectomy. Failure of the adrenal cortex, as with Addisons disease, can suppress epinephrine secretion as the activity of the synthesing enzyme, [[Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine-''N''-methyltransferase]], depends on the high concentration of cortisol that drains from the cortex to the medulla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wurtman RJ, Pohorecky LA, Baliga BS | title = Adrenocortical control of the biosynthesis of epinephrine and proteins in the adrenal medulla | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 411–26 | date = June 1972 | pmid = 4117970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright A, Jones IC | title = Chromaffin tissue in the lizard adrenal gland | journal = Nature | volume = 175 | issue = 4466 | pages = 1001–2 | date = June 1955 | pmid = 14394091 | doi = 10.1038/1751001b0 | bibcode = 1955Natur.175.1001W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coupland RE | title = On the morphology and adrenaline-nor-adrenaline content of chromaffin tissue | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 194–203 | date = April 1953 | pmid = 13052791 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.0090194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In 1901, [[Jokichi Takamine]] patented a purified extract from the [[adrenal glands]], and called it "adrenalin" (from the Latin for "on top of the kidneys" (''ad'' and ''renal''), which was [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|trademark]]ed by [[Parke-Davis|Parke, Davis &amp; Co]] in the US&lt;ref name="BMJ" /&gt;.  The [[British Approved Name]] and [[European Pharmacopoeia]] term for this drug is hence ''adrenaline''.

However, the pharmacologist [[John Jacob Abel|John Abel]] had already prepared an extract from adrenal glands as early as 1897, and coined the name ''epinephrine '' to describe it (from the Greek for "on top of the kidneys")&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson JK | title = "Where name and image meet"--the argument for "adrenaline" | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7233 | pages = 506–9 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10678871 | pmc = 1127537 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7233.506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the belief that Abel's extract was the same as Takamine's (a belief since disputed), epinephrine became{{when|date=February 2017}} the generic name in the US&lt;ref name="BMJ" /&gt;, and remains the [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical's]] [[United States Adopted Name]] and [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (though the name adrenaline is frequently used).

The terminology is now one of the few differences between the INN and BAN systems of names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm|title=Naming human medicines – GOV.UK|website=www.mhra.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although European health professionals and scientists preferentially use the term ''adrenaline'', the converse is true among American health professionals and scientists.  Nevertheless, even among the latter, receptors for this substance are called ''adrenergic receptors'' or ''adrenoceptors'', and pharmaceuticals that mimic its effects are often called ''adrenergics''.

As a hormone, epinephrine acts on nearly all body tissues. Its actions vary by tissue type and tissue expression of [[adrenergic receptor]]s. For example, high levels of epinephrine causes [[smooth muscle]] relaxation in the airways but causes contraction of the smooth muscle that lines most [[arteriole]]s.

Epinephrine acts by binding to a variety of [[adrenergic receptor]]s. Epinephrine is a nonselective [[agonist]] of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="pharmnemonics"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes.

==Measurement in biological fluids==
Epinephrine may be quantified in blood, plasma or serum as a diagnostic aid, to monitor therapeutic administration, or to identify the causative agent in a potential poisoning victim. Endogenous plasma epinephrine concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10&amp;nbsp;ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. [[Pheochromocytoma]] patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000–10,000&amp;nbsp;ng/L. Parenteral administration of epinephrine to acute-care cardiac patients can produce plasma concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raymondos K, Panning B, Leuwer M, Brechelt G, Korte T, Niehaus M, Tebbenjohanns J, Piepenbrock S | title = Absorption and hemodynamic effects of airway administration of adrenaline in patients with severe cardiac disease | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 132 | issue = 10 | pages = 800–3 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10819703 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-132-10-200005160-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=545–547 |isbn=0-9626523-7-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis and regulation==
[[File:Catecholamines biosynthesis.svg|thumb|right|250px|The biosynthesis of adrenaline involves a series of enzymatic reactions.]]
In chemical terms, epinephrine is one of a group of [[monoamine]]s called the [[catecholamine]]s. It is produced in some [[neuron]]s of the [[central nervous system]], and in the [[Medullary chromaffin cell|chromaffin cell]]s of the [[adrenal medulla]] from the [[amino acid]]s [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]].&lt;ref name="HalbachDermietzel2006"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = von Bohlen und Haibach | first1 = O | last2 = Dermietzel | first2 = R | name-list-format = vanc | title = Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators: Handbook of Receptors and Biological Effects | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AfmA_KJMjJAC&amp;pg=PA125 | year = 2006 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | isbn = 978-3-527-31307-5 | page = 125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epinephrine is synthesized in the medulla of the [[adrenal gland]] in an [[enzymatic pathway]] that converts the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] into a series of intermediates and, ultimately, epinephrine. Tyrosine is first oxidized to [[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]], which is subsequently decarboxylated to give [[dopamine]]. Dopamine is then converted to [[norepinephrine]] by [[dopamine beta-hydroxylase]]. The final step in epinephrine biosynthesis is the [[methylation]] of the [[primary amine]] of [[norepinephrine]]. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT) which utilizes [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe) as the [[methyl]] donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirshner N, Goodall M | title = The formation of adrenaline from noradrenaline | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 658–9 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13436503 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(57)90271-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While PNMT is found primarily in the [[cytosol]] of the [[endocrine]] cells of the [[adrenal medulla]] (also known as [[chromaffin cell]]s), it has been detected at low levels in both the [[heart]] and [[brain]].&lt;ref name ="Axelrod"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Axelrod | first = Julius | name-list-format = vanc | title = Purification and Properties of Phenylethanolamine-N-methyl Transferase|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=May 1962|volume=237|issue=5|pages=1657–1660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
The major physiologic triggers of adrenaline release center upon [[stress (medicine)|stresses]], such as physical threat, excitement, noise, bright lights, and high or low ambient temperature. All of these stimuli are processed in the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Nelson |first2=M. |last2=Cox | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |page=908 |isbn=0-7167-4339-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] and [[Dopamine beta-hydroxylase|dopamine β-hydroxylase]], two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} ACTH also stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[cortisol]], which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The sympathetic nervous system, acting via [[splanchnic nerve]]s to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of adrenaline. [[Acetylcholine]] released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, causing cell depolarization and an influx of [[calcium]] through [[voltage-gated calcium channel]]s. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release of adrenaline (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJpEbB9_c9MC|title=Pharmacology for Anesthetists 5, p52|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other hormones adrenaline (as with other catecholamines) does not exert [[negative feedback]] to [[down-regulate]] its own synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adrenaline – Epinephrine |url=http://www.worldofmolecules.com/emotions/adrenaline.htm |work=World of Molecules |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormally elevated levels of adrenaline can occur in a variety of conditions, such as surreptitious epinephrine administration, [[pheochromocytoma]], and other tumors of the [[sympathetic ganglia]].

Its action is terminated with reuptake into nerve terminal endings, some minute dilution, and metabolism by [[monoamine oxidase]] and [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyl transferase]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of catecholamine research}}
Extracts of the [[adrenal gland]] were first obtained by Polish physiologist [[Napoleon Cybulski]] in 1895. These extracts, which he called ''nadnerczyna'' ("adrenalin"), contained adrenaline and other catecholamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skalski JH, Kuch J | title = Polish thread in the history of circulatory physiology | journal = Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 57 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 5–41 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16766800 | url = http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/04_06_s1/articles/01_article.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; American ophthalmologist [[William Bates (physician)|William H.

==Society and culture==
===Adrenaline junkie===
{{See also|Novelty seeking}}
An ''adrenaline junkie'' is somebody who engages in sensation-seeking behavior through "the pursuit of novel and intense experiences without regard for physical, social, legal or financial risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Marvin | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sensation seeking and risky behavior|date=2007|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1591477387|edition=2. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activities include extreme and risky sports, substance abuse, unsafe sex, and crime. The term relates to the increase in circulating levels of adrenaline during physiological [[stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name="Jänig"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jänig|first1=Wilfrid | name-list-format = vanc |title=The integrative action of the autonomic nervous system : neurobiology of homeostasis|date=2006|publisher=UK|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521845182|pages=143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an increase in the circulating concentration of adrenaline is secondary to activation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the adrenal medulla, as it is rapid and not present in animals where the adrenal gland has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deane|first1=W.H.|last2=Rubin|first2=B.L. | name-list-format = vanc | title=The Adrenocortical Hormones Their Origin – Chemistry Physiology and Pharmacology|date=1964|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783662131329|pages=105|chapter=Absence of adrenal meduallary secretions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such stress triggers adrenaline release, it also activates many other responses within the central nervous system [[reward system]] which drives behavioral responses, so while the circulating adrenaline concentration is present, it may not drive behavior. Nevertheless, adrenaline infusion alone does increase alertness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frankenhaeuser M, Jarpe G, Matell G | title = Effects of intravenous infusions of adrenaline and noradrenaline on certain psychological and physiological functions | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 51 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 175–86 | date = 1961 | pmid = 13701421 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1961.tb02126.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has roles in the brain including the augmentation of memory consolidation.&lt;ref name="Jänig"/&gt;{{rp|147–8}}

'''Alexander David Goode''' (May 10, 1911&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1943) was a [[rabbi]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army]]. He was one of the [[Four Chaplains]] who gave their lives to save other [[soldier]]s during the sinking of the troop transport {{SS|Dorchester||2}} during [[World War II]]

==Life==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1911, Goode was one of four children of [[Brooklyn]] [[rabbi]] Hyman Goodekowitz.&lt;ref name="hs"&gt;"Chaplain Alexander Goode (1911-1943): Gave His Life for the Highest Duty," Student and Teachers Resources, Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in [[Washington, D.C.]], Goode excelled at sports at Eastern High School. He became a [[rabbi]] after graduating from the [[University of Cincinnati]] and in 1937 [[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC). While studying at HUC, he spent summers working as a rabbinic student at the [[Washington Hebrew Congregation]].&lt;ref name="hs"/&gt; In 1940, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He was married in 1935 to Teresa Flax, niece of [[Al Jolson]], with whom he had one daughter, Rosalie.

Goode served as a rabbi in [[Marion, Indiana]], and [[York, Pennsylvania]]. In 1941, Goode founded Boy Scout Troop 37 in York as a multi-cultural mixed race troop, the first troop in the U.S. to have scouts earn Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2010/10/camp-ganoga-1.html York Town Square] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213225805/http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2010/10/camp-ganoga-1.html |date=2011-02-13 }}, retrieved February 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same year, he applied to become a [[United States Navy|Navy]] chaplain but was turned down. The following year he was accepted into the [[United States Army|Army]], with orders to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he studied at the chaplain's school in preparation for deployment to [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]] followed by brief service at an [[airbase]] in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]]. In October 1942, he joined the other members of the Four Chaplains and was detailed to embark on the ''Dorchester'' a few months later.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.fourchaplains.org/goode.html Goode bio page, FourChaplains.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729105541/http://www.fourchaplains.org/goode.html |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Four Chaplains glass1.png|Four Chaplains|thumb|right]]
In late 1942, Goode was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], and attended Chaplains School at [[Harvard University]]. There he met fellow chaplains [[George L. Fox]], [[Clark V. Poling]] and [[John P. Washington]].
In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the ''Dorchester'', which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the [[United Kingdom]] via [[Greenland]].

On February 2, 1943, the German submarine [[German submarine U-223|''U-223'']] spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the ''Dorchester'' shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed [[Personal flotation device|life jackets]] from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave his to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the ''Dorchester'' disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.&lt;ref name="S4C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |title=The Saga of the Four Chaplains |accessdate=2008-02-05 |publisher=The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207070224/http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
[[File:Four Chaplains stamp1.png|thumb|left|Four Chaplains stamp, 1948]]
The four chaplains were all awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Purple Heart]] and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951, by President [[Harry S. Truman]] at [[Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia]]. The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism|Four Chaplains' Medal]] was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia, on January 18, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmc-fcm.htm | title = Federal Military Medals and Decorations | publisher = Foxfall Medals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goode is honored with a [[feast day]] along with the other [[Four Chaplains]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on February 3.

The '''Altamuran Revolution''' ({{lang-it|Rivoluzione di Altamura}}, also ''Rivoluzione altamurana'') was a three month period of self-government of Italian town [[Altamura]], right after the birth of the [[Parthenopean Republic]] (23 January 1799) which ousted the Bourbons and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The city of the Kingdom of Naples was then defeated and taken by the so-called [[Sanfedisti]], led by cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], after a battle on the city walls. After being defeated, most Altamurans managed to flee from ''porta Bari'', one of Altamura's main gates.

In February 1799, the news that the king had fled to [[Palermo]] arrived in Altamura. Altamura population then reorganized and embraced the ideals propagated by the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Arbre de la liberté|Liberty Tree]] was also planted in what it was then called ''piazza del mercato'' (today it's called ''piazza Duomo''). In the meantime, the [[Sanfedisti]],led by the cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], were getting closer and closer, determined to restore the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Bourbons]] dynasty. [[Sanfedisti]] left Matera and arrived at the gates of Altamura on 9 May 1799. Altamura had already fixed everything before the battle, by closing the secondary city gates, fusing the church bells in order to make new cannons and preparing ammunition. On 9 May, the battle took place, but soon Altamurans ran off of ammunition and they started to shoot coins. This let the enemy realize that the situation inside the city was critical and that they wouldn't last for long. On the night of 9 May  1799, most Altamurans managed to escape from ''porta Bari'' (perhaps accidentally or thanks to [[Fabrizio Ruffo | Ruffo]] unbeknown to his troops). On the morning of 10 May, [[Sanfedisti]] entered Altamura, sacking and slaughtering an unknown number of Altamurans who had remained there. The stay of [[Sanfedisti]] and [[Ruffo]] inside the city lasted 14 days, during which Altamurans gradually returned and some of them were killed or imprisoned. By the end of May 1799, the situation had already normalized and Altamura had returned under the full control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

The number of deaths among [[Sanfedisti]] has been estimated at around 1,400 people, but it is not clear how many [[Altamurans]] were killed. Some historians estimated the losses among Altamurans from about forty to a hundred people, while other historians suggested that many Altamurans and [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] people from other cities may have been counted as Sanfedisti. In this case, the death toll among Altamurans and Parthenopean Republicans would be much higher.

{{Buddhism}}
Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view. The Lancet 366, 952–955|journal=The Lancet|volume=366|issue=9489|pages=952–955|last=Keown|first=Damien|date=September 16, 2005|website=|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67323-0|pmid=16154024|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is much confusion as to when one is truly dead. Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Compassion ==
[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 011 The Buddha and Ananda tend a Sick Monk (9244516966).jpg|thumb|306x306px|The Buddha and Ananda tend a sick monk]]
[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are four classes of crimes in Iranian law: [[qisas|qesas]] crimes, [[hudud|hadd]] crimes, [[tazir]] crimes, and deterrent crimes.

=== Court system ===
In Iran, laws are created by the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]], also known as the Parliament of Iran ([[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]). They must be verified by the [[Guardian Council]] and signed by the [[President of Iran]]. The laws must be consistent with [[Sharia law|Sharia]], although many laws are derived from pre-revolution civil law, rather than Sharia. For example, while almost 80% of Iranian executions are for drug traffickers,&lt;ref name = BBCIran&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33635260|title= Iran executions see 'unprecedented spike' - Amnesty|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 23 July 2015|website= BBC News Middle East|publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date= 23 July 2015}}  The figures for 2015 are between 1 January and 15 July.&lt;/ref&gt; drug trafficking laws are part of Iranian civil law, not Sharia law.

There are three types of criminal courts. Criminal [[courts of first instance]] try serious crimes, hadd crimes, and qesas crimes, such as murder, rape, and theft. These courts can issue death sentences. Criminal courts of second instance try misdemeanors and contraventions. The [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]]s try offenses aimed against the state and its associated institutions. Crimes include smuggling (e.g. of drugs or weapons), terrorism, counterfeiting, and treason. The revolutionary courts can also issue death sentences.

In most cases (about 90%), executions are carried out in a provincial prison in the province where the crime took place. In serious cases, the criminal is publicly executed at the spot the crime was committed. Many serious criminals or drug-related criminals are sent to larger, more centralized prisons, such as [[Evin]] and [[Gohardasht]] Prisons in [[Tehran]] and [[Vakilabad Prison]] in [[Mashhad]].

A death sentence can be appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation of Iran, which can affirm or deny the sentence. If the Supreme Court of Cassation finds irregularities, it can send the case to a lower court for a retrial. There is no limit on the number of times that a defendant may appeal, but if guilt is established the Court will affirm the sentence. In murder and rape cases, the perpetrator can ask for forgiveness from the victim's family; in other cases, the perpetrator can ask for clemency from the "Amnesty and Pardons Commission" of Iran to reduce their sentences.

In 2011, an amendment to the Dangerous Drugs Act ended the official right of appeal for repeat drug offenders. Instead, they can directly appeal to the Prosecutor General of Iran. This change was made because the regular appeals courts were overloaded and could not carry out their work quickly due to a heavy volume of drug cases.

Often execution is delayed until the person completes a prison sentence. Some murder and rape cases are delayed for five years in order to maximize the possibility of forgiveness and reaching a settlement.

In Iran (as in other [[Muslim countries]]), there are two types of sentences resulting in death. The first is a "qesas-e-nafs" (retribution) sentence, when a murder victim's family refuses to forgive a murderer (see "[[Capital punishment in Iran#Qesas crimes (murder)|Qesas crimes]]" below). The other type is a regular death sentence, "hokm-e-edam", for crimes such as rape and drug trafficking. These sentences are completely separate in Iranian law, and this has created some confusion in news sources when authorities say that a murder will not result in "execution", but in "qesas".

In 2015, Amnesty International argued that executions in Iran were after sentences by courts that were almost always "completely lacking in independence and impartiality" and that "Trials in Iran are deeply flawed, detainees are often denied access to lawyers, and there are inadequate procedures for appeal, pardon and commutation."&lt;ref name = BBCIran/&gt;

=== Qesas crimes (murder) ===
In [[Sharia]] law, a [[Qisas|qesas]] crime is a class of crime that can be punished by retribution. The Sharia crime of intentional murder (ghatl-e-amd) is one crime punished by qesas, which in this case is a life for a life.

Diyyeh is a private settlement claim between the victim's family and the perpetrator. The victim's family has the option to forgive the criminal by accepting [[diyya]] (a financial settlement to compensate for the family's loss) rather than allowing the perpetrator to be executed. Because murder is considered a private matter between the perpetrator and the victim's family, the state may not commute a qesas-e-nafs sentence. The conviction, but not the sentence, can be appealed. Judges may only recommend the course of action the family takes, and in many cases ask the family to forgive the murderer.

In many cases, judges try to persuade the family to forgive the murderer, even at times pressuring them to do so. Often, a murder execution is delayed for five years after the murder was committed in order to persuade the family to exercise forgiveness, and allow time for the murderer to pay ''diyya''. If pardoned, the perpetrator still faces criminal penalties through the tazir code. Anybody who commits intentional murder must face a minimum of 2–3 years in prison, which is usually about the same time it takes to pay the diyya. Usually, longer sentences are given, and if other crimes were committed along with the murder, the person will serve a longer prison sentence, possibly even up to life imprisonment.

The perpetrator may be convicted for murder in the case of a confession, if there are two witnesses to the crime, if there are 50 sworn testimonies, and/or if one or more people testifies 50 times against the defendant. However, in practice, judges also allow circumstantial evidence.

Qesas cannot be applied in cases of self-defense or manslaughter, where the proof requirements above are not met, to minors (age 15 for boys, 9 for girls prior to 2008; after 2008, age 18 in most cases), to those declared insane, in a case where the victim is the perpetrator's spouse or spouse's lover and the perpetrator caught the spouse committing adultery, or in the case of a father murdering his children. In these cases, the perpetrator is punished through a tazir discretionary sentence, ranging from 2 years to life in prison. Sometimes the death penalty can be used regardless if the person has been found guilty of ''moharebeh'' ("spreading corruption on the earth"). Crimes of passion may not always be recognized as a legitimate defense, with the exception of a spouse caught committing adultery (punishable by imprisonment). People who murder in self-defense can usually be released after paying blood money to the victim's family, and the courts would usually help to facilitate that.

In the case of manslaughter or insufficient proof, the perpetrator is not required to pay diyya. If a murderer was working under someone else's orders and can prove it, they may receive a tazir punishment such as imprisonment, fines and/or whipping, but sometimes even death. In these cases, the person(s) who ordered the killing are subject to qesas or diyyeh. If a woman is killed carrying an unborn [[child]] after the first trimester, it is considered the murder of two people.

If the family demands retribution, they cannot receive diyya, although they may receive some minor civil restitution. Most cases (2/3) are resolved through diyya. Qesas executions are a minority of executions in Iran, consisting of 20–30% (although those executed for other crimes may have committed murder previously).

Diyya tables are set every year by the Iranian government. Diyya is equivalent to the price of 100 camels, and must be paid in cash. Diyya is doubled if the intentional murder is committed during the holy months [[Ramadan]] and [[Muharram]]. However, in practice, diyya is negotiated between the parties and they generally settle for more or less diyyeh than the official amount. If the person cannot pay diyya, he would be held in prison until the amount is paid, even if his regular discretionary prison sentence ends. Usually his/her family/friends are expected to help raise the amount, or in some cases the state can pay for it.

According to the official tables, the family of a female victim receives half the amount of diyya due to the family of a man (though the amount is equal in accidental death cases);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7953282.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran women to get equal insurance | date=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in practice, diyyeh is negotiated and usually the amount is equal, especially in recent years.

Before 2004, non-Muslims would receive half the diyya of a Muslim, but the law was changed to give Muslims and non-Muslims equal diyya.

=== Tazir/deterrent crimes ===
In Islamic criminal jurisprudence, a [[tazir]] crime is a crime that is punished according to a judge's discretion. A "deterrent crime" is a crime with a fixed sentence. Tazir punishments should generally be less severe. There are no strict proof requirements as there are for hadd. Tazir and deterrent crimes are often comparable to a [[misdemeanor]], though not in cases where the crime is deemed to be equal to a moharebeh/mofsed-fel-arz crime (see above).

Arms smuggling is punishable by death or life in prison if the offense is deemed to be at the level of "moharebeh". Possession, sale, and/or use of illegal military weapons may be punishable by death or life in prison.

Human trafficking is punishable by death or life in prison if the trafficked person was under 18 years of age or if rape, murder, or financial exploitation occurred. Operation of prostitution rings is also punishable by death, as well as "making large-scale pornographic websites". A person operating a [[blog]], website, or any type of internet application that is deemed to spread "corruption", "insulting of Islam", "terrorism/violence", or "treason" may be punishable by death. In most cases, lesser penalties are given.

Large scale fraud or counterfeiting if enough to disrupt the "financial stability of the Islamic Republic", or "intentionally aimed at undermining the government" is punishable by death or life in prison if at the level of "mofsed-fel-arz". In addition, people who act against the Islamic Republic or are convicted of terrorism can be sentenced to death for moharebeh/mofsed-fel-arz.

According to Iran's Anti-Narcotics Law, possession of narcotics is a felony punishable by death or life imprisonment if:

# The person is found in possession of over 30&amp;nbsp;grams (1.1 ounce) of heroin, morphine, cocaine, LSD, methamphetamine, or similar drugs. The death sentence is not applied for first offenses where the sale was not completed or the amount was less than 100&amp;nbsp;grams (3.5 ounces), or for repeat offenses where collective amount was 30–100&amp;nbsp;grams.
# The person is found in possession of over 5000&amp;nbsp;grams/5 kilograms (11.02&amp;nbsp;lbs) of opium, hasish, or cannabis. The death sentence is not applied for first offenses where the sale was not completed and the amount was less than 20 kilograms. The death sentence is also applied on the third conviction for possession of 5–20&amp;nbsp;kg of such drugs.
# The person is found in possession of more than five kilograms of prescription or industrial drugs for illegal use, or is a repeat offender possessing 5-20 kilograms of such drugs.
# The person is a repeat offender convicted with growing opium poppies for drug use, or cannabis.
# The person is convicted of armed smuggling of any illegal narcotics, committing an armed crime while in possession of drugs, or being a member or head of a narcotics trafficking gang.

In drug cases, a record of the amount of drugs a person is caught with is kept, so that the information is available in the event of a later arrest. Once a certain cumulative amount above is reached, the person is sentenced to the death penalty or life imprisonment. The offense should be deemed tantamount to "mofsede-fel-arz" in order for the perpetrator to be executed.

Drug crimes, smuggling, and crimes against the stability of the country are tried in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Court|Revolutionary Court]] system, a special court that handles such cases relating to national security. In 2011, the right of appeal was revoked for certain drug crimes, and instead the case must be appealed to the Prosecutor-General of Iran. [[Mitigating factor]]s allow the judge to give a lesser penalty of life imprisonment (which can be decreased upon appeal). In practice, the majority of dealers get a prison sentence on first offense, but on the second or third offense, they are executed or sentenced to life imprisonment. In armed drug smuggling cases, the prisoner often must serve a prison sentence prior to execution (typically 5–10 years). Most executed drug dealers have been implicated in other crimes at some point (including theft, robbery, rape, and murder).

Iran is currently fighting a major drug war on its provinces in the east, primarily [[Sistan and Baluchistan]] province and parts of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] province. Since Iran borders [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], the two largest opium-producing countries in the world, Iran is a major trafficking route to Europe and the west. Since 2000 up to 2,000 Iranian soldiers have died fighting armed drug cartels and smugglers. Most of Iran's executions are related to drug trafficking&amp;mdash;a recent announcement by the judiciary said that 74% of executions in Iran were drug-related.&lt;ref name="stopthedrugwar.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Iran |url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/may/31/iran_hang_300_drug_trafficking |title=Iran to Hang 300 for Drug Trafficking |website=StoptheDrugWar.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, according to Iran's vice-president for women and family affairs, [[Shahindokht Molaverdi]], in an unnamed village in Sistan and Baluchistan every adult male was executed on drugs charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|title=Iran executed all adult men in one village for drug offences, official reveals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/all-adult-males-in-one-iranian-village-executed-for-drug-offences-official-says|accessdate=10 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Every Man in an Iranian Village Was Executed for Drug Offenses|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/26/every-man-in-an-iranian-village-was-executed-for-drug-offenses/|accessdate=10 March 2016|work=FP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 lawmakers proposed a bill to end capital punishment for drug offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingdrugs.org/increasing-iran-support-for-ending-death-penalty-for-drug-offences|title=Iranian Lawmakers Mull Ending Death Penalty for Drug Offences|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A justice minister also supported the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37810437|title=Iran minister: 'Kill fewer criminals'|date=29 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hadd crimes ===
Hadd crimes are a class of crime laid down in the [[Koran]] and considered to be comparable to [[felony|felonies]]. Some of these laws are part of Iran's penal code, while others are not. Their punishments are laid down in the Koran and [[Hadith]]. Hadd crimes must be proven by confession, two witnesses (four witnesses in the case of adultery), or in rare cases, by "judge's knowledge" (where, based on available evidence, the defendant's guilt is extremely obvious). If the prosecution cannot provide the proof for a hadd crime, it is tried as a lesser tazir crime. The application of hadd crimes differ significantly in Iran from what is prescribed by classical Sharia. Conviction for these require a high proof rate, and cannot be given when there is any reasonable doubt. All hadd crimes also have a tazir penalty, and in most cases the perpetrator is sentenced to the tazir penalty. If a perpetrator is repentant, the hadd punishment could be pardoned.

In the majority of cases, people who commit a hadd offensive would be given tazir punishments such as imprisonment or fines, but in some serious cases the hadd punishment could be given in addition to it.

[[Moharebeh]] (waging war against God or people) is a crime where a weapon is used with violence to "create fear or disruption against national security and citizens", such as armed robbery, kidnapping and treason.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It is punishable by death or imprisonment, usually for life. In cases of armed robbery/kidnapping (or even rape), the death penalty is usually applied if a person died as a result of the perpetrator's actions, or public order was compromised.

Similarly a court could find that if a person's crimes (of any type) were heinous enough, and the person is a continued threat to society, they are guilty of [[Mofsed-e-filarz|"Mofsede-Fel-Arz"]] (spreading corruption on the earth), which is a related crime and punishable by death/imprisonment.

However, moharebeh and mofsede-fel-arz are famous for being political charges disguised as religious crimes. These are often levied against those involved in espionage, treason, activism, opposition to the government, or terrorism. In 2008, "operation of prostitution rings" and "running pornographic websites/businesses" were added to the list. Large scale economic crimes that disrupt the economy are also punishable by death if the perpetrator is found guilty of mofsede-fel-arz. Belonging to an armed anti-regime opposition group or being part of "riotous disturbances"/ "armed acts" against the state are punishable by death or imprisonment if the perpetrator is found guilty of moharebeh.

==== Adultery/sex crimes ([[zina]]) ====

===== Adultery =====
Adultery (zina-e-mohsen) is punishable by 100 lashes for unmarried people and by death on the fourth offense. It is punishable by death by stoning (under moratorium since 2002, officially replaced in 2012, by an unspecified punishment) for married people and in all cases of incest. If an unmarried non-Muslim male has sexual relations with a Muslim female, the non-Muslim male will be put to death. Four witnesses (rather than two witnesses) are required to prove adultery, the person must confess four times, or they must be convicted by judge's knowledge (through definite circumstantial evidence). If the person confesses twice and is "repentant" or the victim's family forgives the adulterer, the judge can give a tazir sentence of 99 lashes instead, or imprisonment. Convictions and executions for this crime are extremely rare, usually only carried out in the case of death and rare even then.{{what?|reason=whose death? how many is rare?|date=May 2016}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Between 1979 and 2002, 40–76 adultery/incest executions (by stoning) were recorded for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/06/iranian-family-campaigns-to-save-mother-from-stoning/ |title=News &amp; latest headlines from AOL |publisher=Aolnews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407052017/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/06/iranian-family-campaigns-to-save-mother-from-stoning/ |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2002, allegedly eight men were stoned to death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notonemoreexecution.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/facts-and-figures-on-stoning-in-iran/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730110705/http://notonemoreexecution.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/facts-and-figures-on-stoning-in-iran/ |archivedate=30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one woman hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=05152016Sun |url=http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137 |title=Iran Focus |publisher=Iran Focus |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527025228/http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137 |archivedate=27 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the actual numbers are higher, the punishment is nonetheless very rare especially in proportion to confirmed cases of adultery. The punishment is given mostly in aggravated circumstances when the four witnesses or a confession is available and the spouse died. Most adulterers go unpunished, or receive a lighter sentence. Divorce is usually the most common method in dealing with adultery.

===== Rape =====
Rape (zina-be-onf) is related to adultery, has the same proof requirements, and is punishable by death by hanging. In Iran, for most part, convictions are made either by confession or "judge's knowledge", rather than witnesses. 10–15% of executions in Iran are for rape.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In many cases the rape victim settles the case by accepting compensation (jirah) in exchange for withdrawing the charges or forgiving the rapist. This is similar to diyyeh, but equal to a woman's dowry. A woman can also receive diyya for injuries sustained. Normally the rapist still faces tazir penalties, such as 100 lashes and jail time for immoral acts, and often faces further penalties for other crimes committed alongside the rape, such as kidnapping, assault, and disruption of public order.

===== Sodomy =====
Sodomy ([[sodomy|lavat]]) is punishable by death. The judge can determine the type of death, but in practice it is always hanging. The proof requirements are the same as for adultery and such sentences are very rare. If one of the consenting participants was under 18, the punishment is 100 lashes for the minor. If the guilty is repentant, they generally receive a reduced sentence of 99 lashes. All people convicted of sodomy spend one year in prison in addition, and can be sentenced to more prison time at the judge's discretion. Few people are sentenced to death for sodomy, but prior to 2012, both partners could receive the death penalty.

Sodomy rape (lavat-be-onf) is punishable by death for the rapist. Proof requirements and procedure are the same as regular rape. Most sodomy executions are for rape, not consensual sodomy.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===== Other zina crimes =====
[[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy (murrtaad)]] is not codified in the penal code, but is nevertheless subject to prosecution by Iranian courts, due to the primary role of Sharia in the legal system. Some two hundred members of the Baha'i religion, an indigenous but proscribed form of apostasy, have been hanged,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} while many have been and are imprisoned. A range of serious and petty sanctions are routinely placed on the Baha'i community, including a ban on young adherents attending university. The death sentence could be given for a male, though the last such execution was in 1990. A case is [[Youcef Nadarkhani]], an Iranian Christian Pastor sentenced to death for apostasy 21–22 September 2010 in the province of Gilan, but the sentence has not been carried out. For women, the maximum sentence is life in prison.

Blasphemy (sabb-al-nabi) of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], his daughter, or his family is a crime in Iran, and a blasphemer would be found guilty of apostasy as well by default. Blasphemy is punishable by death or imprisonment.

For all other hadd crimes, the fourth offense would be a capital offense, unless the person repents. 
 
Other hadd crimes include incest, theft (serghat-e-haddi), lesbianism (mosahegheh), false accusation of sex crimes (ghazf), pimping (ghavvadi), and [[drunkenness]] (shurb-e-khamr). However, for all but the most serious cases the crime is punished through the tazir code and the judge gives a discretionary sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUk6t1nAXFa3ad089KI4vUxY87WA?docId%3DCNG.ddc0305146893ec9e9e6796d743e6af7.311 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629154332/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUk6t1nAXFa3ad089KI4vUxY87WA?docId=CNG.ddc0305146893ec9e9e6796d743e6af7.311 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of alcohol (one glass) is punished by 80 lashes, but repeated offences may lead to death penalty although rarely exercised. In 2012, two men were sentenced to death after a third offense in Khorasan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-25/two-iranians-sentenced-to-death-for-drinking-alcohol-afp-says |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628130805/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-25/two-iranians-sentenced-to-death-for-drinking-alcohol-afp-says |archivedate=28 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court, but it may be commuted to flogging if the convicted repent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_814837.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625110250/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_814837.html |archivedate=25 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is uncertain if it also applies to drug crimes. Most drinking cases are settled through tazir punishments (e.g. imprisonment and/or fines) rather than whipping.

=== Offenders under age 18 ===
The execution of minors in Iran has been a major issue for human rights groups and the Western media.&lt;ref name="holdouts"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75159/section/3 The Last Holdouts. Iranian Legislation and Practice] Hrw.org, 10 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2009, there were at least 137 known juvenile offenders awaiting execution in Iran, but the total number could be much higher as many death penalty cases in Iran are believed to go unreported. Of the 43 child offenders recorded as having been executed since 1990, 11 were still under the age of 18 at the time of their execution while the others were either kept on death row until they had reached 18 or were convicted and sentenced after reaching that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/background-information-stop-child-executions-in-iran |title=Background Information: Stop Child Executions in Iran &amp;#124; Amnesty International USA |website=Amnestyusa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422213041/http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/background-information-stop-child-executions-in-iran# |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a teenage girl of the age of 16, [[Atefah Sahaaleh]], was sentenced to death, and executed two weeks later by hanging in a public square for the charges of adultery and "crimes against chastity".&lt;ref name="16yo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/5217424.stm |title=Execution of a teenage girl|date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentenced while underage, include at least one at 13-year-old (executed when 21 years old)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-execution-child-offender-makwan-moloudazdeh-mockery-justice-2007120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311113632/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-execution-child-offender-makwan-moloudazdeh-mockery-justice-2007120 |archivedate=11 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another at 14-year-old (executed when 18 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhr.net/spip.php?article2896 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001210451/http://iranhr.net/spip.php?article2896 |archivedate=1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran, according to human rights groups, is the world's largest executioner of juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-17-child-executions_N.htm |title=Iranian activists fight child executions - USATODAY.com |website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enmcr.net/site/assets/files/1382/child_execution_in_iran_and_its_legality_under_islamic_law.pdf |format=PDF |title=CHILD EXECUTION IN IRAN AND ITS LEGALITY UNDER THE ISLAMIC LAW |website=Enmcr.net |accessdate=2016-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045053/http://www.enmcr.net/site/assets/files/1382/child_execution_in_iran_and_its_legality_under_islamic_law.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhowellmp.com/news/execution-of-children-in-iran/435 |title=News |publisher=John Howell MP |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been ascribed to the difference in definition of a "minor" between non-Muslim and (some) Muslim countries. Article 49 of the Islamic Penal Code in Iran defines a child as "someone who has not reached the age of puberty (bulugh) as stipulated by Islamic law and as specified in the 1991 Civil Code as 15 lunar years for boys and nine lunar years for girls.&lt;ref name="holdouts"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-17-child-executions_N.htm Iranian activists fight child executions], Ali Akbar Dareini, [[Associated Press]], 17 September 2008; accessed 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6244126.stm Iran rapped over child executions], Pam O'Toole, [[BBC]], 27 June 2007; accessed 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, Iran's Supreme Court has commuted non-murder death sentences to 2–8 years in prison.

In February 2012, Iran adopted a new penal code, which officially banned the death penalty for minors under the age of 18&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozorgmehr |first=Najmeh |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b17bd2a-5590-11e1-9d95-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/home_uk/feed//product#axzz1mCB25Yc4 |title=Tehran to abandon death by stoning |publisher=FT.com |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of "social penalties" and "educational programs". Minors who commit murder when aged 15–18 can still receive the death penalty in rare cases if the judge is confident that the perpetrator had reached full adult mental development at the time of the crime and that it was committed intentionally with a well thought-out plan. For minors by default and for young adults (older than 18) with low mental development, execution is not used and the perpetrator is prosecuted in a [[juvenile court]]. Iran uses the lunar [[Islamic calendar]] to determine the age of criminal responsibility, which is shorter than the standard [[solar calendar]], so as a result some people sentenced to death at the age of 18 would be 17 years old in solar calendar years.

Although Iran is the focus of juvenile executions, other countries such as [[Sudan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] legally carry them out, while others such as China, Nigeria, and Pakistan allegedly carry them out illegally with little focus from international organizations.{{failed verification|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; Until 2005, some US states also carried out juvenile executions (see [[Roper v. Simmons]]).

== Methods ==
=== Hanging ===
Hanging is the only common method of execution in 21st-century Iran, usually carried out in prison.

Compared to other countries that use hanging (such as [[Japan]] or [[Malaysia]]) with a complex gallows designed to drop the condemned and break the neck, Iran's gallows are very simple and inexpensive. They consist only of a frame and a stool, with some stools able to hold up to seven people at a time and having wheels. Public executions are usually carried out by a mobile crane. Sometimes the victim is suspended from the crane, but more often the crane is used as a gallows and the person is pulled off of a stool (see [[Upright jerker]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace |first=Mark |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/06/opinion/la-oe-wallace-cranes-iran-20110706 |title=Iran's execution binge |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian nooses are thick, with 7–10 knotted coils, and are often made of blue plastic rope with little to no drop. Death is caused by strangulation and carotid reflex (where blood vessels to the head are cut off), taking 10–20 minutes. In most cases the condemned loses consciousness quickly, as seen in most videos of Iranian executions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Famous hangings in Iran include [[Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri]] in 1908, and serial killer [[Mohammed Bijeh]] the "Desert Vampire", who raped and murdered 17 boys in 2005. At dawn on 27 July 2007, 29 men were hanged in [[Evin Prison]] on various charges of murder and drug trafficking. In 2010, [[Shahla Jahed]] was hanged in Tehran for the 2002 murder of the wife of Iran footballer [[Nasser Mohammadkhani]]. In 2006, a teenage girl of the age of 16, [[Atefah Sahaaleh]], was sentenced to death, and executed two weeks later by hanging in a public square for the charges of adultery and "crimes against chastity".&lt;ref name="16yo"/&gt; In 2009, a public execution of two men in [[Sirjan]] for armed robbery was broken up when relatives stormed the gallows and cut the men down while still alive; they were later recaptured and hanged until dead. A video of the incident was posted on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBTE8sJCLtA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player |title=Revolt against execution in Sirjan-Iran 4 dead 30 wounded |date=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firing squad ===
The [[firing squad]] is legal, but seldom used in Iran today. Historically it was used for military and political crimes. In 1974 under the Shah's regime, Marxist activists [[Khosrow Golesorkhi]] and [[Keramat Daneshian]] were executed by firing squad on charges of conspiring to kidnap [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], the Crown Prince of Iran. They were shot after a televised trial in Tehran. This case was one of the big events that turned public opinion against the [[Shah]]. During the reign of the Shah, 1,000 or more people were sentenced to death for crimes against the government, mostly by firing squad after conviction by a special SAVAK military tribunal. After the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|1953 coup]], scores of Communists were executed. Many known figures and dissidents also died under suspicious circumstances, and were possibly murdered by SAVAK (such as wrestler [[Gholamreza Takhti|Gholam-Reza Takhti]], [[Ali Shariati|Dr. Ali Shariati]], and Ayatollah Khomeini's son [[Mostafa Khomeini|Mostapha Khomeini]]). Common criminals were executed mostly by hanging in this period.

In the years after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of 1979]], thousands of people were sentenced to be shot for political offenses, drug trafficking, and crimes against the Islamic Republic by the newly established Revolutionary Courts. These included many of the Shah's former ministers such as former [[Prime Minister]] [[Amir Abbas Hoveida]], head of [[SAVAK]] General [[Nematollah Nassiri]]. By 1980, over 700 people had been shot. Many of the members of the former regime are suspected to have been unjustly executed in biased trials. A campaign against drug trafficking resulted in the executions of many for drug possession, including addicts, often based on minimal evidence. Some of these people were also alleged opponents of the regime. Many executions also took place after the Kurdistan revolt of 1979–80.

While the number of executions had dropped by 1980, after the start of the Iran-Iraq War a crackdown on dissidents, political opponents, and common criminals was responsible for another increase in executions. From 1981–1984, after Mujahedeen-e-Khalq bombings killing many government officials, a crackdown against opponents and terrorist groups such as the [[PMOI|Mujahedeen-e-Khalq]] organization resulted in the execution of hundreds or possibly thousands of people. Many others were hanged or shot for other crimes such as adultery, robbery, murder, and drug trafficking.

In 1982, a purge of the communists in Iran (such as the [[Tudeh Party]]) resulted in executions of the party's leaders and some members on charges of spying for the [[Soviet Union]]. Political executions continued on a lesser scale. When the [[Judicial System of Iran|Islamic Penal Code of Iran]] was adopted in 1982, ordinary crimes began to be punished by hanging once again by regular, non-Revolutionary courts. Political opponents continued to be shot by Revolutionary Courts, but on a lesser scale.

In 1988, after an invasion by the [[Mujahideen-e Khalq|Mujahideen-e-Khalq]] organization (see [[Operation Mersad]]), the government [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|secretly executed 2,000–4,000 political prisoners]], many former members or sympathizers of the Mujahedeen group, former communists, and other dissidents. Those executed had all renounced their former ties to their old opposition organizations and many were about to finish their prison sentences when they were suddenly and secretly executed. The charges were "moharebeh" or apostasy, seen by critics as a gross example of using a religious charge for political reasons. They were executed by hanging for most part, but a few were executed by firing squad.

Since 1988, political executions have been less common, although extrajudicial killing of high-profile regime opponents continued until 1998, such as the [[Chain murders of Iran|Chain murders]]. Since the late 1980s, virtually all executions have been carried out by hanging, both political or criminal. 

Critics{{who|date=June 2018}} of the Revolutionary Courts complained about the process, stating that the trials lacked defense attorneys, were too short (often lasting hours, even minutes), and could not be appealed and that there was a lack of evidence and convictions were often based on strong rumors, with political opponents being unjustly prosecuted and sentences. Critics also complained that the judges were biased, unfair, too rigid, used the death sentence much too often, and applied the death penalty to undeserving people. There were also criticisms of confessions obtained through torture. When asked what if a person was wrongfully executed, one of the judges{{who|date=July 2017}} said that an innocent person "Would receive a reward by God in heaven", so little care was taken to see if the accused were actually guilty.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Ayatollah Khomeini himself was sentenced to death by firing squad for treason against the Shah in 1964, by a military court, but his sentence was commuted to exile in Iraq ([[General]] [[Hassan Pakravan]], another head of SAVAK who helped commute Khomeini's sentence, was one of the first shot upon Khomeini's return). 

One of the most famous "hanging" judges in Iran was a cleric, [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], the first head of the Revolutionary Court, who sentenced drug traffickers and former members of the Shah's government alike to be shot. He personally sentenced 800–2,000 people to death. In 1980, [[Jahangir Razmi]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his famous photo "Firing Squad in Iran", which showed seven Kurds and two Shah's policemen being executed minutes after being convicted for "terrorism and crimes against God" by Khalkhali in the airport in [[Sanandaj]], during a revolt by Kurdish armed groups. Their trial lasted 30 minutes.

After many years of not being used, the firing squad was last used in 2008, to execute a man convicted of raping 17 children, according to the Fars News Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20080126-46811.html |title=Iran firing squad executes man who raped 17 children |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stoning ===
{{Further|Stoning|Rajm}}
Individuals sentenced to stoning are placed in a stoning pit, buried to the neck (women) or waist (men) and others hurl stones at them until they escape the stoning pit, are incapacitated, or are dead, but because men (unlike women) are only buried to the waist, men infrequently but occasionally do escape the stoning pit, which terminates the penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136068.htm|title=Iran|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoning to death was blocked as legal punishment by Khomeini's order in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sid.ir/fa/VEWSSID/J_pdf/29213881506.pdf |format=PDF |title=اجراي سنگسار در زمان حكومت غير معصوم (با تاكيد بر دوران معاصر) |website=Sid.ir |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it officially was removed from the code and replaced by an unspecified death penalty.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt; In theory, it could still be used as a punishment because the penal code allows judges to impose sentencing according to "valid Islamic sources" and Sharia punishments, although it is unlikely due to the fact it would require high burdens of evidence.&lt;ref name="Justice for Iran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justiceforiran.org/news/ipc/?lang=en|title=Justice For Iran Press Release: Ratification of the Islamic Penal Code; Iran to Continue Passage of Laws to Violate Human Rights|accessdate=4 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910062342/http://justiceforiran.org/news/ipc/?lang=en|archivedate=10 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following vociferous domestic and international controversy over stoning in the early years of the Islamic Republic, the government placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002.&lt;ref name=meydaan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |author=Rochelle Terman |title=The Stop Stoning Forever Campaign: A Report |format=PDF |date=November 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128142135/http://stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, the Iranian judiciary spokesman Jamal Karimirad was quoted as saying, "Stoning has been dropped from the penal code for a long time, and in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out."&lt;ref name="Iran denies execution by stoning"/&gt; In 2007 and 2009, Western organizations claimed the moratorium was broken in two cases for men being stoned for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJRNUIStK50C&amp;pg=RA1-PA45 |title=Global Security: Iran : Fifth Report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of ... - Great Britain.

=== Falling from heights ===
[[Iran]] may have used this form of execution for [[homosexuality]]. According to [[Amnesty International]] in 2008, Tayyeb Karimi and Yazdan were convicted of abduction, rape and theft and sentenced to death by a judge in Shiraz, Fars province, southern Iran, in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.amnesty.se/uaonnet.nsf/dfab8d7f58eec102c1257011006466e1/fd0b99f84da0da71c12573d7003a87a5?OpenDocument&amp;Click=# |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004923/http://www2.amnesty.se/uaonnet.nsf/dfab8d7f58eec102c1257011006466e1/fd0b99f84da0da71c12573d7003a87a5?OpenDocument&amp;Click=# |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were to be thrown off a cliff or from a great height.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/010/2008/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ordered that they be executed in the way described.

== Typical execution ==

=== In prison ===
Although, by law, all executions must take place in "public", the place is not specified. In most cases, executions take place in the main prison of the county or province where the crime took place, in front of witnesses (family, prosecutors, other prisoners).

Criminals from Tehran are hanged in [[Evin Prison]] (and according to some reports in [[Ghezel Hesar Prison]] in some cases). In the [[Karaj]] area, [[Gohardasht Prison]] carries out executions. Tehran's [[Qasr Prison]] also conducted executions until it closed in 2005. In [[Mashhad]], executions are carried out in [[Vakilabad Prison]]. The gallows are typically located in a large indoor shed, or in a remote courtyard.

1–2 days prior to the execution, the prisoner is informed of their execution date and moved to [[solitary confinement]]. In murder cases (and often rape cases), both the victim's and prisoner's family are required to be there by law, in order to keep the possibility of a forgiveness settlement open. In non-murder executions, sometimes the prisoner's family is informed after the fact. Usually the condemned may see relatives prior to the execution. The prisoner's attorney may also attend the execution.

Executions are carried out at 4&amp;nbsp;am local time, just before the call for morning [[salat]] (prayer). When the platform is moved away, the condemned dies of strangulation and loss of blood to the brain. Usually they fall unconscious within seconds. If the condemned struggles after being released, the prison guards will typically pull down on the rope to speed up the death.

In the case of a murder, the victim's next of kin is allowed to pull the stool out from under the condemned. There have been occasions where the victim's family pardoned the murderer right at the foot of the gallows. A few times, the person was pardoned and cut down from the gallows after surviving the hanging process.

=== In public ===
{{Main|Public executions in Iran}}
Public executions in Iran are less common, sometimes applied to those found guilty of crimes such as gang rape, child murder, murder during an armed robbery, or massive drug trafficking. Public executions were restricted between the 1920s and 1950s for most part, but became common after the Islamic Revolution, usually carried out from mobile cranes. In 2008, Iran banned public execution; however, the moratorium has not gone into effect as of 2011 according to amnesty international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/31/iran.international | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Robert | last=Tait | title=Iran bans public executions amid death sentence boom | date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/us-iran-executions-idUSTRE73Q7VV20110427 | work=Reuters | title=Iran steps up rate of public executions: Amnesty | date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/sharp-rise-public-executions-iran-executes-first-juvenile-offenders-2011-2011-04-27 |title=Everything you need to know about human rights. &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take place when the prosecutor requests and the judge accepts that since the criminal's crimes were so terrible they "caused public outrage", the criminal must die at the spot where the crime was committed. The Supreme Court must also approve the sentence. It is estimated that about 5–10% of executions are carried out in public, usually around 6&amp;nbsp;am local time. 
 
In 2002, the "Black Vultures", the nickname of a group of five men who assaulted and gang raped dozens of women in northern Tehran, were hanged in public from cranes, two in the main bus terminal and three in the main square of [[Lavizan]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2287381.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran hangs rapists in public | date=29 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2007, [[Maijid and Hossein Kavousifar]] were hanged in downtown Tehran for murdering a judge, as well as shooting and killing two innocent bystanders during an earlier bank robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-472376/Smirking-murderer-led-gallows-children-join-crowds-public-executions-Iran.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Smirking murderer is led to the gallows as children join crowds at public executions in Iran | date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majid was unrepentant of his crime and laughed into the cameras before he was hanged. They were executed at the intersection where they murdered Judge [[Hassan Moghaddas]]. A video of him and other criminals describing their crimes was also posted on [[YouTube]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

On 5 January 2011, a man only identified by Iranian media as "Yaghub" was hanged in the main square of the [[Sa'adat Abad]] district in Tehran, where he had in October 2010 murdered a man by repeatedly stabbing him and then stood over the victim while he bled to death threatening to kill anyone who intervened. The murder was recorded on a [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/Politics/Iran-Convicted-murderer-hanged-in-Tehran-square_311498206202.html |title=Adnkronos |publisher=Adnkronos |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11983514 | work=BBC News | title=Iran soul-searching over murder in the streets | date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further examples ===
*[[Asghar the Murderer]] was executed for raping and killing 33 young adults.
*[[Mohammed Bijeh]] was executed for raping and killing 16 young boys and 2 adults.
*[[Amirhossein Pourjafar]] was executed for rape, murder and body mutilation of a 7-year old girl.
*[[Saeed Hanaei]] was executed for killing 16 female prostitutes and drug addicts.

=== Controversies ===
In July 2005, the [[Iranian Student News Agency]] covered the execution of [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni]] in [[Mashhad]] who as initially reported by Iranian sources were executed for committing homosexual acts, however, when disturbing photos of the hanging were widely distributed around the Internet and drew international attention and condemnation it resulted in subsequent allegations by the Iranian regime that they were executed for the rape of a 13-year-old boy.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,297982,00.html Iran Does Far Worse Than Ignore Gays, Critics Say], ''[[Fox News]]'', 25 September 2007; accessed 20 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The executions of the two teenagers divided the human rights community over whether it was a gay issue, but all human rights groups condemned the hangings as they were for crimes allegedly committed when the boys were minors.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/witnesses-execution Witnesses to an Execution], Richard Kim, ''[[The Nation]]'', 7 August 2005; accessed 20 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial report from the Iranian Student News Agency, a government press agency, had stated that they were hanged for sodomizing and raping a 13-year-old boy (his father was interviewed about the case in the local Mashad newspaper). Online gay advocacy groups such as [[OutRage!]] asserted that they were hanged for being homosexuals; other groups, in light of evidence that the teenagers were convicted of rape, emphasized that the executions were a violation of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Iran is a signatory to both), which prohibit the execution of minors.&lt;ref name=Kim/&gt; After the international outcry, the Iranian government repeated once again that the hangings were for raping the boy. [[Human Rights Watch]], while not agreeing with the brutality of the hangings, stated it was "deeply disturbed about the apparent indifference of many people to the alleged rape of a 13-year-old". However, others still allege that they were hanged for being gay. Later that year, another two young men, referred to in the media by their first names, Mokhtar and Ali, were hanged in the northern city of Gorgan for &lt;I&gt;lavat&lt;/i&gt; (sodomy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran: Two More Executions for Homosexual Conduct|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/11/21/iran-two-more-executions-homosexual-conduct|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Arash Rahmanipour]] and [[Mohammad-Reza Ali-Zamani|Mohammad-Reza Ali Zamani]] were hanged in Tehran for [[moharebeh]], alleged terrorism, and being a member of the banned [[Kingdom Assembly of Iran]]. When they were executed, their execution was falsely reported as being connected to the [[Iran election protests|2009 election protests]], possibly in order to intimidate the opposition, despite their arrest months before the election. [[Abdolreza Ghanbari]]'s moharebeh death sentence for protesting in the [[2009 Ashura protests]] was upheld in March 2012, meaning that his execution could be carried out at any time. In 2012, 5 [[Ahwazi Arabs]] were hanged in retaliation for the alleged death of a policeman during riots a year before. In 2011, when the riots originally took place, 9 men were hanged in retaliation for alleged "deaths and rapes" during the riots, three of them in public. One of them was 16 years old when hanged.

In 2011, two policemen were hanged in Tehran for beating to death three protesters in the [[Kahrizak detention center|Kahrizak Detention Center]] during the 2009 election protests. However, some high-level officials were protected from prosecution for the murders.

In 2014, [[Reyhaneh Jabbari]] was hanged for killing a man she alleged was trying to sexually abuse her, despite an international campaign that sought to avoid her execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29769468 |title=Iran's hanging of Reyhaneh Jabbari condemned |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/amnesty-iran-set-hang-woman-at-dawn-2014102422855125759.html |title=Iran hangs woman despite international uproar |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2014-10-26 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2016, Reza Hosseini, 34, was executed in Ghezel Hesar prison on alleged drug charges after a revolutionary court trial that lasted a couple of minutes. His wife insists Hosseini was innocent. She says Hosseini was arrested because he got into an altercation with the authorities, and the drugs were actually discovered by authorities in another place. Hosseini never pleaded guilty. At that Judge Tayerani replied: "If you are innocent, then you will go to heaven after you are hanged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhr.net/en/articles/2517/ |title=Iran Human Rights &amp;#124; Article: Story of a recent execution: If you're innocent, you'll go to heaven after you're hanged &amp;#124; |website=Iranhr.net |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deathpenaltynews.blogspot.fr/2016/05/iran-judge-to-drug-defendant-if-youre.html |title=Death Penalty News: Iran Judge to Drug Defendant: 'If you're innocent then you'll go to heaven after you're hanged' |website=Deathpenaltynews.blogspot.fr |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles the Bold''' (also translated as '''Charles the Reckless''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ernest|title=Cassall's New French Dictionary|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|page=362|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Charles le Téméraire}}, {{lang-nl|Karel de Stoute}}, 10 November 1433&amp;nbsp;– 5 January 1477), baptised '''Charles Martin''', was [[Duke of Burgundy]] from 1467 to 1477. He was the last Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] from the [[House of Valois]].

His early death at the [[Battle of Nancy]] at the hands of [[Swiss mercenaries]] fighting for [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]], was of great consequence in European history. The Burgundian domains, long wedged between the growing powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Habsburg]] Empire, were divided, but the precise disposition of the vast and disparate territorial possessions involved was disputed among the European powers for centuries.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Charles the Bold was born in [[Dijon]], the son of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Isabella of Portugal (1397–1471)|Isabella of Portugal]]. Before the death of his father in 1467, he bore the title of [[Count of Charolais]]; afterwards, he assumed all of his father's titles, including that of "Grand Duke of the West". He was also made a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]] just twenty days after his birth, invested by [[Charles I, Count of Nevers]], and the seigneur de [[Croÿ]].

Charles was brought up under the direction of Jean d'Auxy&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Gunn and A. Janse, ''The Court As a Stage: England And the Low Countries in the Later Middle Ages'', (Boydell Press, 2006), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and early showed great application alike to academic studies and warlike exercises. His father's court was the most extravagant in Europe at the time, and a centre for the arts and commerce. While he was growing up, Charles witnessed his father's efforts to unite his far-flung and ethnically diverse dominions into a single state, and his own later efforts centered on continuing and securing his father's successes in this endeavor.

In 1440, at the age of seven, Charles was married to Catherine, daughter of King [[Charles VII of France]] and sister of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (later King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]). She was five years older than her husband, and she died in 1446 at the age of 18. They had no children.

[[File:Van der weyden miniature.jpg|thumb|left|Charles as a boy stands next to his father, Philip the Good. [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s frontispiece to the ''Chroniques de Hainaut'', c. 1447–8 ([[Royal Library of Belgium]])]]

In 1454, at the age of 21, Charles married a second time. He wanted to marry a daughter of his distant cousin [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] (a sister of Kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England]]), but under terms of the [[Congress of Arras|Treaty of Arras]] of 1435, he was required to marry a French princess. His father chose [[Isabella of Bourbon]], who was three years younger than he was. Isabella was the daughter of Philip the Good's sister [[Agnes of Burgundy, Duchess of Bourbon|Agnes]] and a very distant cousin of Charles VII of France. Isabella died in 1465. Their daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] was Charles' only surviving child; she inherited all the Burgundian domains before her marriage to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], the son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III]].

Charles was on friendly terms with his brother-in-law Louis, the Dauphin of France, who had been a refugee at the court of Burgundy from 1456 until he succeeded his father as king of France in 1461. But Louis began to pursue some of the same policies as his father, for example Louis's later repurchase of the towns on the [[Somme River]] that Louis's father had ceded in 1435 to Charles's father in the Treaty of Arras, which Charles viewed with chagrin. When his father's failing health enabled him to assume the reins of government (which Philip relinquished to him by an act of 12 April 1465), he initiated a policy of hostility toward Louis XI that led to the [[Burgundian Wars]], and he became one of the principal leaders of the [[League of the Public Weal]], an alliance of west European nobles opposed to policies of Louis XI that sought to centralize the royal authority within France.

For his third wife, Charles was offered the hand of Louis XI's daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]]. The wife he ultimately chose, however, was his second cousin [[Margaret of York]] (who was also a great-grandchild of [[John of Gaunt]]). Upon the death of his father in 1467, Charles was no longer bound by the terms of the Treaty of Arras, and he decided to ally himself with Burgundy's old ally England. Louis did his best to prevent or delay the marriage with Margaret (he even sent French ships to waylay her as she sailed to Sluys), but in the summer of 1468, it was celebrated sumptuously at [[Bruges]], and Charles was made a [[Knight of the Garter]]. The couple had no children, but Margaret devoted herself to her stepdaughter Mary. After Mary's death many years later, she kept Mary's two infant children as long as she was allowed.

===Early battles===
On 12 April 1465, Philip relinquished control of the government of his domains to Charles, who spent the next summer prosecuting the [[War of the Public Weal]] against Louis XI. Charles was left master of the field at the [[Battle of Montlhéry]] on 13 July 1465,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vaughan, ''Charles the Bold'', (Boydell Press, 2002), 251.&lt;/ref&gt; but this neither prevented the king from re-entering [[Paris, France|Paris]] nor did it assure Charles of a decisive victory. He succeeded, however, in forcing upon Louis the [[Treaty of Conflans]] of 4 October 1465, by which the king restored to him certain towns on the [[Somme (river)|Somme River]], the counties of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Guînes]], and various other small territories. During the negotiations for the treaty, his wife Isabella died suddenly at Les Quesnoy on 25 September, making a political marriage suddenly possible. As part of the treaty, Louis promised him the hand of his infant daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]], with the territories of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Ponthieu]] as a [[dowry]], but no marriage ever took place. In the meanwhile, Charles obtained the surrender of [[Ponthieu]].

Charles' concentration on the affairs of France was diverted by the [[Liège Wars|Revolt of Liège]] against his father and the bishop of Liège ([[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège|Louis of Bourbon]]) and a desire to punish the town of [[Dinant]] in the province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]. During the wars of the summer of 1465, Dinant celebrated a false rumour that Charles had been defeated at Montlhéry by burning him in [[effigy]] and chanting that he was the bastard child of his mother Isabella of Portugal and John of Heinsburg, the previous Bishop of Liège (d. 1455). On 25 August 1466, Charles marched into Dinant, determined to avenge this slur on the honour of his mother, and sacked the city, killing every man, woman and child within. After the death of Charles' father Philip the Good in 1467, the Bishopric of Liège renewed hostilities, but was defeated by Charles at the [[Battle of Brustem]]. Charles made a victorious entry into Liège, dismantled its walls and stripped the city of some of its privileges.

===Treaty of Péronne===
[[File:Karte Haus Burgund 4 EN.png|thumb|Territories of the house of Valois-Burgundy during the reign of Charles the Bold.]]
{{main|Treaty of Péronne (1468)}}
[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8647 Carolus Audax.tif|thumb|Engraving of Charles the Bold]]

Alarmed by the early successes of the new Duke of Burgundy and anxious to settle various questions relating to the execution of the Treaty of Conflans, Louis XI requested a meeting with Charles and daringly placed himself in his hands in the town of [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]] in [[Picardy]] in October 1468. In the course of the negotiations, the duke was informed of a fresh revolt of the [[Bishopric of Liège]] secretly fomented by Louis as part of the [[Liège Wars]]. After deliberating for four days on the best way to deal with his adversary, who had foolishly placed himself at his mercy, Charles decided to respect the promise he had given to guarantee Louis's safety and to negotiate with him. At the same time, he forced Louis to assist him in quelling the revolt in Liège. The town was captured and many inhabitants were massacred. Louis chose not to intervene on behalf of his former allies.

At the expiry of the one year's truce that followed the [[Treaty of Péronne (1468)|Treaty of Péronne]], the French king accused Charles of [[treason]], cited him to appear before the [[parlement]], and seized some of the towns on the Somme in 1471. The duke retaliated by invading France with a large army; he took possession of [[Nesle]] and massacred its inhabitants. He failed, however, in an attack on [[Beauvais]] and had to content himself with laying waste to the countryside as far as [[Rouen]]. He eventually withdrew without attaining any useful result.

===Domestic policies===
Charles pursued domestic policies that assisted the growth of his military establishment. To this end, he relinquished at least some of the extravagance that had characterized the court of Burgundy under his father, if not the magnificence of ceremonial events. Since the beginning of his reign, he  employed himself in reorganizing his army and the administration of his territories. While retaining the principles of [[Feudalism|feudal recruiting]], he endeavored to establish a system of rigid discipline among his troops that was strengthened by the employment of foreign mercenaries, particularly [[Englishmen]] and [[Italians]], and the augmentation of his [[artillery]]. The economic power that Charles inherited from Philip would lead to an independent judicial system, a sophisticated administration, and the establishment of local estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|page=124|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building a kingdom===
Charles constantly sought to expand the territories under his control. In 1469, [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]] sold him the County of [[Ferrette]], the Landgraviate of [[Alsace]], and some other towns, reserving to himself the right to repurchase.

In 1472–1473, Charles bought the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] of the Duchy of [[Guelders]] (i.e. the right to succeed to it) from its duke [[Arnold, Duke of Gelderland|Arnold]], whom he had supported against the rebellion of his son. Not content with being "the Grand Duke of the West," he conceived the project of forming a kingdom of Burgundy or Arles with himself as independent [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and even persuaded the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] to assent to crown him a king at [[Trier]]. The ceremony, however, did not take place owing to the emperor's precipitate flight by night in September 1473, which was occasioned by his displeasure at the duke's ambitions.

At the close of 1473, the duchy of Burgundy was anchored in France and extended to the edges of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]]. This made Charles the Bold one of the wealthiest and most powerful nobles in Europe. Indeed, his landholdings and revenue base rivalled those of many of the royal families.&lt;ref&gt;Great Events from History,''The Renaissance &amp; Early Modern Era'', Vol. 1 (1454–1600), article author-Clare Callaghan, {{ISBN|1-58765-214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1474, Charles began to involve himself in the series of political struggles that would ultimately bring about his downfall. He first came into conflict with the [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]], to whom he refused to restore his possessions in Alsace for the stipulated sum. Then, he quarreled with the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy#The Burgundy Wars|Swiss]], who supported the free towns in the Upper Rhine in their [[Burgundian Wars#The conflict|revolt]] against the tyranny of the ducal governor [[Peter von Hagenbach]] (who was condemned by a special international tribunal and executed on 9 May 1474). Finally, he antagonized [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]], with whom he disputed the succession in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], which bordered many of his territories. All of these enemies readily joined forces against their common adversary Charles.

Charles suffered a first rebuff in endeavouring to protect his kinsman [[Ruprecht of the Palatinate (Archbishop of Cologne)|Ruprecht of the Palatinate]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], against his rebel subjects. He spent ten months (July 1474 – June 1475) besieging the little town of [[Neuss]] on the [[Rhine]] (the [[Siege of Neuss]]), but was compelled by the approach of a powerful imperial army to raise the siege. Moreover, the expedition he had persuaded his brother-in-law Edward IV of England to undertake against Louis XI was stopped by the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] of 29 August 1475. He was more successful in Lorraine, where he seized [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] on 30 November 1475.

From Nancy he marched against the Swiss. He saw fit to hang or drown the garrison of [[Grandson, Switzerland|Grandson]] in spite of its capitulation. Grandson was a possession of [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]], a close ally of Charles, that had been captured recently by the forces of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. Some days later, on 2 March 1476, Charles was attacked outside the village of [[Concise]] by the confederate army in the [[Battle of Grandson]] and suffered a shameful defeat; he was compelled to flee with a handful of attendants and abandon his artillery along with an immense booty (including his silver bath).

Charles succeeded in raising a fresh army of 30,000 men that he used to fight the [[Battle of Morat|Morat]] on 22 June 1476. He was again defeated by the Swiss army, which was assisted by the cavalry of the Duke of Lorraine. On this occasion, unlike the debacle at Grandson, little booty was lost, but Charles did lose about one third of his entire army. The defeated soldiers were pushed into the nearby lake, where they were drowned or shot at while trying to swim to safety on the opposite shore. On 6 October, Charles lost Nancy, which the Duke of Lorraine was able to recover.

===Death at Nancy===
Making a last effort, Charles formed a new army and arrived in the dead of winter before the walls of Nancy. Having lost many of his troops through the severe cold, it was with only a few thousand men that he met the joint forces of the Lorrainers and the Swiss, who had come to the relief of the town, at the [[Battle of Nancy]] (5 January 1477). He himself perished in the fight, his naked and disfigured body being discovered some days afterward frozen in the nearby river. Charles' head had been cleft in two by a [[halberd]], lances were lodged in his stomach and loins, and his face had been so badly mutilated by wild animals that only his physician was able to identify him by his long fingernails and the old battle scars on his body.

Charles' battered body was initially buried in the ducal church in Nancy, by [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

[[File:Catherine of France, Isabella of Bourbon &amp; Margaret of York.JPG|thumb|The wives of Charles the Bold.]]

==Marriage and family==
Charles married three times:

1. On 19 May 1440, he married Catherine of France (1428–1446), daughter of [[Charles VII of France]] and [[Marie of Anjou]].&lt;ref name="Troyes106"&gt;Chrétien de Troyes, ''Les Manuscrits de Chrétien de Troyes'', Vol. 2, edited by Keith Busby, Terry Nixon, Alison Stones, and Lori Walters, (Rodopi, 1993), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the marriage, she was 12 and he 6. She died at 18.

2. On 30 October 1454, he married Isabelle of Bourbon (1437–1465), daughter of Charles I of Bourbon.&lt;ref name="Troyes106" /&gt; He would have preferred to marry [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter|Anne of York]] (the daughter of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]), but his father insisted that he fulfill the conditions of the Treaty of Arras, which committed him to marry a French princess. The marriage was a happy one and produced his only offspring, [[Mary of Burgundy]] 13 February 1457.&lt;ref name="Troyes106" /&gt;

3. On 3 July 1468, Charles married Anne's sister, [[Margaret of York]] (1446–1503);&lt;ref name="Troyes106" /&gt; her siblings also included [[Edward IV of England]], [[George, Duke of Clarence]], and [[Richard III of England]]. The marriage was solemnized at [[Damme]], near [[Bruges]], by the bishop of Salisbury.

The Burgundian possessions passed into the Habsburg empire on the marriage of his one child and heiress Mary to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]].

==Byname==
Burgundian chroniclers described the personality of the duke as austere, virtuous but without pity, pious and chaste, and with an exacerbated sense of honour. His contemporaries named him ''le Hardi'' or ''der Kühne'' ("the Bold") or ''le Guerrier'' ("the Warrior") or ''le Terrible'' ("the Terrible"),&lt;ref&gt;a title derived from his savage behaviour against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471.  Frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning more than 2000&amp;nbsp;towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S, ''Isabel of Burgundy'', pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; among others, and the epithet that would become his byname in history, ''le Téméraire'' ("the Reckless"), is already found in Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who wrote around 1484.
These bynames, however, in the 15th century were used as qualifications of his character, but not yet in any systematic fashion, the duke being simply known as ''Charles de Bourgogne''.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Le Cam, ''Charles le Téméraire, un homme et son rêve'', éditions In Fine, 1992, pp. 11, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of the epithet ''le Téméraire'' acquiring the nature of a byname was gradual. In the 17th century, the ''Grand Dictionnaire Historique'' of Louis Moreri mentions ''Charles de Bourgogne, surnommé le Guerrier, le Hardi ou le Téméraire''.
In the 18th century,  Dom Plancher still mentions him as ''Charles le Hardi''.
In the 19th century, the byname of ''le Téméraire'' became standard in France and Belgium.

==Legacy==
[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|Map of France in 1477; the Burgundian territories are shown in orange]]
Charles left his unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]], as his heir; clearly her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. Both Louis and the Emperor had unmarried eldest sons; Charles had made some movements towards arranging a marriage between Mary and the Emperor's son, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], before his own death.
Louis unwisely concentrated on seizing militarily the border territories, in particular the Duchy of Burgundy (a French fief). This naturally made negotiations for a marriage difficult. He later admitted to his councillor [[Philippe de Commynes]] that this was his greatest mistake. In the meantime the Habsburg Emperor moved faster and more purposefully and secured the match for his son Maximilian, with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret.

Due to this marriage, much of the Burgundian territories passed to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Throughout the early modern [[European Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] and [[End of World War II in Europe|down to 1945]], the border between the Holy Roman Empire and the [[kingdom of France]], and later between [[France]] and [[Germany]] (specifically, concerning [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and [[Flanders]]), would be a matter of dispute.

==In literature==
He is a main character in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s 1823 novel ''[[Quentin Durward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/durward.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as intelligent, though brash. The timeline was manipulated by the author for dramatic purposes. He is  also a principal character in Scott's later novel ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7853/7853-h/7853-h.htm#link2H_4_0001 Author's Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/publications/criticism/2005.html#curthoysdocker2005 Curthoys, Ann, and John Docker.

==Overview==

The term "cognitive liberty" was coined by [[neuroethics|neuroethicist]] Dr. [[Wrye Sententia]] and legal theorist and lawyer [[Richard Glen Boire]], the founders and directors of the non-profit [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/index.html Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics] (CCLE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sententia|first=Wrye|chapter=Freedom by Design: Transhumanist Values and Cognitive Liberty|title=The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology and Philosophy of the Human Future|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sententia and Boire define cognitive liberty as "the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full power of his or her mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  FAQ - Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE) | work = General Info  | publisher = Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics | date= 2003-09-15  | url = http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/faqs/faq_general.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sententia and Boire conceived of the concept of cognitive liberty as a response to the increasing ability of technology to monitor and manipulate cognitive function, and the corresponding increase in the need to ensure individual cognitive autonomy and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia divides the practical application of cognitive liberty into two principles:

#As long as their behavior does not endanger others, individuals should not be compelled against their will to use technologies that directly interact with the brain or be forced to take certain psychoactive drugs.
#As long as they do not subsequently engage in behavior that harms others, individuals should not be prohibited from, or criminalized for, using new mind-enhancing drugs and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 227&lt;/ref&gt;

These two facets of cognitive liberty are reminiscent of [[Timothy Leary|Timothy Leary's]] "Two Commandments for the Molecular Age", from his 1968 book ''The Politics of Ecstasy'':

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
  | Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy fellow man
  | Thou shalt not prevent thy fellow man from altering his own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=Timothy|title=The Politics of Ecstasy|date=1968|publisher=Ronin Publishing|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1579510310|page=95|url=https://archive.org/details/ecstaspoliticsof00learrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Supporters of cognitive liberty therefore seek to impose both a negative and a positive obligation on states: to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, and to allow individuals to self-determine their own "inner realm" and control their own mental functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

This first obligation, to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, seeks to protect individuals from having their mental processes altered or monitored without their consent or knowledge, "setting up a defensive wall against unwanted intrusions".&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Ongoing improvements to [[neurotechnology|neurotechnologies]] such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[electroencephalography]] (or "brain fingerprinting"); and to pharmacology in the form of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[Nootropics]], [[Modafinil]] and other [[psychoactive drugs]], are continuing to increase the ability to both monitor and directly influence human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blitz|first=Marc Jonathan|title=Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|date=2010|issue=1049|pages=1053–1055, 1058–1060|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=marc_jonathan_blitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|title=The Brain on the Stand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many theorists have emphasized the importance of recognizing cognitive liberty in order to protect individuals from the state using such technologies to alter those individuals’ mental processes: "states must be barred from invading the inner sphere of persons, from accessing their thoughts, modulating their emotions or manipulating their personal preferences."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty has been raised in relation to a number of state-sanctioned interventions in individual cognition, from the mandatory psychiatric 'treatment' of homosexuals in the US before the 1970s, to the non-consensual administration of psychoactive drugs to unwitting US citizens during [[CIA]] [[Project MKUltra]], to the forcible administration of mind-altering drugs on individuals to make them competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part I|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=1999|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/curriculum/oncoglib_123.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). ''[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition]'', in the case of ''Sell v United States''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futurist]] and bioethicist [[George Dvorsky]], Chair of the Board of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has identified this element of cognitive liberty as being of relevance to the [[autism rights movement|debate]] around the curing of [[autism spectrum]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dvorsky|first=George|title=Cognitive liberty and the right to one's mind|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/dvorsky20091020|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke University School of Law]] Professor [[Nita Farahany]] has also proposed legislative protection of cognitive liberty as a way of safeguarding the protection from self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, in the light of the increasing ability to access human memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farahany|first=Nita|title=Incriminating Thoughts|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 2012|volume=64|pages=405–406|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5321&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this element of cognitive liberty is often defined as an individual’s freedom from ''state'' interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual’s mental "inner realm".&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Bublitz and Merkel propose the introduction of a new criminal offense punishing "interventions severely interfering with another’s mental integrity by undermining mental control or exploiting pre-existing mental weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Direct interventions that reduce or impair cognitive capacities such as memory, concentration, and willpower; alter preferences, beliefs, or behavioral dispositions; elicit inappropriate emotions; or inflict clinically identifiable mental injuries would all be ''prima facie'' impermissible and subject to criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68-70&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia and Boire have also expressed concern that corporations and other non-state entities might utilize emerging neurotechnologies to alter individuals' mental processes without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom to self-determine===
Where the first obligation seeks to protect individuals from interference with cognitive processes by the state, corporations or other individuals, this second obligation seeks to ensure that individuals have the freedom to alter or enhance their own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who enjoys this aspect of cognitive liberty has the freedom to alter their mental processes in any way they wish to; whether through indirect methods such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]] or [[prayer]]; or through direct cognitive intervention through [[psychoactive drugs]] or [[neurotechnology]].

As psychotropic drugs are a powerful method of altering cognitive function, many advocates of cognitive liberty are also advocates of drug law reform; claiming that the "[[war on drugs]]" is in fact a "war on mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part II|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=2000|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/2jcl/2JCL7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCLE, as well as other cognitive liberty advocacy groups such as [http://cognitivelibertyuk.wordpress.com/ Cognitive Liberty UK], have lobbied for the re-examination and reform of prohibited drug law; one of the CCLE's key guiding principles is that: "governments should not criminally prohibit cognitive enhancement or the experience of any mental state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Freedom in Mind|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/mission.html|publisher=Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for reform of restrictions on the use of prescription cognitive-enhancement drugs (also called smart drugs or [[nootropics]]) such as [[Prozac]], [[Ritalin]] and [[Adderall]] have also been made on the grounds of cognitive liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1058-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty is also of great importance to proponents of the [[transhumanism|transhumanist movement]], a key tenet of which is the [[human enhancement|enhancement]] of human mental function. Dr Wrye Sententia has emphasized the importance of cognitive liberty in ensuring the freedom to pursue human mental enhancement, as well as the freedom to choose against enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia argues that the recognition of a "right to (and not to) direct, modify, or enhance one's thought processes" is vital to the free application of [[List of emerging technologies#Neuroscience|emerging]] [[neurotechnology]] to enhance human cognition; and that something beyond the current conception of freedom of thought is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 355-6&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia claims that "cognitive liberty's strength is that it protects those who do want to alter their brains, but also those who do not".&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with recognized human rights==
Cognitive liberty is not currently recognized as a human right by any international human rights treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt; While [[freedom of thought]] is recognized by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), freedom of thought can be distinguished from cognitive liberty in that the former is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''whatever'' they want, whereas cognitive liberty is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''however'' they want.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty seeks to protect an individual’s right to determine their own state of mind and be free from external control over their state of mind, rather than just protecting the content of an individuals’ thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that the lack of protection of cognitive liberty in previous human rights instruments was due to the relative lack of technology capable of directly interfering with mental autonomy at the time the core human rights treaties were created.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; As the human mind was considered invulnerable to direct manipulation, control or alteration, it was deemed unnecessary to expressly protect individuals from unwanted mental interference.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt; With modern advances in [[neuroscience]] and in anticipation of its future development however, it is argued that such express protection is becoming increasingly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive liberty then can be seen as an extension of or an "update" to the right to freedom of thought as it has been traditionally understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Freedom of thought should now be understood to include the right to determine one’s own mental state as well as the content of one’s thoughts. However, some have instead argued that cognitive liberty is already an inherent part of the international human rights framework as the principle underlying the rights to freedom of thought, expression and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to think in whatever manner one chooses is a "necessary precondition to those guaranteed freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Waterman]] and [[Casey William Hardison]] have argued that cognitive liberty is fundamental to Freedom of Thought because it encompasses the ability to have certain types of experiences, including the right to experience altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, 345&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that cognitive liberty can be seen to be a part of the inherent [[dignity]] of human beings as recognized by Article 1 of the UDHR.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Most proponents of cognitive liberty agree however that cognitive liberty should be expressly recognized as a human right in order to properly provide protection for individual cognitive autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farahany, 405-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 226-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal recognition==

===In the United States===
{{main|Sell v. United States}}
Richard Glen Boire of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics filed an [[amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] with the [[US Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Sell v. United States]]'', in which the Supreme Court examined whether the court had the power to make an order to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to an individual who had refused such treatment, for the sole purpose of making them [[competence (law)|competent]] to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf "Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition, in the case of Sell v United States"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/166/case.html ''Sell v. United States'' 539 U.S. 166 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In the case of [[Casey William Hardison|''R v Hardison'']], the defendant, charged with eight counts under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (MDA), including the production of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[LSD]], claimed that cognitive liberty was safeguarded by [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Hardison [2007] 1 Cr App R (S) 37&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison argued that "individual sovereignty over one's interior environment constitutes the very core of what it means to be free", and that as psychotropic drugs are a potent method of altering an individual's mental process, prohibition of them under the MDA was in opposition to Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 433&lt;/ref&gt; The court however disagreed, calling Hardison's arguments a "portmanteau defense" and relying upon the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN Drug Conventions]] and the earlier case of ''R v Taylor'' to deny Hardison's right to appeal to a superior court.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison was convicted and given a 20-year prison sentence, though he was released on 29 May 2013 after nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Drug policy reform|Human enhancement}}

While there has been little publicized criticism of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical about the wisdom of recognizing cognitive liberty as a right.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1063&lt;/ref&gt; [[political philosophy|Political philosopher]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Michael J. Sandel]], when examining the prospect of [[Nootropics|memory enhancement]], wrote that "some who worry about the ethics of cognitive enhancement point to the danger of creating two classes of human beings – those with access to enhancement technologies, and those who must make do with an unaltered memory that fades with age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandel|first=Michael J.|title=The Case against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674036383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty then faces opposition obliquely in these interrelated debates.

'''Cristian Ricardo Lucio Mijares''' (born October 2, 1981 in [[Gomez Palacio]], [[Durango]]) is a retired [[Mexicans|Mexican]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]]. Mijares is the former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Super Flyweight]] Champion. Cristian is the older brother of prospect [[Ricardo Mijares]] and the nephew of world title contender [[Vicente Mijares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Early life ==
Cristian comes from a large boxing family. His younger brother is a [[Lightweight]] prospect [[Ricardo Mijares]] and his uncle is a former world title contender [[Vicente Mijares]].

== Professional career ==
On June 3, 2006 Mijares knocked out Adalberto Davila in six rounds for the Mexican [[Super Flyweight]] title.

=== WBC Super Flyweight Championship ===
On September 18, 2006 he defeated former champion [[Katsushige Kawashima]] for the [[Interim championship|Interim]] [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] title, by a split decision. The Official scorers saw it 114-113, 113-114, 114-113. He was later promoted to full champion after reigning champion [[Masamori Tokuyama]] vacated his title on December 6, 2006 in anticipation of retiring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?ID=154333 N.Korean boxer Tokuyama gives up WBC super-flyweight title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he defeated Katsushige Kawashima in a rematch via a tenth round knock out.

On April 14, 2007 Mijares defended his title by beating two time Light Flyweight Champion [[Jorge Arce]] by unanimous decision in a particularly bloody match for Arce, who saw his first defeat since 1999. Mijares won the fight by a wide margin, with the official judges scoring the match 119-109, 118-110, 117-111, all in favor of Mijares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.eurosport.com/boxing/sport_sto1150112.shtml
|title=Mijares defeats Arce to retain WBC junior bantamweight title 	
|publisher=Eurosport.com 	
|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mijares returned just 3 months later, beating Teppei Kikui, dominating and then stopping him in 10 rounds in front of his hometown crown in Mexico. Mijares made quick work of obscure journeyman Franck Gorjux stopping him in just 1 round.
	 	
In February 2008, Mijares returned to the United States and was featured on a [[HBO]] pay-per-view under card against Flyweight Olympian [[José Navarro (boxer)|Jose Navarro]], the early rounds belonged to Mijares, while the middle rounds were evenly matched with Mijares finishing strong in the later rounds. Mijares retained his title with a Split Decision victory.

=== WBA Super Flyweight Championship ===
Mijares unified his WBC Super Flyweight title by defeating [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Champion [[Alexander Munoz]] via split decision on May 17, 2008. After several close opening rounds, Mijares took control with his crisp counterpunching and brilliant defense, with the win being secured by many dominant late rounds in which he managed to hurt Munoz. This win made him the WBA (Super) Champion. With the victory, Mijares earned a spot in the top 10 pound for pound list.

Mijares made a return August 30 in Mexico, where he defended his two crowns against a 38-year-old former WBC Flyweight Champion [[Chatchai Sasakul]]. Sasakul had lost his title to [[Manny Pacquiao]] in 1998 and had not fought any world class opposition since. Mijares easily controlled the contest with his jab and counterpunching, eventually stopping Sasakul in round 3 after dropping him in the previous round.

Mijares was most recently knocked out by [[Vic Darchinyan]] in the 9th round, losing his WBC and WBA Super Flyweight titles to the Armenian-born Australian in a surprising upset. Although he had three defeats prior to his bout with Darchinyan, this was the first time Mijares had been stopped.

He went up in weight and challenged [[Nehomar Cermeño]] for the Interim WBA [[Bantamweight]] title on March 14, 2009. Mijares lost by split decision. He fought Cermeño again on September 12, 2009 for that same title but lost by unanimous decision. Two days later, Mijares announced his retirement from boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IBF Super Flyweight Championship ===
On December 11, 2010 Mijares became a two-time world champion by beating [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Super Flyweight]] Champion [[Juan Alberto Rosas]].

In May 2011, Cristian made his first defence, a victory over contender Carlos Rueda.

==Retirement==
On June 16, 2018, Mijares headlined his retirement card before a partisan crowd at Gómez Palacio, losing by third round knockout to [[Wilfredo Vázquez Jr.]] of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fightnews.com/vasquez-kos-mijares-in-bitter-farewell-bout/23687|title=Vasquez KOs Mijares, ruins ring farewell|author=Gabriel F.

'''Caylee Marie Anthony''' (August 9, 2005 – 2008) was an American girl who lived in [[Orlando|Orlando, Florida]], with her mother, Casey Marie Anthony (born March 19, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/casey-anthony-20660183|work=Biography Channel|title=Casey Anthony|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her maternal grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony. On July&amp;nbsp;15, 2008, she was reported missing in a {{nowraplinks| [[9-1-1]]}} call made by Cindy, who said she had not seen Caylee for 31 days and that Casey's car smelled like a dead body had been inside it. Cindy said Casey had given varied explanations as to Caylee's whereabouts before finally telling her that she had not seen Caylee for weeks.&lt;ref name=ListonMay312011&gt;Liston, Barbara.[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/31/us-crime-anthony-idUSTRE74U5W720110531 "On 911 call, Casey Anthony said tot was missing for 31 days"], Reuters, May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Casey lied to detectives, telling them Caylee had been kidnapped by a nanny on June&amp;nbsp;9, and that she had been trying to find her, too frightened to alert the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Travis.

==Disappearance==
According to Casey Anthony's father, George Anthony, Casey left the family's home on June&amp;nbsp;16, 2008,&lt;ref name="CB1" /&gt; taking her two-year-old daughter Caylee (who was almost three) with her and did not return for 31 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/27538935/detail.html |work=ClickOrlando |title=Former Anthony Attorney: Casey Lied |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417073539/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/27538935/detail.html |archivedate=April 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey's mother Cindy asked repeatedly during the month to see Caylee, but Casey claimed that she was too busy with a work assignment in [[Tampa, Florida]].

On July 13, 2008, while doing yard work, Cindy and George Anthony found a notice from the post office for a certified letter affixed on their front door. George picked up the certified letter from the post office on July&amp;nbsp;15, 2008, and found that his daughter's car was in a tow yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/17546432/detail.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524180809/http://www.wesh.com/news/17546432/detail.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |title=Documents Reveal New Evidence Against Anthony |publisher=WESH.com |date=September 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When George picked up the car, both he and the tow yard attendant noted a strong smell coming from the trunk.

Investigators brought Casey to Universal Studios on July&amp;nbsp;16, 2008, the day after Caylee was reported missing, and asked her to show them her office. Casey led police around for a while before admitting that she had been fired years before.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Liston,

The defense, led by Jose Baez, claimed in opening statements that Caylee drowned accidentally in the family's pool on June&amp;nbsp;16, 2008, and was found by George Anthony, who told Casey she would spend the rest of her life in jail for child neglect and then proceeded to cover up Caylee's death. Baez argued this is why Casey Anthony went on with her life and failed to report the incident for 31 days. He alleged that it was the habit of a lifetime for Casey to hide her pain and pretend nothing was wrong because she had been sexually abused by George Anthony since she was eight years old and her brother Lee also had made advances toward her.&lt;ref name="blame"/&gt; Baez also questioned whether Roy Kronk, the meter reader who found the bones, had actually removed them from another location, and further alleged that the police department's investigation was compromised by their desire to feed a media frenzy about a child's murder, rather than a more mundane drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/05/24/opening-statements-begin-casey-anthony-murder-trial/|title=Caylee Anthony's Family 'Appalled' After Casey Anthony's Attorney Blames Them for Death|work=Fox News|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted that Casey had lied about there being a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzales.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Pavuk, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-07-08/news/os-casey-anthony-zenaida-deposition-20110708_1_defamation-case-casey-anthony-george-anthonyCasey Anthony: Transcript of murder trial opening statement filed in defamation case], Orlando Sentinel, July 08, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baez asked an FBI analyst about the paternity test the FBI conducted to see if Lee was Caylee's father. She told the jury the test had come back negative.&lt;ref name=ABCStickers&gt;Jessica Hopper, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-trial-paternity-test-father-brother/story?id=13855375 Casey Anthony Trial: Defense Casts Shadow on Heart Stickers Found With Caylee's Remains ], [[ABC News]], June 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a photo on the computer of Ricardo Morales, an ex-boyfriend of Casey Anthony, depicting a poster with the caption "Win her over with Chloroform," Morales said that the photo was on his [[Myspace]] page and that he had never discussed chloroform with Anthony or searched for chloroform on her computer.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt;

The prosecution called John Dennis Bradley, a former Canadian law enforcement officer who develops software for computer investigations, to analyze a data file from a desktop taken from the Anthony home.&lt;ref name="Chloroform"/&gt; Bradley said he was able to use a program to recover deleted searches from March&amp;nbsp;17 and March&amp;nbsp;21, 2008, and that someone searched the website Sci-spot.com for "chloroform" 84 times. Bradley expressed his belief that "some of these items might have been bookmarked". Under [[cross-examination]] by the defense, Bradley agreed there were two individual accounts on the desktop and that there was no way to know who actually performed the searches.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

[[Police dog|K9]] handler Jason Forgey testified that Gerus, a [[German Shepherd]] [[Cadaver dogs|cadaver dog]] certified in 2005, indicated a high alert of human decomposition in the trunk of Casey's car, saying the police dog has had real-world searches numbering "over three thousand by now". During cross-examination, Baez argued that the dog's search records were "hearsay".&lt;ref name="Bigbee"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ivy |last=Bigbee |title=Casey Anthony Trial, Day 12: K-9 Handler Testifies Cadaver Dog Detected High Alert of Human Decomposition |publisher=[[Discovery Channel|Discovery]].com |date=June 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |url=http://blogs.discovery.com/criminal_report/2011/06/casey-anthony-trial-day-12-k-9-handler-testifies-cadaver-dog-detected-high-alert-of-human-decomposit.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615072836/http://blogs.discovery.com/criminal_report/2011/06/casey-anthony-trial-day-12-k-9-handler-testifies-cadaver-dog-detected-high-alert-of-human-decomposit.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sgt.

The prosecution called chief medical examiner Jan Garavaglia, who testified that she determined Caylee's manner of death to be homicide, but listed it as "death by undetermined means". Garavaglia took into account the physical evidence present on the remains she examined, as well as all the available information on the way they were found and what she had been told by the authorities, before arriving at her determination. "We know by our observations that it's a red flag when a child has not been reported to authorities with injury, there's foul play," Garavaglia said. " ... There is no child that should have duct tape on [the lower part of] its face when it dies." Additionally, Garavaglia addressed the chloroform evidence found by investigators inside the trunk of Casey's car, testifying that even a small amount of chloroform would be sufficient to cause the death of a child.&lt;ref name="Dr. Jan"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyle |last=Hightower |title=Prosecutors focus on duct tape in Casey Anthony trial |publisher=news-journalonline.com/''[[Associated Press]]'' |date=June 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/florida/2011/06/11/prosecutors-focus-on-duct-tape-in-casey-anthony-trial.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714062215/http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/florida/2011/06/11/prosecutors-focus-on-duct-tape-in-casey-anthony-trial.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Florida]] professor and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was brought on by the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee taken alongside Casey, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip of duct tape that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that the duct tape could have covered her nose and mouth. Baez stated, "This disgusting superimposition is nothing more than a fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks." Jurors were seen taking notes of the imagery, and Warren testified that it was his opinion that the duct tape found with Caylee's skull was placed there before her body began decomposing.&lt;ref name="Dr. Jan"/&gt;

FBI latent-print examiner Elizabeth Fontaine testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during [[ultraviolet]] testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Although Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, "It was no longer visible."&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helling"&gt;Steve Helling, [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20502254,00.html Casey Anthony Trial: Heart-Shaped Sticker Residue Found on Duct Tape], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', June 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.&lt;ref name="Helling"/&gt;

The defense called two government witnesses who countered prosecution witness testimony about the duct tape. The chief investigator for the medical examiner stated that the original placement of the duct tape was unclear and it could have shifted positions as he collected the remains.&lt;ref name="CFNews13-Day14"/&gt; Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2011/june/271726/ CFNEWS 13 Day 32: Defense rests, Casey Anthony won't testify] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904122155/http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2011/june/271726/ |date=2011-09-04 }}, [[Central Florida News 13]], June 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.&lt;ref name=ABCStickers/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFNews-Day20"&gt;Jacqueline Fell, Adam Longo, Kelli Cook [http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2011/june/263696/Day 20: Casey Anthony's defense begins case, challenges DNA evidence]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}, [[Central Florida News 13]], June 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense called forensic pathologist [[Dr. Werner Spitz]], who performed a second autopsy on Caylee after Garavaglia and challenged Garavaglia's autopsy report. He called her autopsy "shoddy," saying it was a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. "You need to examine the whole body in an autopsy," he said. Spitz stated that he was not allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed the duct tape found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. "The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there," stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross-examination, "So your testimony is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?", Spitz answered, "It wouldn't be the first time, sir.

When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work time sheet indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question.&lt;ref name="Hopper"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Hopper|title=Casey Anthony Trial: Cindy Anthony Searched for Chloroform on Computer|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]/abcnews.go.com|date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=August 31, 2011|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey_anthony_trial/casey-anthony-trial-cindy-anthony-claims-searched-chloroform/story?id=13912343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt.

====Closing arguments====
Closing arguments were heard July 3 and July&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20076639-504083.html |title=Casey Anthony Trial Update: Closing arguments continue after contentious Sunday|publisher=cbsnews.com|date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Ashton, for the prosecution, told the jury, "When you have a child, that child becomes your life. This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have."&lt;ref name="Closing Arguments abc 25"/&gt; He outlined the state's case against Casey, touching on her many lies to her parents and others, the smell in her car's trunk—identified by several witnesses, including her own father, as the odor from human decomposition—and the items found with Caylee's skeletal remains in December 2008. He emphasized how Casey "maintains her lies until they absolutely cannot be maintained any more" and then replaces [them] with another lie, using "Zanny the Nanny" as an example. Anthony repeatedly told police that Caylee was with the nanny that she specifically identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Police, however, were never able to find the nanny. Authorities did find a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, but she denied ever meeting the Anthonys.&lt;ref name="Closing"/&gt;

Ashton reintroduced the items found with Caylee's remains, including a [[Winnie the Pooh]] blanket that matched the bedding at her grandparents' home, one of a set of laundry bags with the twin bag found at the Anthony home, and duct tape he said was a relatively rare brand. "That bag is Caylee's coffin," Ashton said, holding up a photograph of the laundry bag, as Casey reacted with emotion. He further criticized the defense's theory that Caylee drowned in the Anthony pool and that Casey and George  panicked upon finding the child's body and covered up her death. He advised jurors to use their common sense when deciding on a verdict. "No one makes an accident look like murder," he said.&lt;ref name="Closing"/&gt;

Before closing arguments, Judge Perry ruled that the defense could argue that a drowning occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony,&lt;ref&gt;Boedecker, Hal (July 3, 2011). [http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2011/07/casey-anthony-did-judge-throw-defense-a-huge-bone.html "Casey Anthony: Did judge throw defense a huge bone?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904152742/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2011/07/casey-anthony-did-judge-throw-defense-a-huge-bone.html |date=2011-09-04 }}. ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since there was nothing to support the claim that George sexually abused Casey.&lt;ref name="Closing"/&gt; Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak.&lt;ref name="Closing Arguments abc 25"/&gt; He said the drowning is "the only explanation that makes sense" and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey's parents, George and Cindy, testified that Caylee could get out of the house easily. Although Cindy testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy may have left the ladder up the night before. "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony," he said, "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?"&lt;ref name="Closing"/&gt;

Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors his biggest fear was that they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start to look at this evidence in a different light," he said. "I&amp;nbsp;told you at the very beginning of this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Closing"/&gt;

Defense attorney [[Cheney Mason]] then followed with an additional closing argument. Addressing the jury to discuss the charges against Casey Anthony. "The burden rests on the shoulders of my colleagues at the state attorney's office," Mason said, referring to proving that Casey Anthony committed a crime. Mason said that the jurors are required, whether they like it or not, to find the defendant not guilty if the state did not adequately prove its case against Casey Anthony.&lt;ref name="Closing Arguments abc 25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Camille|last=Mann|title=Casey Anthony Trial Update: Defense concludes closing arguments|publisher=[[CBS]].com|date=July 3, 2011|accessdate=July 8, 2011|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20076577-504083.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason emphasized that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the state, and that Casey Anthony's decision not to testify is not an implication of guilt.&lt;ref name="Closing Arguments abc 25"/&gt;

Lead prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick in the prosecution rebuttal told the jurors that she and her colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims.&lt;ref name="Closing Arguments abc 25"/&gt; "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence.&lt;ref name="Loiaconi"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen |last=Loiaconi |title=Prosecutor: "Whose Life Was Better Without Caylee?" |publisher=CNN |date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |url=http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/04/prosecutor-whose-life-was-better-without-caylee/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707084113/http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/04/prosecutor-whose-life-was-better-without-caylee/ |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," she stated. "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a "decoy" put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. "Whose life was better without Caylee?" she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left on the side of the road dead." Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the "Bella Vita" (meaning "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.&lt;ref name="Loiaconi"/&gt;

The jury began deliberations on July&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury Begins Deliberating in Casey Anthony Case|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/04/rebuttal-deliberations-remain-in-murder-trial|date=July 4, 2011|publisher=FOX News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the [[exculpatory evidence]], the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial.&lt;ref name="CFNews13Bradley" /&gt;

====Verdict and sentence====
On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey not guilty of counts one through three regarding first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and aggravated child abuse, while finding her guilty on counts four through seven for providing false information to law enforcement:
*Count Four: Anthony said she was employed at Universal Studios during 2008, pursuant to the investigation of a missing persons report.
*Count Five: Anthony said she had left Caylee at an apartment complex with a babysitter causing law enforcement to pursue the missing babysitter.
*Count Six: Anthony said she informed two "employees" of Universal Studios, Jeff Hopkins and Juliet Lewis, at Universal, of the disappearance of Caylee.
*Count Seven: Anthony said she had received a phone call and spoke to Caylee on July 15, 2008, causing law enforcement to expend further resources.&lt;ref name="WFTV0707"/&gt;

On July 7, 2011, sentencing arguments were heard. The defense asked for the sentencing to be based on one count of lying on the grounds that the offenses occurred as part of a single interview with police dealing with the same matter, the disappearance of her daughter, as one continuous lie. The defense also argued for concurrent sentences, that is for all four counts to become one count and the sentence to run together as one. The judge disagreed with defense arguments, finding that Anthony's statements consisted of "four distinct, separate lies" ordered the sentences be served [[Sentence (law)|consecutively]], noting that "Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy and manpower looking for Caylee Marie Anthony. This search went on from July through December, over several months, trying to find Caylee Marie Anthony."&lt;ref name="WFTV0707"&gt;{{cite news

In September 2011, Perry, complying with a Florida statute requiring judges to assess investigative and prosecution costs if requested by a state agency, ruled that Casey Anthony must pay $217,000 to the state of Florida. He ruled she had to pay those costs directly related to lying to law enforcement about the death of Caylee, including search costs only up to September 30, 2008, when the Sheriff's Office stopped investigating a missing-child case.&lt;ref&gt;cite webauthor=Warren Richey|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0915/Casey-Anthony-ordered-to-reimburse-state-97-000.-How-that-still-could-rise |title=Casey Anthony ordered to reimburse state $97,000.

In January 2013, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts.

==Media coverage==

===Initial coverage===
The case attracted a significant amount of national media attention, and was regularly the main topic of many TV talk shows, including those hosted by [[Greta Van Susteren]], [[Nancy Grace]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], and others.

Casey Anthony's parents, Cindy and George, appeared on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' on October&amp;nbsp;22, 2008.

===Trial coverage===

The trial was commonly compared to the [[O. J.

The case became a "macabre tourist attraction", as people camped outside for seats in the courtroom, where scuffles also broke out among those wanting seats inside.&lt;ref name="Hightower"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyle |last=Hightower |title=Shock and Outrage Greet Casey Anthony's Not Guilty Verdict |publisher=cnsnews.com/''Associated Press'' |date=July 6, 2011 |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/shock-and-outrage-greet-casey-anthony-s |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709114420/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/shock-and-outrage-greet-casey-anthony-s |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Post'' described the trial as going "from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory",&lt;ref name="SHEN"&gt;{{cite news|first=Maxine|last=Shen |title=TV's hottest ticket Holy OJ!

[[Scot Safon]], executive vice president of [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]], said it was "not about policy" but rather the "very, very strong human dimension" of the case that drove the network to cover it.&lt;ref name="SHEN"/&gt; The audience for HLN's ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'' rose more than 150 percent, and other news channels deciding to focus on the trial saw their ratings double and triple.&lt;ref name="SHEN"/&gt; HLN achieved its most watched hour in network history (4.575 million) and peaked at 5.205 million when the verdict was read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman |first=Robert |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/07/06/hln-draws-5-2-million-viewers-at-peak-of-casey-anthony-verdict-has-best-hour-in-its-history/97343/ |title=HLN Draws 5.2 Million Viewers at Peak of Casey Anthony Verdict – Ratings &amp;#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Christian Post]]'', the O. J. Simpson case had a 91 percent television viewing audience, with 142 million people listening by radio and watching television as the verdict was delivered. "The Simpson case was the longest trial ever held in California, costing more than $20&amp;nbsp;million to fight and defend, running up 50,000 pages of trial transcript in the process." The Casey Anthony trial was expected to "far exceed" these numbers.&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt;

Opinions varied on what made the public thoroughly invested in the trial. Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and "unremarkable" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch.&lt;ref name="SHEN"/&gt; In a special piece for [[CNN]], psychologist [[Frank Farley (psychologist)|Frank Farley]] described the [[circumstantial evidence]] as "all over the map" and that combined with "the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation [was] glued to the tube". He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination [had] to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime.&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank |last=Farley |title=Why we're obsessed with the Anthony trial |publisher=CNN |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-04/opinion/farley.casey.anthony.trial_1_anthony-trial-trial-challenges-casey-anthony |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917123022/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-04/opinion/farley.casey.anthony.trial_1_anthony-trial-trial-challenges-casey-anthony |archivedate=September 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from "the saintly archetype" expected of mothers. "We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children," she stated. "It's fascinating that the defense in the Anthony case found a way to blame the father. While we don't know what is true and maybe never will, it is worth taking a look at the narcissistic family when [[Narcissistic parents|maternal narcissism]] rules the roost. Casey Anthony is a beautiful white woman and the fact that the case includes such things as sex, lies, and videotapes makes it irresistible."&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt;

When the not-guilty verdict was rendered, there was significant outcry among the general public and media that the jury made the wrong decision.&lt;ref name="Outrage"/&gt; Outside the courthouse, many in the crowd of 500 reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs.&lt;ref name="Hightower"/&gt; People took to [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage. Traffic to news sites surged from about two&amp;nbsp;million page views a minute to 3.3&amp;nbsp;million, with most of the visits coming from the United States. [[Mashable]] reported that between 2&amp;nbsp;pm and 3&amp;nbsp;pm, one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, 30&amp;nbsp;times higher than the previous month's average. Twitter's trending topics in the United States were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and [[Newser]] reported that posts on Facebook were coming in "too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10&amp;nbsp;per second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn|first=Leslie|title=Not Guilty Verdict for Casey Anthony Causes a Surge in Internet Traffic|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388119,00.asp|publisher=''[[PC Magazine]]''|accessdate=6 July 2011|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people referred to the verdict as "O.J.

Others, such as [[Sean Hannity]] of the [[Fox News Channel]], felt the verdict was fair because the prosecution did not have enough evidence to establish guilt or meet its [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] beyond a reasonable doubt. Hannity said that the verdict was legally correct, and that all of the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was either impeached or contradicted by the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/2011/07/06/where-did-state-lose-case-against-casey-anthony |title=Where Did State Lose Case Against Casey Anthony? |first=Sean |last=Hannity |date=July 5, 2011 |work=[[FoxNews.com]] |authorlink=Sean Hannity |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810000410/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/2011/07/06/where-did-state-lose-case-against-casey-anthony |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cloud of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine echoed these sentiments, saying the jury made the right call: "Anthony got off because the prosecution couldn't answer [the questions]," Cloud stated. "Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on Anthony's (nearly imperceptible) moral character. The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer."&lt;ref name="Cloud 2"/&gt;

Disagreement with the verdict was heavily debated by the media, lawyers and psychologists, who put forth several theories for public dissatisfaction with the decision, ranging from wanting justice for Caylee, to the circumstantial evidence having been strong enough, to some blaming the media.&lt;ref name="Paradis"&gt;{{cite news|first=Cheryl|last=Paradis|title=The Measure of Madness|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|date=July 5, 2011|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-measure-madness/201107/casey-anthony-is-found-not-guilty-killing-her-daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walshe"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sadhbh|last=Walshe|title=The Right Word: Fox rabid about Casey Anthony|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jul/07/casey-anthony-fox-news|location=London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman, said, "The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict. The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child. And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob." She added, "Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar. And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death. Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems. Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing."&lt;ref name="Outrage"/&gt;

There was a gender gap in perceptions to the case. According to a ''[[USA Today]]''/[[Gallup Poll]] of 1,010 respondents, about two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony "definitely" or "probably" murdered her daughter; however, women were much more likely than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony "definitely" committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men.&lt;ref name="Bello"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marisol|last=Bello|title=Casey Anthony verdict doesn't sit well with most Americans|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-07-07-casey-anthony-trial_n.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Casey Anthony release date extended to July 17; case inspires 'Caylee's Laws' in other states|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/casey-anthony-release-date-extended-to-july-17-case-inspires-caylees-laws-in-other-states/2011/07/08/gIQAV6j53H_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender gap has partly been explained by "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood.&lt;ref name="Bello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt; For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of [[Alice Crimmins]], who was accused of murdering her two small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Shaughnessy, Patrice|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title=From Casey Anthony to Alice Crimmins moms on trial mesmerize|date=June 30, 2011|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/casey-anthony-alice-crimmins-moms-trial-mesmerize-article-1.132336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=Before Casey Anthony, There Was Alice Crimmins...|first=Paul |last=LaRosa|date=July 14, 2011|authorlink=Paul LaRosa|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-larosa/before-casey-anthony-ther_b_898417.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of forensic evidence were given for the jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented.&lt;ref name="Walshe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singleton"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Singleton|title=Local attorneys analyze Anthony verdict|publisher=thetimes-tribune|date=July 6, 2011|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/local-attorneys-analyze-anthony-verdict-1.1171515#axzz1RLysTE7f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CSI effect]] was also extensively argued—that society now lives "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient".&lt;ref name="Walshe"/&gt; Likewise, commentators such as [[O. J. Simpson]] case prosecutor [[Marcia Clark]] believe that the jury interpreted "reasonable doubt" too narrowly.&lt;ref name="doubt"/&gt; Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is "the hardest, most elusive" instruction of all. "And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed," she said, opining the confusion between ''reasonable doubt'' and ''a reason to doubt''. "In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and [[not proven]]. It's one way of showing that even if the jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't find the defendant innocent either. There's a difference."&lt;ref name="doubt"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Defense, prosecution, and jury===
Following the criminal trial, Mason blamed the media for the passionate hatred directed toward Anthony. He described it as a "media assassination" of her before and during the trial, saying, "I hope that this is a lesson to those of you who have indulged in media assassination for three years, bias, and prejudice, and incompetent talking heads saying what would be and how to be." Mason added: "I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it. Now you have learned a lesson."&lt;ref name="Flock"&gt;{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Flock|title=Casey Anthony not guilty verdict shocks media; attorneys blast 'talking heads'|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=July 6, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/casey-anthony-not-guilty-verdict-shocks-media-attorneys-blast-talking-heads/2011/07/05/gHQAHhIXzH_blog.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anthony lawyers blast cable news after acquittal|work=[[Yahoo.com]]|date=July 6, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2011|url=https://news.yahoo.com/anthony-lawyers-blast-cable-news-acquittal-232233047.html|last=Bauder|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said, "We're disappointed in the verdict today because we know the facts and we've put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed. This is a dry-bones case. Very, very difficult to prove. The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage."&lt;ref name="Hightower"/&gt; Jose Baez said, "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been for the last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple."

On July 6, 2011, Jeff Ashton gave his first interview about the case on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Ashton said of the verdict, "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case." He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. "You can't believe in the rule of law and not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should," stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case "struck such a nerve" with the public. "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from [a mother's love for her child], it just outrages them." Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having "the potential to be a great attorney".&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaino"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Zaino |title=Casey Anthony Prosecutor Jeff Ashton Offers a Voice of Reason on 'The View' (VIDEO) |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/07/06/the-view-jeff-ashton-casey-anthony-prosecutor/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002172027/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/07/06/the-view-jeff-ashton-casey-anthony-prosecutor/ |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, "I did not say she was innocent" and "I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be." She added, "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," but that "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was "dishonest." She said the jury "was sick to [their] stomachs to get [the not-guilty] verdict" and that the decision process overwhelmed them to the point where they did not want to talk to reporters afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kate Burke, Jessica Hopper, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-prosecutor-juror-agree-reason-acquittal/story?id=14005609 Casey Anthony Juror: 'Sick to Our Stomachs' Over Not Guilty Verdict], [[ABC News]], July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=Juror in Anthony Case Says Acquittals Took an Emotional Toll|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/us/07casey.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=7 July 2011|author2=Bill Carter|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite video|people=Terry Moran|date=July 6, 2011|title=Nightline / Exclusive: Juror No. 3 Speaks Out (5 min. 41 sec.)|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/exclusive-juror-speaks-14015245|format=flash|medium=Television production|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].com|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' that "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [Anthony] was done".

Mark Lippman told [[Reuters]] during the trial that Casey had cut off communication with her parents.&lt;ref name="Liston"&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara |last=Liston |title=Casey Anthony refuses jail visit from her mother |publisher=[[Yahoo]]/[[Reuters]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/casey-anthony-refuses-jail-visit-her-mother-194511908.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711183659/http://news.yahoo.com/casey-anthony-refuses-jail-visit-her-mother-194511908.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that George and Cindy Anthony would be appearing on ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' in September 2011 to tell their story.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Mann [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20093480-504083.html Dr. Phil to interview Casey Anthony's parents], [[CBS News]], August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey left for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict. However, on August&amp;nbsp;12, she was ordered to return to Florida to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction. When she pleaded guilty to that charge in January 2010, the judge in that case intended for Casey to serve her probation after proceedings in the murder case concluded, but an error in the sentencing documents allowed her to serve her probation while awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/08/12/florida.casey.anthony/index.html|title=Judge in Florida orders Casey Anthony to serve year of probation|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey returned to Florida on August 25 and is serving out her probation in an undisclosed location.

In August 2011, the [[Florida Department of Children and Families]] released a report based on a three-year investigation into the disappearance and death of Caylee. An agency spokesperson stated, "It is the conclusion of the [DCF] that [Casey Anthony] failed to protect her child from harm either through her actions or lack of actions, which tragically resulted in the child's untimely death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walter Pacheco |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/caylee-anthony/os-casey-anthony-dcf-report-20110811,0,1774056.story |title=Casey Anthony's 'failure to protect' contributed to Caylee's death, DCF says|publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.trb.com/media/acrobat/2011-08/272204480-11143144.pdf |title=Review of Child Death |publisher=Florida Department of Children and Families |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813164450/http://media.trb.com/media/acrobat/2011-08/272204480-11143144.pdf |archivedate=August 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey filed bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court on January 27, 2013. Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey Anthony files for bankruptcy|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2013/1/26/documents_casey_anth.html|publisher=CFN13|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil suits===
In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told investigators that she left 2½-year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez—also known as "Zanny"—on June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated she did not know Casey or Caylee.&lt;ref name=WKMGZanny&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/17122200/detail.html |title=Local 6 Locates, Talks To Zenaida Gonzalez In Missing Girl Mystery |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |work=[[WKMG-TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821043917/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/17122200/detail.html |archivedate=August 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Casey Anthony can be subject to punitive damages in defamation suit, judge says|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 20, 2009|first=Sarah |last=Lundy|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2009-05-20/news/casey_1_casey-anthony-seek-punitive-mitnik|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, [[John Morgan (lawyer)|John Morgan]], said he wants to interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is "the essence" of the defamation suit.&lt;ref name=WKMGZanny/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[ABC News]]|title=Casey Anthony May Be Grilled by Lawyer for Real Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez|first=Christina|last=Ng|date=July 14, 2011|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey_anthony_trial/casey-anthony-grilled-lawyer-real-zenaida-fernandez-gonzalez/story?id=14071444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Casey via a video conference. She exercised her [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment right]] against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal experts think that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/29430207/detail.html |title=Disguised Casey Anthony Takes The 5th |author=WKMG |work=WKMG |accessdate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011172754/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/29430207/detail.html |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/Cheney-Mason-accepts-subpoena-for-Casey-Anthony-s-civil-trial/-/1637132/13556460/-/a4ppqbz/-/index.html|title=Cheney Mason accepts subpoena for Casey Anthony's civil trial|author=WKMG|work=WKMG|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/lawyers-zenaida-gonzalez-expected-court-thursday/nN2FS/|title=Judge releases Casey's secret address to Zenaida Gonzalez's lawyers|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Anthony, stating: "There is nothing in the statement…to support (Fernandez-Gonzalez's) allegations that (Anthony) intended to portray (the nanny) as a child kidnapper and potentially a child killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesh.com/article/judge-rules-for-casey-anthony-in-defamation-lawsuit-1/4445024|title=Judge rules for Casey Anthony in defamation lawsuit|work=WESH|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, [[Texas EquuSearch]] (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead.&lt;ref name="Liston2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara |last=Liston |title=Search group sues Casey Anthony for costly efforts |publisher=[[MSNBC]]/[[Reuters]] |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2011 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43116818 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704224732/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43116818 |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children.

TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-10-21/news/os-casey-anthony-equusearch-settlement-20131021_1_roy-kronk-bankruptcy-caylee|title=Casey Anthony settles with Texas EquuSearch|first=Jeff|last=Weiner|website=Orlando Sentinel|date=October 21, 2013|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Caylee's Law"===
{{see also|Caylee's Law}}
Since the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called "Caylee's Law", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child.&lt;ref name="ABCcayleeslaw"&gt;{{cite news | first = Laura | last = Riparbelli | title = Casey Anthony Trial Aftermath: 'Caylee's Law' Drafted in 4 States | date = 7 July 2011 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-trial-aftermath-caylee-law-drafted-states/story?id=14020260 | work = [[ABC News]] | accessdate = 2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such petition, circulated via [[Change.org]], has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Caylee's Law won't work|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/21/opinion/la-ed-caylee-20110721|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2011-07-21|access-date = 2015-08-12|issn = 0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—[[Florida]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[West Virginia]]—have begun drafting versions of "Caylee's Law".{{When|date=July 2014}} The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref name="ABCcayleeslaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/176944/20110708/caylee-s-law.htm|title=Clamor Grows Louder for Caylee's Law After Mother Only Gets Slap On Wrist|work=International Business Times|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K.

===Memorials and tribute songs===
Different artists have written songs in Caylee's memory, often titled "Caylee's Song". Jon Whynock performed his own version at her memorial service in February 2009,&lt;ref name="Caylee's Song"&gt;{{cite news|title=Caylee's Song Is Performed At Her Service |publisher=wesh.com |date=February 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |url=http://www.wesh.com/video/18682077/detail.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711150606/http://www.wesh.com/video/18682077/detail.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheffield songwriter Earl "Peanutt" Montgomery, an Alabama Music Hall of Fame member known for writing hits for country artist [[George Jones]], penned a "Caylee's Song" soon after hearing the verdict.&lt;ref name="Corey"&gt;{{cite news|first=Russ |last=Corey |title=Songwriter pens song for Caylee |publisher=''[[Times Daily]]'' |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20110708/NEWS/110709882/-1/opinion?Title=Songwriter-pens-song-for-Caylee |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204083416/http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20110708/NEWS/110709882/-1/opinion?Title=Songwriter-pens-song-for-Caylee |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Me and my wife talked about it, and I decided to do it," said Montgomery.

On July&amp;nbsp;8, 2011, Grace played it for her audience.&lt;ref name="Rey"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ariel|last=R.

===Later information===
In November 2012, [[WKMG-TV]] television in Orlando reported that police never investigated [[Firefox]] browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at [[Internet Explorer]] evidence. The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, did a Firefox Google search for "foolproof suffocation" at 2:51&amp;nbsp;p.m. and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting "foolproof" ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on [[MySpace]], a site used by Casey but not George. The station learned about this information from Casey's attorney Jose Baez who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death. He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may have chosen not to introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George, which was that Casey left at 12:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that her password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39&amp;nbsp;p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Pipitone, [http://www.clickorlando.com/news/Cops-prosecutors-botched-Casey-Anthony-evidence/-/1637132/17495808/-/9rrlr7z/-/index.html Cops, prosecutors botched Casey Anthony evidence Computer search for 'foolproof suffocation' never found], [[WKMG-TV]], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="click orlando"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pipitone|first1=Tony|title=Cops, prosecutors botched Casey Anthony evidence|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/Cops-prosecutors-botched-Casey-Anthony-evidence/17495808|agency=Click Orlando|date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, transcripts of two 2015 affidavits of private investigator Dominic Casey were filed on the court docket in the matter of ''Kronk v. Anthony'' and picked up by news services in May 2016. In one affidavit, Casey stated that on July 26, 2008, Baez admitted to him that Casey Anthony murdered Caylee Anthony "and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did".&lt;ref name=Webteam /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mgtvwfla.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/caseyanthony.pdf |title=Affidavit of Dominic Casey |date=April 25, 2016 |website=WFLA.com |publisher=[[WFLA-TV|WFLA]] |access-date=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that Baez had a sexual relationship with Anthony, and that "Casey told me she had to do what Jose said because she had no money for her defense."

ERT is currently available for some lysosomal storage diseases: [[Gaucher's disease|Gaucher disease]], [[Fabry disease]], [[Mucopolysaccharidosis|MPS I]], [[Hunter syndrome|MPS II (Hunter syndrome)]], [[Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome|MPS VI]] and [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT does not correct the underlying genetic defect, but it increases the concentration of the enzyme that the patient is lacking.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT has also been used to treat patients with [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) resulting from an adenosine deaminase deficiency ([[Adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA-SCID]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17300989|year=2007|author1=Booth|first1=C|title=Management options for adenosine deaminase deficiency; proceedings of the EBMT satellite workshop (Hamburg, March 2006)|journal=Clinical Immunology|volume=123|issue=2|pages=139–47|last2=Hershfield|first2=M|last3=Notarangelo|first3=L|last4=Buckley|first4=R|last5=Hoenig|first5=M|last6=Mahlaoui|first6=N|last7=Cavazzana-Calvo|first7=M|last8=Aiuti|first8=A|last9=Gaspar|first9=H.

Other treatment options for patients with enzyme or protein deficiencies include [[substrate reduction therapy]], [[gene therapy]], and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone-marrow derived stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;]]

== History ==

ERT was developed in 1964 by Christian de Duve and Roscoe Brady.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Neufeld|first1= E. F. |date=2006|chapter=Chapter 10: Enzyme replacement therapy – a brief history|veditors= Mehta A, Beck M, Sunder-Plassmann G|title= Fabry  Disease: Perspectives from 5 Years of FOS|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford PharmaGenesis|isbn= 978-1-903539-03-3|pmid= 21290685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading work was done on this subject at the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta by Mark J. Poznansky and Damyanti Bhardwaj, where a model for enzyme therapy was developed using rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02783734|pmid= 6395807|year= 1984|author1= Poznansky|first1= M. J.|title= Enzyme-albumin polymers. New approaches to the use of enzymes in medicine|journal= Applied biochemistry and biotechnology|volume= 10|pages= 41–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERT was not used in clinical practice until 1991, after the FDA gave [[orphan drug]] approval for the treatment of Gaucher disease with [[Alglucerase]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  ERTs were initially manufactured by isolating the therapeutic enzyme from human placenta.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  The FDA has now approved ERTs that are derived from other human cells, animal cells (i.e. Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells), and plant cells.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Medical uses ==
[[Lysosomal storage disease]]s are fatal group of diseases and a main application of ERT.  [[Lysosome]]s are cellular organelles that are responsible for the metabolism of many different macromolecules and proteins.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=111–113|doi=10.4161/cib.20373|pmc=3376041|year=2012|author1=Weiss|first1=N|title=Cross-talk between TRPML1 channel, lipids and lysosomal storage diseases|journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology|volume=5|issue=2|pmid=22808310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They use enzymes to break down macromolecules, which are recycled or disposed.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; As of 2012, there are 50 lysosomal storage diseases, and more are still being discovered.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Lysosomal Storage Disorders – NORD (National Organization For Rare Disorders)". ''NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)''. Apr. 2017, from https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lysosomal-storage-disorders/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  These disorders arise because of genetic mutations that prevent the production of certain enzymes used in the lysosomes.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  The missing enzyme often leads to a build-up of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] within the body.  This can result in a variety of symptoms, many of which are severe and can affect the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;  Increasing the concentration of the missing enzyme within the body has been shown to improve the body's normal cellular metabolic processes and reduce substrate concentration in the body.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

ERT has also been successful in treating severe combined immunodeficiency caused by an adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=26684479|year=2016|author1=Tartibi|first1=H. M.|title=A 24-Year Enzyme Replacement Therapy in an Adenosine-deaminase-Deficient Patient|journal=Pediatrics|volume=137|issue=1|pages=e20152169|last2=Hershfield|first2=M. S.|last3=Bahna|first3=S. L.|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-2169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a fatal childhood disease that requires early medical intervention.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  When the enzyme adenosine deaminase is deficient in the body, the result is a toxic build-up of metabolites that impair [[lymphocyte]] development and function.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  Many ADA deficient children with SCID have been treated with the polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) enzyme.  This is a form of ERT that has resulted in healthier, longer lives for patients with ADA-SCID.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

== Administration ==
ERT is administered by IV infusion.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27384562|pmc=4964441|year=2016|author1=Coutinho|first1=M. F.|title=Less is More: Substrate Reduction Therapy for Lysosomal Storage Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1065|last2=Santos|first2=J. I.|last3=Alves|first3=S|doi=10.3390/ijms17071065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, infusions occur every week or every two weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  For some types of ERT, these infusions can occur as infrequently as every four weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Complications ==
ERT is not a cure for lysosomal storage diseases, and it requires lifelong IV infusions of the therapeutic enzyme.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This procedure is expensive; in the United States, it may cost over $200,000 annually.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; The distribution of the therapeutic enzyme in the body ([[biodistribution]]) after these IV infusions is not uniform.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The enzyme in less available to certain areas in the body, like the bones, lungs, brain.  For this reason, many symptoms of lysosomal storage diseases remain untreated by ERT, especially neurological symptoms.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Additionally, the efficacy of ERT is often reduced due to an unwanted immune response against the enzyme, which prevents metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

== Other treatments for enzyme deficiencies ==
Substrate reduction therapy is another method for treating lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  In this treatment, the accumulated compounds are inhibited from forming in the body of a patient suffering from a lysosomal storage disease.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The accumulated compounds are responsible for the symptoms of these disorders, and they form via a multi-step biological pathway.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Substrate reduction therapy uses a small molecule to interrupt this multi-step pathway and inhibit the biosynthesis of these compounds.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This type of treatment is taken orally.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  It does not induce an unwanted immune response, and a single type of small molecule could be used to treat many lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; Substrate reduction therapy is FDA approved and there is at least one treatment available on the market.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

Gene therapy aims to replace a missing protein in the body through the use of [[Vectors in gene therapy|vectors]], usually [[viral vector]]s.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;"How does gene therapy work? - Genetics Home Reference." U.S. National Library of Medicine. April 18, 2017, from https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/procedures.&lt;/ref&gt;  In gene therapy, a gene encoding for a certain protein is inserted into a vector.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; The vector containing the therapeutic gene is then injected into the patient.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  Once inside the body the vector introduces the therapeutic gene into host cells, and the protein encoded by the newly inserted gene is then produced by the body's own cells.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  This type of therapy can correct for the missing protein/enzyme in patients with lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is another treatment for lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt; HSCs are derived from bone-marrow.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Domen, J., Wagers, A., &amp; Weissman, I. "Bone Marrow (Hematopoietic) Stem Cells." April 19, 2017, from https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/2006chapter2.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have the ability to mature into the many cell types that comprise blood, including red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;  Patients suffering from enzyme deficiencies often undergo HSC transplantations in which HSCs from a healthy donor are injected.  This treatment introduces HSCs that regularly produce the deficient enzyme since they have normal metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26604151|year=2016|author1=Biffi|first1=A|title=Gene therapy for lysosomal storage disorders: A good start|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=25|issue=R1|pages=R65–75|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatment is often used to treat the central nervous system of patients with some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt;

'''Ernest Edwin Evans''' (August 13, 1908 – October 25, 1944) was an officer of the [[United States Navy]] who [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during the [[Battle off Samar]] in [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Evans, of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry (half [[Cherokee]] and one quarter [[Creek people|Creek]]), was born in [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1931.

On 9 August 1941, he was assigned to the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Alden|DD-211|2}}, and was serving on her in the [[East Indies]] when the Japanese attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7 of that year. He became commanding officer of ''Alden'' on 14 March 1942, and held that position until 7 July 1943.  While serving on ''Alden'' he participated in operations in and around [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].

In mid-1943 Evans was then ordered to duty in charge of fitting out the {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|2}} {{USS|Johnston|DD-557|2}} at the [[Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].  Commander Evans assumed command of ''Johnston'' at her commissioning on 27 October 1943.  He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for meritorious achievement in action against a [[Imperial Japanese navy|Japanese]] [[submarine]] on May 16, 1944.

===Battle off Samar===
In the [[Battle off Samar]], a part of the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], Evans fought his ship gallantly until it was sunk on October 25, 1944, by a Japanese force that was vastly superior in number, firepower, and armor. ''Johnston'', together with the destroyers {{USS|Hoel|DD-533|2}} and {{USS|Heermann|DD-532|2}}, four [[destroyer escort]]s and six [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s (CVEs), formed the [[task force|task unit]] 77.4.3, known as [[Taffy 3|Taffy&amp;nbsp;3]]. This group, together with planes from Taffy&amp;nbsp;2 (TU&amp;nbsp;77.4.2), ultimately forced a Japanese battlegroup consisting of several [[battleship]]s, [[heavy cruiser]]s, [[light cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s to abort its original mission to attack the landing beaches at [[Leyte]] under the command of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and retreat. The famous battle is popularly known as "[[The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors]]," after the [[The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors|2004 book]] of the same title.

When the Japanese fleet during the Battle off Samar was first sighted, Evans did not hesitate. He ordered his helm sharp to port and he led his destroyer out of the task unit's circular antiaircraft disposition in favor of charging the enemy alone to make a torpedo attack. Some claim that Evans told his crew over the ship's intercom: "A large Japanese fleet has been contacted. They are fifteen miles away and headed in our direction. They are believed to have four battleships, eight cruisers, and a number of destroyers. This will be a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected. We will do what damage we can." However, contemporaneous sources credit the latter part of this dramatic announcement to LCDR [[Robert W. Copeland]] of the {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|DE-413|2}}, who charged in with Evans on a subsequent torpedo attack.&lt;ref&gt;According to the action report of the USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'' (DE-413), "The crew were informed over the loud speaker system at the beginning of the action, of the Commanding Officer's estimate of the situation, that is, a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival could not be expected, during which time we would do what damage we could. In the face of this knowledge the men zealously manned their stations wherever they might be, and fought and worked with such calmness, courage and efficiency that no higher honor could be conceived than to command such a group of men." USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413), "Combined Action Report, Surface Engagement off Samar, Philippine Islands, and Report of Loss of USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413), on 25 October 1944," November 20, 1944, Serial X001, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the ''Johnston''{{'}}s captain was never conclusively established, and remains the subject of continuing conjecture among the ship's survivors. Some claim that he was hit by Japanese naval shellfire; others that he was able to jump into a damaged motor [[whaleboat]]. What is known is that he was seriously wounded during the battle; that he lived long enough to give the abandon ship order; and that he was not among those rescued. Evans was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his material contribution to the decisive victory won in [[Leyte Gulf]] and shared in the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded his group for this action in which he gave his life.

In 1955, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Evans|DE-1023}} was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;*{{cite web |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e5/evans-iii.htm |title=history.navy.mil: USS ''Evans'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203131531/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e5/evans-iii.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decommissioned in 1968, and no active ship carries the name of ''Evans'' or ''Johnston'', although a number of active ships have been named for ''Samuel B. Roberts'' and her crew. On November 12, 2013, a petition was created to name a ship after Evans.&lt;ref name="We The People petition"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 12, 2013 |url=http://wh.gov/lBqUJ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131112180011/http://wh.gov/lBqUJ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2013, the [[Naval Station Newport]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Surface Warfare Officers School's [[virtual reality|virtual]] [[simulator]] for [[shiphandling]] training was dedicated as the ''Evans Full Mission-2 Simulator'' in Evans' honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edward A.

===Medal of Honor citation===
[[File:NavyMedalofHonor.jpg|90px|right|Medal of Honor]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of the U.S.S. Johnston in action against major units of the enemy Japanese fleet during the battle off Samar on 25 October 1944. The first to lay a smokescreen and to open fire as an enemy task force, vastly superior in number, firepower and armor, rapidly approached. Comdr. Evans gallantly diverted the powerful blasts of hostile guns from the lightly armed and armored carriers under his protection, launching the first torpedo attack when the Johnston came under straddling Japanese shellfire. Undaunted by damage sustained under the terrific volume of fire, he unhesitatingly joined others of his group to provide fire support during subsequent torpedo attacks against the Japanese and, outshooting and outmaneuvering the enemy as he consistently interposed his vessel between the hostile fleet units and our carriers despite the crippling loss of engine power and communications with steering aft, shifted command to the fantail, shouted steering orders through an open hatch to men turning the rudder by hand and battled furiously until the Johnston, burning and shuddering from a mortal blow, lay dead in the water after 3 hours of fierce combat. Seriously wounded early in the engagement, Comdr. Evans, by his indomitable courage and brilliant professional skill, aided materially in turning back the enemy during a critical phase of the action. His valiant fighting spirit throughout this historic battle will venture as an inspiration to all who served with him.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pinus embryo in female gametophyte.jpg|thumb|100px|Pine gametophyte (outside) surrounding the embryo (inside)]]
A '''gametophyte''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|m|iː|t|oʊ|f|aɪ|t}}) is one of the two [[alternation of generations|alternating phases]] in the life cycle of [[plant]]s and [[algae]]. It is a [[haploid]] multicellular organism that develops from a haploid [[spore]] that has one set of chromosomes.  The gametophyte is the [[Sexual reproduction of plants|sexual phase]] in the life cycle of plants and algae. It develops sex organs that produce [[gamete]]s, haploid sex cells that participate in [[fertilization]] to form a diploid zygote which has two sets of chromosomes.  Cell division of the zygote results in a new [[diploid]] multicellular organism, the second stage in the life cycle known as the [[sporophyte]], the  function of which is to produce haploid spores by [[meiosis]].

== Algae ==
In some [[multicellular]] [[green algae]] (''[[Ulva lactuca]]'' is one example), [[red algae]] and [[brown algae]], sporophytes and gametophytes may be externally indistinguishable (isomorphic). In ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]'' the gametes are [[Isogamy|isogamous]], all of one size, shape and general morphology.&lt;ref name=Sadava&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadava|first1=David|last2=Hillis|first2=David|last3=Heller|first3=H. Craig|last4=Berenbaum|first4=May|title=Life: The Science of Biology, Volume 1|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1464141225|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land plants ==
In [[embryophyte|land plants]], [[anisogamy]] is universal. As in animals, female and male gametes are called, respectively, ''eggs'' and ''sperm.'' In extant land plants, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte may be reduced (heteromorphic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennici|first=Andrea|date=2008|title=Origin and early evolution of land plants|journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=212–218|issn=1942-0889|pmc=2686025|pmid=19513262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bryophytes ===  
In [[bryophytes]] ([[mosses]], [[liverworts]], and [[hornworts]]), the gametophyte is the most visible stage of the life cycle. The bryophyte gametophyte is longer lived, nutritionally independent, and the sporophytes are typically attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them.&lt;ref name=Budke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Budke | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Goffinet | first2 = B. | last3 = Jones | first3 = C.S. | year = 2013 | title = Dehydration protection provided by a maternal cuticle improves offspring fitness in the moss ''Funaria hygrometrica'' | journal = Annals of Botany | volume =  111| issue = | pages =  781–789| doi = 10.1093/aob/mct033 | pmid=23471009 | pmc=3631323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a moss spore germinates it grows to produce a filament of cells (called the [[protonema]]). The mature gametophyte of mosses develops into leafy shoots that produce sex organs ([[Gametangium|gametangia]]) that produce gametes.   Eggs develop in [[Archegonium|archegonia]] and sperm in [[Antheridium|antheridia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf Reski]] (1998): Development, genetics and molecular biology of mosses. In: Botanica Acta 111, pp 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some bryophyte groups such as many liverworts of the order [[Marchantiales]], the gametes are produced on specialized structures called [[gametophore]]s (or gametangiophores).

=== Vascular plants ===

All vascular plants are sporophyte dominant, and a trend toward smaller and more sporophyte-dependent female gametophytes is evident as land plants evolved towards reproduction by seeds.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Rothwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=W.N.|last1=Stewart|first2=G.W.|last2=Rothwell|title=Palaeobotany and the evolution of plants, second edition.|location=Cambridge, U.K.|publisher=Cambridge University press|isbn=0521382947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vascular plants such as ferns that produce only one type of spore are said to be homosporous. They have exosporic gametophytes—that is, the gametophyte is free-living and develops outside of the spore wall. Exosporic gametophytes can either be bisexual, capable of producing both sperm and eggs in the same thallus ([[monoicous]]), or specialized into separate male and female organisms (dioicous). 

In [[heterospory|heterosporous]] vascular plants (plants that produce both microspores and megaspores), the gametophyte develops endosporically, within the spore wall. These gametophytes are [[dioicous]], producing either sperm or eggs but not both.

==== Ferns ====

In most [[fern]]s, for example, in the [[leptosporangiate fern]]  ''[[Dryopteris]]'', the gametophyte is a [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] free living [[autotroph]]ic organism called a [[prothallium|prothallus]] that produces gametes and maintains the sporophyte during its early multicellular development. However, in some groups, notably the clade that includes [[Ophioglossaceae]] and ''[[Psilotaceae]]'', the gametophytes are subterranean and subsist by forming [[mycotroph]]ic relationships with fungi.

==== Lycophytes ====

Extant [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]] produce two different types of gametophytes. In the families [[Lycopodiaceae]] and [[Huperziaceae]], germinating spores into free-living, subterranean and [[mycotroph]]ic, gametophytes that derive nutrients from symbiosis with fungi. In ''[[Isoetes]]'' and ''[[Selaginella]]'', which are [[heterospory|heterosporous]], the megaspore remains attached to the parent sporophyte and a highly reduced megagametophyte develops inside. At maturity, the megaspore cracks open at the trilete suture to allow the male gametes to access the egg cells in the archegonia inside. The gametophytes of ''Isoetes'' appear to be similar in this respect to those of the extinct [[Carboniferous]] giant arborescent clubmosses, ''Lepidodendron'' and ''Lepidostrobus''.&lt;ref name="Brack-Hanes"&gt;{{cite journal|first=S.D.|last=Brack-Hanes|date=1978|title=On the megagametophytes of two Lepidodendracean cones.|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=139|pages=140–146|doi=10.1086/336979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seed plants ====
The [[Spermatophyta|seed plants]] ([[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperms]]) are endosporic and heterosporous. The gametophytes develop into multicellular organisms while still enclosed within the spore wall, and the megaspores are retained within the sporangium.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2010): [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109071540/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |date=November 9, 2011 }}. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heteromorphy==
{{main article|Dioicous|Heterospory}}

In plants with heteromorphic gametophytes, there are two distinct kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed ''heteromorphic'', from ''hetero''- "different" and ''morph'' "form". The egg producing gametophyte is known as a '''megagametophyte''', because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a '''microgametophyte'''. Gametophytes which produce egg and sperm on separate plants are termed [[Dioicous]].

In [[Heterospory|heterosporous]] plants (water ferns, some lycophytes, as well as all gymnosperms and angiosperms), there are two distinct [[sporangium|sporangia]], each of which produces a single kind of spore and single kind of gametophyte. However, not all heteromorphic gametophytes come from heterosporous plants. That is, some plants have distinct egg-producing and sperm-producing gametophytes, but these gametophytes develop from the same kind of spore inside the same sporangium; ''[[Sphaerocarpos]]'' is an example of such a plant.

In the seed plants, the microgametophyte is called [[pollen]]. Seed plant microgametophytes consists of two or three cells when the pollen grains exit the sporangium. The megagametophyte develops within the megaspore of extant seedless vascular plants and within the megasporangium in a cone or flower in seed plants. In seed plants, the microgametophyte (pollen grain) travels to the vicinity of the egg cell (carried by a physical or animal vector), and produces two sperm by mitosis.

In [[gymnosperm]]s the megagametophyte consists of several thousand cells and produces one to several [[archegonia]], each with a single egg cell. The gametophyte becomes a food storage tissue in the seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digimuse.nmns.edu.tw/Default.aspx?Domin=b&amp;tabid=268&amp;Field=v0&amp;ContentType=Study&amp;FieldName=&amp;ObjectId=&amp;Subject=&amp;Language=ENG |title=Vascular Plants :: Description |publisher=Digimuse.nmns.edu.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522044106/http://digimuse.nmns.edu.tw/Default.aspx?Domin=b&amp;tabid=268&amp;Field=v0&amp;ContentType=Study&amp;FieldName=&amp;ObjectId=&amp;Subject=&amp;Language=ENG |archivedate=2014-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[angiosperm]]s, the megagametophyte is reduced to only a few nuclei and cells, and is sometimes called the [[embryo sac]]. A typical embryo sac contains seven cells and eight nuclei, one of which is the egg cell. Two nuclei fuse with a sperm nucleus to form [[endosperm]], which becomes the food storage tissue in the seed.

== Architecture ==

There are several variations on the full gated unit, with gating done using the previous hidden state and the bias in various combinations, and a simplified form called minimal gated unit.

The operator &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]] in the following.

=== Fully gated unit ===
[[File:Gradient Recurrent Unit.svg|thumb|Gated Recurrent Unit, fully gated version]]
Initially, for &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the output vector is &lt;math&gt;h_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z_t &amp;= \sigma_g(W_{z} x_t + U_{z} h_{t-1} + b_z) \\
r_t &amp;= \sigma_g(W_{r} x_t + U_{r} h_{t-1} + b_r) \\
h_t &amp;= z_t  \circ h_{t-1} + (1 - z_t)  \circ \sigma_h(W_{h} x_t + U_{h} (r_t \circ h_{t-1}) + b_h)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Variables
* &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;: input vector
* &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;: output vector
* &lt;math&gt;z_t&lt;/math&gt;: update gate vector
* &lt;math&gt;r_t&lt;/math&gt;: reset gate vector
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;: parameter matrices and vector

[[Activation function]]s
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma_g&lt;/math&gt;: The original is a [[sigmoid function]].
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma_h&lt;/math&gt;: The original is a [[hyperbolic tangent]].
Alternative activation functions are possible, provided that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_g(x) \isin [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Gated Recurrent Unit, type 1.svg|thumb|Type 1]]
[[File:Gradient Recurrent Unit, type 2.svg|thumb|Type 2]]
[[File:Gradient Recurrent Unit, type 3.svg|thumb|Type 3]]
Alternate forms can be created by changing &lt;math&gt;z_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_t&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Dey|first=Rahul|last2=Salem|first2=Fathi M.|date=2017-01-20|title=Gate-Variants of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Networks|eprint=1701.05923 |class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Type 1, each gate depends only on the previous hidden state and the bias.
*: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z_t &amp;= \sigma_g(U_{z} h_{t-1} + b_z) \\
r_t &amp;= \sigma_g(U_{r} h_{t-1} + b_r) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
*  Type 2, each gate depends only on  the previous hidden state.
*: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z_t &amp;= \sigma_g(U_{z} h_{t-1}) \\
r_t &amp;= \sigma_g(U_{r} h_{t-1}) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
*  Type 3, each gate is computed using only the bias.
*: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z_t &amp;= \sigma_g(b_z) \\
r_t &amp;= \sigma_g(b_r) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Minimal gated unit ===
The minimal gated unit is similar to the fully gated unit, except the update and reset gate vector is merged into a forget gate. This also implies that the equation for the output vector must be changed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Heck|first=Joel|last2=Salem|first2=Fathi M.|date=2017-01-12|title=Simplified Minimal Gated Unit Variations for Recurrent Neural Networks|eprint=1701.03452 |class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_t &amp;= \sigma_g(W_{f} x_t + U_{f} h_{t-1} + b_f) \\
h_t &amp;=  f_t \circ h_{t-1} + (1-f_t) \circ \sigma_h(W_{h} x_t + U_{h} (f_t \circ h_{t-1}) + b_h)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Variables
* &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;: input vector
* &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;: output vector
* &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt;: forget vector
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;: parameter matrices and vector

'''''Going postal''''' is an [[American English]] [[slang]] phrase referring to becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment. The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward in which [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general public in acts of [[mass murder]]. Between 1970 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed by current or former employees in at least 20 incidents of [[workplace rage]]. Between 1986 and 2011, workplace shootings happened at roughly two per year, with an average of 12 people killed per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asisonline.org/globalassets/foundation/documents/crisp-reports/crisp_mass-homicides-by-employees-american-workplace.pdf|title=Mass Homicides by Employees in the American Workplace|last=Lee|first=Seungmug|last2=McCrie|first2=Robert|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The earliest known use of the phrase was on December 17, 1993, in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'':

{{quote|The symposium was sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service, which has seen so many outbursts that in some circles excessive stress is known as 'going postal.' Thirty-five people have been killed in 11 post office shootings since 1983. The USPS does not approve of the term "going postal" and has made attempts to stop people from using the saying. Some postal workers, however, feel it has earned its place.&lt;ref name="vick"&gt;Vick, Karl, "Violence at work tied to loss of esteem", ''St. Petersburg Times'', Dec 17, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 31, 1993, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated:

{{quote|Unlike the more deadly mass shootings around the nation, which have lent a new term to the language, referring to shooting up the office as "going postal".&lt;ref&gt;"The Year in Review 1993", ''Los Angeles Times'', December 31, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A former United States postal worker, Joseph M. Harris, killed his former supervisor, Carol Ott, and killed her boyfriend, Cornelius Kasten Jr., at their home.  The following morning, on October 10, 1991, Harris shot and killed two mail handlers, Joseph M. VanderPaauw, 59, of [[Prospect Park, New Jersey]], and Donald McNaught, 63, of [[Pompton Lakes, New Jersey]], at the [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/11/nyregion/4-slain-in-2-new-jersey-attacks-and-former-postal-clerk-is-held.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Hanley | title=4 Slain in 2 New Jersey Attacks And Former Postal Clerk Is Held | date=October 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/a-former-postal-worker-commits-mass-murder| title=

===Royal Oak, Michigan, 1991===
[[File:RoyalOakPostoffice.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The U.S. post office in Royal Oak]]

On November 14, 1991 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], Thomas McIlvane killed five people, including himself, with a rifle in Royal Oak's post office, after being fired from the Postal Service for "insubordination." He had been previously suspended for getting into altercations with postal customers on his route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

For some time prior to the Royal Oak incident the service had experienced labor/management and operational problems and customer service complaints. This had drawn the attention of local media. The Office of Senator Carl Levin investigated Royal Oak, the results of which were summarized in a September 10, 1991, staff memorandum. The memorandum documented "patterns of harassment, intimidation, cruelty and allegations of favoritism in promotions and demotions ... [and] testimony relating to wide-ranging delivery and service problems" prior to the McIlvane shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1462820409|title=The Tainted Eagle|last=Withers|first=Charlie|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A post office tragedy:the shooting at Royal Oak, report of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 102 Congress, {{ISBN|9780160386589}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two events in 1993===
Two shootings took place on the same day, May 6, 1993, a few hours apart. At a post office in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], Lawrence Jasion wounded three and killed one, and subsequently killed himself. In [[Dana Point, California]], Mark Richard Hilbun killed his mother and her dog, then shot two postal workers dead.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory K. Moffatt, Blind-Sided: Homicide Where It Is Least Expected, at 37 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of these two shootings, in 1993 the  USPS created 85 Workplace Environment Analysts for domicile at its 85 postal districts. These new positions were created to help with violence prevention and workplace improvement. In February 2009, the   USPS unilaterally eliminated these positions as part of its downsizing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Musacco|first=Stephen|title=Beyond going postal: Shifting from workplace tragedies and toxic workplace environments to a safe and healthy organization|year=2009|publisher=Booksurge|page=34|quote=the notion of 'going postal' as a myth is not supported by the overwhelming evidence to the contrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goleta, California, 2006===

When he arrived at the parking lot, he reportedly ran over his supervisor several times. He then went into the post office looking for his postmaster. Not finding him, he went back out to the parking lot and shot his supervisor.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"&gt;http://www.bakercityherald.com/csp/mediapool/sites/BakerCityHerald/LocalNews/story.csp?cid=4122312&amp;sid=818&amp;fid=151&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaher was on a new route for three weeks and had felt pressured by a week-long work-time study and extra time added to his new route.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"/&gt;

On June 14, 2017, [[San Francisco UPS shooting#cite note-LAT-170615-1|Jimmy Lam]], 38, fatally shot three coworkers at a [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) facility in the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco, California]]. Lam then shot and killed himself as police arrived at the facility. Two others were wounded by gunfire, and three people were injured while escaping.

==Analysis==
Researchers have found that the homicide rates at postal facilities were lower than at other workplaces. In major industries, the highest rate of 2.1 homicides per 100,000 workers per year was in retail. The homicide rate for postal workers was 0.22 per 100,000 versus 0.77 per 100,000 workers in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps12068/33994.pdf Permanent.access.gpo.gov ''Report of The United States Postal Service Commission On A Safe And Secure Workplace'' August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The common depiction of an employee returning to work for revenge on his boss is overdone.  More than half of mass workplace shooting are by current employees, and a little under a quarter are by employees who have been at their job for less than a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] conducted a joint hearing to review the violence in the U.S. Postal Service. In the hearing, it was noted that despite the postal service accounting for less than 1% of the full-time civilian labor force, 13% of workplace homicides were committed at postal facilities by current or former employees.&lt;ref&gt;Musacco, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
In the controversial video game series ''[[Postal (video game series)|Postal]]'', the player takes on the role of an insane mass murderer in the first game, and in the later series a first-person role performing normally mundane chores (such as picking up a paycheck from work) with an often gratuitously violent twist.  In 1997, the USPS sued the creators of the game, [[Running With Scissors (company)|Running With Scissors]], over the use of the term "postal".  Running With Scissors argued that, despite its title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with the USPS or its employees. The case was dismissed [[Prejudice (legal term)|with prejudice]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Justin|title=Postal court case dismissed|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-court-case-dismissed/1100-6030580/|accessdate=25 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 comedy film ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' includes a scene where the main character must deal with a series of escalating threats, including the sudden appearance of dozens of disgruntled postal workers randomly firing weapons in every direction.

The 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' is credited with popularizing the phrase "going postal" and is responsible for the term's casual usage still today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skeels|first=Virginia|title=The cast of Clueless reunites|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2213701/The-cast-Clueless-reunites-remembering-Brittany-Murphy.html|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in the film had no idea what it meant to "go postal," since it was an uncommon phrase at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first=Nico|title=25 Little-Known Facts About Clueless|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2012/11/25-little-known-facts-about-clueless/|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the 2004 book ''[[Going Postal]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] makes reference to the contents of the novel, but in future novels of the [[Discworld]] universe characters use the term "going postal" in the common sense, apparently referring to the events of ''Going Postal''.

As referenced on the Simpsons, during Episode "Sunday Cruddy Sunday", Bart and Lisa visit the post office and Nelson asks:
* '''Nelson:''' Have you ever gone on a killing spree?
* '''Postmaster Bill:''' (laughing) Ho ho ho, nooo noo, the day of the gun toting disgruntled postman shooting up the place went out with the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]].

In the ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' episode ''[[USPIS (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|USPIS]]'', a self-righteous [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] agent passionate about his job is adamant that "going postal" is the term most associated with bringing goodness into people's lives, which is a view also shared by his co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-season-2-ed-helms-uspis.html|access-date=August 7, 2018|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Recap: Going Postal|first=Allie|last=Pape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greek love''' is a term originally used by [[Classical antiquity|classicists]] to describe the primarily [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] customs, practices, and attitudes of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].

In his classic study ''Greek Homosexuality'', [[Kenneth Dover]] points out that the English nouns "a [[homosexual]]" and "a [[heterosexual]]" have no equivalent in the [[ancient Greek language]]. There was no concept in ancient Greece equivalent to the modern conception of "sexual preference"; it was assumed that a person would have both hetero- and homosexual responses at different times.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;[[Kenneth Dover|Dover, Kenneth J.]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1, et passim}} Evidence for same-sex attractions and behaviors is more abundant for men than for women. Both romantic love and sexual passion between men were often considered normal, and under some circumstances healthy or admirable.

L.]],''Studies in Greek Elegy and Iambus'', Walter de Gruyter and Co. (1974), page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]] and [[ancient Greek literature|literature]] portray these relationships as sometimes erotic or sexual, or sometimes idealized, educational, non-consummated, or non-sexual. A distinctive feature of Greek male-male [[eros (concept)|eros]] was its occurrence [[Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece|within a military setting]], as with the [[Theban Band]],&lt;ref name=Sacksencyc/&gt;{{rp|115–117}} though the extent to which homosexual bonds played a military role has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Leitao, David, "The legend of the Theban Band", in M. Craven Nussbaum and J. Sihvola, ''The Sleep of Reason'': Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'', Chicago University Press (2002), pp. 140–150&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] have been interpreted as reflecting the custom of ''paiderasteia'', most notably the myth of [[Zeus]] kidnapping [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] to become his cupbearer in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[symposium]].&lt;ref name=Sacksencyc/&gt;{{rp|117}} The death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]] is also frequently referenced as a pederastic myth.

The main Greek literary sources for Greek homosexuality are lyric poetry, Athenian comedy, the works of [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], and courtroom speeches from Athens. [[Ancient Greek pottery|Vase paintings]] from the 500s and 400s BCE depict courtship and sex between males.&lt;ref name=Sacksencyc/&gt;{{rp|115}}

==Ancient Rome==

In [[Latin]], ''mos Graeciae'' or ''mos Graecorum'' ("Greek custom" or "the way of the Greeks") refers to a variety of behaviors the ancient Romans regarded as Greek, including but not confined to sexual practice.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|72}}  Homosexual behaviors at Rome were acceptable only within an inherently unequal relationship; male Roman citizens retained their masculinity as long as they took the active, penetrating role, and the appropriate male sexual partner was a prostitute or slave, who would nearly always be non-Roman.&lt;ref&gt;King, Helen, "Sowing the Field: Greek and Roman Sexology", in ''Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[classical Greece]], ''paiderasteia'' had been a formal social relationship between freeborn males; taken out of context and refashioned as the luxury product of a conquered people, pederasty came to express roles based on domination and exploitation.&lt;ref name=Pollini&gt;Pollini, John, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver", in ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37, 40–41 ''et passim''}} Slaves often were given, and prostitutes sometimes assumed, Greek names regardless of their ethnic origin; the boys ''([[Homosexuality in ancient Rome#Puer|pueri]])'' to whom the poet [[Martial]] is attracted have Greek names.&lt;ref&gt;Joshel, Sandra R., ''Slavery in the Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 78 and 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Younger, John G. ''Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of slaves defined Roman pederasty; sexual practices were "somehow 'Greek{{'"}} when they were directed at "freeborn boys openly courted in accordance with the Hellenic tradition of pederasty".&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Effeminacy or a lack of discipline in managing one's sexual attraction to another male threatened a man's "Roman-ness" and thus might be disparaged as "Eastern" or "Greek". Fears that Greek models might "corrupt" traditional Roman social codes (the ''[[mos maiorum]]'') seem to have prompted a vaguely documented law (''[[Lex Scantinia]]'') that attempted to regulate aspects of homosexual relationships between freeborn males and to protect Roman youth from older men emulating Greek customs of pederasty.&lt;ref name=Pollini/&gt;{{rp|27}} &lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, Jan, "An Enigmatic Indo-European Rite: Paederasty", in ''Arethusa'' 13.2 (1980), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the close of the 2nd century BCE, however, the elevation of [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] and [[Ancient Greek art|art]] as models of expression caused homoeroticism to be regarded as urbane and sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay MacMullen|MacMullen, Ramsay]], "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love", in ''Historia'' 31.4 (1982), pp. 484–502.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] was among a circle of poets who made short, light [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic poems]] fashionable in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BCE – 30 BCE)|late Republic]]. One of his few surviving fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name, signaling the new aesthetic in Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella|Cantarella, Eva]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Edward, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization]] of elite culture influenced sexual attitudes among "avant-garde, [[philhellenism|philhellenic]] Romans",&lt;ref name=Pollini/&gt;{{rp|28}} as distinguished from [[sexual orientation]] or behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, David M., "The First Homosexuality?" in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 242 and 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and came to fruition in the "[[neoteric|new poetry]]" of the 50s BCE. The poems of [[Gaius Valerius Catullus]], written in forms adapted from [[List of classical meters|Greek meters]], include several expressing desire for a freeborn youth explicitly named "Youth" (''Iuventius''). His Latin name and free-born status subvert pederastic tradition at Rome.&lt;ref name=Pollini/&gt;{{rp|28}} Catullus's poems are more often addressed to a woman.

The literary ideal celebrated by Catullus stands in contrast to the practice of elite Romans who kept a ''[[Homosexuality in ancient Rome#puer delicatus|puer delicatus]]'' ("exquisite boy") as a form of high-status sexual consumption, a practice that continued well into the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]]. The ''puer delicatus'' was a slave chosen from the pages who served in a high-ranking household. He was selected for his good looks and grace to serve at his master's side, where he is often depicted in art. Among his duties, at a ''[[Symposium|convivium]]'' he would enact the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] role of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] youth [[raptio|abducted]] by [[Zeus]] to serve as a divine [[cupbearer]].&lt;ref name=Pollini/&gt;{{rp|34}} Attacks on emperors such as [[Nero]] and [[Elagabalus]], whose young male partners accompanied them in public for official ceremonies, criticized the perceived "Greekness" of male-male sexuality.&lt;ref name="Vout C. 2007"&gt;[[Caroline Vout|Vout C.]], ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'', Cambridge University Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}} "Greek love", or the cultural model of Greek pederasty in ancient Rome, is a "[[literary topos|topos]] or [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|literary game]]" that "never stops being Greek in the Roman imagination", an erotic pose to be distinguished from the varieties of real-world sexuality among individuals.&lt;ref name="Vout C. 2007"/&gt;{{rp|67}} Vout sees the views of Williams and MacMullen as opposite extremes on the subject&lt;ref name="Vout C. 2007"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

For Ficino, "Platonic love" was a bond between two men that fosters a shared emotional and intellectual life, as distinguished from the "Greek love" practiced historically as the ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastes]]/[[eromenos]]'' relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Endres, "Plato, Platotude, and Blatancy in E.M. Forster's ''Maurice''", in ''Alma parens originalis?: The Receptions of Classical Literature and Thought in Africa, Europe, the United States, and Cuba'' (Peter Lang, 2007), p. 178, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ficino thus points toward the modern usage of "Platonic love" to mean love without sexuality. In his commentary to the ''Symposium'', Ficino carefully separates the act of [[sodomy]], which he condemned, and praises Socratic love as the highest form of friendship. Ficino maintained that men could use each other's beauty and friendship to discover the greatest good, that is, God, and thus [[Christianization|Christianized]] idealized male love as expressed by [[Socrates]].&lt;ref name=Aldrich1993/&gt;{{rp|38}}

During the Renaissance, artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]] used Plato's philosophy as inspiration for some of their greatest works. The "rediscovery" of classical antiquity was perceived as a liberating experience, and Greek love as an ideal after a Platonic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Leonardo the Florentine - A Study in Personality | last=Taylor| first=Rachel Annand | publisher = Kiefer Press |date = March 15, 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ACLMFYKviNcC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;dq=Greek+love,+Platonic+love,+Socratic+love+Michelangelo&amp;lr== 483] | isbn=978-1-4067-2927-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo presented himself to the public as a Platonic lover of men, combining Catholic orthodoxy and pagan enthusiasm in his portrayal of the male form, most notably the ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'',&lt;ref name="Crompton2006"/&gt;{{rp|270}} but his great-nephew edited his poems to diminish references to his love for [[Tommaso Cavalieri]].&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

By contrast, the [[French Renaissance]] essayist [[Montaigne]], whose view of love and friendship was [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[rationalist]], rejected "Greek love" as a model in his essay "De l'amitié" ("On Friendship"); it did not accord with the social needs of his own time, he wrote, because it involved "a necessary disparity in age and such a difference in the lovers' functions".&lt;ref&gt;''Et cet'autre licence Grecque est justement abhorrée par nos muers'': Montaigne, "De l'amitié" (1580), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KMoYEWULo2UC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=Montaigne+%22greek+love%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KrIITq-vBIy-tgeHhq3HDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 187a and c], as cited and discussed by Zahi Anbra Zalloua, ''Montaigne and the Ethics of Skepticism'' (Rockwood Press, 2005), pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Montaigne saw friendship as a relationship between equals in the context of [[political liberty]], this inequality diminished the value of Greek love.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Platt, "Montaigne, Of Friendship, and On Tyranny", in ''Freedom over Servitude: Montaigne, La Boétie, and "On Voluntary Servitude"'' (Greenwood, 1998), p. 58; special emphasis on the context of political liberty in Marc D. Schachter, {{"'}}That Friendship Which Possesses the Soul': Montaigne Loves La Boétie", in ''Homosexuality in French History and Culture'' (Haworth Press, 2001), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical beauty and sexual attraction inherent in the Greek model for Montaigne were not necessary conditions of friendship, and he dismisses homosexual relations, which he refers to as ''licence grecque'', as socially repulsive.&lt;ref&gt;Zalloua, ''Montaigne and the Ethics of Skepticism'', p. 87. Platt, "Montaigne", p. 58, thinks that Montaigne's emphasis on equality is more important than the rejection of "bodily love between males" in the passage. Montaigne also regards women as incapable of true friendship.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the wholesale importation of a Greek model would be socially improper, ''licence grecque'' seems to refer only to licentious homosexual conduct, in contrast to the moderate behavior between men in the perfect friendship. When Montaigne chooses to introduce his essay on friendship with recourse to the Greek model, "homosexuality's role as [[trope (literature)|trope]] is more important than its status as actual male-male desire or act&amp;nbsp;... ''licence grecque'' becomes an aesthetic device to frame the center."&lt;ref&gt;Todd W.

==English Romanticism==
[[File:Portrait of Lord Byron - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Byron in Greek nationalist costume (c. 1830) with the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in the background]]

The concept of Greek love was important to two of the most significant [[Romantic poetry|poets]] of English [[Romanticism]], [[Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. The [[British Regency|Regency in England was an era]] characterized by hostility and a "frenzy of&amp;nbsp;... persecutions" against homosexuals, the most virulent decades of which coincided with Byron's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 3, as evidenced by readings in "poets and novelists, theologians, journal writers, and historians, along with newspapers, political speeches, reports of religious societies, and popular pamphlets".&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "homosexual" and "[[gay]]" were not used during this period, but "Greek love" among Byron's contemporaries became a way to conceptualize homosexuality, otherwise taboo, within the precedents of a highly esteemed classical past. The philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], for instance, appealed to social models of classical antiquity, such as the homoerotic bonds of the [[Theban Band]] and pederasty, to demonstrate how these relationships did not inherently erode heterosexual marriage or the family structure.&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|38–53}}

The high regard for classical antiquity in the 18th century caused some adjustment in [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes on [[Continental Europe|the Continent]], but not in England.&lt;ref name="Crompton2006"/&gt;{{rp|86}} In Germany, the prestige of [[classical philology]] led eventually to more honest translations and essays that examined the homoeroticism of Greek culture, particularly pederasty, in the context of scholarly inquiry rather than moral condemnation. Religious and nationalist sentiments in England overall remained hostile.&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt; An English archbishop, however, penned what may be the most effusive account of Greek pederasty available in English at the time, duly noted by Byron on the "List of Historical Writers Whose Works I Have Perused" that he drew up at age 19.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 97–97. In his ''Antiquities of Greece'' (1697–1699), [[John Potter (bishop)|Archbishop John Potter]] assumed that "the excellent passion" of the [[Theban Band]] was chaste. Potter echoes [[Athenaeus]]'s praise of pederasty, and [[Strabo]]'s account of [[Cretan pederasty]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato was little read in Byron's time, in contrast to the later [[Victorian era]] when translations of the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' would have been the most likely way for a young student to learn about Greek sexuality.&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|89}} The one English translation of the ''Symposium'', published in two parts in 1761 and 1767, was an ambitious undertaking by the scholar [[Floyer Sydenham]], who nevertheless was at pains to suppress its homoeroticism: Sydenham regularly translated the word ''[[eromenos]]'' as "mistress", and "boy" often becomes "maiden" or "woman".&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|89–90}} At the same time, the classical curriculum in English schools passed over works of history and philosophy in favor of  Latin and Greek poetry that often dealt with erotic themes.&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|91}}
In describing homoerotic aspects of Byron's life and work, Louis Crompton uses the umbrella term "Greek love" to cover literary and cultural models of homosexuality from classical antiquity as a whole, both Greek and Roman,&lt;ref&gt;Latin literature in particular was seen as continuing or deriving from a Greek heritage.&lt;/ref&gt; as received by intellectuals, artists, and moralists of the time. To those such as Byron who were steeped in classical literature, the phrase "Greek love" evoked pederastic myths such as [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], as well as historical figures such as the political martyrs [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], and [[Hadrian]]'s beloved [[Antinous]]; Byron refers to all these stories in his writings. He was even more familiar with the classical tradition of male love in Latin literature, and quoted or translated homoerotic passages from [[Catullus]], [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], and [[Petronius]],&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|11}} whose name "was a byword for homosexuality in the eighteenth century".&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|93}} In Byron's circle at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], "Horatian" was a code word for "[[bisexual]]".&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt; In correspondence, Byron and his friends resorted to the code of classical [[allusion]]s, in one exchange referring with elaborate [[pun]]s to "Hyacinths" who might be struck by [[coits]], as the mythological Hyacinthus was accidentally felled while throwing the [[discus]] with [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;Via a punning allusion to Petronius's ''Satyricon,'' ''plenum et optabilem coitum'' ("full and to-be-wished-for [[wikt:coitus|coitus]]"); Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 127–129.

Shelley complained that contemporary reticence about homosexuality kept modern readers without a knowledge of the original languages from understanding a vital part of ancient Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton's summary in ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 87, citing "A Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love", in ''The Platonism of Shelley'', ed. James A. Notopoulos (Duke University Press, 1949), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry was influenced by the "androgynous male beauty" represented in Winckelmann's art history.&lt;ref name="Crompton1985"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Shelley wrote his ''Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love'' on the Greek conception of love in 1818 during his first summer in Italy, concurrently with his translation of Plato's ''Symposium''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Victorian era==
Throughout the 19th century, upper-class men of same-sex orientation or sympathies regarded "Greek love", often used as a euphemism for the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient pederastic relationship]] between a man and a youth, as a "legitimating ideal":&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Ned Katz]], ''Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; "the prestige of Greece among educated middle-class [[Victorians]]&amp;nbsp;... was so massive that invocations of [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]] could cast a veil of respectability over even a hitherto unmentionable vice or crime."&lt;ref name=dowling&gt;Dowling, Linda. ''Hellenism and Homosexuality in Victorian Oxford'' (Cornell University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} Homosexuality emerged as a category of thought during the [[Victorian era]] in relation to [[classical studies]] and "manly" [[nationalism]]; the discourse of "Greek love" during this time generally excluded women's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz, introduction to ''Among Women: From the Homosocial to the Homoerotic in the Ancient World'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), pp. 9–10; Joan DeJean, "Sex and Philology: Sappho and the Rise of German Nationalism", in ''Re-reading Sappho: Reception and Transmission'' (University of California Press, 1996), p. 139ff. Deborah Cohler, ''Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2010), p. 8, observes that "homosexuality in women was located only through medical or anthropological measure, reserving the 'highly regarded' classical studies for the realm of men only."&lt;/ref&gt; Late Victorian writers such as [[Walter Pater]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[John Addington Symonds]] saw in "Greek love" a way to introduce individuality and diversity within their own civilization.&lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|66}} Pater's short story "Apollo in Picardy" is set at a fictional monastery where a pagan stranger named Apollyon causes the death of the young novice Hyacinth; the monastery "maps Greek love" as the site of a potential "homoerotic community" within [[Anglo-Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Roden, ''Same-Sex Desire in Victorian Religious Culture'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Others who addressed the subject of Greek love in letters, essays, and poetry include [[Arthur Henry Hallam]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dellamora, ''Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics of Victorian Aestheticism'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1990), pp. 23–25, with further discussion of Hallam and his relations with other literary figures ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--others should be listed here as an overview of the relevant figures in the Victorian era--&gt;

The efforts among aesthetes and intellectuals to legitimate various forms of homosexual behaviors and attitudes by virtue of a Hellenic model were not without opposition. The 1877 essay "The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature" by [[Richard St. John Tyrwhitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''The Contemporary Review'' 29 (1877), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UbICAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA552 pp. 552–566.]&lt;/ref&gt; warned against the perceived immorality of this agenda. Tyrwhitt, who was a vigorous supporter of [[Ancient Greek grammar|studying Greek]], characterized the Hellenism of his day as "the total denial of any moral restraint on any human impulses", and outlined what he saw as the proper scope of Greek influence on the education of young men.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrwhitt, "The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature", pp. 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tyrwhitt and other critics attacked by name several scholars and writers who had tried to use Plato to support an early gay-rights agenda and whose careers were subsequently damaged by their association with "Greek love".&lt;ref name="BlanshardGreek"/&gt;{{rp|145}} &lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|90–92}}

===Symonds and Greek ethics===
In 1873, the poet and literary critic [[John Addington Symonds]] wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what could later be called "[[gay history]]", inspired by the poetry of [[Walt Whitman#Sexuality|Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 244. Katz notes that "Whitman's knowledge of and response to ancient Greek love is the subject for a major study" (p. 381, note 6).&lt;/ref&gt; The work, "perhaps the most exhaustive eulogy of Greek love",&lt;ref name="DeJeanSex"&gt;DeJean, "Sex and Philology", p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; remained unpublished for a decade, and then was printed at first only in a limited edition for private distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 244. ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'' was later published without attribution in [[Havelock Ellis]]'s ''Sexual Inversion'' (1897); see Eric O. Clarke, ''Virtuous Vice: Homoeroticism and the Public Sphere'' (Duke University Press, 2000), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symonds's approach throughout most of the essay is primarily [[classical philology|philological]]. He treats "Greek love" as central to Greek "aesthetic morality".&lt;ref name="DeJeanSex" /&gt; Aware of the taboo nature of his subject matter, Symonds referred obliquely to pederasty as "that unmentionable custom" in a letter to a prospective reader of the book,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; but defined "Greek love" in the essay itself as "a passionate and enthusiastic attachment subsisting between man and youth, recognised by society and protected by opinion, which, though it was not free from sensuality, did not degenerate into mere licentiousness".&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Pulham, ''Art and Transitional Object'', p. 59, and Anne Hermann, ''Queering the Moderns: Poses/Portraits/Performances'' (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symonds studied classics under [[Benjamin Jowett]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and later worked with Jowett on an English translation of Plato's ''Symposium''.&lt;ref name=Aldrich1993/&gt;{{rp|78}} When Jowett was critical of Symonds' opinions on sexuality, Dowling notes that Jowett, in his lectures and introductions, discussed love between men and women when Plato himself had been talking about the Greek love for boys.&lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|74}} Symonds asserted that "Greek love was for Plato no 'figure of speech', but a present and poignant reality. Greek love is for modern studies of Plato no 'figure of speech' and no anachronism, but a present poignant reality."&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 78, citing a letter written by Symonds. Passage discussed also by Dowling, p. 130, and Bart Schultz, ''Henry Sidgwick: An Intellectual Biography'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Symonds struggled against the desexualization of "[[Platonic love]]", and sought to debunk the association of effeminacy with homosexuality by advocating a Spartan-inspired view of male love as contributing to military and political bonds.&lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|130}} When Symonds was falsely accused of corrupting choirboys, Jowett supported him, despite his own equivocal views of the relation of Hellenism to contemporary legal and social issues that affected homosexuals.&lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|88,91}}

[[File:Symonds, John Addington.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Addington Symonds, in a photo he signed for Walt Whitman]]
Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems": "The metaphors are Greek, the tone [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] and the emotions a bit sentimental for present-day readers."&lt;ref name=Aldrich1993/&gt;{{rp|78}}

One of the ways in which Symonds and Whitman expressed themselves in their correspondence on the subject of homosexuality was through references to ancient Greek culture, such as the intimate friendship between [[Callicrates of Sparta|Callicrates]], "the most beautiful man among the Spartans", and the soldier [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Aristodemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''Love Stories'', pp. 243–244.&lt;/ref&gt; Symonds was influenced by [[Karl Otfried Müller]]'s work on the [[Dorians]], which included an "unembarrassed" examination of the place of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Sparta|pederasty in Spartan pedagogy, military life, and society]].&lt;ref name=dowling/&gt;{{rp|xv}} Symonds distinguished between "heroic love", for which the ideal friendship of [[Achilles and Patroclus]] served as a model, and "Greek love", which combined social ideals with "vulgar" reality.&lt;ref name="DeJeanSex" /&gt; Symonds envisioned a "nationalist homosexuality" based on the model of Greek love, distanced from effeminacy and "debasing" behaviors and viewed as "in its origin and essence, military".&lt;ref&gt;Cohler, ''Citizen, Invert, Queer'', p. 7, quoting Symonds, ''A Problem in Sexual Ethics''. See also Douglass Shand-Tucci, ''The Crimson Letter: Harvard, Homosexuality, and the Shaping of American Culture'' (St. Martin's Press, 2003), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to reconcile his presentation of Greek love with [[Christian values|Christian]] and [[chivalry|chivalrous values]].&lt;ref name=Aldrich1993/&gt;{{rp|80}} His strategy for influencing social acceptance of homosexuality and legal reform in England included evoking an idealized Greek model that reflected [[Victorian morality|Victorian moral values]] such as honor, devotion, and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Aldrich1993/&gt;{{rp|83}} &lt;ref&gt;Cole, Sarah. ''Modernism, Male Friendship, and the First World War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 44, on Greek homoeroticism as conceived in Symonds's time as "a form of love which in practice can never match the ideal as presented by the poets".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pulham, ''Art and Transitional Object'', pp. 59ff., points out that despite attempts to "sanitize" Greek love, the Victorian use of classical mythology and texts necessarily admit the "unruly qualities" of sexual desire that the originals contain.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trial of Oscar Wilde===
{{Details|Oscar Wilde#Trials}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
During his relationship with [[Lord Alfred Douglas|Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas]], Wilde frequently invoked the historical precedent of Greek models of love and masculinity, calling Douglas the contemporary "Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly," in a letter to him in July 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters|last=|first=|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Holland|editor-first=Merlin|location=New York|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Oscar Wilde marked the end of the period when proponents of "Greek love" could hope to legitimate homosexuality by appeals to a classical model.&lt;ref name="BlanshardGreek"/&gt;{{rp|159–160}} During the cross examination, Wilde defended his statement that "pleasure is the only thing one should live for," by acknowledging: "I am, on that point, entirely on the side of the ancients—the Greeks. It is a pagan idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famous-trials.com/wilde/346-literarypart|title=Testimony of Oscar Wilde on Cross Examination (April 3,1895)(Literary Part)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of sexology, however, that kind of defense failed to hold.&lt;ref name="BlanshardGreek" /&gt;&lt;!--Daniel Orrells, ''Classical Culture and Modern Masculinity'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) has a chapter on this topic --&gt;

==20th and 21st centuries==
The legacy of Greece in homosexual aesthetics became problematic, and the meaning of a "costume" derived from classical antiquity was questioned.&lt;ref name="BlanshardGreek"/&gt; The French theorist [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984), perhaps best known for his work ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', rejected [[essentialist]] conceptions of gay history, and fostered a now "widely accepted" view that "Greek love is not a prefiguration of modern homosexuality."&lt;ref name=Eriobon&gt;Eriobon, Didier.

'''John William Angus''' (1 December 1868 –1933) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who played as a [[Striker (association football)|forward]] in [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[1894–95 Southampton St. Mary's F.C. season|inaugural season]] in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].

==Football career==
Born in [[Blythswood Hill]], [[Glasgow]], he started his career at [[Third Lanark F.C.|Third Lanark]], before joining English  side [[Ardwick A.F.C.|Ardwick]] (later [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]) in March 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toovey|first=Paul |title=Manchester City –The Birth of the Blues 1880–1894 |publisher=Paul Toovey |year=2009 |location=Stockport |isbn=978-0-9561910-0-7|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1892–93 in English football|1892–93 season]] was Ardwick's first in the [[Football League]], and Angus scored in the club's first ever League match, a 7–0 win against [[Bootle F.C.|Bootle]].&lt;ref&gt;Toovey, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he scored three league goals from seven appearances for the Manchester club. Angus then moved to the south coast to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton St Mary's]] in the summer of 1893.

Angus was one of the first professional players signed by Southampton. He played in the Saints' two [[FA Cup]] qualifying matches in November 1893 as well as friendlies and local cup matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Gary |last1=Chalk | first2=Duncan |last2=Holley | title=Saints – A complete record| publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987|page=15| isbn=0-907969-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Described by Holley &amp; Chalk as "a deft and aggressive forward",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2= Gary |last2=Chalk | title=The Alphabet of the Saints| publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing | year=1992|page=14| isbn=0-9514862-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first Saints player to be [[Penalty card#Red card|sent off]] for an "over zealous" tackle in a Hampshire Senior Cup match on 24 February 1894 against local rivals [[Freemantle F.C.|Freemantle]].

In [[1894–95 in English football#Southern League|1894]] Southampton were founder members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and Angus played at [[inside forward]], in a forward line-up including [[Charles Baker (footballer)|Charles Baker]], [[Fred Hollands]], [[Harry Offer]] and [[Herbert Ward (footballer)|Herbert Ward]]. He scored in the "Saints"' first game in the Southern League and went on to score six goals that season, making him joint top scorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last=  |first=   | publisher=  | year= | isbn=  |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, he made three more league appearances before leaving the club in November 1895. In all he made 23 appearances for the Saints, scoring 11 goals. He subsequently played for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], but little is known about his later life.

'''Karen Gay Silkwood''' (February 19, 1946&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; November 13, 1974) was  an American chemical technician and [[Trade union|labor union]] [[Activism|activist]] known for raising concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety of workers in a nuclear facility. Following her mysterious death, which received extensive coverage, her estate filed a lawsuit against chemical company [[Kerr-McGee]], which was eventually settled for $1.38 million. Her story was chronicled in [[Mike Nichols]]'s 1983 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Silkwood]]'' in which she was portrayed by [[Meryl Streep]].

She worked at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] plant near [[Crescent, Oklahoma]], United States. Silkwood's job was making [[plutonium]] [[Pelletizing|pellets]] for [[nuclear reactor]] fuel rods. This plant experienced theft of plutonium by workers during this era{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. She joined the union and became an [[activist]] on behalf of issues of health and safety at the plant as a member of the union's negotiating team, the first woman to have that position at Kerr-McGee. In the summer of 1974, she testified to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] about her concerns.

For three days in November, she was found to have plutonium contamination on her person and in her home.  That month, while driving to meet with David Burnham, a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' journalist, and Steve Wodka, an official of her union's national office, she died in a car crash under unclear circumstances.

Her family sued Kerr-McGee on behalf of her estate. In what was the longest trial up until then in Oklahoma history, the jury found Kerr-McGee liable for the plutonium contamination of Silkwood, and awarded substantial damages. These were reduced on appeal, but the case reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in 1979, which upheld the damages verdict. Before another trial took place, Kerr-McGee settled with the estate out of court for US $1.38 million, while not admitting liability.

== Family==
Karen Gay Silkwood was born in [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], [[Texas]], the daughter of Merle ([[Given name#Name at birth|née]] Biggs 1926&amp;ndash;2014)&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt; and William Silkwood, and raised in [[Nederland, Texas|Nederland]], Texas. She had two sisters, Linda and Rosemary. She attended [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]].{{r|Kleiner}} In 1965, she married William Meadows, an oil pipeline worker, with whom she had three children. Following the couple's bankruptcy due to Meadows' overspending, and in the face of Meadows' refusal to end an extramarital affair, Silkwood left Meadows in 1972 and moved to [[Oklahoma City]], where she briefly worked as a hospital clerk.{{r|Garraty}}{{r|Booth}}{{r|Rashke|p=2}}

== Union activities ==
After being hired at Kerr-McGee in 1972, Silkwood joined the local [[Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union|Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Union]] and took part in a strike at the plant. After the strike ended, she was elected to the union's bargaining committee, the first woman to achieve that position at the Kerr-McGee plant.{{r|Kleiner}} She was assigned to investigate health and safety issues. She discovered what she believed to be numerous violations of health regulations, including exposure of workers to contamination, faulty respiratory equipment and improper storage of samples. She believed the lack of sufficient shower facilities could increase the risk of employee contamination.{{r|Rashke|pp=19&amp;ndash;23}}

The Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union said that "the Kerr-McGee plant had manufactured faulty fuel rods, falsified product inspection records, and risked employee safety;" it threatened litigation.{{r|Kleiner}} In the summer of 1974, Silkwood testified to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) about having been contaminated, alleging that safety standards had slipped because of a production speedup. She was appearing with other union members.{{r|Rashke|pp=22&amp;ndash;23}}

On November 5, 1974, Silkwood performed a routine self-check and found that her body contained almost 400 times the legal limit for plutonium contamination. She was decontaminated at the plant and sent home with a testing kit to collect urine and feces for further analysis. Although there was plutonium on the inner portions of the gloves which she had been using, the gloves did not have any holes. This suggests the contamination had come not from inside the glovebox, but from some other source.{{r|LAS|p=252}}

The next morning, as she headed to a union negotiation meeting, Silkwood again tested positive for plutonium, although she had performed only paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intensive decontamination. On November 7, as she entered the plant, she was found to be dangerously contaminated, even expelling contaminated air from her lungs. A [[health physics]] team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces, especially in the bathroom and the refrigerator. When the house was later stripped and decontaminated, some of her property had to be destroyed. Silkwood, her boyfriend Drew Stephens, and her roommate [[Dusty Ellis]], were sent to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for in-depth testing to determine the extent of the contamination in their bodies.{{r|LAS|p=253}}

Questions arose over how Silkwood became contaminated over this three-day period. She said the contamination in the bathroom may have occurred when she spilled her urine sample on the morning of November 7. This was consistent with the evidence that samples she took at home had extremely high levels of contamination, while samples taken in "fresh" jars at the plant and at Los Alamos showed much lower contamination.{{r|LAS|p=253}}

She thought she had been contaminated at the plant. Kerr-McGee's management said that Silkwood had contaminated herself in order to portray the company in a negative light. According to [[Richard Rashke|Richard L. Rashke]]'s book, ''The Killing of Karen Silkwood'' (1981/2000), security at the plant was so lax that workers could easily smuggle out finished plutonium pellets.{{r|Rashke|pp=56&amp;ndash;62}} Rashke wrote that the soluble type of plutonium found in Silkwood's body came from a production area which she had not accessed for four months. The pellets had since been stored in the vault of the facility.{{r|Rashke|pp={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}}

== Death ==
Silkwood said she had assembled documentation for her claims, including company papers. She decided to go public with this evidence, and contacted [[David Burnham]], a ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist, who was interested in her story. On November 13, 1974, Silkwood left a union meeting at the Hub cafe in Crescent. Another attendee of that meeting later testified that Silkwood had a binder and a packet of documents with her at the cafe. Silkwood got into her car and headed alone for Oklahoma City, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, to meet with Burnham, the ''New York Times'' reporter, and Steve Wodka, an official of her union's national office.{{r|Mazzocchi}} Later that evening, Silkwood's body was found in her car, which had run off the road and struck a [[culvert]] on the east side of [[State Highway 74 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 74]], 0.11 miles (180 m) south of the intersection with West Industrial Road (35.855233° N, 97.584963° W). The car contained none of the documents she held in the union meeting at the Hub cafe.    She was pronounced dead at the scene in what was believed to be an accident. The trooper at the scene remembers that he found one or two tablets of the [[sedative]] [[methaqualone]] ([[Quaalude]]) in the car, and he remembers finding [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. The police report indicated that she fell asleep at the wheel. The coroner found 0.35 milligrams of methaqualone per 100 milliliters of blood at the time of her death&amp;nbsp;— an amount almost twice the recommended dosage for inducing drowsiness.

Some journalists have theorized that Silkwood's car was rammed from behind by another vehicle, with the intent to cause an accident that would result in her death.{{r|Phillips}} Skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting that she was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from behind.{{r|Rashke|pp=99&amp;ndash;101, 114&amp;ndash;115}}

Investigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle that, according to Silkwood's friends and family, had not been present before the accident. As the crash was entirely a front-end collision, it did not explain the damage to the rear of her vehicle. A microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle. Silkwood's family claimed to know of no accidents of any kind that Silkwood had had with the car, and that the 1974 [[Honda Civic]] she was driving was new when purchased and no insurance claims were filed on that vehicle.{{r|Rashke|pp=114&amp;ndash;115}}

Silkwood's relatives, too, confirmed that she had taken the missing documents to the union meeting and placed them on the seat beside her. According to her family, she had received several threatening phone calls very shortly before her death. Speculation about foul play has never been substantiated.{{r|Rashke|p=99}}

According to the book ''Who Killed Karen Silkwood'', the assassination scene in the movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, is based on a theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According to the book, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.

Because of concerns about contamination, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the State Medical Examiner requested analysis of Silkwood's organs by the Los Alamos Tissue Analysis Program. Much of the radiation was in her lungs, suggesting that plutonium had been inhaled. When her tissues were further examined, the highest deposits were found in the contents of her gastrointestinal tract, demonstrating that she had ingested plutonium.{{r|LAS|p=254&amp;ndash;255}}

Public suspicions led to a federal investigation into plant security and safety. [[National Public Radio]] reported that this investigation had found that {{convert|20|to(-)|30|kg|lb}} of plutonium had been misplaced at the plant.

Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear-fuel plants in 1975. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) reported the Cimarron plant as decontaminated and decommissioned in 1994.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;

PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] produced the program, ''Nuclear Reaction,'' which included aspects of the Silkwood story. Its website for the program includes "The Karen Silkwood Story", as printed in 1995 in ''Los Alamos Science''. The PBS program covered the risks of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and raised questions about corporate accountability and responsibility.

Silkwood's father Bill and her children filed a lawsuit against Kerr-McGee for negligence on behalf of her estate. The trial was held in 1979 and lasted ten months, the longest up to that point in Oklahoma history. [[Gerry Spence]] was the chief attorney for the estate; other key attorneys were [[Daniel Sheehan (attorney)|Daniel Sheehan]], Arthur Angel, and James Ikard; William Paul was the chief attorney for Kerr-McGee. The estate presented evidence that the autopsy proved Silkwood was contaminated with plutonium at her death. To prove that the contamination was sustained at the plant, evidence was given by a series of witnesses who were former employees of the facility.

The defense relied on the expert witness Dr. George Voelz, a top-level scientist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Voelz said that he believed the contamination in Silkwood's body was within legal standards. The defense later proposed that Silkwood was a troublemaker, who might have poisoned herself. Following the summation arguments, Judge Frank Theis told the jury, "[I]f you find that the damage to the person or property of Karen Silkwood resulted from the operation of this plant ... defendant Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation is liable...."{{r|Justia|p=Instruction 7}}

The jury rendered its verdict of US $505,000 in damages and US $10,000,000 in [[punitive damages]]. On [[appeal]] in federal court, the judgment was reduced to US $5,000, the estimated value of Silkwood's losses in property at her rental house, and reversing the award of punitive damages. In 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] restored the original verdict, in ''Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.'' 464 US 238 (1984), ruling that "the NRC's exclusive authority to set safety standards did not foreclose the use of state tort remedies."{{r|FindLaw}} Although suggesting it would appeal on other grounds, Kerr-McGee settled out of court for US $1.38 million, admitting no liability.

== Representation in other media ==
According to [[Richard Rashke|Richard L. Rashke]]'s book, ''The Killing of Karen Silkwood'' (2000), officials investigating Silkwood's death and Kerr-McGee's operations received death threats. One of the investigators disappeared under mysterious circumstances. One of the witnesses "committed [[suicide]]" shortly before she was to testify against the Kerr-McGee Corporation about the alleged happenings at the plant.{{r|Rashke|p={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}} Rashke wrote that the Silkwood family's legal team were followed, threatened with violence, and physically assaulted.{{r|Rashke|p=xvii&amp;ndash;xviii}} Rashke suggested that the 20&amp;nbsp;kg (44&amp;nbsp;lbs) of plutonium missing from the plant had been stolen by "a secret underground plutonium-smuggling ring", in which many government agencies, including the highest levels of government and international intelligence agencies [[CIA]], [[MI5]], Israeli [[Mossad]], and a "shadowy group of [[Iran]]ians" were involved. The book says that the United States government covered up many details about Silkwood's death, and allegedly carried out her assassination.{{r|Rashke|p={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}}

The 1977 song "[[We Almost Lost Detroit (song)|We Almost Lost Detroit]]" by musician [[Gil Scott-Heron]] mentions Silkwood.
The 1984 song "Opus In Cm7" by [[Wendy O. Williams]] begins with a mention of Silkwood.

The [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Silkwood]]'' is an account of Silkwood's life and the events resulting from her activism, based on an original screenplay written by [[Nora Ephron]] and [[Alice Arlen]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played the title role and was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA. [[Cher]] played Karen's best friend, Dolly, and was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. [[Mike Nichols]] was nominated for Best Director. Ephron and Arlen were nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.

"'''Looking for Mr. Goodbart'''" is the twentieth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 28)|twenty-eighth season]] of the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 616th episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on April 30, 2017.

In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] accompanies elderly women in exchange for gifts, and befriends one woman who he realizes is suicidal. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] becomes addicted to the [[augmented reality]] game ''Peekimon Get'' (a parody of ''[[Pokémon Go]]'').

The episode was watched by 2 million viewers, making it the second-most viewed show on Fox that night. For her performance as Bart, [[Nancy Cartwright]] was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]].

==Plot==
The episode begins [[in medias res]], in which Bart Simpson appears to be mannerly. Bart breaks the fourth wall by asking the viewer whether he would like to know why Bart changed. Bart then flashes back to the start.

After [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] misbehaves, [[Principal Skinner]] is thinking of a punishment for Bart when his mother Agnes Skinner walks in and asks him to take her to the bus stop. He gets on the bus with her to the candy store. After learning that he can be given gifts for accompanying elderly women, he spends time with many others. One, Phoebe, catches on to what he is doing, but settles to give him money if he can pick her up four days in a row from  her nursing home. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] becomes addicted to the [[augmented reality]] game ''Peekimon Get'' (a parody of ''[[Pokémon Go]]''). He causes accidents and embarrassment while playing, but [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] believes that the game is helping him exercise, so she encourages him to play and accompanies him. When he discovers that he can buy in-game content with real money, Lisa begrudgingly agrees to it and Homer spends $600 of the family's savings. 

Bart arrives at the nursing home and takes Phoebe out in the woods to admire the nature together. After four days, she gives him the promised money, but he refuses it. Having acknowledged that he changed, Phoebe gives him her camera, saying that she has "bequeathed" it to him. After learning the meaning of the word, Bart realizes that Phoebe had been mentioning plans to commit suicide.  Bart turns to Homer and Lisa, who enlist other Peekimon Get players for help finding Phoebe in the woods. They find her alive and she thanks Bart for showing that she still has a lot to live for. 

Bart finishes his narration, having learned that it is wrong to play with women's hearts and take advantage of the elderly. It is revealed that he has been talking with [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]], who complains about how long the story has been. Marge discovers that Homer had spent their money, but once he assures her that the game will soon fade away, learns to be content with it. During the end credits, Homer and Lisa sing a parody of the original ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' anime theme tune.

==Reception==
[[File:Nancy_Cartwright_2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nancy Cartwright]] received an Emmy nomination for her voice performance as Bart]]
Dennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B, stating "'Looking For Mr. Goodbart’ isn’t boring. But it doesn’t quite land as hard as it appears it’s going to for a time. The script really does lay the foundation for it—Bart and Phoebe’s mutual admiration makes sense in context, and both actors find the emotional truth there. I like how Phoebe’s unimpressed reaction to Bart’s scam turns to genuine appreciation once she, among other things, sees Bart enjoying nature (in the form of a losing fight with a praying mantis). Walking off with Bart, she talks about them going ‘inside that Milhouse you love so much.’ (She thought it was a house, don’t be weird). Set straight, Saunders’ offhand ‘Oh well, there you go,’ once last time, hints at the rounded person who gave Bart’s little epiphany someone real to bounce off of.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins |first=Dennis |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/barts-just-gigolo-simpsons-hunts-some-heart-254538 |title="Looking For Mr. Goodbart" · The Simpsons · TV Review Bart’s just a gigolo as The Simpsons hunts for some heart · TV Club · The A.V. Club |publisher=Avclub.com |date=2017-04-30 |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tony Sokol of ''Den of Geek'' gave the episode 2/5 stars. He praised the premise and the performance of guest star [[Jennifer Saunders]] as Phoebe, but noted a lack of jokes and criticized an extended opening sequence as a way to fill time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Sokol |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-simpsons/264340/the-simpsons-season-28-episode-20-review-looking-for-mr-goodbart |title=The Simpsons Season 28 Episode 20 Review: Looking for Mr. Goodbart |publisher=Den of Geek|date=2017-04-30 |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Looking For Mr. Goodbart" scored a 1.0 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.30 million viewers, making it Fox's second highest rated show of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-april-30-2017/|title='Chicago Justice,' 'America's Funniest Home Videos' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|work=TV by the Numbers|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Russian cable channel [[2x2 (Russian TV channel)|2x2]] refused to air the episode due to a scene in which Homer plays ''Peekimon Get'' in church. The scene was similar to an ongoing incident in Russia, in which atheist blogger Ruslan Sokolovsky was on trial for blasphemy, having made a video of himself playing ''Pokémon Go'' at the [[Church of All Saints, Yekaterinburg]] and claiming that he could not find Jesus because Jesus did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinelli|first1=Marissa|title=The Simpsons’ Episode About Pokémon Go Will Not Air in Russia Due to Religious Controversy|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/05/russian_network_won_t_air_simpsons_pokemon_go_episode_after_orthodox_church.html|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=Slate|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] called this "worrying self-censorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian YouTuber convicted of blasphemy after playing Pokémon Go in a church|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/05/russian-youtuber-convicted-of-blasphemy-after-playing-pokemon-go-in-a-church/|accessdate=September 18, 2017|date=May 11, 2017|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4356">'''Mah-Adhur Gushnasp''' ({{lang-fa|ماه‌آذر گشنسپ}}), also known by the [[Arabicized]] form of '''Mahadharjushnas''', was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] nobleman who served as the ''[[Wuzurg framadar|wuzurg framadār]]'' ([[vizier]] or [[prime minister]]) of the [[Sasanian Empire]] during the reign of the child ruler [[Ardashir III]] (r. 628–629).

== Biography ==
[[Image:Court of Ardashir III.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Court of [[Ardashir III]].]]
Mah-Adhur was the son of a certain Jushnas (Gushnasp), and an unnamed [[House of Ispahbudhan|Ispahbudhan]] noblewoman, who was the sister of [[Vistahm]] and [[Vinduyih]]. Mah-Adhur Gushnasp had a brother named [[Narsi]], and was a cousin of [[Khosrow II]] (r. 591–628), whose mother was also a sibling of the two Ispahbudhan brothers.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=179}}

He is first mentioned during the accession of the eight-year old [[Ardashir III]] to the Sasanian throne in 6 September 628, where he was elected as ''wuzurg framadār'' of the young ruler. According to the medieval Persian historian [[al-Tabari]], Mah-Adhur greatly administered the empire; "Mahadharjushnas carried on the administration of the kingdom in [such] an excellent fashion, [and with such] firm conduct, [that] no one would have been aware of Ardashir III's youthfulness."{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=179}} However, this did not mean that the Sasanian Empire was peaceful and secure—in fact, "local chiefs and army leaders had gained too much power to obey the central government; imperial administration was disintegrating, and the [[Arabs]] and the [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Turks]] were attacking Iranian border regions" ([[Alireza Shapour Shahbazi|A. Shahbazi]]).{{sfn|Shahbazi|1986|pp=381-382}}

One year later, the former Sasanian military leader [[Shahrbaraz]], with a force of 6,000 men,{{sfn|Shahbazi|1986|pp=381-382}} marched towards [[Ctesiphon]] and besieged the city. He was, however, unable to capture the city, and therefor made an alliance with [[Piruz Khosrow]], the leader of the Parsig faction, and the previous ''wuzurg framadār'' of the empire during the reign of Ardashir's father, [[Kavadh II]] (r. 628). He also made an alliance with Namdar Jushnas, the ''[[spahbed]]'' ("army chief")  of [[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr#Kusts of Eranshahr|Nemroz]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=180}} Shahrbaraz, with the aid of these two powerful figures, [[Siege of Ctesiphon (629)|captured Ctesiphon]] and executed Ardashir III, along with Mah-Adhur himself, and other prominent nobles of the empire including a certain Ardabīl. 40 days later, Shahrbaraz was murdered by Mah-Adhur's paternal cousin [[Farrukh Hormizd]], who then made [[Boran]], the daughter of Khosrow II, the new ruler of the empire.

== Offspring ==
Mah-Adhur's two sons, [[Kavadh Gushnasp|Kavadh]] and [[Anoshagan]], later clashed with the Arabs twice in 633, first at the [[battle of Chains]], then finally at [[battle of River]] (also known as battle of Al Madhar), where they were killed by the troops of the Arab general [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=193-194}}

'''Matilda Charlotte Chaplin Ayrton''' ({{circa|1846}} – 19 July 1883) was an English [[physician]]. She studied medicine in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Paris]], pursuing higher studies at the latter's universities, and is one of the [[Edinburgh Seven]], the first seven matriculated undergraduate female students at a British university.  She travelled to Japan, where she opened a school for [[midwives]], and was an author of [[anthropological]] studies.

==Early life and family==
Matilda Chaplin was born at [[Honfleur]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;''1871 Scotland Census''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Englishwoman's Review of Social and Industrial Questions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7sRAAAAYAAJ|year=1883|publisher=Englishwoman's Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of English parents John Clarke Chaplin, a solicitor from [[Watlington, Norfolk]], and Matilda Adriana Ayrton from [[Chelsea, London]].&lt;ref&gt;''London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; 1861 England Census&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in [[Edgbaston]], where several of her elder siblings were born, and returned to England shortly after her birth. She was baptised at [[St George's Church, Edgbaston]] in December 1846 before the family moved to [[Kensington]].&lt;ref&gt;''1851 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1861 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education and career==
After beginning her studies in art she commenced the study of medicine in 1867, and continued to do so until her death. She spent two years at the [[Ladies' Medical College]], and having passed the preliminary examination at [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries' Hall]] in 1869, she presented herself for the later examination, but was refused admission on the ground of her gender.

Recognised as one of the heroic 'seven against Edinburgh' women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=Joan|title=Hertha Ayrton (1854-1923) and the Admission of Women to the Royal Society of London|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|date=Jul 1991|volume=45|issue=2|page=201|jstor=531699|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1991.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the [[Edinburgh Seven]], she eventually matriculated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], but was barred from instruction in higher branches of medicine. Legal intervention allowed her to gain high honours in anatomy and surgery at the extramural examinations held in 1870 and 1871 at [[Surgeons' Hall]], Edinburgh, before a judgment in 1872 finally prohibited women students.

In 1871, when she found the chief medical classes in [[England]] and [[Scotland]] closed to her, she resolved to complete her education at Paris, where every facility was afforded her. The [[University of Paris]] recognised her abilities by bestowing upon her the degrees of Bachelier ès-Sciences and Bachelier ès-Lettres. During her studies Chaplin maintained connection with Edinburgh, attending some of the classes open to her there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1872, she married her cousin, the noted scientist [[William Edward Ayrton]],&lt;ref name="Nyenhuis2003" /&gt; an Edinburgh student, and a distinguished pupil of [[Sir William Thomson]]. Early in the following year she obtained a certificate in [[midwifery]] from the [[London Obstetric Society]], the only medical qualification then obtainable by women in England, and shortly afterwards accompanied her husband to Japan, where he had been appointed to a professorship in the [[Imperial College of Engineering]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="Rochelson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meri-Jane Rochelson|title=A Jew in the Public Arena: The Career of Israel Zangwill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfPdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=19 February 2010|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-4083-7|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Japan, she pursued [[anthropological]] researches, and opened a school for Japanese midwives, in which she lectured herself, with the aid of an interpreter. In 1877 symptoms of [[tuberculosis]] made themselves apparent, forcing her return to Europe. In 1879, she took the degree of M.D. at Paris, and presented as her thesis the result of her Japanese studies, which was printed under the title of ''Recherches surles dimensions générales et sur le développement du corps chez les Japonais'' (Paris, 1879).&lt;ref name="Sparks2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Tabitha Sparks|title=The Doctor in the Victorian Novel: Family Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HomgUfmIlIC&amp;pg=PA134|date=28 April 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-7540-8|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She became a licentiate of the [[King and Queen's College of Physicians]] in [[Ireland]], and, although the only female candidate, came out first in the examination. In 1880 she lived in London, chiefly studying diseases of the eye at the [[Royal Free Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Englishwoman's Review of Social and Industrial Questions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92Q7AQAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Garland Publishing|isbn=978-0-8240-3740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But her health was rapidly breaking down, and she was compelled for the next two years to winter abroad, but at the hospital of [[Algiers]] during one winter, and in the physiological laboratory at [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]] during another, she continued her studies. Mrs. Ayrton died in London on 19 July 1883, aged 37.

==Legacy==
The Dictionary of National Biography records: "From the time of her journey to Japan Mrs. Ayrton contributed to ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and other periodicals a large number of articles on very various topics, including Japanese politics and customs, and the educational problems of the West."&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

She took a keen interest in the Japanese people and never wearied of studying them and their beautiful country. She became more and more interested in the home life of the Japanese and in the pictures and stories which delighted the children of the Mikado's Empire. After her return to England she wrote a book entitled ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28979 Child Life in Japan]'' which was illustrated from her own sketches.

Ayrton always took a lively interest in attempts to improve the educational opportunities and social position of women. She actively aided the establishment of a club for women students in Paris, and helped to organise the [[Mary Somerville|Somerville Club]] for women in London.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Ayrton, Matilda Chaplin|last=Lee|first=Sidney|authorlink=Sidney Lee|volume=02}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

In 2007, he became head coach at Robert Morris University, and in 2010 he became head coach of Rutgers University.

==Rutgers University suspension and firing==
On December 13, 2012, Rice was suspended three games without pay and fined $50,000 for abusive behavior toward his players. The suspension came after athletic director [[Tim Pernetti]] obtained video footage from a practice during either Rice's first or second season at Rutgers, at which Rice was seen throwing basketballs at players' heads and cursing at them. Assistant coach David Cox led the team during Rice's suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/index.ssf/2012/12/mike_rice_suspended_by_rutgers.html|title=Rutgers suspended Mike Rice because school found coach threw basketballs at players' heads|last=Prunty|first=Brendan|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the suspension, Rice was not only banned from any contact with his players or going on recruiting visits, but was banned from coming onto campus altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy Katz|title=Mike Rice speaks out after suspension, fine|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/8790174/rutgers-scarlet-knights-coach-mike-rice-vows-get-better-suspension-college-basketball|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pernetti characterized the suspension as "a complete removal from the program," but stated that Rice would return to Rutgers for the 2013-14 season pending a review of his behavior.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8744573/mike-rice-coach-rutgers-scarlet-knights-suspended-three-games-fined Mike Rice suspended, fined $50K]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed dramatically on April 2, 2013, when [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' aired several hours of video from Rice's practices. According to ESPN, the video, provided to Pernetti by then-assistant coach [[Eric Murdock]], showed Rice berating, pushing, kicking, cursing, using [[homophobia|homophobic]] slurs, and throwing basketballs at players during practices.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/03/rutgers-fire-basketball-coach-mike-rice Rutgers' firing of coach Mike Rice exposes a toxic locker-room culture], 3 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock said that he first told Pernetti about the abuse in the summer of 2012, but Pernetti took no action until he and other Rutgers officials saw the video in December. Murdock claims he was fired in July for reporting the abuse, and sued Rutgers for wrongful termination.&lt;ref&gt;via [[ESPN]]. [http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9125796/practice-video-shows-rutgers-basketball-coach-mike-rice-berated-pushed-used-slurs-players "Rutgers' Rice Berates Players at Practice"], April 2, 2013. Accessed April 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; An independent investigation found that there was insufficient evidence to support Murdock's claims that Rice created a hostile work environment. It also found the video was not in context, since it depicted practices from Rice's first year at Rutgers. However, it did find that Rice's actions brought "shame and disgrace" to Rutgers–on paper, grounds to fire Rice for cause regardless of the merits of Murdock's claims.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/sports/ncaabasketball/rutgers-officials-long-knew-of-coach-mike-rices-actions.html|title=Rutgers Officials Long Knew of Coach’s Actions|author1=Steve Eder|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernetti later said that his gut feeling had been to fire Rice on the spot, but ultimately concluded that Rutgers policy would not justify a firing.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The video touched off a nationwide outcry, with [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Chris Christie]] condemning Rice's behavior, and [[New Jersey General Assembly|State Assembly]] Speaker [[Sheila Oliver]] among many demanding that Rice be fired.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN. [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9128825/rutgers-scarlet-knights-fire-coach-mike-rice-wake-video-scandal Rutgers fires coach Mike Rice]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Rutgers fired Rice as head coach.&lt;ref name="ricefired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041#.UVw93KLqk84 |title=Mike Rice Relieved of Duties at Rutgers University |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406045910/http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041 |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Star-Ledger|The (Newark) Star-Ledger]]'', the move came after school president [[Robert L. Barchi|Robert Barchi]] saw the video for the first time, although he had signed off on Pernetti's decision to suspend Rice in December. When Barchi saw the video, he called in Pernetti and told him that Rice had to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/mike_rice_fired_rutgers_univer.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Barchi held Pernetti responsible for the debacle, and forced Pernetti's resignation two days later.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409095655/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sullivan_For_days_Rutgers_athletic_director_knew_he_would_have_to_go.html|title=For days, Rutgers athletic director knew he would have to go|author1=Tara Sullivan|publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-mortem of the circumstances leading to Rice's firing, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Rutgers officials were so focused on whether Rice created a hostile work environment for his assistants that they ignored "the larger question" of whether Rice's behavior toward his players in and of itself demanded his firing.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''Miklós''' "'''Miki'''" '''Fehér''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈmikloːʃ ˈfɛheːr}}; 20 July 1979 – 25 January 2004) was a Hungarian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].

He spent most of his nine-year career in Portugal, representing four clubs and amassing [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 80 games and 27 goals. On 25 January 2004, he died of a [[cardiac arrest]] during a match between [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]] and his team [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in [[Guimarães]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/26/newsstory.sport4 Benfica's Miklós Fehér dies after heart attack on pitch]; [[The Guardian]], 26 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/226/508/0/|title=Miklos Feher: Football remembers|publisher=FIFA|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fehér represented [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at international level, making his debut in 1998 at the age of 19.

==Club career==
Born in [[Tatabánya]], Fehér started his playing career at [[Győri ETO FC]], where he was spotted by [[FC Porto]] scouts. He was signed in 1998 but never really made a breakthrough onto the first team, being loaned to gain experience from ages 20–21 to another two northern sides, [[S.C. Salgueiros]] and [[S.C. Braga]].

At Braga Fehér had his best professional season, scoring 14 [[Primeira Liga]] goals in 26 games in [[2000–01 Primeira Liga|2000–01]]. After Porto [[chairman]] [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa]] quarrelled with his agent José Veiga, the player refused to part with the latter and left, joining [[Lisbon]] side [[S.L. Benfica]] and going on to net eight official goals during two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/futebol-nacional/interior/benfica-pagou-ao-fc-porto-por-feher-12-anos-depois-3714687.html|title=Benfica pagou ao FC Porto por Fehér 12 anos depois|trans-title=Benfica paid FC Porto for Fehér 12 years later|publisher=[[Diário de Notícias]]|last=Ruela|first=João|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Miklos Feher memorial.jpg|thumb|Fehér memorial at the [[Estádio da Luz]]]]
On 25 January 2004, Fehér was in [[Guimarães]] with Benfica to play against [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]]. The game was being broadcast live on television, and Benfica were leading 1–0. Fehér had just come on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] and [[Assist (football)|assisted]] another player just off the bench, [[Fernando Aguiar]], for the match's only goal, but received a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] in [[Association football#Duration and tie-breaking methods|injury time]] and suddenly bent forward, seemingly in pain; he then fell backwards to the ground.

Members of both teams rushed immediately to aid Fehér before medical personnel arrived on the pitch. [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was performed, an ambulance arrived on the pitch and he was rushed to the hospital. His condition was covered by the Portuguese media throughout the day and, before midnight, his death was confirmed, the cause of death being [[cardiac arrhythmia]] brought on by [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=140036.html Fehér death stuns football]; UEFA, 26 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In his memory Benfica retired the number 29 shirt, which he wore during his time at the club;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slbenfica.pt/noticias/detalhedenoticia/tabid/2788/ArticleId/40331/language/pt-PT/Miklos-Feher-partiu-ha-11-anos.aspx|title=Miklos Fehér partiu há 11 anos|trans-title=Miklos Fehér departed 11 years ago|publisher=S.L.

Among others, Porto [[director of football]] Reinaldo Teles and manager [[José Mourinho]] paid their respects at the [[Estádio da Luz]], where the player's body remained before his [[burial]] in his native Hungary.

Benfica's delegation, which included president [[Luís Filipe Vieira]], coach [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] and the entire first-team squad, travelled to Hungary, presenting Fehér's parents with the [[2004–05 Primeira Liga|2004–05 league championship]] medal, in respect for the player and his time with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=306009.html|title=Benfica trip a tribute to Fehér|publisher=UEFA|date=31 May 2005|access-date=4 November 2016|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516205018/http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind%3D2/newsid%3D306009.html|archive-date=16 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2009, the day before their [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Lisbon]], the [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian national team]] squad laid a wreath next to a metal bust of him at Benfica's homeground, in tribute to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news;_ylt=AmTTHD81_k4YRo_.tGQqAPQXwLYF?slug=reu-worldhungaryfeher&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns Hungary squad honours late striker Feher]; [[Reuters]], 9 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Fehér earned his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 10 October 1998, in a [[UEFA Euro 2000]] [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|qualifying match]] against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]]. He came on as a sixth-minute substitute for [[Ferenc Horváth]] at the [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium]] in [[Baku]], and scored the final goal of the 4–0 win.

On 11 October 2000, Fehér netted a [[hat-trick]] in a 6–1 away rout of [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=51962 «Minhoto» Fehér marca três pela Hungria em goleada na Lituânia («Minho»'s Fehér scores three for Hungary in rout in Lithuania)]; [[Record (newspaper)|Record]], 12 October 2000 (Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; In total, he scored seven goals in 25 appearances.

{{unreferenced|date=April 2009}}
The '''mri''' are a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] species in the [[Faded Sun Trilogy]] of [[C. J. Cherryh]]'s [[Alliance-Union universe]]. Their culture appears to be drawn upon those of the [[Apache]], [[Berber people|Berbers]] (especially [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]]), and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[samurai]]. Their name means simply "the people," and they refer to all other races as "tsi-mri," which literally means ''not people''.

==Physical appearance==
The mri are a tall and slender [[humanoid]] species. Their skin is golden in color and their hair is coarse and golden-brown, generally worn shoulder-length. Their eyes are yellow, with [[epicanthic fold]]s and a functional [[nictitating membrane]] to protect them against wind-blown grit. Their ears are slightly pointed, with a tuft of hair at the tip resembling that of a [[lynx]].

==Social structure==
The mri are divided into a rigid structure of three castes: ''kel'', ''sen'', and ''kath''. These are functional rather than hereditary castes, but each has a clearly defined role in their society, and the mri regard any change in those traditional functions as completely unacceptable.
* ''Kel'' are warriors, and dress in black. Because they interact with outsiders, they veil their faces to preserve the privacy of the People. Furthermore, they are forbidden to read or write, lest they inadvertently betray the ancient secrets of the People. They are masters of both the traditional edged weapons of the People and the modern weapons they use as mercenaries. They play ''shon’ai'', the traditional passing game of the People, with knives.
* ''Sen'' are scholars, and dress in gold, except for the ''she’pan'' or matriarch of the tribe, who dresses in white. They keep the sacred writings of their people, and are [[celibate]]. Because they do not interact with outsiders, they do not veil their faces. They play ''shon’ai'' with wands.
* ''Kath'' are the children and those women who do not join either the ''kel'' or the ''sen'', and dress in blue. No man past puberty may remain in ''kath'', and those unsuited for ''kel'' or ''sen'' die. The ''kath'' are the lowest caste of the mri, responsible for the upkeep of the tribe's dwellings. Kath play ''shon’ai'' with a pair of rounded stones.

==Language==
The language of the mri appears to be [[agglutinative]], with each element having a single function. The apostrophes that give mri words their distinctive appearance appear to represent a [[glottal stop]] when separating two vowels, for instance, in ''kel’e’en'', "a woman of the kel". However, in other words they seem to merely mark the boundaries between [[morpheme]]s. There are a few words in which the function of the apostrophe is unclear, and it has been suggested that those are purely decorative, to make the words look more alien.

A careful reader can assemble a fairly large vocabulary of nouns, and even conjecture additional forms. However, there is little in the way of verbs or grammatical structure, so the novels cannot be used as the basis of a working language, as opposed to the elvish languages of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
The mri originated on the world of Kutath, an ancient world which they shared with four other races. As resources grew scarcer, a portion of them left Kutath in slowships, seeking other worlds. They would hire on as mercenaries with a race, but each time the relationship ended badly, and they left a ruined world behind to seek a new start. During each journey, or Dark, everything but the ancient traditions of the mri were forgotten by kel and kath, with only the sen retaining records of the Between they had left between. A hint of this process remained in the ''Shon’jir'' or passing song which was sung at births and deaths, but most kel of the Between thought of it only as referring to the individual.

After more than eighty such migrations, the mri settled on Kesrith, a desert planet not dissimilar to their lost home. There they encountered the [[dus]]ei, bearlike telepaths who had intelligence but not the capacity for speech. The dusei established bonds with warriors of the kel, but were said to find the minds of sen too cold for their tastes. Thus the mri were found by the [[regul]], a race of traders from Nurag, a planet of the Mab system. Various regul clans or ''docha'' hired mri as bodyguards, giving the mri the opportunity to hone their skills against one another.

The situation changed when the regul encountered humans and war broke out. Atrocities occurred on both sides, at least in part due to the inability of the regul to imagine the future. After forty years of war, the mri were nearly exterminated. The regul negotiated a peace which involved handing Kesrith over to humanity, then betrayed the mri to prevent the mercenaries from switching sides. All the mri save two were murdered.

After the human protagonist, Sten Duncan, was adopted by the mri, the human command decided to risk an experiment. Using an ancient sacred navigation record, they put Duncan and the two surviving mri, Niun and Melein, aboard a ship and sent them back to the lost homeworld of the mri. On the way, Niun forced Duncan to learn to become a mri, with death the penalty for failure.

As a result, they were reunited with the mri of Kutath, and Melein took command of one tribe. Humans and regul had followed them on their journey, and the regul were ready to commit genocide again to ensure that the mri did not hire on with the humans. However, their murderous plans were foiled, and humans ultimately established an understanding with the mri when a human scholar learned to play ''shon’ai''.

'''Taylor Marie Behl''' ({{IPAc-en|b|iː|l}}; October 13, 1987 – September 6, 2005) was a 17-year-old college freshman from [[Vienna, Virginia]]. She moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]], in August 2005 to attend [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. About two weeks later on [[Labor Day]], September 5, 2005, Behl disappeared. Acting on a tip one month later, VCU police located her remains at a rural area in [[Mathews County, Virginia]]. Behl's disappearance and death were the subject of a major police investigation and became an [[Internet]] [[cause célèbre]]. ''Love You More:  The Taylor Behl Story'', a book written by her mother, was released on November 7, 2006.{{ref|1}}{{ref|2}}{{ref|3}}

==Case==
In the early morning hours of Saturday, September 17, 2005, Behl's car was found in a residential neighborhood about a mile and a half from the VCU Campus. A K-9 unit police were using on the car led them to Jesse Schultz, 22, who lived in the area where Behl's car was found. Police reported that Schultz failed questions on a lie detector test when he claimed not to know and not to have been in Behl's car, and was arrested on cocaine possession charges.

Numerous search warrants were executed, including Behl's mother's home in Vienna, Virginia, and Behl's VCU Gladding Residence Center dorm room. Those questioned by police at this phase of the investigation included "Jake," a VCU student and former boyfriend of Behl with whom she had dinner after she returned to Richmond on September 5, and another unnamed friend of Schultz and Behl, whose car was impounded for forensic tests because police believed that Behl might have been in his car before her disappearance. The ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' reported that this "friend in common" refused a polygraph test.

Another of the last individuals to have seen Behl alive was Benjamin Fawley, a 38-year-old amateur photographer and self-described "Goth/skater from the 1980s."  Investigators focused on Fawley as they began to uncover his and Behl's relationship. Fawley's attorney, Chris Collins, confirmed that Fawley "is a suspect and should be a suspect because he knew her." Police began to become more suspicious when Fawley's alibi did not hold up, and executed a [[search warrant]] issued by Richmond Circuit Court Judge Beverly W. Snukals on Fawley for offenses "substantially described as...taking indecent liberties with children attempted" and "contributing to the delinquency of a minor."  Police were looking for, among other things, "women's clothing," Behl's Nokia camera phone, "Taylor Behl's key ring," her money, and "burglary tools." As a result of the search, Fawley was arrested that day, Friday, September 23, 2005, and charged with 16 counts of [[child pornography]].

On Wednesday, October 12, 2005, Fawley, against his attorney's advice, spoke to police investigators. Fawley reportedly admitted to being with Behl the night of September 5 and into the early morning hours of September 6, 2005. He allegedly said that Behl died accidentally during a consensual sex act (likely [[erotic asphyxiation]]) with him in her car at [[Mathews County, Virginia]]. He claimed he then panicked and dumped her unburied body in a shallow ravine.

A surveillance video showed Behl and Fawley entering the VCU Gladding Residence Center together at 10:18 p.m. and Fawley waiting for Behl in the dorm's lobby while she went to her dorm room. The video's final frames show Behl and Fawley leaving the dorm together.{{ref|6}}

Behl's mother Janet Pelasara called Fawley "a big, fat liar" and claimed that Behl had sex "once out of curiosity" with Fawley in April 2005, "and then didn't want anything to do with him."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/15/AR2005101501066.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, October 17, 2005, Richmond [[Circuit Court]] Chief Judge, Margaret Spencer, issued a [[gag order]], prohibiting witnesses who appear before the court from publicly discussing their testimony, effectively quashing any witness accounts becoming public until Fawley's trial.

Since then, court records have shown that on Tuesday, January 17, 2006, Mathews County, Virginia indicted Fawley for Behl's murder. The indictment accuses him of killing Behl "willfully, deliberately and with premeditation" while attempting to abduct and rape her.{{ref|4}}

On Monday, February 13, 2006, the indictment was amended, barring immediate accusations of rape and abduction. The reworded first-degree murder charge now accuses that Fawley "did feloniously kill and murder Taylor Marie Behl."{{ref|5}}

On Wednesday, August 9, 2006, Circuit Court Judge William H. Shaw, III accepted Fawley's guilty plea to second degree murder and sentenced him to thirty years in prison. Fawley had entered an [[Alford plea]].{{ref|8}}

==Use of internet==
In September 2007, Chuck Cohen, a first sergeant with the [[Indiana State Police]], told a class of 21 law enforcement agencies studying "how criminals often leave an online trail at social networking sites such as [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]]" that the Taylor Behl case marked one of the first times that police narrowed down their suspect pool using a MySpace friends list. Cohen said that Fawley's [[Internet footprint]] eventually led police to Behl's body.{{ref|7}}

'''Neuroevolution''', or '''neuro-evolution''', is a form of  [[artificial intelligence]] that uses [[evolutionary algorithm]]s to generate [[artificial neural network]]s (ANN), parameters, topology and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/neuroevolution-a-different-kind-of-deep-learning|title=Neuroevolution: A different kind of deep learning|last=Stanley|first=Kenneth O.|date=2017-07-13|work=O'Reilly Media|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly applied in [[artificial life]], [[general game playing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Risi |first1=Sebastian|last2=Togelius|first2=Julian |title= Neuroevolution in Games: State of the Art and Open Challenges |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games |year= 2017 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.7326v3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary robotics]]. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than [[supervised learning|supervised learning algorithms]], which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a network's performance at a task. For example, the outcome of a game (i.e. whether one player won or lost) can be easily measured without providing labeled examples of desired strategies. Neuroevolution can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use [[gradient descent]] on a neural network with a fixed topology.

==Features==

Many neuroevolution algorithms have been defined. One common distinction is between algorithms that evolve only the strength of the connection weights for a fixed network topology (sometimes called conventional neuroevolution), as opposed to those that evolve both the topology of the network and its weights (called TWEANNs, for Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network algorithms).

A separate distinction can be made between methods that evolve the structure of ANNs in parallel to its parameters (those applying standard evolutionary algorithms) and those that develop them separately (through [[memetic algorithm]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1= Togelius |first1=Julian |last2=Schaul |first2=Tom |last3=Schmidhuber |first3=Jurgen |last4= Gomez |first4=Faustino |contribution=Countering poisonous inputs with memetic neuroevolution |title=Parallel Problem Solving from Nature |year=2008 |contribution-url=https://www.academia.edu/download/30945872/poison.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with gradient descent==
Most neural networks use gradient descent rather than neuroevolution. However, around 2017 researchers at [[Uber]] stated they had found that simple structural neuroevolution algorithms were competitive with sophisticated modern industry-standard gradient-descent deep learning algorithms, in part because neuroevolution was found to be less likely to get stuck in local minima. In ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'',
journalist Matthew Hutson speculated that part of the reason neuroevolution is succeeding where it had failed before is due to the increased computational power available in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence can ‘evolve’ to solve problems|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/artificial-intelligence-can-evolve-solve-problems|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct and indirect encoding==

Evolutionary algorithms operate on a population of [[genotype]]s (also referred to as [[genome]]s). In neuroevolution, a genotype is mapped to a neural network [[phenotype]] that is evaluated on some task to derive its [[fitness function|fitness]].

In ''direct'' encoding schemes the genotype directly maps to the phenotype. That is, every neuron and connection in the neural network is specified directly and explicitly in the genotype. In contrast, in ''indirect'' encoding schemes the genotype specifies indirectly how that network should be generated.&lt;ref name="cgegecco"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Kassahun|first1=Yohannes|last2=Sommer|first2=Gerald|last3=Edgington|first3=Mark|last4=Metzen|first4=Jan Hendrik|last5=Kirchner|first5=Frank|date=2007|contribution=Common genetic encoding for both direct and indirect encodings of networks|contribution-url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.159.705|title=Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference |publisher=ACM Press|pages=1029–1036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect encodings are often used to achieve several aims:&lt;ref name="cgegecco"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hyperneat&gt;{{citation|last=Gauci |first= Stanley |contribution=Generating Large-Scale Neural Networks Through Discovering Geometric Regularities |title=Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference|year=2007 |location=New York, NY |publisher=ACM |contribution-url=http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/gauci_gecco07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gruau94&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.29.5939|title=Neural Network Synthesis Using Cellular Encoding And The Genetic Algorithm.|last=Gruau|first=Frédéric|last2=I|first2=L'universite Claude Bernard-lyon|last3=Doctorat|first3=Of A.

* compression of phenotype to a smaller genotype, providing a smaller search space;
* mapping the search space (genome) to the problem domain.

===Taxonomy of embryogenic systems for indirect encoding===

Traditionally indirect encodings that employ artificial [[embryology|embryogeny]] (also known as [[artificial development]]) have been categorised along the lines of a ''grammatical approach'' versus a ''cell chemistry approach''.&lt;ref name=taxae &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley |first1=Kenneth O. |last2=Miikkulainen |first2=Risto |title=A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny |journal=The MIT Press Journals |year=2003 |url=http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.alife03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former evolves sets of rules in the form of grammatical rewrite systems. The latter attempts to mimic how physical structures emerge in biology through gene expression. Indirect encoding systems often use aspects of both approaches.

Stanley and Miikkulainen&lt;ref name=taxae /&gt; propose a taxonomy for embryogenic systems that is intended to reflect their underlying properties. The taxonomy identifies five continuous dimensions, along which any embryogenic system can be placed:
* Cell (neuron) fate''':''' the final characteristics and role of the cell in the mature phenotype. This dimension counts the number of methods used for determining the fate of a cell.
* Targeting''':''' the method by which connections are directed from source cells to target cells. This ranges from specific targeting (source and target are explicitly identified) to relative targeting (e.g. based on locations of cells relative to each other).
* Heterochrony''':''' the timing and ordering of events during embryogeny. Counts the number of mechanisms for changing the timing of events.
* Canalization''':''' how tolerant the genome is to mutations (brittleness). Ranges from requiring precise genotypic instructions to a high tolerance of imprecise mutation.
* Complexification''':''' the ability of the system (including evolutionary algorithm and genotype to phenotype mapping) to allow complexification of the genome (and hence phenotype) over time. Ranges from allowing only fixed-size genomes to allowing highly variable length genomes.

'''Nikolaus Lenau''' was the [[nom de plume]] of '''Nikolaus Franz Niembsch Edler von Strehlenau''' (13 August 1802 – 22 August 1850), a German-language [[Austria]]n poet.

==Biography==
He was born at Schadat, now [[Lenauheim]], [[Banat]], then in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], now [[Romania]]. His father, a Habsburg government official, died in 1807 in [[Budapest]], leaving his children in the care of their mother, who remarried in 1811. In 1819 Nikolaus went to the [[University of Vienna]]; he subsequently studied Hungarian law at Pozsony ([[Bratislava]]) and then spent the next four years qualifying himself in medicine. Unable to settle down to any profession, he began writing verse. The disposition to sentimental melancholy inherited from his mother, stimulated by disappointments in love and by the prevailing fashion of the [[romanticism|romantic]] school of poetry, descended into gloom after his mother's death in 1829.

Soon afterwards, however, a legacy from his grandmother enabled him to devote himself wholly to poetry. His first published poems appeared in 1827, in [[Johann Gabriel Seidl]]'s ''Aurora''. In 1831 he moved to [[Stuttgart]], where he published a volume of ''Gedichte'' (1832) dedicated to the Swabian poet, [[Gustav Schwab]]. He also made the acquaintance of [[Ludwig Uhland]], [[Justinus Kerner]], [[Karl Mayer (poet)|Karl Mayer]] and others. His restless spirit longed for change, and he determined to seek peace and freedom in America.

In October 1832 he landed at [[Baltimore]] and settled on a homestead in [[Ohio]]. He also lived six months in [[New Harmony, Indiana]], with a group called the [[Harmony Society]]. Life in the primeval forest fell lamentably short of the ideal he had pictured. He disliked Americans with their eternal English lisping of dollars (''englisches Talergelispel''), and in 1833 returned to Germany. The appreciation of his first volume of poems revived his spirits.

From then on he lived partly in Stuttgart and partly in [[Vienna]]. In 1836 his ''[[Faust]]'' appeared, in which he laid bare his own soul to the world;&lt;ref name="Doctor Faustus of the popular legend, Marlowe the Puppet-Play, Goethe, and Lenau, treated historically and critically."&gt;{{cite book |last=Pagel|first=Louis|title=Doctor Faustus of the popular legend Marlowe, the Puppet-Play, Goethe, and Lenau, treated historically and critically.|pages=46 |authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1837, ''Savonarola'', an epic in which freedom from political and intellectual tyranny as an essential component of Christianity was stated. In 1838 his ''Neuere Gedichte'' proved that ''Savonarola'' had been the result of a passing exaltation. Of these new poems, some of the finest were inspired by his hopeless passion for Sophie von Löwenthal, the wife of a friend. In 1842 appeared ''Die Albigenser'', and in 1844 he began writing his ''[[Don Juan]]'', a fragment of which was published after his death.

Soon afterwards he developed signs of mental ill-health. In October 1844, he jumped from a window one morning and ran down a street shouting "Revolt! Freedom! Help! Fire!".&lt;ref name="Lenau"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janů|first=Jaroslav|title=Lenau|pages=116 |authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed in an asylum, under restraint, for the remainder of his life. He died in the asylum at Oberdöbling near Vienna and was buried in the cemetery of Weidling, near [[Klosterneuburg]]. On his grave is the replica of an open book with an extract from one of his poems (''An Frau Kleyle'') inscribed on the left-hand page, while on the right-hand page there is the final stanza from his poem ''Vergangenheit''. The city of [[Stockerau]] in Lower Austria has proclaimed itself "Lenau City", because Nikolaus Lenau went on extensive walks in the alluvial forests next to Stockerau and the [[Danube]] and was inspired to write one of his most famous lyric poems, "Schilflieder", during this time. He has various streets and squares in Vienna and the surrounding area named after him.

Lenau's fame rests mainly upon his shorter poems; even his [[Epic poetry|epic]]s are essentially lyric in quality. His excellent poem, "Herbst", expresses the sadness and melancholy he felt after his sojourn in the United States and his strenuous travels across the Atlantic to return to Europe.  In it, he mourns the loss of youth, the passing of time and his own sense of futility.  The poem is archetypal of Lenau's style and culminates with the speaker dreaming of death as a final escape from emptiness.  He is the greatest modern lyric poet of Austria, and the typical representative in German literature of that pessimistic ''[[Weltschmerz]]'' which, beginning with [[Lord Byron]], reached its culmination in the poetry of [[Giacomo Leopardi]].

Lenau's ''Sämtliche Werke'' were first published in 4 vols. by [[Anastasius Grün]] in 1855, 
but there are several more modern editions, as those by [[Max Koch (academic)|Max Koch]] in [[Joseph Kürschner]]'s ''Deutsche Nationalliteratur'' of 1888 (vols. 154 and 155), and E. Castle (2 vols., 1900).

'''Olivier Chandon''' (17 September 1955 – 2 March 1983), also called '''Olivier Chandon de Brailles''', '''Oliver Chandon de Briailles''', and '''Olivier Chandon Debrailles''', was a French race car driver, heir to the [[Moët et Chandon]] champagne, and one-time boyfriend of the American model [[Christie Brinkley]].&lt;ref name="motosport"&gt;[http://motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php??db=ct&amp;n=1966 Motorsport Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130125224558/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Christie_Brinkley/1195890%23fullBio Christie Brinkley biography at ''www.hollywood.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Olivier Chandon de Brailles was the only son of Frederic Chandon de Brailles, chairman of the Moët-Hennessy group and heir to the Moët &amp; Chandon champagne fortune.&lt;ref name="motosport"/&gt;

Chandon spoke five languages, was a race car driver and skydiver.

A graduate of [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]] in Switzerland, he served in the [[French Air Force]] and later moved to New York City. There he attended [[New York University]] to study marketing and worked in the sales department of United Technologies. Earlier, he began racing cars in Europe at age 18, whereby he assumed the shortened name of Olivier Chandon. He later resumed his race car career in the United States.&lt;ref name="motosport"/&gt;

On 2 March 1983, Chandon, a member of the ''New York-based Fred Opert Racing Team'', was killed while driving a [[Ralt]] [[Formula Atlantic]] race car in a private practice session at [[Moroso Motorsport Park]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], while preparing for the upcoming Formula Atlantic season. Travelling over 100 miles per hour, Chandon's vehicle crashed through a barrier, fell into a canal and landed upside down, where he was pinned in his car at the feet and drowned in an otherwise survivable accident. The cause of the accident could not be determined: either the throttle stuck or driver error.&lt;ref name="motosport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2DF1739F937A35750C0A965948260|title=Racer Drowned After Car Crashed|date=March 4, 1983|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandon had a romantic relationship with model [[Christie Brinkley]]. The two first met at [[Studio 54]] where she was holding a party to promote Brinkley‘s 1982 calendar and then they became an "item" for the gossip magazines. Chandon had phoned her less than an hour before the accident to arrange to meet her in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] that evening. When told of the accident, a distraught Brinkley stayed in California.&lt;ref name="motosport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/112_0707_postcards_from_detroit/photo_07.html  Chandon and Brinkley online photo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivier Chandon is buried in the [[Laferté-sur-Aube]] cemetery, in [[Haute-Marne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=Patricia|author2=HP-TIME.com|date=March 14, 1983|title=Rootless Cosmopolitan of the Age|journal=[[Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951992-3,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the experience of seeing firsthand the reality of the Earth in space, which is immediately understood to be a tiny, fragile ball of life, "hanging in the void", shielded and nourished by a paper-thin atmosphere.

'''Pharmacia''' was a [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] company in [[Sweden]] that merged with the [[United States|American]] pharmaceutical company [[Upjohn]] in 1995.

==History ==
Pharmacia company was founded in 1911 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden by pharmacist Gustav Felix Grönfeldt at the ''Elgen'' Pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foretagsamheten.se/Foretag/Foretag/Pharmacia/ Företagsamheten.se: Pharmacia]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed on June 17, 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elgen'' is old Swedish spelling for ''Älgen'', which means "The [[Moose]]". Traditionally, almost all Swedish pharmacy shops have been named after animals.&lt;/ref&gt; The company is named after the Greek word φαρμακεία, transliterated ''pharmakeia'', which means 'sorcery'. In the company's early days, much of its profits were derived from the "miracle medicine" [[Phospho-Energon]].

During [[World War II]], Swedish chemist [[Björn Ingelman]] (who worked for [[Arne Tiselius]] at [[Uppsala university]]) researched various uses for the [[polysaccharide]] [[dextran]]. Together with the medical researcher [[Anders Grönwall]], he discovered that dextran could be used as a replacement for [[blood plasma]] in [[blood transfusions]], for which there could be a large need in wartime. Pharmacia, which then was still a small company, was contacted in 1943 and its CEO Elis Göth was very interested. The product Macrodex, a dextran solution, was launched four years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharma-industry.se/artikelShowNew_Article.asp?leverantorsbokenID=120700 Pharma-industri.se: ''Krig, socker och samarbete lade grunden till företag i världsklass''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820100122/http://www.pharma-industry.se/artikelShowNew_Article.asp?leverantorsbokenID=120700 |date=2010-08-20 }} ("War, sugar and cooperation laid the foundation for a world-class company"), accessed on June 17, 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dextran-based products were to play a significant role in the further expansion of Pharmacia. In 1951, the company moved to [[Uppsala]], Sweden, to get closer to the scientists with whom they cooperated, and Ingelman became its head of research. In 1959, Pharmacia pioneered [[gel filtration]] with its [[Sephadex]] products. These were also based on dextran and discoveries in Tiselius' department, this time by [[Jerker Porath]] and [[Per Flodin]]. In 1967 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals was established in Uppsala. In 1986 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals acquired LKB-produkter AB and changed name to Pharmacia Biotech. Pharmacia Biotech expanded their role in the "biotech revolution" through its acquisition of PL Laboratories from Pabst Brewery offering a line of recombinant DNA specialty research chemicals.  Sold to private interests in the 1990s, Pharmacia was first merged with "Kabi Vitrum" to form Kabi Pharmacia with headquarters in Uppsala.  In 1993, Kabi Pharmacia bought [[Farmitalia]], an Italian company that had developed [[doxorubicin]], a chemotherapeutic.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/5/345.2.extract News: Farmitalia bought by Kabi Pharmacia] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160420014222/http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/5/345.2.extract |date=2016-04-20 }}. Ann Oncol (1993) 4 (5): 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the company merged with the [[United States|American]] pharmaceutical company [[Upjohn]], becoming known as [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]] and moved its headquarters to [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4133">The '''phi complex''' is a [[Electroencephalography|brain rhythm]] in the awake [[human brain]] that appears to serve various social functions. Phi is one of several brain rhythms in the awake human brain that coordinate [[human behavior]]. "Phi" operates in the 10-Hz band (ten oscillations per second), and is located above the right [[Parietal lobe|centro-parietal cortex]]. It consists of two components, one favoring independent behaviors, and the other favoring interpersonal coordination between people.

The brain wave patterns of the phi complex are consistent with those of waves produced in the human [[mirror neuron]] system. The phi complex may reflect the influence of one person upon another's behavior, with phi-1 expressing the inhibition of the human mirror neuron system and phi-2 its enhancement.

==Research==
Researchers from [[Florida Atlantic University]] (FAU), in one of the first studies in the field of [[social neuroscience]], have identified neural signatures of effective, real-time coordination between people. FAU researchers have recorded, measured and analyzed both [[behavior]] and brain activity simultaneously in two interacting humans that could provide insight into neurological disorders, such as [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/104/19/8190?rss=1 PNAS.org] – 'The phi complex as a neuromarker of human social coordination', Emmanuelle Tognoli, Julien Lagarde, Gonzalo C. DeGuzman, and J.A. Scott Kelso, ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (May 8, 2007, vol 104, no 19, 8190–8195)&lt;/ref&gt; The research used the conceptual framework and methods of [[coordination dynamics]].

Using specially designed dual-[[electroencephalogram]] recordings, Tognoli and her colleagues tested the brain activity of two people simultaneously performing continuous finger motion. Initially, two subjects were asked to rhythmically wag their fingers at their own preferential pace, but were prevented from seeing each other's hands. Then the barrier placed between them was then removed, so they could see each other while continuing to wag their fingers. When subjects were allowed to see one another's fingers moving, they sometimes adjusted their own movements and synchronized, and sometimes they did not, behaving independently.

The researchers believe that the use of dual EEG recordings to observe the phi complex could help scientists better understand what triggers leader/follower behaviors and male/female relationships. The researchers reported that 62% of respondents synchronized their movements upon being exposed to one another's finger-wagging, but 38% were unaffected and continued gesturing independently.

The study demonstrated a clear reduction in [[occipital lobe]] [[alpha wave]] and [[mu wave]] rhythms during social interaction. The evident suppression was independent of whether or not behavior was coordinated. In contrast, a pair of oscillatory components (phi-1 and phi-2) above the right centro-parietal cortex distinguished effective from ineffective coordination. An increase of phi-1 favored independent behavior and increase of phi-2 favored coordinated behavior.

According to Kelso "What this research suggests is that a unique pattern can be seen in the brains of two people interacting and that these brain activities distinguish independence from cooperation. This new brain rhythm that we have discovered and termed the 'phi complex' actually distinguishes when you're socially interacting and when you're not."

'''Social cognition''' is "a sub-topic of [[social psychology]] that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that [[cognitive processes]] play in social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Park |first=Mina |last2= Song |first2=Jae-Jin |last3=Oh |first3=Seo Jin |last4=Shin |first4=Min-Sup |last5=Lee |first5=Jun Ho |last6=Oh |first6= Seung Ha |journal= BioMed Research International |language=en |volume=2015 |pages=1–7 |doi= 10.1155/2015/313274 |pmid= 26236723 |pmc= 4506840 |issn= 2314-6133 |title=The Relation between Nonverbal IQ and Postoperative CI Outcomes in Cochlear Implant Users: Preliminary Result |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with [[conspecifics]] (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of [[social psychology]], social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[information processing theory]]. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt; The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.

The term ''social cognition'' has been used in multiple areas in [[psychology]] and [[Social cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience]], most often to refer to various social abilities disrupted in [[autism]],&lt;ref name="Striano"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Cognition: Development, Neuroscience and Autism|editor=Striano, T.|editor2=Reid, V.|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1-4051-6217-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref name="Billeke-Aboitiz-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 =Billeke | first1 = P. | last2 = Aboitiz | first2 = F.  | title = Social cognition in schizophrenia: from social stimuli processing to social engagement| journal =Frontiers in Psychiatry  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = eCollection 2013 |date=February 2013 | doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00004 | pmid = 23444313 | pmc=3580762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other disorders.&lt;ref name="BlairMitchellBlair"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain|last=Blair|first=J.|author2=Mitchel, D. |author3=Blair, K.  |year=2005|isbn=978-0-631-23336-7|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|pages=25–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cacioppo, J.T.|author2=Berntson, G.G.|author3=Sheridan, J.F.|author4=McClintock, M.K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Multilevel integrative analyses of human behavior: social neuroscience and the complementing nature of social and biological approaches|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|issue=6|pages=829–43|pmid=11107878|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.829|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806233305/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cacioppo, J.T.|year=2002|title=Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa|journal=American Psychologist|volume=57|issue=11|pages=819–31|pmid=12564179|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.11.819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=R.|title=Social cognition and the human brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|pages=469–79|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01399-6|pmid=10562726|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.7847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]]s study the development of social cognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|title= Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence|last=Shaffer |first=D.R.|author2=Kipp, K. |isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|chapter=Chapter 12: Theories of social and cognitive development |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of [[cognitive psychology]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name=Husain&gt;{{cite book|title= Social Psychology|last=Husain |first=A. |isbn=9788131760000 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]]|chapter=Chapter 5: Social Perception and Cognition |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "[[mentalism (psychology)|cognitive elements]]" such as [[schema (psychology)|schemas]], [[attribution theory|attributions]], or [[stereotype]]s. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.

==Social schemas==
Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or "[[concept]]s" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the brain]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.

When a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.

Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication? A theory driven study |journal=The Open Medical Informatics Journal |volume=2 |pages=82–91|doi=10.2174/1874431100802010082|pmid=19415137|pmc=2669642}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.

Social cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural differences==
Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.&lt;ref name= "Aronson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book |title= Remembering |last=Bartlett |first=F. |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page=249 |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.

Cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as [[China]] and [[Japan]] tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbett |first=R. |author2=Peng, K. |author3=Choi, I. |author4= Norenzayan, A.  |title=Culture and Systems of thought: Holistic vs. analytic cognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |pages=291–310 |year=2001 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.291 |pmid=11381831 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Takahiko Masuda |last1=Masuda |first1=T. |last2=Nisbett|first2=R. |title=Culture and change blindness |journal=Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal. |volume=30 |pages=381–389 |year=2006 |doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_63 |pmid=21702819 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett" /&gt; For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|authorlink2=Phoebe C. Ellsworth|authorlink3=Batja Mesquita |author3=Mesquita, B.  |title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=94 |pages=365–381 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365 |pmid=18284287 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the typically Western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context.&lt;ref name= "Masuda 2006" /&gt; For example, if a Westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling, then he or she might focus only on the classmate's face in order to make the judgment.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008" /&gt;

Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyamoto |first=Y. |author2=Kitayama, S.  |title=Cultural variation in correspondence bias: The critical role of attitude diagnosticity of socially constrained behaviour |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=1239–1248 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1239 |pmid=12416925 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.6787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cognitive neuroscience==
{{See also|Social cognitive neuroscience}}
Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of [[Phineas Gage]], whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent [[neuropsychological]] studies have shown that [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] disrupt social cognitive processes. For example, damage to the frontal lobes can affect emotional responses to social stimuli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harmon-Jones |first=E. |author2=Winkielman, P.  |year=2007 |title=Social Neuroscience: Integrating Biological and Psychological Explanations of Social Behavior |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-59385-404-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Descarte's Error: Emotion, reason and the human brain |last=Damasio |first=A.R. |year=1994 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-65656-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hornak |first=J. |author2=Rolls, E.T. |author3=Wade, D.  |year=1996 |title=Face and voice expression identification in patients with emotional and behavioral changes following ventral frontal lobe damage |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=34 |pages=247–61 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00106-9 |pmid=8657356 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performance on [[theory of mind]] tasks.&lt;ref name=BaronCohen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=V.E. |author2=Baron-Cohen, S. |author3= Knight, R.T.  |title=Frontal lobe contributions to theory of mind |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=10 |pages=640–56 |year=1998 |doi=10.1162/089892998562942 |pmid=9802997 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.330.1488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brunet |first=E. |author2=Sarfati, Y. |author3=Hardy-Bayle, MC. |author4=Decety, J. |year=2000 |title=A PET investigation of attribution of intentions to others with a non-verbal task |journal=NeuroImage |volume=11 |pages=157–66 |doi=10.1006/nimg.1999.0525 |pmid=10679187 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[temporal lobe]], damage to the [[fusiform gyrus]] can lead to the [[prosopagnosia|inability to recognize faces]].

The development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively (see [[developmental psychology]]). For example, it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as [[Face perception|facial recognition]]) may be [[psychological nativism|innate]]. Consistent with this, very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice, face and scent of their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |pages=182–3 |chapter=Chapter 5: Social Development |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-631-14809-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz''' ({{lang-be|Станіслаў Булак-Балаховіч}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Станисла́в Була́к-Балахо́вич}}; 12 November 1883 – 28 November 1940) was a notable general, military commander and veteran of World War I, [[Russian Civil War]], [[Estonian War of Independence]], [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] and the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] at the start of World War II.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz was born 10 February 1883 in [[Braslaw Raion|Meyszty]], a small village in the [[Kovno Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Braslaw Raion]] in Belarus). Stanisław had two brothers and six sisters. His parents were servants to a local landlord of [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Autobio"&gt;Bułak-Bałachowicz S.N. "General Bułak-Bałachowicz on his deeds: how it was in reality? // Civil war archive. Berlin, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stanisław' birth, his father left the landlord's service and acquired a small estate in Stakavievo near Vilnius.

After attending an agricultural school for four years in Belmonty, Bułak-Bałachowicz worked as an accountant, and in 1904 became a manager at the Count Plater's estates in Horodziec and Łużki.&lt;ref name="Autobio" /&gt;

At the time, he had a reputation as a defender of the less fortunate and was often an arbitrator in disputes between the farmers and their landlord. As a result of these activities he acquired the nickname "Daddy" (Bat'ka). His other nickname—"Bulak"—  became part of his surname. It means a man who is driven by the wind in the Belarusian language.&lt;ref name="NHV"&gt;[http://www.nivestnik.ru/2002_2/8.shtml New Historical Herald, 2002, # 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
After the outbreak of [[World War I]] and Duke [[Grand Duke Nicholas|Nikolai Nikolayevich Romanov]]'s address to the Polish people, Bułak-Bałachowicz joined the Russian Imperial army. As a person of noble roots, he was drafted as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] to the 2nd Leyb-Courland Infantry Regiment. However, unlike many of his colleagues who were awarded the basic NCO grades for their noble ancestry only, Bułak-Bałachowicz proved himself as a skilled field commander and was quickly promoted. By December 1914, only four months after he entered the army, he was given command over a group of [[Cossack]] volunteers, of whom he formed a cavalry squadron. Together with the [[2nd Cavalry Division (Russian Empire)|2nd Cavalry Division]] he fought on the western front, most notably in the area of [[Sochaczew]] near [[Warsaw]].

During the German summer offensive of 1915 Warsaw was taken by the [[Central Powers]] and Bułak-Bałachowicz's unit was forced to retreat towards [[Latvia]].

On November 1915, Bułak-Bałachowicz was assigned to the special partisan regiment in Northern front headquarters as a squadron commander. His regiment under the command of colonel Punin L. was acting in the [[Riga]] area. For their audacious actions partisans were nicknamed "deathknights".&lt;ref name="NHV"/&gt;

His unit was formed of four cavalry platoons: one of Cossack light cavalry, one of [[hussars]], one of [[uhlans]] and one of [[dragoons]]. Thanks to the versatile and flexible structure of his unit, Bułak-Bałachowicz managed to continue the fight behind the enemy lines until 1918.

For the German campaign Bułak-Bałachowicz was decorated with six orders and three soldier's Georgiev medals (2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree).

===Russian Civil War===
On 5 March 1918, unaware of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed only two days before, the unit commanded by Bułak-Bałachowicz got engaged in a skirmish against a German unit near the village of Smolova. Although the enemy unit was severely defeated, forced to retreat and abandon its staff behind, Bułak-Bałachowicz was seriously wounded after being shot in the left lung. Transported to [[Saint Petersburg]], Bułak-Bałachowicz quickly recovered and rejoined with his brother, [[Jozef Bulak-Balachowicz|Józef Bułak-Bałachowicz]]. The latter got involved in the creation of a Polish cavalry detachment commanded by ensign Przysiecki. The [[Bolsheviks]] disbanded the unit soon after its formation, executed its commander and started to persecute its members. However, with a help of French military mission a Polish cavalry detachment was finally created and Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz became its commander. The new unit received [[Leon Trotsky]]'s recognition and was soon reinforced with non-Polish volunteers from all over Russia and was planned as a cavalry division of the [[Red Army]].

Soon after its creation, Bułak-Bałachowicz was ordered to quell the so-called ''Baron Korff Revolt'' in the area of the city of [[Luga, Leningrad Oblast|Luga]]. With his regiment (the unit was still not completely formed) he reached the area and pacified the peasant unrest without the use of force. He was immediately called in to Saint Petersburg by his superiors, but was afraid of being arrested. Because of that, Bułak-Bałachowicz with his cavalry regiment deserted and moved across the Bolshevik lines to the area of [[Pskov]], held by the joint forces of [[White Movement|White Russian]] Northern Army and various German [[Anti-Bolshevik Communism|anti-Bolshevik]] units. Initially the unit fought against the Reds on the White side, but soon conflicts with the German officials arose and Bułak-Bałachowicz had to switch sides yet again. Together with his battle-hardened unit he disarmed the German units surrounding him and broke to the rear of the Red-held territory. From there he fought his way across the fronts to [[Estonia]], where he finally joined the forces of General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich]]'s [[Northwestern Army (Russia)|Northwestern Army]]. A skilled commander, Bułak-Bałachowicz added greatly to the Estonian victories in the battles of [[Tartu]], [[Võru]], and [[Vastseliina]], and was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel.

On 10 May 1919, Bałachowicz was given the command over an ''assault group'' and was ordered to drive it to the rear of the Bolshevik lines. Three days later his forces took the town of [[Gdov]] by surprise and on 29 May Bałachowicz entered [[Pskov]]. For this action he was promoted to colonel by General Yudenich himself. Because of his victories, his subordinates (mostly Belarusian, Cossack, and Polish volunteers) nicknamed him [[ataman]], though some preferred to use the term ''Bat'ko'' – father.

Bułak-Bałachowicz became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal [[duma]] and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers, which enraged White generals towards him. Finally, Bułak-Bałachowicz entered in contact with Estonian officers and Poles who were trying to reach the renascent [[Polish Army]], which was seen by Bałachowicz's superiors as a sign of lack of loyalty. After Pskov was yet again lost to the Bolsheviks in mid-July, general Yudenich ordered Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz to be arrested even though only a few days earlier he promoted him to major general (a move Yudenich undertook with hopes of appeasing Bułak-Bałachowicz and encouraging greater subordinance).

However, once again Bułak-Bałachowicz evaded being captured. He handed over his division to his brother Józef and, together with 20 of his friends, left for Estonian-controlled [[Ostrov, Ostrovsky District, Pskov Oblast|Ostrov]]. There he once again created a partisan unit. With 600 men he broke through the Red Army front and started to disrupt its supply lines. Despite Yudenich's hostility towards Bułak-Bałachowicz, the latter cooperated with White Russian units during their counter-offensive in the autumn of 1919. His unit captured the railway node in [[Porkhov]] and broke the Pskov-[[Polotsk]] rail road, which added greatly to the White Russian's initial success. On 5 November 1919 his unit yet again entered the area between [[Pskov]] and Ostrov and destroyed the three remaining railway lines linking Pskov with the rest of Russia. However, Yudenich's army could not link up with the areas controlled by Bułak-Bałachowicz and their assault was finally broken.

On 22 January 1920, general Yudenich signed an order of dissolution of his badly-beaten army. On 28 January general Bułak-Bałachowicz, together with several Russian officers and the Estonian police arrested him. A large amount of money was found with him (roughly 227.000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]], 250.000 Estonian marks and 110.000.000 [[Markka|Finnish marks]]) was given to the soldiers of the disbanded army as a last salary, which greatly added to Bałachowicz's popularity amongst them.

===Short service for the Belarusian Democratic Republic===
[[File:Zarinsh 50 kap.jpg|thumb|140px|right|A postal stamp of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]], issued on behalf of the Special Unit of the BDR in the Baltics which was led by Bałachowicz]]
Since 1918, Bałachowicz has been in contacts with the representatives of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]] in the Baltic states. On 7 November 1919, the government of the BDR agreed to finance Bałachowicz's unit and on 14 November, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz confirmed his Belarusian citizenship and applied for official service for the Belarusian Democratic Republic. His unit was officially renamed to ''Special Unit of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in the Baltics'' ({{lang-be|Асобны атрад БНР у Балтыі}}), received Belarusian uniforms and a seal. The unit issued its own field [[postal stamp]]s and engaged in a few minor battles with the Bolsheviks.

===Polish-Bolshevik War===
In February 1920 Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz contacted [[Józef Piłsudski]] through the Polish envoy to [[Riga]] and proposed to ally his unit with the Polish Army against the Bolshevist Russia. As the fame of the general preceded him, Piłsudski agreed and soon afterwards Bułak-Bałachowicz with some 800 cavalrymen set off for yet another of his great odysseys. After leaving Estonia, they outflanked the Red Russian lines and rode several hundred kilometres behind the enemy lines to Latvia, where they were allowed to pass through Latvian territory. Finally by mid-March they reached [[Dyneburg]] (now [[Daugavpils]], then under Polish military administration), where they were greeted as heroes by Józef Piłsudski himself.

[[Image:Krzyz Walecznosci Ribbon.png|thumb|right|Ribbon of Krzyż Waleczności, a military award created for the soldiers of Bułak-Bałachowicz's units]]
Transferred to [[Brześć Litewski]], the Bułak-Bałachowicz's unit was reformed into a ''Bułak-Bałachowicz [[Operational Group]]'', sometimes incorrectly referred to as ''Belarusian-Lithuanian Division''. It was composed mostly of Belarusian volunteers, as well as veterans of the [[Green armies|Green Army]] and former Red Army soldiers, and received the status of an allied army. Because of the composition of his troops, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz is sometimes referred to as a Belarusian.&lt;ref name="Nationality"&gt;The nationality of Bułak-Bałachowicz was a matter of dispute even during the war. Józef Piłsudski described him with the following words: ''Today he's a Pole, tomorrow he'll be a Russian, the day after – a Belarusian and the following day perhaps an African.''; as cited in: Cabanowski, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally independent, the division was one of the most successful units fighting in the ranks of the Polish Army during the Polish-Bolshevik War. The unit entered combat in late June 1920 in the area of [[Polesie Marshes]]. On 30 June Bułak-Bałachowicz once again broke through the enemy lines and captured the village of Sławeczno in today's Belarus, where the [[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]s of the [[Soviet 2nd Rifle Brigade]] were stationed. The enemy unit was caught by surprise and suffered heavy losses. On 3 July the enemy unit was completely surrounded in the village of Wieledniki and was annihilated. After that action, the Operational Group was withdrawn to the main lines of the Polish 3rd Army and after 10 July it defended the line of the [[Styr]] river against Red Army actions.

On 23 July, during the Bolshevik offensive towards central Poland, general Bałachowicz's group started an organised retreat as a rear guard of the Polish 3rd Army. During that operation, Bułak-Bałachowicz abandoned the withdrawing Polish troops and stayed with his forces for several days behind the enemy lines only to break through to the Polish forces shortly afterwards. During the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] overnight of 14 August Bałachowicz's forces were ordered to start a counter-attack towards the town of [[Włodawa]], one of the centres of concentration of the advancing Russian forces. On 17 August the area was secured and the Bułak-Bałachowicz's forces defended it successfully until 7 September against numerically superior enemy forces. Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz organised an active defence and managed to disrupt the concentration of all enemy attacks before they could be started. For instance on 30 August and 2 September his forces, supported by the [[Polish 7th Infantry Division]], managed to attack the [[Soviet 58th Rifle Division]] from the rear, before it could attack the town of Włodawa.

On 15 September the unit was yet again advancing in pursuit of the withdrawing Red Army. That day the unit captured [[Kamien Koszyrski|Kamień Koszyrski]], where it took more than 1000 [[prisoners of war]] and the [[matériel]] depot of an entire division. During the [[Battle of the Niemen River]] Bałachowicz's unit prevented the enemy from forming a defensive line in [[Polesie]]. Overnight of 21 September his unit outflanked and then destroyed completely the Bolshevik 88th Rifle Regiment near the town of [[Lyubeshiv|Lubieszów]]. Perhaps the most notable victory of the Bułak-Bałachowicz's Group took place on 26 September, when his forces took [[Pinsk]] in the rear.&lt;ref name="mashko"&gt;Mashko VV.

===Failed uprising in Belarus===
{{see also|Slutsk Defence Action}}
In October Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz was stationed with his forces in Pinsk, where they received supplies and a large amount of former Red Army soldiers who were taken [[prisoner of war]] after the Battle of Warsaw and volunteered for the service in anti-Bolshevik units. The unit was to re-enter combat in November, but on 12 October a [[cease fire]] was signed. On the insistence of both the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and [[Bolshevik Russia]], the allied units were to leave Poland before 2 November. General Bułak-Bałachowicz was given the choice of either being interned in Poland with his units and then sent home or to continue the fight against the Reds on his own. He chose the latter option, just like most other White Russian and Ukrainian units fighting on the Polish side in the Polish-Bolshevik War.

On 2 November 1920, his units were renamed the [[Russian People's Volunteer Army]] and transferred to the areas that were to be abandoned by the Polish Army and become a [[no-man's-land]] until the final Russo-Polish peace treaty was signed. Three days later his forces crossed into Russian-held Belarus and started an offensive towards [[Homel]]. General Bułak-Bałachowicz was hoping for a Belarusian all-national uprising against Bolshevik Russia. His forces initially achieved a limited success and captured Homel and [[Rechytsa]].

On 10 November 1920 Bułak-Bałachowicz entered [[Mozyr]]. There, two days later, he again proclaimed the independence of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]] with himself as the head of state. Bułak-Bałachowicz declared the exiled [[Rada BNR]] as dismissed and started forming a new [[Belarusian National Army]]. On 16 November 1920 he also created the Belarusian provisional government. However, the planned uprising gained little support in the Belarusian nation tired by six years of constant war and the Red Army finally gained an upper hand. On 18 November 1920 Bałachowicz abandoned Mozyr and started a withdrawal towards the Polish frontier. The Belarusian troops, hardened by the years spent behind the enemy lines, fought their way to Poland and managed to inflict heavy casualties on the advancing Russians while suffering negligible losses, but were too weak to turn the tide of war.

Representatives of Balachowicz participated in the organization and conduction of the [[Slutsk Defence Action]] that started in late November around [[Slutsk]].

On 28 November the last organised unit under his command crossed the Polish border and was subsequently interned. The Russian government demanded that General Bułak-Bałachowicz be handed over to them and tried for high treason. The [[Peace of Riga|Riga Peace Conference]] was even halted by these demands for several days, but eventually these claims were refuted by the Polish government which argued that Bułak-Bałachowicz was a Polish citizen since 1918.

===Interbellum===
Shortly after the [[Peace of Riga|Riga Peace Treaty]] had been signed, Bułak-Bałachowicz and his men were set free from the internment camps. The general retired from the army and settled in Warsaw. There he became an active member of various veteran societies. Among other functions, he held the post of the head of Society of Former Fighters of the National Uprisings. He was also a political essayist and writer of two books on the possibilities of a future war with Germany: "Wojna będzie czy nie będzie" (''Will there be war or will there be not''; 1931) and "Precz z Hitlerem czy niech żyje Hitler" (''Down with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] or long live Hitler?'', 1933). Between 1936 and 1939 he served as an advisor to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

===World War II===
During the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Polish Defensive War]] of 1939, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz volunteered for the Polish army. He created a Volunteer Group that fought in the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|defence of Warsaw]]. The unit consisted of approximately 1750 ill-equipped infantrymen and 250 cavalrymen. It was used on the southern flank of the Polish forces defending the Polish capital and adopted the tactics its commander knew perfectly well: fast attacks on the rear of the enemy forces. On 12 September 1939, the unit entered combat for the first time. It took the German defenders by surprise and retook the southernmost borough of [[Sluzew|Służew]] and the [[Sluzewiec|Służewiec]] horse track. Soon afterwards the cavalry organised a disrupting attack on the German infantry stationed in [[Natolin]]. On 23 September the unit was transferred to northern Warsaw, where it was to organise an assault on the German positions in the [[Bielany]] forest. The assault had been prepared, but was thwarted by the [[cease-fire]] signed on 27 September.

After the capitulation of Warsaw, general Bułak-Bałachowicz (formally retired) evaded being captured by the Germans and returned to civilian life. At the same time he was the main organiser of [[:pl:Konfederacja Wojskowa|Konfederacja Wojskowa]] (''Military Confederation''), one of the first underground resistance groups in German and Soviet-occupied Poland. In early 1940 the [[Gestapo]] found out his whereabouts. He was surrounded with a group of young conspirators in a house in Warsaw's borough of [[Saska Kępa]] and arrested by the Germans. According to the most common version, Bułak-Bałachowicz, was shot by [[Gestapo]] agents on 10 May 1940, in the Warsaw centre, on the intersection between Francuska and Trzeciego Maja streets.&lt;ref name="mashko"/&gt;

For his resistance against Bolshevik forces that killed local Belarusian peasantry, members of [[Belarusian minority in Poland]] regard him as their [[Folk hero|national hero]].&lt;ref name="Moroz"&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aleksy Moroz| date =December 2004| title =Dzień Bohaterów na Białostocczyźnie| journal =Niwa| volume =| issue =2004–12–09| pages =| doi =| id =| url =http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?pokaz=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;wiecej=8229| format =| accessdate =| language =pl| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061009165425/http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?pokaz=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;wiecej=8229| archivedate =9 October 2006| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- White ???--&gt; Historians have often seen him to be an adventurer.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;ref name="mashko"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-Semitism, Volume 12", Israel pocket library, Publisher: Keter Books, 1974 {{ISBN|978-0-7065-1327-1}}, p. 133-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2015) found that cyanobacteria exposed to localized beams of light moved towards the light, or expressed [[phototaxis]], and increased their [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] yield, which is necessary for survival.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biddanda|first=Bopaiah A.|last2=McMillan|first2=Adam C.|last3=Long|first3=Stephen A.|last4=Snider|first4=Michael J.|last5=Weinke|first5=Anthony D.|date=2015-01-01|title=Seeking sunlight: rapid phototactic motility of filamentous mat-forming cyanobacteria optimize photosynthesis and enhance carbon burial in Lake Huron’s submerged sinkholes|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00930/abstract|journal=Aquatic Microbiology|pages=930|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.00930|pmc=4561352|pmid=26441867|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a novel experiment, the scientists projected a school logo onto a petri dish containing the organisms, which accreted beneath the lighted region, forming the logo in bacteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors speculate that such [[motility]] allows the cyanobacteria to seek light sources to support the colony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In both light and dark conditions, the cyanobacteria form clumps that then expand outwards, with individual members remaining connected to the colony via long tendrils. This may be a protective mechanism that affords evolutionary benefit to the colony in harsh environments where mechanical forces act to tear apart the microbial mats. Thus these sometimes elaborate structures, constructed by microscopic organisms working somewhat in unison, are a means of providing shelter and protection from a harsh environment.

==Fossil record ==
Some [[Archean]] rock formations show macroscopic similarity to modern microbial structures, leading to the inference that these structures represent evidence of ancient life, namely stromatolites. However, others regard these patterns as being due to natural material deposition or some other abiogenic mechanism. Scientists have argued for a biological origin of stromatolites due to the presence of organic globule clusters within the thin layers of the stromatolites, of [[aragonite]] nanocrystals (both features of current stromatolites),&lt;ref name=Lepot2008&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ngeo107 | volume = 1 | pages = 118–21 | last = Lepot | first = Kevin |author2=Karim Benzerara |author3=Gordon E.

[[Proterozoic]] stromatolite microfossils (preserved by [[permineralization]] in silica) include [[cyanobacteria]] and possibly some forms of the [[Eukaryota|eukaryote]] [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]] (that is, [[green algae]]). One [[genus]] of stromatolite very common in the [[geologic time scale|geologic record]] is ''[[Collenia]]''.

The connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance is well documented in the younger [[Ordovician]] [[evolutionary radiation]]; stromatolite abundance also increased after the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end-Ordovician]] and [[Permian extinction|end-Permian]] extinctions decimated marine animals, falling back to earlier levels as marine animals recovered.&lt;ref name="SheehanHarris2004ResurgenceAfterOrdovicianExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Microbialite resurgence after the Late Ordovician extinction | journal=Nature | volume=430 | pages=75–78 | year=2004 | doi=10.1038/nature02654 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n6995/full/nature02654.html | author1=Sheehan, P.M. | author2=Harris, M.T. | pmid=15229600 | issue=6995 | bibcode=2004Natur.430...75S | access-date=18 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007145118/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n6995/full/nature02654.html | archive-date=7 October 2008 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluctuations in metazoan population and diversity may not have been the only factor in the reduction in stromatolite abundance.

While [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cyanobacteria reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the [[timeline of evolution|evolutionary development]] of more complex [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms.&lt;ref name="PiP" /&gt; Cyanobacteria (as well as [[extremophile]] [[Gammaproteobacteria]]) are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of [[oxygen]] in the primeval earth's [[atmosphere]] through their continuing [[photosynthesis]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]). Cyanobacteria use [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[sunlight]] to create their food. A layer of [[mucus]] often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented together by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of [[limestone]]. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed [[oncolite]]s are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the [[fossil record]]. [[Thrombolite]]s are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria, common in the fossil record and in modern sediments.&lt;ref name=Lepot2008/&gt;

The Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of south western [[Namibia]] provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the [[Proterozoic]] period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adams, E.

Laguna Bacalar in Mexico's southern [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in the state of [[Quintana Roo]], has an extensive formation of living giant [[Wiktionary:microbialite|microbialites]] (that is, stromatolites or [[thrombolites]]).

A little farther to the south, a 1.5&amp;nbsp;km stretch of reef-forming stromatolites (primarily of the genus ''[[Scytonema]]'') occurs in [[Chetumal Bay]] in [[Belize]], just south of the mouth of the [[Rio Hondo (Belize)|Rio Hondo]] and the Mexican border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rasmussen, K.A.|author2=Macintyre, I.G.|author3=Prufert, L|last-author-amp=yes|title=Modern stromatolite reefs fringing a brackish coastline, Chetumal Bay, Belize|journal=Geology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=199–202|date=March 1993|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021&lt;0199:MSRFAB&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1993Geo....21..199R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pair of instances of freshwater stromatolites are at [[Pavilion Lake|Pavilion]] and [[Kelly Lake, British Columbia|Kelly Lake]]s in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

Microbialites have been discovered in an open pit pond at an abandoned asbestos mine near [[Clinton Creek, Yukon]],
Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Power, I.M., Wilson, S.A., Dipple, G.M., and Southam, G. (2011) ''Modern carbonate microbialites from an asbestos open pit pond, Yukon, Canada'', http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbi.2011.9.issue-2/issuetoc {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211140309/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbi.2011.9.issue-2/issuetoc |date=11 February 2012 }} Geobiology. 9: 180-195.&lt;/ref&gt; These microbialites are extremely young and presumably began forming soon after the mine closed in 1978. The combination of a low sedimentation rate, high calcification rate, and low microbial growth rate appears to result in the formation of these microbialites. Microbialites at an historic mine site demonstrates that an anthropogenically constructed environment can foster microbial carbonate formation. This has implications for creating artificial environments for building modern microbialites including stromatolites.

'''Technology [[forecasting]]''' attempts to predict the future characteristics of useful technological [[machine]]s, [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] or [[wikt:technique|techniques]].

==Important aspects==
{{quotebox|"'''I think we have a cultural affinity for technology that reflects optimism, but we all make poor forecasts.'''" &amp;mdash; ''Jim Moore, director of the Transportation Engineering Program at the University of Southern California''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20160706-5-transportation-technologies-we-wish-were-more-popular&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Primarily, a technological [[forecasting|forecast]] deals with the characteristics of [[technology]], such as levels of technical performance, like speed of a military aircraft, the power in watts of a particular future engine, the accuracy or precision of a [[measuring instrument]], the number of [[transistors]] in a chip in the year 2015, etc. The forecast does not have to state how these characteristics will be achieved.

Secondly, technological forecasting usually deals with only useful machines, procedures or techniques. This is to exclude from the domain of technological forecasting those commodities, services or techniques intended for luxury or amusement.

==Rational and explicit methods==
The whole purpose of the recitation of alternatives is to show that there really is no alternative to forecasting. If a decision maker has several alternatives open to him or her, s/he will choose among them on the basis of which provides him/her with the most desirable outcome. Thus his/her decision is inevitably based on a forecast. His/her only choice is whether the forecast is obtained by rational and explicit methods, or by intuitive means.

The virtues of the use of rational methods are as follows:
#They can be taught and learned,
#They can be described and explained,
#They provide a procedure followable by anyone who has absorbed the necessary training, and in some cases,
#These methods are even guaranteed to produce the same forecast regardless of who uses them.

The virtue of the use of explicit methods is that they can be reviewed by others, and can be checked for consistency. Furthermore, the forecast can be reviewed at any subsequent time.
Technology forecasting is not imagination.

==Methods of technology forecasting==
Commonly adopted methods of technology forecasting include the [[Delphi method]], [[forecast by analogy]], [[growth curve (statistics)|growth curve]]s and [[extrapolation]]. Normative methods of technology forecasting — like the [[relevance tree]]s, [[morphological model]]s, and [[mission flow diagram]]s — are also commonly used.

==Combining forecasts==
Studies of past forecasts have shown that one of the most frequent reasons why a forecast goes wrong is that the forecaster ignores related fields.

A given technical approach may fail to achieve the level of capability forecast for it, because it is superseded by another technical approach which the forecaster ignored.

Another problem is that of inconsistency between forecasts. Because of these problems, it is often necessary to combine forecasts of different technologies. Therefore rather than to try to select the one method which is most appropriate, it may be better to try to combine the forecasts obtained by different methods.

If this is done, the strengths of one method may help compensate for the weaknesses of another.

===Reasons for combining forecasts===
The primary reason for [[Consensus forecasts|combining forecasts]] of the same technology is to attempt to offset the weaknesses of one forecasting method with the strengths of another.
In addition, the use of more than one forecasting method often gives the forecaster more insight into the processes at work which are responsible for the growth of the technology being forecast.

===Trend curve and growth curves===
A frequently used combination is that of growth curves and a trend curve for some technology.
Here we see a succession of growth curves, each describing the level of functional capability achieved by a specific technical approach.

An overall trend curve is also shown, fitted to those items of historical data which represent the currently superior approach.

The use of growth curves and a trend curve in combination allows the forecaster to draw some conclusions about the future growth of a technology which might not be possible, were either method used alone.

With growth curves alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the time at which a given technical approach is likely to be supplanted by a successor approach.

With the trend curve alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the ability of a specific technical approach to meet the projected trend, or about the need to look for a successor approach.
Thus the need for combining forecasts.

===Identification of consistent deviations===
Another frequently used combination of forecasts is that of the trend curve and one or more analogies.

We customarily consider the scatter of data points about a trend curve to be due to random influences which we can neither control nor even measure. However, consistent deviations may represent something other than just random influences.

Where such consistent deviations are identified, we may have an opportunity to apply an analogy. Typical events which bring about deviations from a trend are wars and depressions. Thus the purpose of combining analogies with a trend forecast is to predict deviations from the trend deviations which are associated with or caused by external events or influences.

As with other uses of analogy, it is important to determine the extent to which the analogy between the event used as the basis for the forecast, and the historical model event, satisfies the criteria for a valid analogy.

===Forecasts of different technologies===
Combining forecasts of different technologies may be even more important than combining the forecasts of the same technology.

One reason for this is the fact that technologies may interact or be interrelated in some fashion.
Another reason for this is that of consistency in an overall picture or scenario. One of the simplest examples of interacting trends is the projection to absurdity, i.e. simply projecting the given data indefinitely without getting any specific result. For instance, if one simply projects recent rates of growth of world population, one arrives at some fantastic conclusions about the density of population in a particular place by various dates in the next millennium.

Some other trends which can confidently be expected to not continue indefinitely are:
#Annual production of scientific papers.
#Number of automobiles per capita.
#[[Watt-hour|Kilowatt hours]] of electricity generated annually.

Another instance of interacting trends was in the case of the number of scientists in the U.S. growing faster than the overall population. Since the 1940s through the 1960s, science as an activity in the United States grew exponentially. The number of dollars spent on R&amp;D was growing faster than the GNP (in the 1960s).

If projected indefinitely, these two curves would give the result that eventually every person in the U.S. would be working as a scientist and the entire GNP would be devoted to R&amp;D alone, which are however absurd conclusions. Thus it is clear that the scientific discipline of technology forecasting is not mere trend extrapolation but also involves combining forecasts.

==Uses in manufacturing==
Almost all modern manufacturing firms utilize the services of a technological forecaster. Nevertheless, there are a number of alternatives to the rational and explicit forecasting of technology, such as 'no forecast', 'anything can happen' (i.e. relying on pure chance), 'window-blind forecasting', 'genius forecasting' and boasting of a 'glorious past' (i.e. adopting the same old techniques).

Thus technological forecasting is not mere astrology or palmistry, but a scientific and well defined procedure adopted by a technological forecaster or a consultancy for the forecasting of a particular technology. Even though technological forecasting is a scientific discipline, some experts are of the view that "the only certainty of a particular forecast is that it is wrong to some degree."

The '''''Teresina Vasco Monument''''' is a public artwork by Andrea Sichi, located at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Glenwood Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]]. "Teresina Vasco Monument" was surveyed as part of the [[Smithsonian]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] survey in 1994. It serves as the final resting place for the young Teresina Vasco.&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=SOS | year=1994 | title=Teresina Vasco Monument | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323179~!0#focus | accessdate= 26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

This sculpture shows a full-size portrait of a girl (Teresina Vasco) sitting in a small rocking chair. Her feet and the chair are placed on a pile of flowers, which sits on a square base at the head of a tombstone. She looks off to the right and her proper left arm rests on the arm of the chair. She wears a dress with a [[lace]] collar and her hair is curly and tied back in bows.

The bottom front of the tombstone is inscribed:

'''Test Tube Aliens''' are a series of toys that were invented by JKID Ltd and released by [[4Kidz, Inc.]], a toy and juvenile products company based in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]].

== Story ==

There are 6 [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] available - three good, three bad. The three good aliens  have escaped their dying home world of Nratuatuko in search of a new home. Using the technology of their ancestors, they were genetically reverted to a pre-birth state. They retain only their intelligence, their accumulated strength sacrificed for the greater good. They travelled across the universe in search of a sympathetic lifeform to restore them to adulthood and their former strength.

The evil aliens  are responsible for the destruction of Naratuko, and have pursued the three good aliens across the universe, determined not to let their quarry escape for good.

However, in 2011 it is revealed that all the aliens are evil, even the 'good' aliens are evil. The true good aliens were the Test Tube Aliens X series aliens. The aliens wanted to be marketed in test tubes so that after they appear to be dead, they would be thrown into a bin, so that they could take over the rivers and seas. This was followed by the release of Test Tube Aliens: Pure Evil, with 6 Pure Evil aliens.

== The toy itself ==

[[Image:Test Tube Alien.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Kurion, a good alien in its infancy, having just hatched from its chrysalis.]]The package contains a [[test tube]], a clear plastic cylinder of around 18 centimetres in height and 6 centimetres in diameter. The alien is contained within a white cocoon, or '[[chrysalis]]', inside the cylinder. By adding water the cocoon erodes, revealing an infant alien. The alien's heart (represented by a series of coloured flashes from the head) begins to beat, and the alien is 'alive'.

The alien must be fed for the first few days of its existence with 'Sloog', a white powder which is combined with water and poured into the test tube. After the feeding is complete, the alien will survive on plain tap water.

In order to remain 'healthy', the alien must be kept in twelve hours of daylight, and twelve hours of darkness each day. If left too long in the light, the alien's heartbeat will speed up. If left too long in darkness, the alien's heartbeat will become staggered and sporadic.

Similarly, the alien will detect if the water level is too high or low, and it will flash green (too high, drowning) or orange (too low, thirsty) to indicate this.

Eventually, if the alien is not treated right, it will die and the toy becomes useless. Some have been recorded to survive seven to nine months in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alien will also interact with the [http://www.testtubealiens.com Test Tube Aliens website], where users can induce the alien into a coma or panic mode. The alien's age and health can also be checked. Unfortunately the website is currently down rendering the toy useless.

== How it works ==

The alien body contains [[Polyacrylamide]], a [[polymer]] that soaks up water and causes the body to expand to up to eight times its original size.  The "sloog" contains a weak [[acid]] that slows the expansion of the polymer so that the growth appears to occur over several days.  The alien can sense the presence of the acid by measuring the solution's conductivity via [[electrodes]] on the tip of its [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]] and on the top of its head.  The electrodes also act to sense water level—the water level must be between the antenna electrode and the head electrodes for the alien to be `healthy'.

The website interaction works via a light detector in the alien's head responding to flashes from the 'web portal' on the Test Tube Aliens website.  The light detector also lets the alien know how many hours it has been exposed to light and dark.  As of January 2013, the [http://www.testtubealiens.com/ Test Tube Alien website] was offline.

A '''Total Anterior Circulation Infarct''' ('''TACI''') is a type of [[cerebral infarction]] affecting the entire [[anterior]] [[Circulatory system|circulation]] supplying one side of the [[brain]].

'''Total Anterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome''' ('''TACS''') refers to the symptoms of a patient who clinically appears to have suffered from a total anterior circulation infarct, but who has not yet had any diagnostic imaging (e.g. [[CT Scan]]) to confirm the diagnosis.

It is diagnosed when it causes all 3 of the following symptoms:
* Higher dysfunction
** [[Dysphasia]]
** [[Visuospatial]] disturbances
** Decreased level of consciousness
* [[Homonymous hemianopia]]
* Motor and Sensory Defects (≥2/3 of face, arm, leg)

'''[[Count]] Ugolino della Gherardesca''' ({{circa|1220}}{{snd}}March 1289), count of Donoratico, was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[nobility|nobleman]], politician and naval commander. He was frequently accused of treason and features prominently in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.

==Biography==
In the 13th century, Italy was beset by the strife of two parties, the [[Ghibellines]] and the [[Guelphs]]. While the conflict was local and personal in origin, the parties had come to be associated with the two universal powers: the Ghibellines sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and his rule of Italy, while the Guelphs sided with the Pope, who supported self-governing city-states.
[[File:Coat of arms of the House of della Gherardesca.svg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of arms of the [[Della Gherardesca family|House of della Gherardesca]]]]
Pisa was controlled by the Ghibellines, while most of the surrounding cities were controlled by the Guelphs, most notably Pisa's trading rivals [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]]. Under the circumstances, Pisa adopted the "strong and vigilant government" of a [[podestà]] "armed with almost despotic power"&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;"Count Ugolino of Pisa",  ''Bentley’s Miscellany'' 55 (1864), p. 173–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugolino was born in [[Pisa]] into the [[della Gherardesca family]], a noble family of [[Lombards|Germanic]] origins whose alliance with the [[Hohenstaufen]] [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperors]] had brought to prominence in [[Tuscany]] and made them the leaders of the Ghibellines in Pisa.

Between 1256 and 1258 he participated in the war against the filo-genoese [[giudicato of Cagliari]], in [[Sardinia]]. Ugolino then obtained the south-western portion of the former giudical territory, with its rich [[silver mines]], where he founded the important city of ''Villa di Chiesa'', today [[Iglesias, Sardinia|Iglesias]].
[[Image:Ugolino Carpeaux Petit Palais PPSO1573.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Ugolino and his sons'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], 1861, [[Petit Palais]].]]

As head of his family, the Ghibelline party and podestà of Pisa, Ugolino took action to preserve his power in the face of the political hostility of Pisa's neighbours. In 1271, through a marriage of his sister with [[Giovanni Visconti (Gallura)|Giovanni Visconti]], [[judge of Gallura]], he allied himself with the [[House of Visconti#Visconti of Pisa and Sardinia|Visconti]], the leaders of the Guelphs in Pisa. In doing so, he aroused the suspicions of his fellow Ghibellines.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Della Gherardesca, Ugolino |volume=7 |pages=965–966|first=Luigi|last=Villari|authorlink=Luigi Villari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent disorders in the city in 1274 led to the arrest of both Ugolino and Giovanni, who were accused of plotting to undermine Pisa's government and, with the support from Tuscany's Guelphs, share power among themselves. Ugolino was imprisoned and Giovanni banished from Pisa. Giovanni Visconti died soon afterwards, and Ugolino, no longer regarded as a threat, was set free and banished. In exile, Ugolino immediately began to intrigue with the Guelph cities of [[Florence]] and [[Lucca]]. With the help of [[Charles I of Anjou]], he attacked his native city and forced it to make peace on humiliating terms, pardoning him and all the other Guelph exiles.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; After his return, Ugolino at first remained aloof from politics but quietly worked to reassert his influence.

In 1284, war broke out between Pisa and [[Genoa]] and both Ugolino and Andreotto Saracini were appointed as captains of two divisions of fleets by Alberto Morosini, the Podestà of Pisa. The two fleets met in August in the [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]]. The Genoese fought valiantly and destroyed seven Pisan galleys and captured twenty-eight. Among the eleven thousand captives was the Podestà.&lt;ref name="Bentley"/&gt; Ugolino and his division set the sign of surrender and withdrew, deciding the battle in favour of Genoa.&lt;ref name="Bentley"/&gt; This flight was later interpreted as treachery but not by any writer earlier than the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;G. del Noce, in ''Il Conte U. della Gherardesca'' (1894), takes treachery as the only motive behind the flight, while Daniella Bartoli, in the 6th volume of his ''Storia della letteratura italiana'', suggests Ugolino's alliance with the Ghibellines as the motive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Florence]] and [[Lucca]] took advantage of the naval defeat to attack Pisa, Ugolino was appointed [[podestà]] for a year and succeeded in pacifying them by ceding certain castles. When Genoa suggest peace on similar terms, Ugolino was less eager to accept, for the return of the Pisan prisoners, including most of the leading Ghibellines, would have diminished his power.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Ugolino, now appointed ''capitano del popolo'' for ten years, was now the most influential man in Pisa but was forced to share his power with his nephew [[Nino Visconti]], son of Giovanni. The duumvirate did not last, as Ugolino and Nino soon quarrelled.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1287, Nino, striving to become Podestà, entered into negotiations with [[Ruggieri degli Ubaldini]], Archbishop of Pisa, and the Ghibellines. Ugolino reacted by driving Nino and several Ghibelline families out of the city, destroying their palaces and occupying the town hall, where he had himself proclaimed lord of the city.

[[Image:Torre della Fame, lasinio Giovanni Paolo, 1865.jpg|thumb|200px|''Torre della Muda'', [[Giovanni Paolo Lasinio]], engravings dated 1865.]] 

In April of that year, Ugolino again refused to make peace with Genoa, even though the enemy was willing to be content itself with financial reparations. Ugolino still feared the return of the captured Pisans, who saw Ugolino as the cause for their prolonged captivity and had sworn to get their revenge for this.

In 1288, Pisa was hit by a dramatic increase in prices, resulting in food shortage and riots among the bitter populace. During one of these riots, Ugolino killed a nephew of the Archbishop, turning the latter against him. On 1 July 1288, after leaving a council-meeting discussing peace with Genoa, Ugolino and his followers were attacked by a band of armed Ghibellines. Ugolino withdrew into the town hall and repelled all attacks. The Archbishop, accusing Ugolino of treachery, aroused the citizens. When the town hall was set on fire, Ugolino surrendered. While his illegitimate son was killed, Ugolino himself – together with his sons Gaddo and Uguccione and his grandsons Nino (surnamed "the Brigand") and Anselmuccio – were detained in the [[Torre dei Gualandi|Muda]], a tower belonging to the [[Gualandi]] family.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In March 1289, on orders of the Archbishop, who had proclaimed himself podestà, the keys were thrown into the [[Arno]] river and the prisoners left to starve.

Their corpses were buried in the cloister of Saint Francis Church and remained there until 1902, when they were exhumed and transferred to the Gherardesca family chapel.

==Literary afterlife==

The historical details of the episode are still involved in some obscurity, and although mentioned by [[Giovanni Villani|Villani]] and other writers, it owes its fame entirely to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Dante's account has been paraphrased by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in the [[The Monk's Prologue and Tale|Monk's Tale]] of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', as well as by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]] also recounts the legend in his poem "Ugolino" found in his 1979 book ''Field Work''. [[Giovanni Pascoli]] writes of Ugolino in 'Conte Ugolino', a poem from his [[Primi Poemetti]].

===Ugolino in Dante's ''Inferno''===
[[File:Inf. 33 Conte Ugolino, Priamo della Quercia .jpg|thumb|''Dante and Virgil in the Inferno before Ugolino and His Sons'' by [[Priamo della Quercia]] (15th century)]]
Dante placed Ugolino and [[Ruggieri degli Ubaldini|Ruggieri]] in the ice of the second ring (Antenora) of the lowest circle of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which is reserved for betrayers of kin, country, guests, and benefactors.

Ugolino's punishment involves his being entrapped in ice up to his neck in the same hole with his betrayer, Archbishop Ruggieri, who left him to starve to death. Ugolino is constantly gnawing at Ruggieri's [[Human skull|skull]]. As Dante describes it, 
{{commons category|Inferno Canto 32}}
{{cquote|
:I saw two shades frozen in a single hole
:packed so close, one head hooded the other one;
:the way the starving devour their bread, the soul
:above had clenched the other with his teeth
:where the brain meets the nape.
::(Canto XXXII, lines 124–29)&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;Alighieri, Dante. ''The Inferno''.  Translated and edited by Robert Pinsky. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ugolino's gnawing of Ruggieri's head has been interpreted as meaning that Ugolino's hatred for his enemy is so strong that he is compelled to "devour even what has no substance."&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Ferrante. ''The Political Vision of the Divine Comedy''. Princeton University Press (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Ugolino, though punished for his betrayal of his people, is allowed some closure for the betrayal that he himself was forced to suffer under Ruggieri, when he is allowed to act as Ruggieri's torturer for eternity. According to Frances Yates, both are "suffering the torments of the damned in the traitors' hell; but Ugolino is given the right to oppress ... Archbishop Ruggieri with a ghastly eternal punishment which fits his crime."&lt;ref&gt;Frances A. Yates. "Transformations of Dante's Ugolino". ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 14(1/2) (1951), p.&amp;nbsp;92–117. [[doi:10.2307/750354]]. [[JSTOR]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/750354 750354].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ugolino and his children===

[[Image:Blake Hell 33 Ugolino.jpg|thumb|Ugolino and his sons in their cell, as painted by [[William Blake]] circa 1826.]]
{{commons category|Inferno Canto 33}}
[[File:Ugolino and his Sons Starving to Death in the Tower 1806 1a.jpg|thumb| [[Henry Fuseli]] – ''Ugolino and his Sons Starving to Death in the Tower'' (1806)]] 
According to Dante, the prisoners were slowly starved to death and before dying Ugolino's children begged him to eat their bodies.

{{cquote|
:'Father our pain', they said,
:'Will lessen if you eat us you are the one
:Who clothed us with this wretched flesh: we plead
:For you to be the one who strips it away'.
::(Canto XXXIII, ln. 56–59)}}

{{cquote|
:… And I,
:Already going blind, groped over my brood
:Calling to them, though I had watched them die,
:For two long days. And then the hunger had more
:Power than even sorrow over me
::(Canto XXXIII, ln. 70–73)&lt;ref name="Pinsky"/&gt;}}

Ugolino's statement that hunger proved stronger than grief has been interpreted in two ways, either that Ugolino devoured his offspring's corpses after being driven mad with hunger, or that starvation killed him after he had failed to die of grief. The first and more ghastly of these interpretations has proved the more popular and resonant. For this reason Ugolino is known as the "Cannibal Count" and is often depicted gnawing at his own fingers ("eating of his own flesh") in consternation, as in the sculpture ''[[The Gates of Hell]] ''by [[Auguste Rodin]], in ''Ugolino and his Sons'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] and in other artwork, though this may also simply refer to Ugolino's own statement in the poem that he gnawed his fingers in grief.

Ugolino is referred to in [[José Saramago]]'s novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'', in which the protagonist opines that suitable name for a foxhound bitch that has been found eating its own young from two different litters would be Ugolina, mentioning the ''History of the Guelphs and Ghibellines'' and the ''Divine Comedy'' as references to Ugolino della Gherardesca's having eaten his children and grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;José Saramago, ''The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'', p. 18f.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ugolino in Borges===
The case of Ugolino and Ruggiero is behind the story of the short story "[[The Wait (short story)|The Wait]]" (La espera) of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in the collection named The Aleph (El Aleph) (1949).

==Scientific analysis of the remains==

In 2002, [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Francesco Mallegni]] conducted [[DNA]] testing on the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children. His analysis agrees with the remains being a father, his sons and his grandsons. Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca family leave Mallegni about 98 percent sure that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the [[forensic]] analysis discredits the allegation of [[cannibalism]]. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat in the months before his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and is believed to have been in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Martinelli, [http://nicolemartinelli.com/wordpress/wp-content/ugolino2.pdf "Dante and the Cannibal Count"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106104524/http://nicolemartinelli.com/wordpress/wp-content/ugolino2.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'' (1 February 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Mallegni, M. Luisa Ceccarelli Lemut. ''Il conte Ugolino di Donoratico tra antropologia e storia'' (2003). {{ISBN|978-8884920591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Paola Benigni, superintendent to the Archival Heritage of Tuscany, disputed Mallegni's findings in an article, claiming that the documents assigning the burial to Ugolino and his descendants were [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist-era]] forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Benigni, Massimo Becattini.

'''Ättestupa''' ({{Language with name/for||Swedish|kin/clan precipice}}) is the mythical practice of [[senicide]] during Nordic prehistoric times: elderly people are said to have thrown themselves, or were thrown, to their deaths. According to legend, this was done when the old people were unable to support themselves or assist in a household. Even though there are many places in the [[Nordic countries]] that are said to have been used as ättestupa, today it is not thought that the practice actually existed, but that the notion of ättestupa is a persistent myth.

==Descriptions==
Suicide precipices are mentioned in several sources from antiquity, e.g. [[Procopius]] in his description of the [[Heruli]] from the 6th century CE. [[Caius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] wrote about the happy [[hyperborean]]s at the [[North Pole]] where it is daylight for half a year between the [[vernal equinox]] to the [[autumnal equinox]], and described the climate as being so healthy that the people there didn't die but threw themselves from a precipice into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=[[Caius Julius Solinus]] 
|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus2.html#XVII 
|title=De Hyperboreis, et Hyperboreæ regionibus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden the term ''ättestupa'' was rediscovered in the 17th century when the old [[Icelandic saga]] ''[[Gautreks saga]]'', in which ''Ætternisstapi'' ("Släktklippan"&lt;ref name=noreen&gt;[[Adolf Noreen]], [http://runeberg.org/nfar/0276.html Ättestupa]&lt;/ref&gt;) is mentioned, was translated to Swedish and published. The saga is the only known occurrence of the word ''ætternisstapi''&lt;ref name=noreen /&gt; making it a [[hapax legomenon]]. The Swedish linguist [[Adolf Noreen]] started questioning the myth at the end of the 19th century&lt;ref name="noreen" /&gt; and it is now generally accepted among researchers that the practice of suicide precipices never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The term ''ättestupa'' has been used often in modern times, in political contexts, to underline how bad an insufficiently funded [[social security]] program can be, especially for [[retiree]]s. In the 1960s, the Swedish comedy radio program ''[[Mosebacke Monarki]]'' satirically introduced ättestupa, abbreviated ÄTP, as an alternative to [[Allmän tilläggspension|ATP]], a state-provided [[pension]].

==Associated locations==
Several places in the Nordic countries are alleged to be former suicide precipices:
* [[Ramberget, Hisingen|Keillers Park]] in [[Göteborg]] has a precipice called Ättestupan.
* A part of the village [[Åby, Norrköping Municipality|Åby]] outside of [[Norrköping]] was called Ättetorp, and in the nearby forest there is a precipice called Ättestupan.
* Precipices at [[Vargön]] and close to the lake [[Vristulven]] in [[Västergötland]].
* Ättestupeberget at Långared ([[Alingsås kommun]], Västergötland) (RT 90: X=6431606, Y=1297860)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Svenska Ortnamn (CD-skiva utgiven av Sveriges Släktforskarförbund)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kullberget in [[Hällefors]] ([[Örebro län]]) is locally called "ättestupan".
* [[Olofströms kommun]] between [[Olofström]] - Gaslunda, by the lake Orlunden.
* The western cliff faces of [[Omberg]] in [[Östergötland]] are said to be an ättestupa.

== Depictions in modern culture ==

=== Television series ===
* In Episode 1 ''of [[Norsemen (TV series)|Norsemen]]'', a 2016 [[Norway|Norwegian]] comedy TV series about a group of [[Vikings]] living in the village of Norheim around the year 790, a comedic depiction of this practice is shown. A number of older men who are expected to perform the ''ättestupa'' refuse to do so after witnessing the results after the first man in line does so.
