      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">'''Albert Pallavicini''' ({{lang-it|Alberto Pallavicini}}) was the fifth [[marquess of Bodonitsa]] from his father's death until his own in 1311. His father was [[Thomas Pallavicini|Thomas]], a great-nephew of the first marquess, [[Guy Pallavicini|Guy]]. Albert married [[Maria dalle Carceri]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] noblewoman from [[Euboea]]. He even obtained [[Triarchy of Negroponte|a sixth]] of that island.

He was a loyal vassal of the [[Prince of Achaea|princes of Achaea]]. In 1305, he was summoned by his lord [[Philip I of Piedmont|Philip of Savoy]] to a [[tournament]] and [[parliament]] on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. In 1307, he obeyed the similar summons of [[Philip I of Taranto]]. On 15 March 1311, he followed [[Walter V of Brienne]] into the [[Battle of the Cephissus]], but did not emerge alive. By the ''[[Assizes of Romania]]'', his fief was inherited by his widow and his daughter, [[Guglielma Pallavicini|Guglielma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4051">"'''Allogamy'''" ('''cross-fertilization''') is a term used in the field of [[biological reproduction]] describing the [[fertilization]] of an [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. By contrast, [[autogamy]] is the term used for self-fertilization. In humans, the fertilization event is an instance of allogamy. Self-fertilization occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual. This is common in [[plant]]s (see [[Sexual reproduction in plants]]) and certain [[protozoa]]ns.

In plants, allogamy is used specifically to mean the use of [[pollen]] from one plant to fertilize the [[flower]] of another plant and usually synonymous with the term "cross-fertilization" or "cross-pollination" ([[outcrossing]]), though the latter term can be used more specifically to mean pollen exchange between different [[Strain (biology)|plant strains]] or even different plant species (where the term ''cross-hybridization'' can be used) rather than simply between different individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[Parasite]]s having complex [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] can pass through alternate stages of allogamous and autogamous reproduction, and the description of a hitherto unknown allogamous stage can be a significant finding with implications for human disease.

==Avoidance of inbreeding depression==
Allogamy ordinarily involves cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals leading to the masking of deleterious recessive [[allele]]s in progeny.&lt;ref name="pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Adv. Genet. |volume=24 |issue= |pages=323–70 |year=1987 |pmid= |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michod, R.E. (1994). "Eros and Evolution: A Natural Philosophy of Sex" Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.  {{ISBN|978-0201442328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, close inbreeding, including self-fertilization in plants and automictic parthenogenesis in hymenoptera, tends to lead to the harmful expression of deleterious recessive alleles ([[inbreeding depression]]).

In dioecious plants, the stigma may receive pollen from several different potential donors.  As multiple pollen tubes from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the ovary, the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants.&lt;ref name=Teixeira&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira S, Foerster K, Bernasconi G |title=Evidence for inbreeding depression and post-pollination selection against inbreeding in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=101–12 |year=2009 |pmid=18698334 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.86 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus post-pollination selection may occur in order to promote allogamy and avoid inbreeding depression.  Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.&lt;ref name=Teixeira /&gt;

==Education and career==
Dufourmantelle was educated at [[Brown University]] and at [[Paris-Sorbonne University]], where she earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1994.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40703606 |title=French philosopher Dufourmantelle drowns rescuing children |publisher=[[BBC news]] |date=24 July 2017 |accessdate=25 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She practised [[psychoanalysis]] and was a professor at the [[European Graduate School]]&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Held |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/24/539056481/french-philosopher-who-promoted-risk-taking-dies-attempting-water-rescue |title=French Philosopher Who Promoted Risk-Taking Dies Attempting Water Rescue |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=24 July 2017 |accessdate=25 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a contributor to ''[[La Libération]]''.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;

Her philosophical work focused on risk taking, which she argued was essential, saying that "absolute security - like 'zero risk' - is a fantasy"&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  and that "[R]eal danger must be faced in order to survive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerretsen|first1=Isabelle|title=French philosopher who said 'real danger must be faced in order to survive' drowns rescuing children|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/french-philosopher-who-said-real-danger-must-be-faced-order-survive-drowns-rescuing-children-1631713|accessdate=24 July 2017|agency=World|publisher=International Business Times|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Éloge du risque'' or ''Praise of Risk'' was published in 2011.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Death==
She died on July 21, 2017 at Pampelonne beach in Ramatuelle near the city of [[Saint-Tropez]], while trying to rescue two children caught in the Mediterranean when the water became dangerously turbulent. The children were rescued by lifeguards and survived, but Dufourmantelle could not be resuscitated.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Roisin|title=Anne Dufourmantelle dead: French philosopher who wrote book on risk-taking dies rescuing children|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/anne-dufourmantelle-dead-mort-french-philosopher-drowned-dies-saving-children-riviera-st-tropez-a7857206.html|accessdate=24 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Dufourmantelle won the Prix Raymond de Boyer de Sainte-Suzanne from the [[Académie française]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="academiefrancaiseprix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Raymond de Boyer de Sainte-Suzanne|url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/prix-raymond-de-boyer-de-sainte-suzanne|publisher=[[Académie française]]|accessdate=24 July 2017 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">'''Dr. Benjamin Hayes Dougan''' (June 22, 1867 - January 1, 1940) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[physician]] and [[politician]] in the [[New Brunswick|Province of New Brunswick]]. Known by his middle name, in the [[Canada 1901 Census|1901 Canadian census]], he is listed as Hazen Dugan. At census time, he was at his future in-laws home in [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]. In 1906, he married Blanch M. Slipp (1878–1959).

Dougan became a medical doctor and he and his wife made their home in [[Harvey Station, New Brunswick]]. In 1924, he gained wide recognition as the Province's [[coroner]] who conducted the inquiry into the sensational shooting deaths of two young female siblings in [[Fosterville, New Brunswick]]. Capitalizing on his celebrity following the January 1925 trial and conviction of [[Darius H. Thornton]] for the double murders, in the August [[New Brunswick general election, 1925|provincial election]] Dougan was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Conservative Party]] candidate in the multiple-member riding of [[York County, New Brunswick|New Brunswick]]. He was reelected in [[New Brunswick general election, 1930|1930]] and served until June 27, 1939.

Benjamin Hayes Dougan died in 1940. He and his wife are buried in the [[Fredericton Rural Cemetery]].

'''Barbara Jane Harrison''' [[George Cross|GC]] (24 May 1945&amp;nbsp;– 8 April 1968), known as '''Jane Harrison''',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ashcroft, ''George Cross Heroes'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[flight attendant]], one of four women to have been awarded the [[George Cross]] for heroism&lt;ref&gt;Other women have received awards that were later replaced by the GC for actions in peacetime&lt;/ref&gt; and the only woman awarded the medal for gallantry in peacetime (the other three female George Cross recipients served with the [[Special Operations Executive]] in occupied France during the [[Second World War]]).

==Early life==
Harrison was born on 24 May 1945 at the family home in Kingsdale Crescent, [[Bradford]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to Lena and Alan Harrison. She was their second child, another daughter, Susan Elizabeth, having been born in 1941. Harrison attended Greystones School, Bradford. The family later moved to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], where Harrison attended Newby County Primary School. In 1955 her mother died. She passed her [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]] and attended [[Graham School|Scarborough Girls' High School]]. In 1961, her father moved to [[Doncaster]]. Harrison stayed on at Scarborough to complete her [[GCE Ordinary Level|O levels]] before joining her father in the summer of 1961. She then attended [[Doncaster High School]] until Easter, 1962.&lt;ref name=OttawayC1&gt;{{cite book | first =Susan | last =Ottaway | authorlink = | year =2008 | month = | title =Fire over Heathrow, The Tragedy of Flight 712 | chapter =Chapter 1 | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =1–9| publisher =Pen and Sword Books | location =Barnsley |isbn=978-1-84415-739-6 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving school, Harrison worked at [[Martins Bank]] from 1962 until 1964, then took a job as a [[nanny]] for a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] farmer in the [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] in order to improve her French. She later took another job as a nanny in [[San Francisco]]. While in San Francisco she applied for a job as a [[flight attendant]] with [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC), and she joined BOAC in May 1966. 

After completing her training, Harrison was assigned work onboard BOAC's [[Boeing 707]] fleet. She moved to Emperor's Gate, [[Kensington]], [[London]], where she shared a flat with other BOAC flight attendants, and purchased a [[Ford Anglia]] car for use in getting to work at [[Heathrow Airport]]. She also joined Universal Aunts, which provided staff to do odd jobs; one of her assignments was babysitting [[Jason Connery]], son of actor [[Sean Connery]].&lt;ref name=OttawayC3&gt;{{cite book | first =Susan | last =Ottaway | authorlink = | year =2008 | month = | title =Fire over Heathrow, The Tragedy of Flight 712 | chapter =Chapter 3 | pages = 19–40| publisher =Pen and Sword Books | location =Barnsley |isbn=978-1-84415-739-6 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While she enjoyed her job, long-haul flights with their several stopovers were exhausting, and she had told a friend she was considering quitting BOAC.{{sfn|Ottaway, p. 29}}

On 8 April 1968 Harrison was rostered at her own request to work BOAC Flight 712 Whiskey Echo long-haul to Sydney, Australia, via Zurich, Tel Aviv, Tehran, Bombay (now Mumbai), Singapore and Perth. She told a colleague that she had been invited to a wedding in Sydney, but it is possible that she wanted to see a [[Qantas]] pilot whom she had met some months before.{{sfn|Ottaway, pp. 26, 29–30}}

Harrison, aged 22, was a flight attendant on board [[BOAC Flight 712]] when it left [[Heathrow Airport]] at 16.27 BST on 8 April 1968, bound indirectly for [[Sydney]].
The citation for Harrison's George Cross recites what happened almost immediately after takeoff:
{{quote|
No. 2 engine of B.O.A.C. Boeing 707 G-ARWE caught fire and subsequently fell from the aircraft, leaving a fierce fire burning at No. 2 engine position. About two and a half minutes later the aircraft made an emergency landing at the airport and the fire on the port wing intensified. Miss Harrison was one of the stewardesses in this aircraft and the duties assigned to her in an emergency were to help the steward at the aft station to open the appropriate rear door and inflate the escape chute and then to assist the passengers at the rear of the aircraft to leave in an orderly manner. When the aircraft landed, Miss Harrison and the steward concerned opened the rear galley door and inflated the chute, which unfortunately became twisted on the way down so that the steward had to climb down it to straighten it before it could be used. Once out of the aircraft he was unable to return; hence Miss Harrison was left alone to the task of shepherding passengers to the rear door and helping them out of the aircraft. She encouraged some passengers to jump from the machine and pushed out others. With flames and explosions all around her, making an escape from the tail of the machine impossible, she directed her passengers to another exit while she remained at her post. She was finally overcome while trying to save an elderly cripple who was seated in one of the last rows and whose body was found close to that of the stewardess. Miss Harrison was a very brave young lady who gave her life in her utter devotion to duty.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;}}

According to witnesses, after the escape chute had been burnt away Harrison continued to force passengers to safety by pushing them out the starboard rear door, even as "flames and smoke [were] licking around her face".{{refn|Ottaway, pp. 72–74, p. 136}}
She then seemed to be preparing to jump but instead turned back inside;{{sfn|Ottaway, pp. 76, 77}} there was another explosion and she was not seen alive again.{{refn| Ottaway, p. 131}} Her body was later found with four others near the rear door;{{refn|Ottaway, p. 91}} all had died from "asphyxia due to inhalation of fire fumes".{{refn|Ottaway, p. 151}}

[[Anthony Crosland]] ([[President of the Board of Trade]] and the minister responsible for civil aviation) later wrote of Harrison's "lonely and courageous action" and "devotion to duty, in the highest traditions of her calling".{{sfn|Ottaway, p. 139}}

In August 1969 Harrison became the only woman to receive the George Cross in peacetime,&lt;ref name="GCDB"&gt;{{cite web

==Memorials==

The "Barbara Jane Harrison, GC, Memorial Fund" was set up in October 1969 with the aim of raising [[Pound Sterling|£]]1,000 by October 1970. Almost £1,500 was raised which was used to buy a computer for the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]], London, for use by the [[muscular dystrophy]] laboratories for research into the disease.&lt;ref name=OttawayC11&gt;{{cite book | first =Susan | last =Ottaway | authorlink = | year =2008 | month = | title =Fire over Heathrow, The Tragedy of Flight 712 | chapter =Chapter 11| editor = | others = | edition = | pages =157–63 |publisher =Pen and Sword Books | location =Barnsley |isbn=978-1-84415-739-6 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is awarded to the best student on a Diploma in Aviation Medicine course whose first language is not [[English language|English]]. The prize is now under the remit of the Department of Aviation Medicine at [[King's College, London]].
Since 2010, the Barbara Harrison Memorial Prize is awarded to the student of the Diploma in Aviation Medicine Course "who has demonstrated commitment to others and determination to succeed through the course and in gaining the Diploma".

Also in 1970, a plaque memorial was unveiled in [[St George's Interdenominational Chapel, Heathrow Airport|St. George's Interdenominational Chapel]] in [[Heathrow Airport]] dedicated to Harrison.

A plaque remembering Harrison is on the churchyard wall of St Laurence's Church, Scalby, Scarborough.  

Harrison's bravery is also commemorated with a memorial window in [[Bradford City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8187305.Barbara___s_bravery_honoured_in_book/ | title=Bradford air stewardess included in national biography | work=Bradford Telegraph and Argus | date=27 May 2010 | accessdate=3 June 2014 | first=Will |last=Kilner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black beetle virus''' ('''BBV''') is a [[virus]] that was initially discovered on the north island of New Zealand in Hellensville in dead New Zealand black beetles (''[[Heteronychus arator]]'') in 1975

==History and general information==
[[File:Heteronychus_arator01.jpg|thumb|220px|''Heteronychus arator'' African black beetle]]
BBV is recognized as a member of a group of small split [[arboviruses]] from the same line as [[Nodamura virus]] which was discovered 20 years prior to BBV in Japan. The [[genome]]s of these viruses are unusually small compared to others such as [[picornavirus|picorna]] and [[retroviruses]]. Because the virus only has 2 initial [[RNA]]s, this is the simplest class of virus. It should be noted that there is an RNA 3 that does appear only in infected [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friesen |first1=Paul |title=BlackBeetleVirus:PropagationinDrosophilaLine1Cells andanInfection-ResistantSublineCarryingEndogenous BlackBeetleVirus-RelatedParticles |journal=Journal of Virology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=741–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
BBV has only been shown to infect insect cells. When transmitted to [[wax moth]] larvae, it can cause paralysis; however it cannot replicate in mammalian cells like other viruses in its family. Viruses such as Nodamura Virus and [[Flock house virus]] have been shown to infect mammals and fishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maramorosch|first1=Karl|title=Advances in Virus Research|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0080583402|date=1998-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
BBV comes from the family of [[Nodaviridae]] that contains nine different viruses divided into two different sub groups: [[Alphanodavirus]] and [[Betanodavirus]]. BBV falls into the Alphanodavirus group along with Nodavirus. These viruses are non-enveloped, with [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] geometries, and [[Capsid#Icosahedral|T]]=3 symmetry. Their diameter is typically around 30&amp;nbsp;nm with BBV's being 32.4&amp;nbsp;nm. The virus genomes are linear and segmented, bipartite, around 21.4kb in length as well.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alphanodaviruses|url=http://viralzone.expasy.org/611?outline=all_by_species |website=Viralzone |publisher=Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alphanodaviruses life cycles begin with penetration into the host cell. Once in the [[cytoplasm]], RNA is transcribed within envagininations of the host cell using its own [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|RNA dependent polymerase]]. To release, the virus causes lysis of the host cell from which copies of newly made virus are released.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Viral classification==
BBV is a [[Virus#Genome|(+)ssRNA]] virus from the family Nodaviridae and of the genus Alphanodavirus. The two other viruses within the Nodaviridae are Noramura virus and Flock House virus. Each member of the Nodaviridae is then classified as either an alpha or beta-nodavirus with BBV being an alphanodavirus. BBV, Flock House, and nodavirus are all group IV viruses with varying abilities to infect other animals in terms of species specificity.

==Viral structure==
The structure of BBV is similar to the other viruses in its family. BBV is made of a non-enveloped virion that has a diameter of approximately 32.4&amp;nbsp;nm. The virion is made up of 180 copies of a single viral coating protein. The virion is organized in T=3 icosahedral symmetry, meaning there are 60 triangular subunits each made up of 3 viral capsid proteins. The virion contains both RNA1 and RNA2 inside of it, but RNA3 is not included into the virion and is transcribed after infection of a host cell. RNA3 is not necessary for replication, however it is coded for with RNA1 making it always synthesized.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friesen|first1=Paul|title=BlackBeetleVirus:PropagationinDrosophilaLine1Cells andanInfection-ResistantSublineCarryingEndogenous BlackBeetleVirus-RelatedParticles|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=35|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viral genome==
The BBV insect virus genome is made of two mRNA molecules encapsidated in a single virion. The nucleotide sequence of BBV RNA1 is 3015 bases long, this along with RNA2's 1399 base pairs completes the viral genome. The genome of BBV and other viruses in its family are incredibly small, nearly half the size of picornaviruses, making it the smallest class of virus with a segmented genome.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The RNA1 sequence contains a 5' region of 38 nucleotides with no coding role. It also contains a coding region for protein A, which is used in RNA synthesis.Also a 3' proximal region encoding RNA3 (389 bases)is overlapped within the RNA1 sequence. RNA3 is a subgenomic messenger RNA made in infected cells but not encapsidated into the original virions. The RNA3 sequence begins inside the coding region of protein A and also forms protein B from its own frames. RNA1 and RNA2 seem to be fairly independent of each other, except for their ability to bond when forming the capsid. RNA2 is also found to suppress the function of RNA3, which could be a marker to begin capsid construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bimalendu|first1=Dasmahapatra|title=Structure of the black beetle virus genome and its functional implications|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=182|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maramorosch|first1=Karl|title=Advances in Virus Research|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viral replication==
The genome and viral messenger for (+)ssRNA noroviridae viruses is the initial virion RNA. RNA1 sequence encodes for the virus' RNA-dependand RNA polymerase which is protein A. Thee virion also contains code for RNA2 which forms a precursor protein for capsid formation. RNA3 is also formed in infected cells from RNA1 sequence, and is inhibited by RNA2 though independently coded. RNA3 encodes for proteins B! and B2. B1 is used as the end terminal for RNA replicase, but the function is to totally clear. B2 is a separate unique protein which also has an unknown use. When tested, neither B1 or B2 was necessary for replication, however the new genotypes did not match exactly with the wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maramorosch|first1=Karl|title=Advances in Viral Research|publisher=Academic Press|pages=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cell entry ===
Not much information is known on the infection and replication cycle of BBV. However, it is respectively assumed to follow the path of other viruses of the same family.

The cell will first enter the cell via penetration of the membrane. Once in the cell, the virus uncoats itself and releases the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm of the cell. Typically, Nodaviridae will form an invagination within the membrane of the host cell mitochondria where it will prepare to replicate.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nodaviridae|url=http://viralzone.expasy.org/47|publisher=Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Replication and transcription ===
Once set in the invagination, RNA1 is transcribed, thus allowing for the RNA-dependent polymerase to be synthesized. The space occupied by the virus is then known as a cytoplasmic viral factory in which the virus uses the host cell machinery to continue replication of RNA strands that will then be turned into dsRNA. The dsRNA is then finally transcribed or replicated into either viral mRNA or more ssRNA to be replicated again.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Viral assembly and release ===
Once RNA2 is synthesized, the virus then prepares for assembly. When the ratio of ribosomes to N proteins becomes favorable to switch to capsid formation, the virus spontaneously assembles around RNA1 and RNA2 into an icosahedral capsid leaving the previously synthesized RNA3 outside of the capsid. Once Capsid maturation occurs via autoproteolytic cleavage of capsid protein alpha, capsid protein beta and peptide gamma are formed. Peptide gamma is assumed to be released in the endosome where it disrupts the endosomal membrane allowing the new viral RNA to be released into the cytoplasm of the cell creating the new infected cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UniProtKB - P04329 (CAPSD_BBV)|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04329|website=UniProt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host interaction==
Although BBV has been shown to infect multiple types of insect cells, it has only been seen in the wild to infect ''[[Heteronychus arator]]'' - the New Zealand black beetle. The virus is able to kill the host organism, and plays a key role in suppressing the population of black beetles when they verge on overpopulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maramorosch|first1=Karl|title=Advances in Virus Research|publisher=Academic Press|edition=Volume 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bummer and Lazarus''' were two stray dogs that roamed the streets of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, in the early 1860s. Recognized for their unique bond and their prodigious rat-killing ability, they became a fixture of city newspapers, were exempted from local ordinances, and immortalized in cartoons.

==Background==
San Francisco, in common with other cities in the United States at the time, had a problem with free-ranging dogs. In [[Los Angeles]] in the 1840s, dogs outnumbered people by nearly two to one, and while the situation in San Francisco had not reached this extreme, the large numbers of strays and feral dogs did cause problems. Dogs were regularly poisoned or trapped and killed. Nevertheless, if a dog turned out to be a good [[ratter]] or distinguished itself in some other way, it was still possible for it to survive.&lt;ref name="Derr147"&gt;Derr p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Meeting and career===

Bummer was a black-and-white [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] or Newfoundland [[Dog hybrids and crossbreeds|cross]] who established himself outside the [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] of Frederick Martin in 1860 and quickly proved to be an exceptional rat-killer.&lt;ref name="Derr147" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conviss p.14&lt;/ref&gt; His ratting talent spared him the fate of the former owner of the territory, Bruno, who had been poisoned with [[strychnine]] shortly before Bummer's arrival. He scraped a living begging scraps from passers-by and the patrons of the saloon and other establishments along Montgomery Street.
[[File:Bummerandlazarus3.jpg|left|thumb|''Ambling Down Montgomery Street''. Joshua A. Norton, Bummer and Lazarus  are accompanied by "[[Frederick Coombs|George Washington II]]" another local eccentric.]]
In 1861 Bummer rescued another dog from a fight with a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not expected to live. Bummer coaxed him to eat, brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following Bummer as he made his begging rounds in the streets. His remarkable recovery earned him the name [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and he proved to be an even more prodigious ratter than Bummer. As a team they turned out to be exceptional, once finishing off 85 rats in 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="Derr147" /&gt;

Their ratting talent and unique bond was seized upon by the city's press. Martin's saloon was a favorite haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the ''Californian'', ''Daily Alta California'', ''Daily Morning Call'', and ''Daily Evening Bulletin'',&lt;ref name="Derr148"&gt;Derr p.148&lt;/ref&gt; the editors vying with each other in their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast in the role of the sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.&lt;ref name="Derr148" /&gt;

The two dogs had the run of the streets, and when, on June 14, 1862, Lazarus was taken by a new [[Animal control officer|dog catcher]], a mob of angry citizens demanded his release, petitioning to have the pair declared city property so they could wander the streets unmolested. The city supervisors released Lazarus and declared he and Bummer were exempt from the city ordinance against strays. A week later the two were reported to have stopped a runaway horse. Despite their reputations, the two could be vicious: Bummer was a sheep killer and regularly fought other dogs in the street, occasionally assisted by Lazarus (although normally Lazarus would restrict himself to barking encouragement). They also ransacked shops when they had entered unnoticed and had been locked in by the owners.&lt;ref name="Derr148" /&gt;

===Emperor Norton===
The two dogs were sometimes seen in the company of the "Emperor of the United States", the eccentric [[Emperor Norton|Joshua A. Norton]], and a popular legend made him their owner. However, no contemporary records make any mention of Norton being the owner and only one newspaper report made any connection between him and the dogs.&lt;ref name="Truth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscomemoirs.com/b_and_l_truth.html|title=Bummer and Lazarus: the truth|author=Malcolm E. Barker| accessdate = 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumor may have arisen because the cartoonist [[Edward Jump]] frequently featured the three together, most notably in ''The Three Bummers'' which showed Norton eating from a heavily laden buffet table while the dogs wait patiently for scraps. Norton was apparently outraged when he saw the picture displayed in a shop-front window: the imperial dignity was affronted by the depiction of His Majesty in the company of lowly dogs.&lt;ref name="Truth" /&gt; Despite the apparent antipathy felt by Norton for the dogs, the close association was still being claimed in the 1950s:

===Death of Lazarus===
[[File:Lazarus2.jpg|thumb|right|Lazarus' funeral as depicted by Jump. At the rear of the cortege is the dogcatcher in his cart. "Emperor" [[Joshua A. Norton|Norton]] presides over the service.]]
Lazarus was killed in October 1863. In the ''San Francisco Kaleidoscope'', [[Samuel Dickson (writer)|Dickson]] claimed he was kicked by the horse of one of the city's [[Fire apparatus|fire engine]]s,&lt;ref name="VMSF" /&gt; but contemporary accounts say he was poisoned by being given meat laced with "ratbane" after biting a boy.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} San Franciscans put up a $50 reward for the capture of the poisoner. A wit suggested that he be buried in a place of honor alongside other great men of the city. Jump produced a cartoon of his "Funeral" with Norton as the Pope performing the ceremony and [[Frederick Coombs|Freddy Coombs]]—another San Francisco eccentric who claimed to be the reincarnation of [[George Washington]]—digging the grave. Notable San Franciscans formed the [[cortège]] and Bummer looked on mournfully. This may have led to the rumor that large numbers of San Franciscans turned out for Lazarus' funeral.&lt;ref name="3b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/nortpic3.html|title=The Three Bummers|publisher=Tales from Colma|year=1997|accessdate = 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog was not buried though, but stuffed by a [[taxidermist]] and displayed behind the bar in Martin's saloon. (According to Dickson, Martin paid the taxidermist $50 to turn the dog over—even though its remains had already been claimed by the city council.) The ''Daily Evening Bulletin'' featured a long obituary entitled "Lament for Lazarus" in which they praised the virtues of both dogs and recounted their various adventures together.&lt;ref name="Derr148" /&gt;

===Death of Bummer===

Bummer continued alone, although [[Mark Twain]] reported a year later in the ''Daily Morning Call'' that he had taken a small black puppy under his wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twainquotes.com/18640731b.html|title=Another Lazarus|author=Mark Twain|publisher=''Californian''|date=31 July 1864|accessdate = 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more was heard of the puppy and without his companion, Lazarus, Bummer was of less interest to the press. He died a lingering death in November 1865 after being kicked by a drunk, Henry Rippey. Bummer was still popular enough that, to avoid violence, the city immediately arrested Rippey. He also did not escape popular justice: on learning of his crime, his cellmate, David Popley, "popped him in the smeller".&lt;ref name="3b" /&gt;
[[File:Bummerandlazarus11.jpg|thumb|right|Bummer lies in state. This cartoon of Jump's was accompanied by a long satirical eulogy.]]
Bummer's passing did not make the headlines in the same way that Lazarus' death had, but Jump created a new cartoon showing him lying in state while Lazarus tucked into a table of food in the ether above him and rats paid their respects. Mark Twain produced a eulogy for him in the ''Virginia City Enterprise'' which was reprinted in the ''Californian'' on 11 November 1865:

{{quote|text=The old vagrant 'Bummer' is really dead at last; and although he was always more respected than his obsequious vassal, the dog 'Lazarus,' his exit has not made half as much stir in the newspaper world as signalised the departure of the latter. I think it is because he died a natural death: died with friends around him to smooth his pillow and wipe the death-damps from his brow, and receive his last words of love and resignation; because he died full of years, and honor, and disease, and fleas. He was permitted to die a natural death, as I have said, but poor Lazarus 'died with his boots on' - which is to say, he lost his life by violence; he gave up the ghost mysteriously, at dead of night, with none to cheer his last moments or soothe his dying pains. So the murdered dog was canonized in the newspapers, his shortcomings excused and his virtues heralded to the world; but his superior, parting with his life in the fullness of time, and in the due course of nature, sinks as quietly as might the mangiest cur among us. Well, let him go. In earlier days he was courted and caressed; but latterly he has lost his comeliness - his dignity had given place to a want of self-respect, which allowed him to practice mean deceptions to regain for a moment that sympathy and notice which had become necessary to his very existence, and it was evident to all that the dog had had his day; his great popularity was gone forever. In fact, Bummer should have died sooner: there was a time when his death would have left a lasting legacy of fame to his name. Now, however, he will be forgotten in a few days. Bummer's skin is to be stuffed and placed with that of Lazarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twainquotes.com/bummer.html|title=Exit Bummer|author=Mark Twain|publisher=''Territorial Enterprise''|date=8 November 1865|accessdate = 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Mark Twain}}

Bummer was also mounted by the taxidermist and placed on display. In 1906, both specimens were donated to the [[Golden Gate Park]] museum (now the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]]) where they remained in storage until they were destroyed in 1910.&lt;ref name="ESF"&gt;{{cite web| title = Bummer and Lazarus| publisher = Encyclopedia of San Francisco| author = Malcolm E.

On 28 March 1992, a brass plaque commemorating the two dogs was placed at Transamerica Redwood Park, a small park adjacent to the base of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].&lt;ref name="ESF" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, S.J. &amp; N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau &amp; N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 76, 861–867.&lt;/ref&gt; in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Kameoka, A., D. Ito, and K. Kobayashi (2001).  “A Cross-Generation Framework for Deriving Next-Generation Innovation Model.”  Change Management and the New Industrial Revolution, IEMC ‘01 Proceedings, Albany, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cairn.info/revue-journal-of-innovation-economics-2014-3-page-59.htm Micaëlli, J., Forest, J., Coatanéa, É. &amp; Medyna, G.

CC applications link [[data analysis]] and adaptive page displays ([[Adaptive user interface|AUI]]) to adjust content for a particular type of audience. As such, CC hardware and applications strive to be more [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and more influential by design.

Some features that cognitive systems may express are:
* '''[[Adaptive system|Adaptive]]''': They may learn as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. They may resolve ambiguity and tolerate unpredictability. They may be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time, or near real time.&lt;ref name="Ferrucci"&gt;Ferrucci, D. et al. (2010) Building Watson: an overview of the DeepQA Project. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010, 59–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Interactive]]''': They may interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and [[Cloud computing|cloud services]], as well as with people.

== Cognitive analytics ==
Cognitive computing-branded technology platforms typically specialize in the processing and analysis of large, [[Unstructured data|unstructured datasets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://public.deloitte.com/media/analytics/pdfs/us_da_3min_guide_cognitive_analytics.pdf|title=Cognitive analytics - The three-minute guide|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-cognitive-analytics|title=What is cognitive analytics? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Word processing documents, emails, videos, images, audio files, presentations, webpages, social media and many other data formats often need to be manually [[Tag (metadata)|tagged with metadata]] before they can be fed to a computer for analysis and insight generation. The principal benefit of utilizing cognitive analytics over traditional big data analytics is that such datasets do not need to be pretagged.

Other characteristics of a cognitive analytics system include:
* '''Adaptability:''' cognitive analytics systems can use machine learning to adapt to different contexts with minimal human supervision
* '''Natural language interaction:''' cognitive analytics systems can be equipped with a chatbot or search assistant that understands queries, explains data insights and interacts with humans in natural language.

The '''''Cornelia B. Windiate''''' was a schooner that sank in 1875 with all hands, presumably in Lake Michigan near the [[Straits of Mackinac]].  The ship was eastbound from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].  The reason for her sinking is unknown, but she departed November 27, late in the season, and was overloaded with grain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.seahistory.org/assets/KIDS-121-35.pdf |title=Great Lakes Ghost Ship: the Cornelia B. Windiate |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1986 The Windiate was discovered by divers in Lake Huron, near [[Alpena, Michigan]], further east than expected.  The wreck is unique in that her cargo is still secure in her holds which is quite unusual for a wreck. Her masts are still standing with rigging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunderbaywrecks.com/3d-wreck-cornelia-b-windiate.php |title=Cornelia B Windiate Wreck |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5495">'''Dax Cowart''' (born 1947, [[Texas]], birth name Donald Cowart). Mr. Cowart was a United States Air Force Pilot and served during the war in Vietnam.  Mr. Cowart later changed his name to Dax S. Cowart, because of injuries sustained in a propane gas line leak.  Mr. Cowart is an American attorney noted for the ethical issues raised by efforts to sustain his life against his wishes following an accident in which he suffered severe and disabling burns over most of his body. His case is often cited in discussions of [[medical ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jonsen|first1=Albert|last2=Siegler|first2=Mark|last3=Winslade|first3=William|title=Clinical Ethics: A Practical Approach to Ethical Decisions in Clinical Medicine, Fourth Edition|url=https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/ceintro.html|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
In 1973 Cowart, then a 25-year-old Air Force reserve pilot, visited with his father a tract of land his father was considering for purchase. The land lay in a small valley and, unbeknownst to the Cowarts, a gas leak had filled the area with heavier-than-air [[propane]] gas. When the two men started their car the propane was ignited, severely burning them. Cowart's father died.

Mr. Cowart's burn injuries included loss of both hands, eyes, and ears, and two-thirds of his skin area. Dax said later:

{{blockquote|I was burned so severely and in so much pain that I did not want to live even in the early moments following the explosion. A man who heard my shouts for help came running down the road, I asked him for a gun. He said, "Why?" I said, "Can’t you see I am a dead man? I am going to die anyway. I need to put myself out of this misery." In a very kind and compassionate caring way, he said, "I can’t do that."&lt;ref name=UVA&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/uvanewsmakers/newsmakers/cowart.html University of Virginia], October 2, 2002. Retrieved March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Fearing he would be unable to regain his former level of activity, he refused treatment en route to the hospital but nonetheless survived.

Mr. Cowart says that in the hospital he was "forcibly treated for 14 months" despite continually begging his doctors to end treatment and allow him to die. He likened some of the treatments{{snd}}such as bandage replacement and [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]] baths{{snd}}to being "skinned alive". He was given limited painkillers because of a poor understanding of their risks, and was denied access to legal assistance, by which he might have forced treatment to end.&lt;ref name=UVA/&gt; He attempted suicide several times.

==Later life==
Although blind, hearing impaired and without functioning hands, Mr. Cowart earned a law degree from [[Texas Tech University]] in 1986, had his own practice, later worked for Robert Hilliard, of Hilliard and Munoz, in Corpus Christi, Texas and is now retired.  Mr. Cowart changed his first name from Donald to Dax because after being repeatedly embarrassed when responding to "Donald", only to find that someone else was being addressed, and in order to be able to write his name.  &lt;ref name=UVA/&gt;

Mr. Cowart, is married to Samantha Berryessa (Cowart) a California attorney, and lives on a farm in San Diego County, California. 

Mr. Cowart has been a frequent teacher and speaker at The Trial Lawyers College in Dubois, Wyoming, started and run by the legendary attorney, Gerry Spence. Mr. Cowart has spoken on patient rights in the United States of America and abroad. 

Mr. Cowart's life and his reflections on what has happened to him continue to challenge medicine's understanding of itself as a moral practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchchannel.org/prog/displayevent.aspx?rID=3619 ResearchChannel - Dax's Story: A Severely Burned Man's Thirty-Year Odyssey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary of his plight titled ''Please Let Me Die'' was filmed in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=10105 Please Let Me Die&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with a follow-up documentary titled ''Dax's Case'' filmed in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=10114 Dax's Case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] was an opposition leader against the government of President [[Salvador Allende]] and initially supported the [[Chilean coup of 1973]] that deposed Allende and put General [[Augusto Pinochet]] in power. Frei Montalva, [[President of Chile]], died in 1982 apparently following routine surgery. 

Questions continue to surround the events that led to his death. There have been accusations that Frei was murdered with small doses of toxic substances.

==Events leading to the death==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2018}}
In 1981, Frei was suffering from [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|chronic acid reflux]], stemming from a [[Hiatus hernia|hiatal hernia]], a very uncomfortable but essentially low risk condition. After consulting with several specialists, he decided to have it treated via surgery. The surgery was performed at the Santa María Clinic in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on November 18, 1981 by a team of three surgeons: Dr Augusto Larraín Orrego, Dr Patricio Silva Garín, and Dr Ivo Eterovic. At the time, Dr Larrain was a world-renowned gastric surgeon, as well as a cousin of [[Andrés Zaldívar]], one of Frei's closest advisers.

The initial surgery was considered a success and, after a few days, Frei was discharged to continue his recovery at his home. However, Frei began experiencing fever and pain a few days later and was readmitted to the Santa María Clinic on 4 December. After a complete check, he was diagnosed with an intestinal occlusion and a partial necrosis of the small intestine. He underwent a second (corrective) surgery on 6 December, this time performed by Dr. Patricio Silva Garín.

Despite another initial bout of improvement over the next several days, Frei's health once again severely deteriorated and he was found to be suffering from septic shock and [[septicaemia]]. After suffering a complete immune system collapse, Frei died on January 22, 1982. 

At the time, his death was attributed to an infection by ''[[candida albicans]]'', contracted either during surgery or due to hospital contamination. He was buried in the [[Cementerio General de Santiago]].

==Controversy==
Frei's death is a matter of controversy due to allegations that he was poisoned by the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], the intelligence service of the military government, allegedly using a toxin produced by biochemist [[Eugenio Berrios]]. After Belgian researchers from the University of Ghent reportedly found biological remnants of [[mustard gas]] in Frei's body, the former president's family filed a lawsuit, which is still pending as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6289209.stm "Ex-Chilean leader 'was murdered'"], [[BBC]], January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frei's personal doctor, Patricio Rojas, who was also his minister of Interior and minister of defense during [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]]'s administration, has denied the accusations. El Mercurio columnist Hermógenes Pérez de Arce disputes even the existence of the Belgian report, citing the denial by the University's chief of communications, Tom de Smedt, that an investigation had been done in that university.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In December 2009, six persons were arrested for their roles in the alleged assassination of Frei.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/6755282/Six-arrested-over-assassination-of-former-Chilean-president.html|title=Six arrested over assassination of former Chilean president|date=December 7, 2009|work=Telegraph Online|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Judge Alejandro Madrid based his decision on a report that determined that Frei was administered low doses of [[Thallium poisoning|thallium]] and [[mustard gas]] over an extended period while he was hospitalized at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago and that these toxic substances had the effect of decreasing Frei's immune system, making him too weak to survive his surgery".&lt;ref name=Mostrador&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2009/12/07/con-bajas-dosis-de-talio-y-gas-mostaza-durante-varios-meses-asesinaron-a-frei|title=Detalles del auto de procesamiento contra médicos que lo operaron: "Con bajas dosis de Talio y gas mostaza durante varios meses asesinaron a Frei"|work=El Mostrador|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nonetheless, the report has been widely criticized on scientific basis as well as by the medical team that participated in the surgery.&lt;ref name=Mercurio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elmercurio.com/columnasycartas/2010/01/13/caso-frei-montalva-ii-4.asp|title=Caso Frei Montalva. Carta del Dr. Fernando Orrego Vicuña|date=January 13, 2010|work=El Mercurio|location=Santiago, Chile|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Appeals Court attempted to suspend Judge Madrid from the case, while the accused were set free on bail. However, the case re-opened in 2010 after a failed attempt to disqualify Judge Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/02/10/wikileaks-us-believes-former-chilean-leader-death-to-remain-a-mystery|title=WikiLeaks: US believes former Chilean leader death “to remain a mystery”|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2013, the body of poet [[Pablo Neruda]], who died in the same hospital one day before departing for exile, was exhumed amid suspicious of foul play in his death.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

On 11 March 2006, former Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milošević]] died in his prison cell of a heart attack,&lt;ref name="ICTY300506"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/custom2/en/parkerreport.pdf "Report to the President Death of Slobodan Milosevic"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224114152/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/custom2/en/parkerreport.pdf |date=24 December 2016 }}. ICTY, 30 May 2006. p. 4 para. 3&lt;/ref&gt; while being tried for war crimes at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] in [[The Hague]], which was a major news story internationally. Milošević died a few months before the verdict was due for [[Trial of Slobodan Milošević|his four-year trial]]. It occurred shortly after the Tribunal rejected his request to seek specialized medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Moscow,&lt;ref name="ICTY230206"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/tdec/en/060223.htm "Decision on Assigned Counsel Request for Provisional Release"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224061147/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/tdec/en/060223.htm |date=24 December 2016 }}, ICTY, 23 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but the report of 30 May 2006 confirmed that he had died of natural causes and that there was "no poison or other chemical substance found in his body that contributed to the death".&lt;ref name="ICTY300506"/&gt;

==Establishment of death==
Milošević was found dead in his cell on 11 March 2006 in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention centre in the [[Scheveningen]] section of [[The Hague]]. An official in the chief prosecutor's office said that Milošević had been found at about 10 a.m. and had apparently been dead for several hours. His trial had been due to resume on 14 March with testimony from the former [[president of Montenegro]], [[Momir Bulatović]]. A request for the autopsy in the presence of a Serbian pathologist was granted, and his body was transported to the [[Dutch Forensic Institute]].

It was established that Milošević died of a heart attack. Suspicions have been voiced:

#that he was deliberately given the wrong medication, causing the heart attack (Milošević had claimed to have been given the wrong medication three days before he died).&lt;ref name="www.slobodan-milosevic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/news/sm030806.htm|title=TEXT OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC'S LETTER TO THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS|publisher=Slobodan Milosevic|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#that he took the wrong medication himself in order to worsen his condition or commit suicide. ICTY Chief Prosecutor [[Carla Del Ponte]], suggested Milošević might have committed a suicide in order to foul the court and "evade justice"; (the prosecutor, ICTY PR, some Western media, and many USA politicians)
#that he was, deliberately or through negligence, not given the standard treatment that would have prevented the heart attack. (Spanish doctors, Russian doctors, Serbian doctors, Milošević family, academician and philosopher [[Mihailo Marković]])&lt;ref name="echo.msk.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/sorokina/42410/|title=Interview: Leo Bokeria, Director of Moscow's Bakulev Heart Surgery Center|publisher=echo|date=18 March 2006|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slobodan-milosevic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/news/mm071706.htm|title=MARKO MILOSEVIC'S LETTER TO THE ORGANS OF THE ICTY AND THE UNITED NATIONS REGARDING JUDGE PARKER'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEATH OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC|publisher=Slobodan Milosevic|date=17 July 2006 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Milošević had been suffering from heart problems and [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. Initially, the Dutch coroner failed to establish the cause of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18456430%255E2703,00.html theaustralian.news.com.au]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the president of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] ordered an autopsy and a toxicological investigation. Immediately after his death was announced, rumours that Milošević had been poisoned started circulating.

==Investigation==

===12 March===
An autopsy was held in the Netherlands; its preliminary results found that Milošević had died of [[myocardial infarction]], the scientific term for a heart attack. The Tribunal warned that it was impossible to rule out poisoning at the time of their statement, as the toxicological tests had not been completed. The Tribunal had denied Milošević's request for travel to Russia for specialist medical treatment. He planned to appeal against this decision, saying that his condition was worsening. Shortly before his death, Milošević complained about wrong medical treatment to Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]]. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it received the letter from Milošević with his medical complaints. In the letter as provided by Milošević's lawyer Zdenko Tomanović,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/03/russia-confirms-milosevic-letter-wants.php|title=Russia confirms Milosevic letter|publisher=Pittsburg University|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926215322/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/03/russia-confirms-milosevic-letter-wants.php|archivedate=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milošević complained that he was being given a drug used against tuberculosis and leprosy, and that it was done in secrecy and without him (Milošević) knowing anything about it. In his hand written letter to Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]], Milošević said he never used any drugs on his own, nor he was ill and in need to take medicines: 

{{quote|[...] I never used any kind of antibiotic during this 5 years that I'm in their prison. Throughout this whole period, neither have I had any kind of infectious illness (apart from flu).}}

Milošević complained, in the same letter, that even though the medical report containing information about the fact the drug against leprosy was found in his blood dated from 12 January, he had only found out and received the report four days earlier before his death.&lt;ref name="www.slobodan-milosevic.org"/&gt; The same was reported later by former pro-Milošević [[president of Montenegro|Montenegrin President]] [[Momir Bulatović]], who was due to testify for Milošević's defence. According to Bulatović, Milošević had stopped taking the drug and consequently was afraid of being poisoned. In his letter, Milošević motivated his desire to be treated in Russia (by "Russian physicians, who rank among the most respected physicians in the world"),&lt;ref name="www.slobodan-milosevic.org"/&gt; saying that: 

{{quote|Also the fact that doctors needed 2 months (to report to me), can't have any other explanation than we are facing manipulation. In any case, those who foist on me a drug against leprosy surely can't treat my illness; likewise those from which I defended my country in times of war and who have an interest to silence me.&lt;ref name="www.slobodan-milosevic.org"/&gt;}}

Lawyer Zdenko Tomanović told reporters that his client had feared Milošević was being poisoned and cited the aforementioned letter, as well as the medical report two months before his death, according to which Milošević's blood contained [[rifampicin]] - a drug that is normally used to treat [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]] and which would have [[Drug interaction|neutralized]] some of the effects of Milošević's medicines for his high blood pressure and heart condition. Tomanović said he had made a formal request for the autopsy to take place in Moscow. The Tribunal rejected the request, allowing instead a pathologist from Serbia to attend the autopsy. In his statement, Tomanović said: "I demanded protection for Slobodan Milošević over his claims that he was being poisoned. I still haven't received any reply and that's all I have to say at this time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.sbs.com.au/theworldnews/region.php?id=127729&amp;region=3 sbs.com.au]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===13 March===
Dutch toxicologist Donald Uges confirmed that the drug had been found in Milošević's blood and suggested that he may have deliberately taken these drugs in order to get out of jail and seek medical treatment in Russia, where Milošević's widow, [[Mirjana Marković]], and son, Marko, were still living in exile. Likewise, sources at the Tribunal stated that Milošević had regular access to unprescribed drugs that were smuggled into his cell under a lax prison regime. Timothy McFadden, the prison governor responsible for Milošević, is reported to have complained, in vain, in December and January that he could no longer monitor drugs taken by the former leader. Milošević has the key to his own office, which had a fax machine, a computer and a telephone, and access to a private "comfort room" for visits by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/702946D3-8A83-4C52-8512-7AD35AA69E47.htm aljazeera.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525140945/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/702946D3-8A83-4C52-8512-7AD35AA69E47.htm |date=25 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17 March===
The Tribunal confirmed that preliminary results of blood tests shows there is no indication that Milošević's death by heart attack was caused by poisoning. Judge Fausto Pocar, president of the UN war crimes tribunal, told a news conference: "So far no indications of poisoning have been found. I would like to stress that these are provisional results." Tribunal registrar Hans Holthuis confirmed that traces of [[rifampicin]] were found in an earlier 12 January blood test. However, Pocar said that there are no traces of the drug were found at the time of Milošević's death. According to The Hague, district public prosecutor Moraal, referring to the NFI/Dutch Forensic Institute, "rifampicin disappears from the body quickly, and the fact that no traces were found implies only that it is not likely that rifampicin had been ingested or administered in the last few days before death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim&amp;nbsp;Large|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=newsOne&amp;storyID=2006-03-17T113752Z_01_L17711623_RTRUKOC_0_US-WARCRIMES-MILOSEVIC.xml|title=Warcrimes|publisher=Reuters|date=9 February 2009|accessdate=9 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo Bokeria, Director of Moscow's Bakulev Heart Surgery Center, confirmed that Milošević had died of a heart attack, but said adequate treatment in Moscow or in any one of many countries, including the Netherlands, would have rescued him. According to Bokeria, the necessary medical procedures ([[coronary angiography]] and [[stent]]ing) were "elementary". Bokeria said he saw "nothing showing signs of suicide", but there remained questions over whether Milošević received adequate care while standing trial at the U.N. tribunal. 

{{quote|If the patient had been investigated enough...he would have still been alive today.}} 

Bokeria also claimed that the center had sent Pocar a letter informing him that Milošević needed hospital treatment and naming several countries beside Russia where that could be done.&lt;ref name="echo.msk.ru"/&gt; ''The Times''' medical columnist [[Thomas Stuttaford]] commented that, taking into account what had been known about Milošević's health condition for years, he was "surprised that he (Milošević) lived for as long as he did". According to Stuttaford, given the data that existed, Milošević should have been considered for a [[coronary bypass]] or [[angioplasty]]; while these operations might be rendered impossible by severe heart defects, that can only be established by a careful analysis of the heart, and one would have thought that if this had been done, someone would have mentioned it. According to Stuttaford, using rifampicin might have been a cunning way to kill a man that needs no expertise.

===5 April===
The conclusions of the Dutch investigation into Milošević's death were finally announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5177D609-67B2-4DFA-85CB-53A03DA5669B.htm aljazeera.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429100026/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5177D609-67B2-4DFA-85CB-53A03DA5669B.htm |date=29 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators concluded that Milošević had died of natural causes, and final toxicological studies had confirmed there were no traces of poisoning or substances which could have triggered the heart attack. Tribunal prosecutors also announced that although non-prescribed medicines had been found in Milošević's cell three months earlier, there is no such medicines were found in his cell on the day he died. The president of the UN Yugoslav war crimes tribunal welcomed the final report that formally closed the Dutch investigation, but he said that the Tribunal will continue to investigate the medical treatment Milošević had received during his five-year detention.

== Political reactions ==

===ICTY===
ICTY Chief Prosecutor [[Carla Del Ponte]] deplored Milošević's death, saying that it had "deprived victims of justice". Concerning the causes of Milošević's death, she concluded that suicide could not be ruled out and declined to comment on speculation that Milošević may have been poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1715425|title=abcnews|publisher=Abcnews|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Rome newspaper, ''[[La Repubblica]]'', Del Ponte stated:

{{quote|I am furious ... In an instant everything was lost ... the death of Milošević represents for me a total defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/2006/03/13/eng/article6542703.html nzz.ch]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Serbian reactions===
In Serbia, tens of thousands of Milošević's supporters criticized the Tribunal for allegedly being more or less responsible for his death. Members of his Socialist Party advisors were particularly harsh - for example, senior official [[Ivica Dačić]] said that "Milošević did not die in The Hague, he was killed in The Hague". [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Boris Tadić]], who was an opponent of Milošević and the Socialist Party, said that in his opinion the U.N. war crimes tribunal was responsible for Milošević's death, but he added that it would not hamper Serbia's future cooperation with the court.

== Milošević family reactions ==
Most notable was a letter [[Marko Milošević]], son of Slobodan Milošević, sent to The President of the ICTY, The Chairman of the Security Council of the OUN, The Secretary General of the OUN, and to Judge Parker who led the investigation into Slobodan Milošević's death.&lt;ref name="slobodan-milosevic.org"/&gt; In his letter, Marko Milošević accuses the Hague Tribunal for negligence and for the death of his father.
In one part of the letter, Milošević agrees that his father was not poisoned and accuses the ICTY for being misleading:

{{quote|Secondly, neither we the family, nor the expert team of pathologists, which was familiar with my father’s health and was given the findings of the Dutch team, ever alleged the possibility of poisoning. To the contrary, I accepted the diagnosis of a heart attack (infarction) from the moment I heard it in The Hague. I warned both your deputy and the Dutch prosecutor not to vulgarize the investigation by setting up a "straw man" accusation such as a violent murder or poisoning. The lines you have chosen to describe the "scene of crime" are naïve, vulgar and insulting. The report itself, if made by an independent institution, would have been at the very least disappointing. But, since it’s being issued by the Tribunal, the very institution which had a monopoly over my father’s health during his time in UN custody, it is shocking. It contains an unexpected number of contradictions. Its contents and conclusions are absolutely unacceptable to the sane mind.}}
  
Marko Milošević then continues about the logic of the investigation into his father's death:

{{quote|Even if we had suspicions of poisoning, it would be pointless to try and prove them in conditions where the only possible culprit is the investigator. It is as if an accused committed a crime, leads the investigation, and comes to the expected conclusion that he is innocent. An accused may defend himself, but it is quite unusual that the accused himself leads the investigation, as was the case with your investigation and your report.}}
  
The Milošević family raised questions about the legitimacy of the ICTY conducted investigation:

{{quote|Should I mention the fact that the autopsy was conducted without the presence of the independent expert team sent by our family, even though we insisted on it? Or that the Russian doctors were denied the access to the body and the tissue samples? Or that we have been denied his blood samples? Now it happens that the Dutch medical institutions and doctors, which have already been gravely compromised in the eyes of the public through their involvement with the ICTY Prosecution in numerous manipulations with my father’s health, medical treatment, and respective diagnosis, were the only ones to manage the toxicology tests and announce their results?! Here I must remind you of my father's letter addressed to the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which he wrote just hours before his death that he suspected he was being poisoned in the UNDU. So here we have a situation where we are witnessing numerous speculations regarding his blood samples, he expresses his worry about it, then he suddenly dies. Now comes this mysterious autopsy conducted by the very same people that he accused in his last hours, and they conclude that there was no poisoning. How credible does this sound even to you Mr. Parker?}}

{{quote|It is a pity that I am not in a position to ask Ms. Del Ponte an even simpler question – if he was ill, then why he wasn’t he given medical treatment when he asked for it? And if he wasn’t ill, then why did he die?&lt;ref name="slobodan-milosevic.org"/&gt;}}

[[Marko Milošević]] then concludes that the ICTY is playing on "straw man" policy:

{{quote|I understand that the you have set-up this straw-man accusation of poisoning, and now by finding that there was no poisoning you assert that the ICTY has been relieved of all responsibility for my father's death. Nevertheless, an unquestionable truth remains before the public, the image of my father addressing your so-called "trial chamber" and asking to be allowed medical treatment, and the "presiding judge" responding that he will not listen to him.}}

{{quote|The question isn’t whether or not my father was murdered or poisoned. The point is that a former head of state, being held in UN custody, was gravely ill and constantly complaining of his medical condition. His health condition was assessed many times by medical experts as dire. He was denied adequate (if any) medical treatment, and then he died. At the same time those who denied him treatment were undeniably aware of what the consequences would be. He asked for provisional release to receive medical treatment.}}

Marko Milošević doubted the intentions of the ICTY:

{{quote|The Tribunal, and everyone in charge, has committed a deliberate murder. They condemned him to death on February 24th when they rejected his request for provisional release, ignoring everything: his health condition, his rights, and the warnings of  his doctors, which unlike the jail physician hired by the ICTY, had both – unquestionable competence and expertise, as well as his confidence. Ignoring even the guarantees of The Russian Federation (by the explanation that those guarantees lacked credibility, it seems that the Tribunal has given itself the mandate to evaluate the credibility of even the Security Council's permanent member states). The ruling handed down on February 24th came into effect on March 11th. That is the fact and the truth. Any other speculation is just evasive political maneuvering.}}

As (one of the) conclusion(s), Marko Milošević offers:

{{quote|It is obvious that even without poisoning, murder, or anything similar, but with heart failure which you consider to be a "natural" death that the ICTY and the UN who created it bears the sole responsibility for my father’s death.}}

==Funeral and burial==
There was a strong controversy across Serbia regarding on Milošević's funeral, as the Socialist Party and nationalist leaders demanded that it should be state-sponsored and high-profile. In particular, it was argued that Milošević ought to have a prominent resting place in the "Alley of the Greats," where other Serbian leaders are buried, which the Tribunal rejected such requests. As a result, the Socialist Party threatened to withdraw its support, which was essential for the ruling coalition. Finally, the Tribunal decided that Milošević should have a private burial in his hometown, [[Požarevac]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=PP14A2TZXSKEFQFIQMGSFF4AVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2006/03/14/wslob114.xml telegraph.co.uk]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313095556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Bjsessionid%3DPP14A2TZXSKEFQFIQMGSFF4AVCBQWIV0?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F03%2F14%2Fwslob114.xml |date=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a farewell ceremony was organised by the Socialist Party outside the federal parliament in [[Belgrade]]. About 50,000 of Milošević's supporters attended the ceremony, which turned into a mass demonstration,{{Vague|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--demonstrating what?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4819158.stm |publisher=BBC |date=18 March 2006 |title=Milosevic buried in his home town |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DZnfHeng?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4819158.stm |archivedate=10 January 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a succession of fiery speeches by prominent supporters.&lt;ref name="reuters.co.uk"&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-19T171937Z_01_L19242940_RTRUKOC_0_UK-WARCRIMES-MILOSEVIC.xml&amp;archived=False reuters.co.uk]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Milošević's coffin was taken to his hometown for burial in the backyard of his family home. Milošević's family and close friends pulled out of his funeral, citing anonymous threats and contradictory statements from Serbian authorities regarding the requested guarantees that they would not be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200603/s1594964.htm abc.net.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318185133/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200603/s1594964.htm |date=18 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milošević's daughter Mirjana stated that the Socialist Party had hijacked the funeral for political ends.&lt;ref name="reuters.co.uk"/&gt;

'''Endoderm''' is one of the three primary [[germ layer]]s in the very early [[embryo]]. The other two layers are the [[ectoderm]] (outside layer) and [[mesoderm]] (middle layer), with the endoderm being the innermost layer.&lt;ref&gt;Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells migrating inward along the [[archenteron]] form the inner layer of the [[gastrulation|gastrula]], which develops into the endoderm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the [[epithelial]] lining of multiple systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In [[plant biology]], endoderm corresponds to the innermost part of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] ([[Bark (botany)|bark]]) in young [[shoots]] and young [[Root|roots]] often consisting of a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] layer. As the [[plant]] becomes older, more endoderm will [[Lignification|lignify]].

==Production==

The following chart shows the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s produced by the endoderm.
The embryonic endoderm develops into the interior linings of two tubes in the body, the digestive and respiratory tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=SF|title=Endoderm|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/|publisher=Sinauer Associates|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3647">An '''ethicist''' is one whose judgment on [[ethics]] and [[ethical code]]s has come to be trusted by a specific [[community]], and (importantly) is expressed in some way that makes it possible for others to mimic or approximate that judgment. Following the advice of ethicists is one means of acquiring [[propositional knowledge|knowledge]] (see [[argument]], [[appeal to authority|argument from authority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tjeltveit, Alan C. (1999) ''Ethics and Values in Psychotherapy'' Routledge, London, pages 37-39, {{ISBN|0-415-15663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert (1991) "Psychiatry: Where medicine, psychology, and ethics meet" ''in'' Browning, Don S. and Evison, Ian S. (eds.) (1991) ''Does Psychiatry Need a Public Philosophy?'' Nelson-Hall, Chicago, pp. 61-73, page 70, {{ISBN|0-8304-1244-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[jurist]] describes an ethicist whose judgment on [[law]] becomes part of a [[legal code]], or otherwise has [[force of law]].  This may be due to formal ([[de jure]]) [[Sovereign state|state]] sanction.

Some jurists have less formal ([[de facto]]) backing by an ethical community, e.g. a [[religious community]].  In [[Islamic Law]], for instance, such a community following ([[taqlid]]) a specific jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of [[shariah]] mimics judgment of a prior jurist.&lt;ref&gt;Ismael, J. S. and Ismael, T. Y. (1980) "Social Change in Islamic Society: The Political Thought of Ayatollah Khomeini" ''Social Problems'' 27(5): pp. 601-619, page 614&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catholic Canon Law]] has a similar structure.  Such a jurist may be a [[theology|theologian]] or simply a prominent teacher.  To those outside this tradition, the jurist is simply an ethicist who they may more freely disagree with, and whose input on any issue is advisory.  However, they may find it hard to avoid a [[fatwa]] or [[excommunication]] or other such [[shunning]] by the religious community, so it may be hard advice to ignore.

Outside the [[legal profession]]s and [[spiritual tradition]]s, ethicists are usually considered to be either [[philosophy|philosopher]]s or [[mediation|mediator]]s of disputes. {{Verify source|date=January 2009}}

The [[list of ethicists]] demonstrates the extreme range of people who claim to have made, or contributed to, ethical debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">'''Ezmel de Ablitas''' (died 1342), "the rich Jew of Ablitas", had business relations with the King of [[Navarre]] and [[Aragon]].  He was the son of Don Juceph; and was born in the village of [[Ablitas]], near [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], from which place he derived his name.

The King of Aragon and the nobles of Navarre borrowed large sums from him, which they failed to repay. On this account Ablitas was unable to fulfil his obligations to the state.  After his death his grandson, Don '''Ezmel de Ablitas II''', and a Christian citizen of Tudela were made administrators of his estate and obliged under oath to deliver his property, consisting of furniture, money, gold and silver vessels, vases, and carvings.  His whole fortune, both personal and real, were confiscated in 1343 by the Queen of Navarre.  The massive amount which came into the treasury by this confiscation can be suggested from the record of documents published by Jacobs — which cites a single indebtedness from the king of £53,000 (see ''Jew. Quart. Rev.'' viii. 487).

Two of his sons are mentioned, '''Funes''' and '''Judah'''. The latter name is found in a document at [[Pamplona]] (Jacobs, ''Sources of History of Jews in Spain,'' xxxviii, 85). Don '''Solomon de Ablitas''', under [[Carlos II of Navarre]], was ''administrador de los bienes de su consejero'' (administrator of the property of his counselor), 1362–67.

An '''Esezkiel de Ablitas''' (1422) is mentioned in Jacobs' "Sources."

{{Primary sources|date=January 2010}}
The '''Great Filter''', in the context of the [[Fermi paradox]], is whatever prevents dead matter from undergoing [[abiogenesis]], in time, to expanding lasting life as measured by the [[Kardashev scale]].&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Hanson |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html |title=The Great Filter &amp;mdash; Are We Almost Past It? |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n7VYJBUd?url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html |archivedate=2010-01-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/space/the-flip-side-of-optimism-about-life-on-other-planets.html |date=August 3, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originates in [[Robin Hanson]]'s argument that the failure to find any [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations in the [[observable universe]] implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a "Great Filter" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: [[human]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hanson 1998: "No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system or systems nearby. Thus among the billion trillion stars in our past universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we may soon reach. This one data point implies that a Great Filter stands between ordinary dead matter and advanced exploding lasting life. And the big question is: How far along this filter are we?"&lt;/ref&gt; This probability threshold, which could lie [[Extinction event|behind us]] (in our past) or [[Human extinction|in front of us]] (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction.&lt;ref name="Hanson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Bostrom |date=May–June 2008 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf |format=PDF|title=Where Are They? Why I hope the search for extraterrestrial life finds nothing |journal=[[Technology Review]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |pages=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.

The idea was first proposed in an online essay titled "The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?", written by economist [[Robin Hanson]].  The first version was written in August 1996 and the article was last updated on September 15, 1998.  Since that time, Hanson's formulation has received recognition in several published sources discussing the Fermi paradox and its implications.

Using extinct civilizations such as [[Easter Island]] as models, a study conducted in 2018 posited that climate change induced by "energy intensive" civilizations may prevent sustainability within such civilizations, thus explaining the lack of evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-could-answer-fermi-paradox-2018-6|title=There's a compelling explanation for why we've never found aliens—and it could mean humanity is doomed|publisher=Business Insider|first1=Kevin|last1=Loria|date=June 25, 2018|access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main argument ==

===Fermi paradox===
{{Main|Fermi paradox}}
There is no reliable evidence [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] have visited [[Earth]] and we have observed no [[intelligent]] [[extraterrestrial life]] with current technology nor has [[SETI]] found any transmissions from other [[civilizations]].  The [[Universe]], apart from the [[Earth]], seems "dead"; Hanson states:&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our planet and solar system, however, don't look substantially colonized by advanced competitive life from the stars, and neither does anything else we see. To the contrary, we have had great success at explaining the behavior of our planet and solar system, nearby stars, our galaxy, and even other galaxies, via simple "dead" physical processes, rather than the complex purposeful processes of advanced life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Life is expected to expand to fill all available niches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1978QJRAS..19..277P "Are We All Alone, or could They be in the Asteroid Belt" by Michael D. Papagiannis, ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', Vol. 19, p.277]&lt;/ref&gt; With technology such as [[self-replicating spacecraft]], these niches would include neighboring star systems and even, on longer time scales which are still small compared to the age of the universe, other galaxies.  Hanson notes, "If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet, we would know it by now."&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt;

===The Great Filter===
With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with "advanced explosive lasting life" must be unlikely. This implies that at least one step in this process must be improbable.  Hanson's list, while incomplete, describes the following nine steps in an "evolutionary path" that results in the colonization of the observable universe:

# The right [[star system]] (including [[organic chemistry|organics]] and [[Drake equation#The equation|potentially habitable]] [[planet]]s)
# Reproductive [[molecules]] (e.g., [[RNA]])
# Simple ([[prokaryotic]]) [[Microorganisms|single-cell life]]
# Complex ([[eukaryotic]]) single-cell life
# [[Sexual reproduction]]
# [[Evolution of multicellularity|Multi-cell life]]
# Tool-using [[animal]]s with [[intelligence|big brains]]
# Where we are now
# [[Space colonization#Outside the Solar System|Colonization explosion]].

According to the Great Filter hypothesis at least one of these steps—if the list were complete—must be improbable. If it's not an early step (i.e., in our past), then the implication is that the improbable step lies in our future and our prospects of reaching step 9 (interstellar colonization) are still bleak.  If the past steps are likely, then many civilizations would have developed to the current level of the human species. However, none [[Fermi paradox#They do exist, but we see no evidence|appear to have]] made it to step 9, or the [[Milky Way]] would be full of colonies. So perhaps step 9 is the unlikely one, and the only thing that appears likely to keep us from step 9 is [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|some sort of catastrophe]] or  resource exhaustion leading to the impossibility of making the step due to consumption of the available resources (like for example highly constrained energy resources).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Is Humanity Doomed? Insights from Astrobiology|last = Baum|first = Seth|date = 8 February 2010|journal = Sustainability|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; So by this argument, finding [[multicellular]] life on Mars (provided it evolved independently) would be bad news, since it would imply steps 2–6 are easy, and hence only 1, 7, 8 or 9 (or some unknown step) could be the big problem.&lt;ref name=Bostrom /&gt;

Although steps 1–8 have occurred on Earth, any one of these may be unlikely. If the first seven steps are necessary preconditions to calculating the likelihood (using the [[Realization (probability)|local environment]]) then an [[anthropic bias|anthropically biased]] observer can [[Statistical hypothesis testing|infer]] nothing about the general probabilities from its ([[prior probability|pre-determined]]) surroundings.

==Counterarguments==
{{main|Fermi paradox#Hypothetical explanations for the paradox}}
There are many alternative scenarios that might allow for the evolution of intelligent life to occur multiple times without either catastrophic self-destruction or glaringly visible evidence. These are possible resolutions to the [[Fermi paradox]]: "They do exist, but we see no evidence". Other ideas include: it is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy, Earth is purposely isolated, it is dangerous to communicate and hence civilizations actively hide, among others.

As one example, astronomer [[Seth Shostak]] of the [[SETI Institute]] argues that one can postulate a galaxy filled with intelligent  extraterrestrial civilizations that have failed to colonize the [[Earth]].  Perhaps the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s lacked the intent and purpose to colonize or depleted their resources, or maybe the [[galaxy]] ''is'' colonized but in a [[heterogeneous]] manner, or the Earth could be located in a "galactic backwater".  Although absence of evidence generally is only weak [[evidence of absence]], the absence of extraterrestrial [[megascale engineering]] projects, for example, might point to the Great Filter at work.  Does this mean that one of the steps leading to intelligent life is unlikely?&lt;ref name="Shostak"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pethokoukis |first=James M. |date=2003-11-04 |title=Keeping His Eyes on the Skies |newspaper=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025348/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm |archivedate=2013-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Shostak:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don't see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we're alone.  But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence. It could be that it's the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable. This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be—and this is, of course, speculation—that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead. It should also be kept in mind that, as [[Arthur C. Clarke]] said, truly advanced engineering would look like magic to us—or be unrecognizable altogether. By the way, we've only just begun to search for things like [[Dyson sphere]]s, so we can't really rule them out.&lt;ref name="Shostak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Voros in "Macro-Perspectives Beyond the World System" (2007) points out that some researchers have attempted to search for energy signatures that could be traced to Dyson-like structures (shells, swarms, or spheres).  So far, none have been found.  See for example, Tilgner &amp; Heinrichsen, "A Program to Search for Dyson Spheres with the Infrared Space Observatory", ''Acta Astronautica'' Vol. 42 (May–June, 1998), pp. 607–612; and Timofeev et al. "A search of the IRAS database for evidence of Dyson Spheres", ''Acta Astronautica'' Vol. 46, (June 2000), pp. 655–659.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Henrietta Baker Chanfrau''' (1837&amp;ndash;1909) was an [[United States|American]] [[stage (theatre)|stage]] [[actress]].

Born '''Henrietta Baker''' in [[Philadelphia]], before her marriage, her stage name was '''Jeannette Davis'''. She made her début as a [[singing|vocalist]] during the summer of 1854 at the [[Assembly Buildings]] in Philadelphia under the management of Professor Mueller.{{cn|date=December 2016}} 

Her first appearance at a regular theatre was at the city museum on September 9, 1854, as Miss Apsley in ''[[The Willow Copse]]''. A short time afterward she became a member of the [[Arch Street Theatre]], where she remained nearly two seasons. She became a member of the company when the National in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], was opened by [[Lewis Baker (theatre)|Lewis Baker]] for the 1857–58 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=T. Allston|title=History of the American Stage|year=1870|publisher=Dick and Fitzgerald|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long absence from [[New York City]], in late 1886 she appeared at the reopening of the [[Fourteenth Street Theatre]] as Linda Colmore in ''[[The Scapegoat (play)|The Scapegoat]]''.

==Personal life==
She married actor [[Frank Chanfrau]] in July 1858. She is believed to have died in [[New Jersey]] in 1909.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''Homogamy''' is used in biology in four separate senses: 
*[[Inbreeding]] can be referred to as homogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P.M.B. (ed.) 1988. ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Science and Technology''. W. R. Chambers Ltd. and Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Homogamy refers to the maturation of male and female reproductive organs at the same time, which is also known as simultaneous or synchronous [[hermaphrodite|hermaphrodism]] and is the antonym of [[dichogamy]]. Many flowers appear to be homogamous but some of these may not be strictly functionally homogamous, because for various reasons male and female reproduction do not completely overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bell, S.A. |author2=Cresswell, J.E. |year=1998|title=The phenology of gender in homogamous flowers: temporal change in the residual sex function of flowers of Oil-seed Rape (Brassica napus)|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=298–306|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Asteraceae|daisy family]], the flower heads are made up of many small flowers called florets, and are either homogamous or heterogamous. '''Heterogamous heads''' are made up of two types of florets, ray florets near the edge and disk florets in the center. '''Homogamous heads''' are made up of just one type of floret, either all ray florets or all disk florets.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://predator.oldwestbury.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1501654564?accountid=29096&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inbreeding ==
As opposed to [[outcrossing]] or outbreeding, [[inbreeding]] is the process by which organisms with common descent come together to mate and eventually procreate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/inbreeding|title=Inbreeding {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archetype of inbreeding is [[self-pollination]]. When a plant has both anthers and a stigma, the process of inbreeding can occur. Another word for this self-fertilization is [[autogamy]], which is when an anther releases pollen to attach to the stigma on the same plant. Self-pollination is promoted by homogamy. Homogamy is when the anthers and the stigma of a flower are being matured at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_improvement/crop_imprv_pollmode.html|title=TNAU Agritech Portal Crop Imporvement:: Mode of Pollination|last=|first=|date=|website=Agritech.tnau.ac.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of self-pollination guides the plant to [[homozygosity]], causing a specific gene to be received from each of the parents leading to the possession of two exact formats of that gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12730|title=Definition of Homozygosity|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assortative mating ==
[[Assortative mating]] is the choosing of a mate to breed with based on their physical characteristics, [[phenotypical]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/assortative-mating|title=Assortative mating {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are social factors that enhance one's choosing, such as religion, physical traits, and culture. For instance, research has been conducted by sociologists who found that men and women look for individuals who fall under the educational homogamy he or she is in. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raniagihleb.com/resources/RESOURCES/marriage3k.pdf |title=Educational Homogamy and Assortative Mating Have Not Increased |last1=Gihleb |first1=Rania |last2=Lang |first2=Kevin |date= |website=raniagihleb.com |series=NBER Working Paper W22927 |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogamy theory holds that when organisms look for a potential partner, they search for organisms that have similar traits to themselves. The idea of sexual imprinting plays a role in this theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on whether or not an individual is a male or a female, the individual tends to be attracted to other people that have most similar characteristics to their parent of the opposite gender. This is a form of [[Assortative mating|positive assortative mating]], where people choose a mate with attributes that correlate with their own. According to Kalmijn and Flap, there are five places individuals could become acquainted with each other in. These five places are: work, school, neighborhood, common family networks, and voluntary associations. They also studied the five criteria that are usually looked for to decide on the status of wanting to mate. As such, the five traits are: age, education, class destinations, class origins, and religious background.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary aspect ==
&lt;p&gt;There is a evolutionary theory that explain that there are two specific qualities that are looked out. These two traits are male dominance and the attractiveness of the female. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd_Lucas/publication/239799863_Marital_satisfaction_in_four_cultures_as_a_function_of_homogamy_male_dominance_and_female_attractiveness/links/5547a7830cf2b0cf7ace7216.pdf|format=PDF|title=Marital satisfaction in four cultures as a function of homogamy, male dominance and female attractiveness|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the evolutionary perspective, the purpose of mating is to procreate for the purpose of survival. It is the ones with the best features and traits that survive, a known phrase called [[survival of the fittest]]. If there was a couple who lacked the ability to become fertile or have a child with a disease or a handicap, there is a great rise in the risk of the couple receiving  a divorce. &lt;ref&gt;Littlefield, C.H. and Silverman, I. (1991) ‘Marital dissatisfaction following the death of a child: the influence of genetic factors at cause in the death’, Journal of Marriage and the Family 53: 799–804.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are traits that are found in a spouse that are not favorable, then the homogamy in the relationship decreases, and there begins to have a need for it for a better production of children.

[[File:Knox Helm.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Knox Helm, 1951]]
'''Sir Alexander Knox Helm''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|GBE|KCMG}} (23 March 1893 &amp;ndash; 7 March 1964) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat who served as ambassador to [[Turkey]] and was the last [[Governor-General]] of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]].

==Early years==
Born to W.H. Helm of [[Dumfries]], Alexander Knox Helm was educated at [[Dumfries Academy]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]].

==Career==
In 1912, he passed the examination for what were then called second division clerkships and was appointed to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]. He served as a member of the East Registry. A keen volunteer when [[World War I]] broke out, he was allowed by the Foreign Office to join his field artillery unit, being promoted second lieutenant in 1917 and serving in that capacity in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]]. As a humble clerk, he had performed only routine duties but distinguished himself through his assiduity and retentive memory. 

Thus, when the war ended he was selected under the special recruitment scheme for filling vacancies caused by the war and appointed to the Levant Consular Service. After a short period of training in Oriental languages at [[King's College, Cambridge]], he went as Vice-Consul to [[Thessaloniki]], and soon after became third [[Dragoman]] at [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. When the Turkish capital moved to [[Ankara]] and the office of Dragoman was abolished, Helm went there as Second Secretary. He served there as Consul, and in 1930 was transferred to the Foreign Office, working in the Eastern Department.

In 1937 he was sent as Consul to [[Addis Ababa]] and at the outbreak of [[World War II]] was moved to the British Embassy at [[Washington, D.C.]], where he handled the various complicated problems connected with the supply of petroleum to the United Kingdom. In 1942 he went back to Ankara (at that moment a key post) as Counsellor.

In 1946 he was chosen to go as British representative to [[Hungary]] and when normal diplomatic relations were restored in 1947 he was made Minister there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38213/pages/1186 The London Gazette, 20 February 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he was appointed the first British Chargé d'Affaires (later Minister) to [[Tel Aviv]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38702/pages/4189 The London Gazette, 30 August 1949]&lt;/ref&gt; in the newly independent State of [[Israel]], where he spent two happy and fruitful years; in 1951 he became Ambassador to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/39446/pages/455 The London Gazette, 22 January 1952]&lt;/ref&gt; He left there in 1954, having reached retirement age, but went for a brief period to [[Khartoum]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2936%2C6314955 New Governor of Sudan – Sir Knox Helm], ''The Glasgow Herald'', 31 December 1954&lt;/ref&gt; being the last Governor-General there.

"Helm was a  man of strong character and great determination. A tenacious and forceful negotiator, he had great powers of persuasion and a remarkable sense of timing – valuable gifts which were supplmented with a sense of humour and of proportion and a charm which was genuine: few people can ever have said 'No' in a more pleasant way. He was an exacting chief but popular with his staff, who always knew that he could do any of their jobs better than they could themselves. Moreover, he was always ready to listen to their advice, but equally he invariably made up his own mind."&lt;br /&gt;"He retained to the end the accent and intonation of the [[Dumfriesshire]] farming stock from which he came and his love for and understanding of the things of the soil often stood him in good stead in posts where agricultural problems bulked large in the economy of the country." &amp;mdash; ''The Times''

'''''Lightning Over Water''''' is a 1980 [[documentary film]] by [[Wim Wenders]] and [[Nicholas Ray]] about the last days of Ray's own life; the director was most famous for his 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''. It was screened out of competition at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1791/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Lightning Over Water |accessdate=2009-05-30|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LightningWaterRayjpg.jpg|275px|left]] --&gt;
The film is a collaboration between Wenders and Ray to document Ray's last days due to terminal cancer in 1979. The film is partially an homage to Ray who had a strong influence on Wenders' work, and partially an investigation on life and death. Ray's influence on Wenders includes Ray's "love on the run" subgenre as well as his ''[[film noir]]'' photography. 

The film features excerpts from Ray's movies ''[[The Lusty Men]]'' and his unfinished final work ''[[We Can't Go Home Again]]''. The sequence featuring the former excerpt was shot at [[Vassar College]], at which Ray presented the movie and then gave a lecture, which itself is excerpted.

Nicholas Ray appears in a minor role in Wenders' film ''[[The American Friend]]''. Wenders' science fiction film ''[[Until the End of the World]]'' is named for the last spoken words in Ray's 1961 Biblical [[epic film]] ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]''.

The film crew is extensively featured onscreen. [[Jim Jarmusch]], Ray's personal assistant at the time — and later a notable film director in his own right — can be briefly glimpsed at the 50:28 mark sitting at an editing console.

When Wenders goes to the Vassar campus to attend a lecture, a brief one-man performance is seen on-stage. It is Franz Kafka's story "A Report for an Academy", about an ape who becomes a man.

The American independent film director [[Jon Jost]] has recently come out against Wenders' status as the sole co-director, saying that Wenders "used his celebrity" to push Jost and [[Raúl Ruiz (director)]] out of the project that they had been the creators of.

The '''Linde–Buzo–Gray algorithm''' (introduced by Yoseph Linde, Andrés Buzo and [[Robert M. Gray]] in 1980) is a [[vector quantization]] algorithm to derive a good [[codebook]].

It is similar to the [[k-means]] method in [[data clustering]].

==The algorithm ==
At each iteration, each vector is split into two new vectors.

*A initial state: centroid of the training sequence;
*B initial estimation #1: code book of size 2;
*C final estimation after [[Lloyd's algorithm|LGA]]: Optimal code book with 2 vectors;
*D initial estimation #2: code book of size 4;
*E final estimation after [[Lloyd's algorithm|LGA]]: Optimal code book with 4 vectors;

{{homicide}}
A '''mass killing''', as defined by a genocide scholar [[Ervin Staub]], is "killing members of a group without the intention to eliminate the whole group or killing large numbers of people without a precise definition of group membership."&lt;ref name="Staub1"&gt;{{Cite book|last =Staub|first =Ervin|authorlink = |title =The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence|publisher =Cambridge University Press|year =1989|location = |pages =8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d0FHWmChRYgC|doi =   |isbn =978-0-521-42214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|"In contrast to genocide, I see mass killing as 'killing (or in other ways destroying) members of a group without the intention to eliminate the whole group, or killing large numbers of people' without a focus on group membership."&lt;ref name="Staub2"&gt;{{Cite book|last =Staub|first =Ervin|authorlink = |title =Overcoming Evil: Genocide, Violent Conflict, and Terrorism|publisher =Oxford University Press|year =2011|location = |pages =100|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WcxhGuq7VY8C|doi =   |isbn =978-0-195-38204-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This term is used by a number of genocide scholars because the term "[[genocide]]" (its strict definition) does not cover mass killing events when no specific ethnic or religious group is targeted, and when perpetrators are not intended to eliminate of the whole group or its significant part. This article primarily discusses different models used by genocide scholars to explain and predict the onset of mass killing events.

==Terminology== 
According to Weiss-Wendt, any attempts to develop a universally accepted terminology describing mass killings of non-combatants was a complete failure&lt;ref&gt;Weiss-Wendt A. (2008) Problems in Comparative Genocide Scholarship. In: Stone D. (eds) The Historiography of Genocide. Palgrave Macmillan, London. DOI https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230297) "''There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole. This is one of the reasons why those who define themselves as genocide scholars have not been able to detect the situation of crisis.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Below are listed the terms used by genocide scholars to describe mass killings.

* '''Mass killing''' Referencing earlier definitions{{refn|group=nb|In the Encyclopedia of Genocide (1999), Israel Charny defined generic genocide as "the mass killing of substantial numbers of human beings, when not in the course of military action against the military forces of an avowed enemy, under conditions of the essential defenselessness and helplessness of the victims."&lt;ref name="Charny"&gt;Charny, Israel (ed). (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q30HcvCVuIC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Encyclopedia of Genocide], Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 article "Development, democracy, and mass killings", William Easterly, Roberta Gatti and Sergio Kurlat adopted Charny's definition of generic genocide for their use of "mass killing" and "massacre" to avoid the politics of the term "genocide" altogether.&lt;ref name="Easterly"&gt;Easterly, William, Roberta Gatti and Sergio Kurlat. (2006). [http://williameasterly.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/46_easterly_gatti_kurlat_developmentdemocracymasskillings_prp.pdf "Development, democracy, and mass killings"], Journal of Economic Growth 11: 129-56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}, Joan Esteban, Massimo Morelli and Dominic Rohner have defined ''mass killings'' as "the killings of substantial numbers of human beings, when not in the course of military action against the military forces of an avowed enemy, under the conditions of the essential defenselessness and helplessness of the victims".&lt;ref name="Esteban"&gt;Esteban, Joan Maria, Morelli, Massimo and Rohner, Dominic, Strategic Mass Killings (May 11, 2010). Institute for Empirical Research in Economics, University of Zurich Working Paper No. 486. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1615375&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been defined by Benjamin Valentino as "the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants", where a "massive number" is defined as at least 50,000 intentional deaths over the course of five years or less.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Valentino, Paul Huth, Dylan Bach-Lindsay, (2004), "Draining the Sea: mass killing and guerrilla warfare," ''International Organization'' 58,2 (375–407): p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most accepted quantitative minimum threshold for the term.&lt;ref name="Esteban"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;ref name="Tago"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=FW|last1=Wayman|first2=A|last2=Tago|title=Explaining the onset of mass killing, 1949–87|journal=Journal of Peace Research Online|year=2009|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|"Our term, 'mass killing', is used by Valentino (2004: 10), who aptly defines it as 'the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants'. The word 'noncombatants' distinguishes mass killing from battle-deaths in war, which occur as combatants fight against each other. The 'massive number' he selects as the threshold to mass killing is 'at least fifty thousand intentional deaths over the course of five or fewer years' (Valentino, 2004: 11-12), which of course averages to at least 10,000 killed per year." ... " One reason for selecting these thresholds of 10,000 and 1,000 deaths per year is that we find that in the Harff data on geno-politicide, which are one of our key datasets, there are many cases of over 10,000 killed per year, but also some in which between 1,000 and 10,000 are killed per year. Therefore, analyzing at a 1,000-death threshold (as well as the 10,000 threshold) insures the inclusion of all the Harff cases. Valentino chooses 50,000 over five years as 'to some extent arbitrary', but a 'relatively high threshold' to create high confidence that mass killing did occur and was deliberate, 'given the generally poor quality of the data available on civilian fatalities' (Valentino, 2004: 12). We believe that our similar results, when we lower the threshold to 1,000 killed per year, are an indication that the data in Harff and in Rummel remain reliable down even one power of ten below Valentino's 'relatively high' selected threshold, and we hope that, in that sense, our results can be seen as a friendly amendment to his work, and that they basically lend confidence, based on empirical statistical backing, for the conceptual direction which he elected to take." ... "Within that constant research design, we then showed that the differences were not due to threshold either (over 10,000 killed per year; over 1,000; or over 1). The only remaining difference is the measure of mass killing itself - democide vs. geno-politicide."&lt;ref name=Tago/&gt;}}
*[[Genocide]] – under the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|crime of genocide]] generally applies to mass murder of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] rather than political or social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the UN resolution after a second vote, because many states&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jones2010Genocide|Jones (2010) ''Genocide'']] p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Beth van Schaack. The Crime of Political Genocide: Repairing the Genocide Convention's Blind Spot. ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 106, No. 7 (May 1997), pp. 2259‒2291.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genocide'' is also a popular term for mass political killing, which is studied academically as ''democide'' and ''politicide''.&lt;ref name="Tago"/&gt;
*[[Politicide]] – the term "politicide" is used to describe the killing of groups that would not otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention.&lt;ref name="harffgurr"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harff|first=Barbara|first2=Ted R.|year=1988|title=Toward Empirical Theory of Genocides and Politicides: Identification and Measurement of Cases since 1945|volume=32|pages=359–371|journal=|last2=Gurr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Harff studies "genocide and politicide", sometimes shortened as '''geno-politicide''', to include the mass killing of political, economic, ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name="Tago"/&gt;
*[[Democide]] – [[R. J. Rummel]] defines democide as "''the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command''".&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"&gt;Barbara Harff.

[http://afes-press-books.de/html/SpringerBriefs_PSP_Rummel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims; killings by "unofficial" private groups; extrajudicial summary killings; and mass deaths in deliberate famines, as well as killings by ''de facto'' governments, i.e. civil war killings.&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harff@Rummel"&gt;Barbara Harff.

Stable URL: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206491]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Rummel's "democide" concept is very similar to "geno-politicide", however there are two important differences. First, an important prerequisite for geno-politicide is government's intent to destroy a specific group.&lt;ref name=harff-t/&gt; In contrast, "democide" deals with wider range of cases, including the cases when governments are engaged in random killing either directly or due to the acts of criminal omission and neglect.&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"/&gt;
:Second, whereas some lower threshold exists for a killing event to be considered "geno-politicide" (Valentino uses 50,000/five years, other authors use lower threshold), there is no low threshold for democide, which covers any murder of any number of persons by any government.&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"/&gt;
*[[Classicide]], was proposed by Michael Mann  to describe the "intended mass killing of entire social classes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mann2005DarkSideofDemocracy|Mann (2005) ''Dark Side of Democracy'']] p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|"Mann thus establishes a sort of parallel between racial enemies and class enemies, thereby contributing to the debates on comparisons between Nazism and communism. This theory has also been developed by some French historians such as Stéphane Courtois and Jean-Louis Margolin in ''The Black Book of Communism'': they view class genocide as the equivalent to racial genocide. Mann however refuses to use the term 'genocide' to describe the crimes committed under communism. He prefers the terms 'fratricide' and 'classicide', a word he coined to refer to intentional mass killings of entire social classes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Semelin2009PurifyandDestroy|Semelin (2009) ''Purify and Destroy'']] p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dispossessive ''vs'' coercive mass killings===
Benjamen Valentino, who sees ruler's motives as the key factor explaining the onset of mass killings, outlines two major category of mass killings, dispossessive mass killings and coercive mass killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The first category included ethnic cleansing, killings that accompany agrarian reforms in some states led by communists, mass killings during colonial expansion, etc. The second category includes mass killings during counter-guerilla warfare, killings during the Axis imperialist conquests during the [[World War II]], etc. Although Valentino does not consider ideology or regime type as an important factor that explains mass killings,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Straus.

==Global databases of mass killings==

Two global databases of mass killings are currently available.  The first compilation, by [[Rudolph Rummel]], covers a time period from the beginning of the 20th century till 1977, and the second compilation, by [[Barbara Harff]], combines all mass killing events since 1955. The Harff database is the most frequently used by genocide scholars.&lt;ref name="Tago"/&gt; These data are intended mostly for statistical analysis of mass killings in attempt to identify the best predictors for their onset. According to Harff, these data are not necessarily the most accurate for a given country, since some sources are general genocide scholars and not experts on local history.&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"/&gt; A comparative analysis of these two databases revealed a significant difference between the figures of killed per years and low correlation between Rummel's and Harff's data sets. Tomislav Dulić criticized Rummel's generally higher numbers&lt;ref name="harff@rummel2"/&gt; as arising from flaws in Rummel's statistical methodology.&lt;ref name="dulic"&gt;Tomislav Dulić.

==Explanation of the onset of mass killings==

The term "mass killing" was proposed by genocide scholars in attempts to collect a uniform global database of genocidal events and identify statistical models for prediction of onset of mass killings.

Frank Wayman and Atsushi Tago use the term "mass killing" as defined by Valentino, and they concluded that, even with a lower threshold (10,000 killed per year, 1,000 killed per year, or even 1), "autocratic regimes, especially communist, are prone to mass killing generically, but not so strongly inclined (i.e. not statistically significantly inclined) toward geno-politicide.

'''Mitchell Scott Johnson''' (born August 11, 1984) and '''Andrew Douglas Golden''' (born May 25, 1986) are former middle school students and the 13 and 11 year old perpetrators, respectively, of the March 24, 1998 [[mass shooting|massacre]] at Westside Middle School in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Craighead County]], [[Arkansas]] near the city of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US0535710&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Jonesboro city, Arkansas]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. Retrieved on October 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and Golden fatally shot four students and a teacher with multiple weapons, and both were arrested when they attempted to flee the scene. Ten others were wounded in the shooting. Both Golden and Johnson were charged with the five murders and 10 injuries that were caused by the shooting, and were imprisoned until each turned 21 years of age.

==Background==

===Mitchell Johnson===
'''Mitchell Scott Johnson''' was born in [[Grand Meadow, Minnesota]] to Gretchen and Scott Johnson.&lt;ref name=shootingsuspect/&gt; When Mitchell was seven, his parents divorced, and he and his brother moved with their mother to [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]]. His mother soon remarried to Terry Woodward, an inmate at the prison where she was a guard. Johnson had a good relationship with his stepfather and brother, and adults who remembered him described him as being quiet and respectful. He was a former member of the Central Baptist Church youth choir, later joining the youth group at the Revival Tabernacle Church, in Jonesboro.

Following the shooting, Johnson's attorney claimed that he had been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] when he was 6 and 7 years by a "family member of the day care where he was placed." One year prior to the shooting, 12-year-old Mitchell was charged with molesting a 3-year-old girl while visiting southern Minnesota with his family. However, the record of the case was expunged because of Mitchell's age.&lt;ref name=shootingsuspect&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/special/shoot/shoot029.htm Shooting suspect claims he was molested], Associated Press (reprinted by USA Today)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andrew Golden===
'''Andrew Douglas Golden''' was born and raised in Jonesboro to Jacqueline and Dennis Golden. By all accounts, he came from a stable household, having a good relationship with both his parents, and he regularly visited his grandparents and great-grandmother.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Both of his parents worked as postal workers, and his paternal grandfather, Douglas Golden, was a wildlife conservation officer in Jonesboro. He was raised to be familiar with firearms and their use at an early age; he was given his first firearm by his father when he was six years old.

===Middle school===
Johnson and Golden were both students at Westside Middle School. They met and became friends on a school bus that they rode home from school.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/us/from-wild-talk-and-friendship-to-five-deaths-in-a-schoolyard.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=From wild talk and friendship, to five deaths in schoolyard}}, ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 29, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they were known to [[bullying|bully]] other students, and people recalled Johnson talking of wanting to belong to the [[Bloods]] and smoke [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The [[Texaco]] truck stop was a popular hang-out for youths in Jonesboro,&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and adolescents there remember Johnson claiming to belong to street gangs. He also spoke of "having a lot of killing to do"&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and his classmates also commented that he had a fascination with firearms. He had particularly threatened to kill sixth-grader Candace Porter, his former girlfriend who ended their relationship.
 	
Golden was a sixth grader at the school, where schoolmates said he displayed troublesome behavior. He would often engage other students in fist fights and use profane language. A classmate accused him of killing her cat with a [[BB gun]].

===Before the massacre===
Three months prior to the incident, one of the students reported to a school counsellor that Golden had stated he intended to shoot some people at the school. When Golden was called to the counselor, he stated that he had a nightmare in which he followed through and then was killed, scaring him off the plan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/jonesboro-massacre-two-macho-boys-with-a-lot-of-killing-to-do-1152649.html|title=Jonesboro massacre: Two macho boys with 'a lot of killing to do'|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the school day on March 23, 1998, the day before the massacre, Johnson talked to his sister Jennifer, warning her not to come to school the next day, as Johnson heard that something bad was going to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ADeUkV5ykE|title=Mitchell Johnson 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the massacre Golden told friends he had "a lot of killing to do" and suggested to them that they would know the next day whether they were destined to live or die.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the night before the shooting, Golden assisted Johnson in loading his mother's [[Dodge Caravan]] with camping supplies, snack foods, nine weapons ([[Remington Model 742|Remington 742]] .30-06 rifle, [[M1 carbine|Universal .30 M1 carbine]] replica, [[Ruger Model 44|Ruger .44 Magnum]] rifle, [[.38 Special|Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver]], Double Deuce Buddie .22 two-shot [[derringer]], FIE [[.380 ACP|.380 pistol]], Star [[.380 ACP|.380 pistol]], [[Ruger Security-Six|Ruger Security Six .357 revolver]], [[Davis Industries]] .38 two-shot [[derringer]], and a [[Charter Arms]] [[.38 Special|.38 revolver]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/wgun980324.htm|title=VPC - Where'd They Get Their Guns? - Westside Middle School, Jonesboro, Arkansas|website=www.vpc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been stolen from Golden's grandfather's house, and 2000 rounds of ammunition. 

=== Incident ===
The following morning, the boys drove in the van to Westside Middle School, arriving late after feigning illnesses to get out of school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As they arrived, Golden pulled the fire alarm just after 12:30 pm, during the beginning of fifth period&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-ones-that-got-away-jonesboros-survivors-and-the-shooters-recall-a-moment-of-horror_us_5a39780ce4b06d1621b01f37|title=The Ones That Got Away: Jonesboro's Survivors — And The Shooters — Recall A Moment Of Horror|last=News|first=Yahoo|date=2017-12-19|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while Johnson took the weapons to the woods outside of the school. Golden then ran back to the woods where Johnson had taken the weapons. When children and teachers filed out of the school, the two boys opened fire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/living-us-mass-school-shooters-incarcerated/story?id=36986507|title=The Only 2 Living US Mass School Shooters Not in Prison|last=News|first=A. B. C.|date=2016-02-17|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with officials stating that the shooting began at 12:41 pm.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/mar/18/20-years-ago-sad-day-westside/?f=news-arkansas|title=‘THAT MOMENT OF CHAOS’: 20 years ago, sad day at Westside|date=2018-03-18|work=Arkansas Online|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the incident many became confused initially with reports of shouting of "It's all fake", as friends of wounded tried to evacuate their friends and teacher Shannon Watts used her body to protect a wounded student.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/23/596103091/20-years-later-jonesboro-shooting-survivors-conflicted-over-parkland|title=20 Years Later, Jonesboro Shooting Survivors Conflicted Over Parkland|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another teacher had been checking students off on her class list, when she heard pops, "like firecrackers" and thought it was an ill-advised attempt to frighten the kids, to potentially make them take the drill seriously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A student reported that the sounds were at first dismissed by some as construction workers had been working on the new fifth-grade building nearby.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Students who had initially evacuated for the drill, were brought back into the school's gymnasium, where students could hear the bullets ricocheting off the outside bricks and walls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some victims were brought back inside by uninjured students and teachers, after a teacher opened the doors from the inside as they had automatically locked due to the fire alarm. A student who had sought shelter in the school, told a teacher with them that they believed the shooter was Mitchell Johnson, as they had been told by him not to come to school that day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/djpeisner/the-ghosts-of-jonesboro-fifteen-years-after-a-notorious-scho|title=The Ghosts Of Jonesboro: Fifteen Years After A School Shooting, A Small Town Is Still Recovering|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The boys killed four female students and one teacher and wounded ten others. All ten of those injured survived their injuries.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9803/28/funerals.wrap/|title=CNN - Last of Jonesboro victims laid to rest - March 28, 1998|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden and Johnson attempted to run back to the van and escape, but police captured them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The shooters were apprehended about 10 minutes after the shooting began, according to a Lieutenant with the Jonesboro Police Department.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The boys evidently planned to run away, as they had food, sleeping bags, and survival gear in their van.

==Aftermath==
As the incident was the third fatal multiple shooting at an American school since October 1997; following the [[Pearl High School shooting]] and the [[Heath High School shooting|Heath High shooting]], then [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] ordered Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] to organize experts on school violence to analyze the recent incidents, determine what they may have had in common and what steps could be taken to reduce the chance of a similar incident.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Memorials ===
White ribbons were tied on tree trunks, and other objects in memory of the victims. The school installed a memorial bench outside the school that is carved with the date of the massacre, and a [[sundial]] memorial, installed in a park area behind the school, is engraved with the names of the victims.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The park area was designed as a memorial park, based around the number 5 to commemorate the 5 dead victims, with five trees, with five picnic tables, and five stepping-stones, along with the sundial.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Trial===
During the trial, Johnson hung his head and read a letter of apology he had written to victims' families. He said he had not been targeting anyone. "We were not going to shoot at anyone in particular," he said. "I really thought we would scare them. I am sorry. I hope anyone who listens to these words knows how truly sorry I am."

While in detention awaiting trial, Johnson wrote a letter that stated: "Hi. My name is Mitchell. My thoughts and prayers are with those people who were killed, or shot, and their families. I am really sad inside about everything. My thoughts and prayers are with those kids that I go to school with. I really want people to know the real Mitchell someday. Sincerely, Mitchell Johnson."&lt;ref name="shootingsuspect"/&gt;

Due to their age, they were tried as juveniles, and were found guilty of five counts of murder. Following their convictions, Johnson and Golden were taken by National Guard helicopter to [[Alexander, Arkansas]], so they could be placed at the Arkansas Juvenile Assessment &amp; Treatment Center (AJATC), the [[Arkansas Department of Human Services]] Youth Services Division's juvenile facility and the state's most secure juvenile facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/special/shoot/shoot038.htm Ark. vows to toughen juvenile sentencing] by Carol Morello, USA Today. August 12, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imprisonment====
The two youths were among the youngest people ever charged with murder in U.S. history. The Jonesboro prosecutor later stated that were it not for their ages, he would have sought a [[death penalty|death sentence]] for the pair. In August 1998, both boys were sentenced to confinement until they reached the age of 21, which is the maximum sentence available under Arkansas law. They would have served until only age 18 had federal authorities not added additional confinement for weapons charges. Judge Ralph Wilson commented, "This is a case where the punishment will not fit the crime." The case led to wide public outcry for tougher sentencing laws pertaining to juvenile offenders.

====Release====
Johnson was released on his 21st birthday, August 11, 2005, having spent seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8917466/ |title=School shooter free after seven years - Nightly News with Brian Williams - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden was released on May 25, 2007, also his 21st birthday, after spending nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/may/25/1998-schoolyard-killer-now-21-due-release-brief/ |title=Westside school shooter released |publisher=.arkansasonline.com |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden's whereabouts were unknown until he applied for a [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapon permit]] in Arkansas on October 7, 2008, under the name he now uses, Drew Douglas Grant. His application was denied by the [[Arkansas State Police]], who noted that Golden had lied on the application about his previous residences and declared it was illegal for Golden to own or possess a firearm. The assumed name that Golden was using had been unknown up until this point due to a [[gag order]], but police were able to tie Andrew Golden to Grant through fingerprint records during the background check for the permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Koon  | first = David  | author-link =  | title = Westside killer seeks handgun permit  | newspaper = Arkansas Times  | date = 2008-12-11  | url = http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=9656fb86-7479-4ec8-88f2-8c7596d09e2e  | accessdate = 2008-12-11  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Johnson's later legal troubles==
On January 1, 2007, Johnson was arrested by the ATF after a traffic stop in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]] on misdemeanor charges of carrying a weapon, a loaded [[9 mm]] [[pistol]], and possession of 21.2 g of marijuana. Though the van that Johnson was riding in was registered to him, the driver was 22-year-old Justin Trammell. Trammell and Johnson reportedly met at Alexander Youth Services Correctional Facility in [[Alexander, Arkansas]], where Trammell was incarcerated after pleading guilty to the 1999 crossbow murder of his father, a crime committed when Trammell was 15. The pair were roommates and provided officers with the same Fayetteville address. Trammell was cited for careless driving and released. Johnson was arrested for possession of marijuana and a loaded weapon and later released on a $1,000 [[bail bond|bond]]. He appeared in court on January 26, 2007 at the [[Washington County, Arkansas]] courthouse.

Johnson was [[indictment|indicted]] by a federal [[grand jury]] on October 24, 2007 for possession of a firearm while either using or addicted to a controlled substance. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Arkansas reported that Johnson pleaded not guilty and was released on a $5,000 bond. Johnson's trial began on January 28, 2008. After two days of testimony from the prosecution and the defense witnesses, Johnson was found guilty on a charge of possessing a weapon while being a drug user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kait8.com/Global/story.asp?S=7799368|title=Mitchell Johnson Trial Wrap-Up|author=Will Carter|publisher=KAIT|place=Jonesboro, Arkansas|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, just days after his conviction, Johnson was arrested again, now for possession of marijuana at the convenience store he worked at and on suspicion of using a stolen credit card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/215935/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216192928/http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/215935/|archivedate=2008-02-16|title=Johnson suspected in theft of debit card|author=Michelle Bradford|publisher=Arkansas Democrat Gazette|edition=Northwest Arkansas|date=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2008, US District Judge [[Jimm Larry Hendren]] sentenced Mitchell Johnson to four years in prison on the weapon and drug charges. During his sentencing, the judge expressed dismay that Johnson had not taken advantage of the chance he had to go straight. He told him, "No matter your sentence, you still have a life; those killed in 1998 do not." On October 7, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to a felony theft charge and misdemeanor possession of [[marijuana]]. Johnson admitted that he stole a debit card left by a disabled man at the Bentonville gas station where he worked and subsequently used it to purchase a meal at a local [[Burger King]]. He also admitted that at the time he was arrested, he was in possession of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.katv.com/news/stories/1008/559725.html|title=Johnson Pleads Guilty to Theft, Drug Charges|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KATV7 News|date=October 8, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2010|url=http://www.katv.com/news/stories/1008/559725.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-10-08-johnson-plea_N.htm?csp=34|title=Jonesboro shooter pleads guilty to theft|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 2008, Johnson, now 24 years old, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the theft charge and misdemeanor possession charges. Although Johnson could have faced up to 30 years, the sentence of 12 years was chosen because Johnson technically had no criminal record from the Jonesboro shooting.&lt;ref name=Nov1408&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Nov14/0,4670,JonesboroShooter,00.html|title=Jonesboro shooter gets more prison time in Ark.|author=Jon Gambrell|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox|date=November 14, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jonesboro%20shooter%20gets%20more%20prison%20time%20in%20Ark.-a01611715341|archivedate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2009, Johnson was sentenced to six additional years in prison for an additional charge of theft by receiving and financial identity fraud for using the stolen card to purchase a meal from a local Burger King. Circuit Judge William Storey told Johnson, "You continue to run afoul of the law. I am hopeful this is the last time." That brought Johnson's combined state sentences to 18 years.&lt;ref name=Jan2309&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gd6cfuZSo6foVCQPo6GjSHh3gMfAD95SVJF01|title=Ark. school shooter gets extra 6 years for theft|agency=Associated Press|date=January 23, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ark.%20school%20shooter%20gets%20extra%206%20years%20for%20theft-a01611776069|archivedate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] granted Johnson leave to appeal his sentence by saying that the trial judge should not have admitted evidence of the juvenile convictions during the sentencing phase of the theft and possession trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/dpp/news/local/021210-apx-jonesboro-shooter-can-appeal-theft-plea |author=Jill Zeman Bleed |agency=Associated Press |title=Jonesboro Shooter Can Appeal Theft Plea |date=February 12, 2010 |place=Little Rock, Arkansas |publisher=Fox |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728052647/http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/dpp/news/local/021210-apx-jonesboro-shooter-can-appeal-theft-plea |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson will have to complete his federal sentence of four years after serving his 18-year state sentence.&lt;ref name=Jan2309/&gt; He could have remained incarcerated well into his thirties but was eligible for parole from his Arkansas sentence in 2011, after which he served the four-year federal sentence. In February 2016, ABC News reported online that Johnson was released in July 2015 into the custody of the US Probation Office for the Southern District of Texas and placed in a drug rehabilitation program. The office did not respond to ABC News' multiple requests for comment. It was pointed out that Johnson and Golden were the only two living "school shooters" who were not incarcerated.

'''Amber Gail "Aimee" Creek'''&lt;ref name=uncle/&gt; was an American 14-year-old girl from [[Palatine, Illinois]], who was murdered in February 1997. Creek's body was found in [[Burlington, Wisconsin]] not long after she ran away from a youth shelter. Creek remained unidentified for approximately one year, and it was not until April 2014 that police arrested a suspect, James Eaton, a native of Palatine. Eaton pled guilty to a reduced charge of [[reckless homicide]] in late 2016.&lt;ref name=plead/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police make arrest in Amber Creek cold case|url=http://video.wgntv.com/Police-make-arrest-in-Amber-Creek-cold-case-25791990?playlistId=12184#.U64fKPldXTo|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=WGN News|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Wis. police make arrest in 1997 slaying of Ill. teen|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-wisconsin-police-make-arrest-in-1997-slaying-of-illinois-teen/|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=CBS News|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Amber Gail Creek was born on July 12, 1982, in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], and was raised in [[Palatine, Illinois]].

==Disappearance==
Creek ran away from a juvenile shelter for abused and neglected children in [[Chicago]] on January 23, 1997, and was reported missing. She was last seen alive in February 1997, attending a hotel party with a group of men in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=geoff/&gt;

Eaton's original charges consisted of first-degree murder and concealing a body, which carried a sentence of life in prison.&lt;ref name=set&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Doug T.|title=Trial set for Palatine man charged in girl's 1997 slaying|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150609/news/150608818/|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=Daily Times|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He pleaded not guilty to both charges at his October 2014 [[arraignment]].&lt;ref name=not&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zambo|first1=Kristen|title=Not guilty pleas in Amber Creek killing|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/not-guilty-pleas-in-amber-creek-killing/article_436d882a-d073-11e3-a873-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=28 June 2014|newspaper=Journal Times|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial itself was scheduled to begin in November 2015.&lt;ref name=vio/&gt; His defense attorney has stated that they had not been given all of the evidence available in the case, despite strong indication that he played some role in Creek's death.&lt;ref name=delay2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zambo|first1=Kristin|title=Evidence delay in runaway slaying|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/evidence-delay-in-runaway-slaying/article_06a67a4c-b817-59ef-a7fc-5d23a1f02028.html|accessdate=22 January 2015|work=Journal Times|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140610/news/140619829/ | title=Prosecutors get more time to prepare case against Palatine man | work=Daily Herald | date=10 June 2015 | accessdate=November 24, 2015 | author=Graham, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final pretrial conference and trial were later delayed to May 31 and June 6, 2016, respectively, as the defense was attempting to locate an individual to examine the bite mark on Creek's neck as well as the DNA from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151009/news/151008718/ | title=Trial date delayed for Palatine man charged in girl's 1997 slaying | work=Daily Herald | date=9 October 2015 | accessdate=November 24, 2015 | author=Graham, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/cold-case-homicide-trial-delayed-for-bite-mark-expert/article_a9d8d4e4-6de9-5aef-84c5-a44197d845ba.html | title=Cold-case homicide trial delayed for bite mark expert | work=The Journal Times | date=9 October 2015 | accessdate=November 24, 2015 | author=Zambo, Kristen | location=Racine, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge, convinced by Eaton's attorney, eventually ruled that information that was obtained through interrogation of Eaton after his arrest, including his reaction to Amber's photographs, could not be used in court, as police had continued to interrogate him after he requested getting a lawyer, which they did not acknowledge until his third request, on April 5, 2014. However, it was ruled that information obtained by police the next day could still be used.&lt;ref name=vio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zambo|first1=Kristin|title=Right to counsel violated during interrogation of defendant in Amber Creek case|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/right-to-counsel-violated-during-interrogation-of-defendant-in-amber/article_413fe5df-c556-5117-b1ff-cdd1c1279205.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=The Journal Times|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=supp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Doug T.|title=Defense seeks to suppress statements in Amber Creek case|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150128/news/150128689/|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=Daily Herald|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nautilina''' is the last suborder of the [[Nautilida]] and the only [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]] living since the end of the [[Triassic]]. The Nautilina, proposed by Shimanskiy, is basically the [[Nautilaceae]] of Kummel, 1964, defined by Furnish and Glenister, but differs in omitting two families, the Paracenoceratidae and Pseudonautilidae which instead are placed in the Liroceratina. 

The Nautilina are derived from the [[Syringonautilidae]], a family in the [[Centroceratina]] (Trigonocerataceae), in the Late Triassic and consists of four families, the Nautilidae, [[Cymatoceratidae]], Herocoglossidae, and Aturiidae. The Nautilidae which is the root stock of the suborder includes the living ''[[Nautilus]]'' 

The Nautilidae are involute or slightly evolute and generally smooth with straight to sinuous sutures. The Cymatoceratidae which are the most common of the Cretaceous nautiloids are strongly ribbed. The Hercoglossidae are smooth but with differentiated sutures, in some with deep lateral lobes and well-developed saddles. The Aturiidae (Aturia) is similar to the Hercoglossidae except for being more discoidal and having a more complex suture and subdorsal siphuncle. 

The Nautilidae gave rise to the Cymatoceratidae and Hercoglossidae during the Jurassic while the Herocoglossidae became ancestral to the Aturiidae near the beginning of the Cenozoic. The Cymatoceratidae and Hercoglossidae became extinct near the end of the  Paleogene while the Aturiidae reached into the Neogene. Only the Nautilidae remain.

'''New Harvest''' is a donor-funded research institute dedicated to the field of [[cellular agriculture]], focusing on advances in scientific research efforts surrounding [[In vitro meat|cultured animal products]]. It highlights growing [[Environmental impact of meat production|environmental]] and [[Cruelty to animals#Industrial animal farming|ethical]] concerns associated with [[Intensive animal farming|industrial livestock production]].

The 501(c)(3) non-profit was established in 2004. Today, New Harvest funds university-based research to develop breakthroughs in cellular agriculture, such as new culture media formulations, bioreactors, and methods of tissue assembly for the production of cultured meat.

New Harvest organizes a yearly conference – among the first professional conferences related to cellular agriculture – where it connects scientists, entrepreneurs, and other interested parties in the biosciences and food security fields.

== History ==
In 2004, New Harvest was founded by [[Jason Gaverick Matheny|Jason Matheny]] to fund academic research into the use of cell cultures, instead of live animals, to grow meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Needs -|url = http://www.new-harvest.org/research-needs/|website = www.new-harvest.org|accessdate = 2015-06-03|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150608125949/http://www.new-harvest.org/research-needs/|archivedate = 2015-06-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matheny became interested in cultured meat after researching infectious diseases in India for a Master's degree in public health. In the course of his research, he toured a poultry farm outside Delhi where he saw "tens of thousands of chickens in a metal warehouse, doped with drugs, living in their own manure and being bred for production traits that caused them to be immune-compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14233-advertising-feature-biotechnology.html?page=1|title=Advertising feature: Biotechnology|accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the experience made him recognize the need for a new way to meet a global demand for meat that is "exponentially growing" in even a traditionally vegetarian country like India.

When Matheny returned to the States, he read about a NASA-funded project that "grew" goldfish meat to explore food possibilities for astronauts on long-range space missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fish fillets grow in tank|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2066-fish-fillets-grow-in-tank.html|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted all 60 of the cited authors and teamed up with three—a tissue engineer, cell biologist and animal scientist—to consider the viability of producing cultured meat on a large scale. In 2005, their research was published in the journal ''[http://tej.sagepub.com/ Tissue Engineering]'' which generated considerable public and scientific interest in New Harvest.

When a new Executive Director, Isha Datar, was appointed in 2013, New Harvest's focus grew to include other animal commodities like milk and eggs, that could be produced by biotechnology rather than livestock. Since 2014, New Harvest has helped found two start-up companies, '''[http://muufri.com/ Muufri]''' and '''[http://www.clarafoods.com/ Clara Foods]'''.

== Startup companies ==

===Perfect Day===
Isha Datar, Perumal Gandhi and Ryan Pandya (two New Harvest volunteers) founded Muufri in 2014 to produce an animal-free cow's milk via biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Milk Grown in a Lab Is Humane and Sustainable.

=== Clara Foods ===
Isha Datar, David Anchel, and Arturo Elizondo founded Clara Foods in February 2015 to develop a chickenless egg white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Company Sets Out to Make Egg Whites Without the Chickens!|url = http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/new-company-makes-egg-whites-without-the-chickens/|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company participated in the Indie.Bio accelerator program in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Egg Whites, Rhino Horns, And Stem Cells: IndieBio's Plan To Bioengineer A Better World|url = http://www.fastcoexist.com/3044581/egg-whites-rhino-horns-and-stem-cells-indiebios-plan-to-bioengineer-a-better-world|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara Foods is working to produce an egg white that is cholesterol-free and salmonella-free, while using lower land and water inputs and available at a reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome|url = http://www.clarafoods.com/|website = Clara Foods|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isha Datar'''
[[File:Isha Datar (29669893021).jpg|thumb|Isha Datar 2016]]
Datar holds a BSc. in Cell &amp; Molecular Biology from the University of Alberta, where she contributed to Canada's first cultured meat laboratory, and an M.Biotech from the University of Toronto. Datar said she was inspired by a meat science course to explore the environmental consequences of livestock production. In 2010, she coauthored a publication for Possibilities of an In Vitro Meat Production System, which applied tissue engineering technology to the cultured meat application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isha Datar Can Grow Your Steak in a Lab|url = http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/isha-datar-can-grow-your-steak-in-a-lab/31981|accessdate = 2015-06-03|first = Laura|last = Palet}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke at 2012 TEDxToronto about cultured meat and was soon after appointed as the head of New Harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Watch "Re-Thinking Meat: Isha Datar at TEDxToronto" Video at TEDxTalks|url = http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Re-Thinking-Meat-Isha-Datar-at|website = TEDxTalks|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a one-third founder of the start-up company Muufri, which is producing an animal-free cow's milk.

== Animal Charity Evaluators review ==
Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) named New Harvest as one of its Standout Charities in its 2015 and 2016 annual charity recommendations.&lt;ref name=ace-review&gt;{{cite web |url=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/charity-review/new-harvest/ |title=New Harvest |author=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=December 2015 |accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="updated"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/updated-recommendations-december-2016/|title=Updated Recommendations: December 2016|author=Jon Bockman|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACE designates as Standout Charities those organizations which they do not feel are as strong as their Top Charities, but which excel in at least one way and are exceptionally strong compared to animal charities in general.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/our-thinking-on-standout-organizations/ |title=Our Thinking on Standout Organizations |author=Allison Smith |date=June 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE cites New Harvest's strengths as being one of the few organizations to promote [[cellular agriculture]], which could drastically reduce animal suffering by reducing or replacing animal agriculture.  Their weaknesses, according to ACE, include their limited track record and concerns over the realism of their plans for growth.&lt;ref name=ace-review /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Pandulf II''' (died 13 July 982) was the [[prince of Salerno]] (981), the second of such princes of the family of the [[princes of Capua]]. He was originally appointed heir to the childless [[Gisulf I of Salerno]], who had been reinstated on his throne by Pandulf's father, [[Pandulf Ironhead]]. On the former's death in 977, he succeeded him as co-prince of Salerno with his father. On the latter's death in March 981, the Ironhead's great principality was divided such that he inherited only Salerno, while [[Capua]]-[[Benevento]] went to his elder brother [[Landulf IV of Benevento|Landulf IV]].

He was young and was immediately opposed by [[Manso, Duke of Amalfi]], who succeeded in removing him from office and attaining imperial recognition.  Pandulf never regained his principality. He joined his brother, whom a revolt had relegated to Capua alone, and they joined the army of [[Emperor Otto II]] in [[Calabria]], where both died in the [[Battle of Stilo]] against the Saracens on 13 July 982.

'''Plating efficiency''' ("PE") is a measure of the number of [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] originating from single cells. It is a very sensitive test and is often used for determining the nutritional requirements of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], testing [[serous fluid|serum]] lots, measuring the effects of [[growth factors]], and for [[toxicity]] testing.

Plating Efficiency is the number of cells that grow into colonies per 100 cells inoculated. That is, it is the proportion of cells that attach and grow to the number of cells originally plated, expressed as a percentage. PE can be determined by the following formulae:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE} = \frac{\#\, \text{cells on day 1}}{\#\, \text{cells plated on day 0}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE} = \frac{\#\, \text{colonies counted}}{\#\, \text{cells inoculated}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;
The first method is more accurate.

[[Cell growth]] in [[Cell culture|culture]] generally undergoes a decline after [[plating]], and graphically, PE is the global minimum (lowest point) of the growth curve at day one, after which growth rises again. The decrease in viable cells after plating is due to "anchorage-dependence"--cells must attach to the bottom of the culture dish.

Plating Efficiency is one of the parameters typically used to define  growth properties of cells in culture. Other common parameters are [[doubling time]] ("DT") (which is an average of [[generation time]] ("GT")), and saturation density ("SD").

The rebirth doctrine in Buddhism, sometimes referred to as reincarnation or metempsychosis, asserts that rebirth does not necessarily take place as another human being, but as an existence in one of the six ''Gati'' (realms) called ''[[Bhavachakra]]''.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The six realms of rebirth include Deva (heavenly), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human), Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (resident of hell).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obeyesekere|first=Gananath| authorlink = Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|page=127|year=2005|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|ISBN=978-8120826090}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|This is discussed in many Suttas of different Nikayas.

The rebirth doctrine has been a subject of scholarly studies within Buddhism since ancient times, particularly in reconciling the rebirth doctrine with its ''[[Anatman_(Hinduism)|Anatman]]'' (no self, no soul) doctrine.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wendy Doniger]]|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC|year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist traditions have disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neufeldt1986p123"/&gt; Some Buddhist traditions assert that "no self" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is ''avacya'' (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that [[Vijnana]] (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;{{Sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}}&lt;ref&gt;"Post-Classical Developments in the Concepts of Karma and Rebirth in Theravada Buddhism." by Bruce Matthews. in ''Karma and Rebirth: Post-Classical Developments'' State Univ of New York Press: 1986 {{ISBN|0-87395-990-6}} pg 125;&lt;br&gt;Collins, Steven.

== Buddhist terminology and doctrine ==
There is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms "rebirth", "metempsychosis", "transmigration" or "reincarnation" in the traditional Buddhist languages of Pāli and Sanskrit. Rebirth is referred to by various terms, representing an essential step in the endless cycle of ''samsara'', terms such as "re-becoming" or "becoming again"(Sanskrit: punarbhava, Pali: punabbhava), re-born (''punarjanman''), re-death (''punarmrityu''), or sometimes just "becoming" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[bhava]]), while the state one is born into, the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way, is referred to simply as "birth" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[Jati (Buddhism)|jāti]]).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=71-73}} The entire universal process of beings being reborn again and again is called "wandering about" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]).

Some English-speaking Buddhists prefer the term "rebirth" or "re-becoming" (Sanskrit: ''punarbhava''; Pali: ''punabbhava'') to "[[reincarnation]]" as they take the latter to imply an entity (soul) that is reborn.&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt; Buddhism denies there is any such soul or self in a living being, but does assert that there is a cycle of transmigration consisting of rebirth and redeath as the fundamental nature of existence.&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name=6sourcesatmanfmt/&gt;

== Historical context ==
Before the time of the Buddha, many ideas on the nature of existence, birth and death were in vogue. The ancient Indian [[Vedic]] and [[Sramana]] schools affirmed the idea of soul, karma and cycle of rebirth. The competing Indian materialist schools denied the idea of soul, karma and rebirth, asserting instead that there is just one life, there is no rebirth, and death marks complete annihilation.{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|pp=38-43, 138-140}} From these diverse views, Buddha accepted the premises and concepts related to rebirth,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=708}} but introduced innovations.&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt; According to various Buddhist scriptures, Buddha believed in other worlds,

{{Quote|
Since there actually is another world (any world other than the present human one, i.e. different rebirth realms), one who holds the view 'there is no other world' has wrong view...
|Buddha, Majjhima Nikaya i.402, Apannaka Sutta|translated by Peter Harvey&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt;}}

Buddha also asserted that there is karma, which influences the future suffering through the cycle of rebirth, but added that there is a way to  end the cycle of karmic rebirths through ''nirvana''.&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neufeldt1986p123"/&gt; The Buddha introduced the concept that there is no soul (self) tying the cycle of rebirths, in contrast to themes asserted by various Hindu and Jaina traditions, and this central concept in Buddhism is called ''[[Anatman|anattā]]''; Buddha also affirmed the idea that all compounded things are subject to dissolution at death or ''[[Impermanence|anicca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma's review of [[Hajime Nakamura]]'s ''A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy'', Philosophy East and West, Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul., 1987), page 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's detailed conception of the connections between action (karma), rebirth and causality is set out in the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Doniger1999"/&gt;

== Ideas of rebirth ==
There are many references to rebirth in the early Buddhist scriptures. These are some of the more important; Mahakammavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 136); Upali Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 56); Kukkuravatika Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 57); Moliyasivaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21); Sankha Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 42.8).

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''The Buddha and Rebirths'''&lt;br&gt;
The texts report that on the night of his enlightenment the Buddha gained the ability to recall his previous lives. It is said that he remembered not just one or two, but a vast number, together with the details of what his name, caste, profession, and so forth had been in each life. Elsewhere, the Buddha states that he could remember back 'as far as ninety one eons' (''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'' i.483), one eon being roughly equal to the lifespan of a solar system.

Rebirth is discussed in Buddhist scriptures with various terms, such as ''Āgati-gati'', ''Punarbhava'' and others. The term ''Āgati'' literally means 'coming back, return', while ''Gati'' means 'going away' and ''Punarbhava'' means 're-becoming'.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=94–95, 281–282, 294–295, 467, 499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1azdAAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-78329-6|pages=95–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Āgati-gati'' in the sense of rebirth and re-death appears in many places in early Buddhist texts, such as in Samyutta Nikaya III.53, Jataka II.172, Digha Nikaya I. 162, Anguttara III.54-74 and Petavatthu II.9.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt; ''Punarbhava'' in the sense of rebirth, similarly appears in many places, such as in Digha II.15, Samyutta I.133 and 4.201, Itivuttaka 62, Sutta-nipata 162, 273, 502, 514 and 733.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt; Numerous other terms for rebirths are found in the Buddhist scriptures, such as ''Punagamana'', ''Punavasa'', ''Punanivattati'', ''Abhinibbatti'', and words with roots of ''*jati'' and ''*rupa''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt;

===Mechanism===
While all Buddhist traditions except [[Navayana]] accept some notion of rebirth, they differ in their theories about rebirth mechanism and precisely how events unfold after the moment of death. The early Buddhist texts suggest that Buddha faced a difficulty in explaining what is reborn and how rebirth occurs, after he innovated the concept that there is "no self" ([[Anatta]]).&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p115"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The texts also suggest that the ''Anicca'' theory led to difficulties in explaining that there is a permanent consciousness that moves from life to life.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p115"/&gt; Later Buddhist scholars such as Buddhaghosa suggested that the lack of a self or soul does not mean lack of continuity; and the rebirth across different realms of birth – such as heavenly, human, animal, hellish and others – occurs in the same way that a flame is transferred from one candle to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William H.

The [[Sautrantika]] sub-school of the Saravastivada Buddhist tradition, that emerged in 2nd century BCE, and influenced the 4th-century CE [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism, introduced the idea of "transmigrating substratum of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Sautrantika Sautrāntika], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that each personal act "perfumes" the individual and leads to the planting of a "seed" that would later germinate as a good or bad karmic result.

The [[Pudgalavada]] school of early Buddhism accepted the core premise of Buddhism that there is no ''attā'' (ātman, soul, self), but asserted that there is a "personal entity" (''pudgala'', ''puggala'') that retains a karma balance sheet and is mechanistically involved in rebirth; this personal entity, stated Pudgalavada Buddhists, is neither different nor identical to the five aggregates (skandhas).&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"/&gt; This concept of personal entity to explain rebirth by Pudgalavada Buddhists was polemically attacked by Theravada Buddhists in early 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"/&gt; The personal entity concept was rejected by the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar [[Buddhaghosa]], who attempted to explain rebirth mechanism with "rebirth-linking consciousness" (''patisandhi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Mathews|editor=Ronald Wesley Neufeldt|title=Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-990-2|pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDermott|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C&amp;pg=PA169|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03923-0|pages=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
Some schools conclude that karma continued to exist and adhere to the person until it had worked out its consequences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Theravada]] Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] schools hold to the notion of a [[bardo]] (intermediate state) that can last up to forty-nine days.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|pp=49-50, 708-709}}&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''.

=== Rebirth realms ===
In traditional [[Buddhist cosmology]] the rebirth, also called reincarnation or metempsychosis, can be in any of six realms. These are called the ''Gati'' in cycles of re-becoming, ''[[Bhavachakra]]''.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The six realms of rebirth include three good realms – Deva (heavenly, god), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human); and three evil realms – Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (hellish).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The realm of rebirth is conditioned by the [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] (deeds, intent) of current and previous lives;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obeyesekere|first=Gananath|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|page=127|year=2005|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|ISBN=978-8120826090}}&lt;/ref&gt; good karmas will yield a happier rebirth into good realm, bad karmas is believed to produce rebirth which is more unhappy and evil .&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;

== Buddhist arguments for rebirth ==

=== Parapsychological evidence ===
Ancient Buddhists as well as some [[Buddhist modernism|moderns]] cite the reports of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and his disciples of having gained direct knowledge into their own past lives as well as those of other beings through a kind of [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] ability or [[extrasensory perception]] (termed [[Abhijñā|''abhiñña'']]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Bhikkhu Analayo]], Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research, Foreword by [[Henepola Gunaratana|Bhante Gunaratna]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Narada Thera, Buddhism in a nutshell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Buddhist philosophers have defended the concept of special yogic perception (''yogipratyakṣa'') which is able to empirically verify the truth of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), Dharmakirti, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Buddhists have also pointed to [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena as possible empirical evidence for rebirth, mainly [[Near-death experience|near-death experiences]], [[past life regression]], [[reincarnation research]] and [[xenoglossy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Analayo]], Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research, section III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical arguments ===
Besides defending the status of the Buddha as an epistemically authoritative or reliable person (''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]] puruṣa''), Indian [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophers]] like [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] (c. 480–540 CE) and [[Dharmakirti]] (fl. c. 6th or 7th century), as well as [[Buddhist logico-epistemology#Dignaga-Dharmakirti school|later commentators on their works]], also put forth philosophical arguments in favor of rebirth and especially directed against the [[Reductionism|reductionist]] [[Materialism|materialist]] philosophy of the [[Charvaka|Carvaka]] school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hayes, Richard P. Dharmakirti on punarbhava,1993.&lt;/ref&gt; To defend rebirth, Dharmakirti initially focuses on refuting the materialist doctrine of the Carvaka school, which held that the support (''asraya'') for cognition is the body and that when the body is destroyed, cognition is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, Dharmakīrti on compassion and rebirth, Arbeitskreis für Tibetische und Buddhistische Studien, Universität Wien, 1997, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard P. Hayes]], Dharmakirti denied that mental events were a mere byproduct of the body, instead holding that "both mental events and physical events can be seen as effects of the same set of causal conditions."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Dharmakirti, all events are dependent on multiple causes, and they must be preceded by an "antecendent causal condition" of the same class. This means that all mental events ''must have'' a previous mental event as part of its causal nexus (presumably stretching back before one's birth). According to Hayes, Dharmakirti holds therefore that "both physical factors and nonphysical factors play a role in the formation of mental events", if not there would be no difference between sentient beings and inanimate matter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eli Franco mentions that for Dharmakirti, the position that cognition "can arise from the body alone, independent of their similar causes" at the moment of birth is irrational. That is, if the mind is not being conditioned by a previous cognitive event, then it cannot arise from inert matter.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, Dharmakīrti on compassion and rebirth, Arbeitskreis für Tibetische und Buddhistische Studien, Universität Wien, 1997, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmakirti also argues that mental events can causally condition physical events, and thus there is no reason to privilege matter as being primary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Martin Willson, this kind of argument is the most commonly used in the Tibetan philosophical tradition to establish the truth of rebirth and in its most simple form can be put as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;With respect to the knowing (consciousness or mind) of an ordinary being just born: &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;it is preceded by earlier knowing; because it is knowing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Willson notes that this relies on two further assumptions, the first is that any mental continuum must have previous causes, the second is that [[materialism]] is false and that mind cannot emerge solely from matter ([[emergentism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Indian Buddhist philosophers who argued in this way attempted to disprove the theories of materialists ([[Charvaka|Carvaka]]).

[[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] makes a similar argument. According to the Abhidhamma teacher Nina van Gorkom, physical and mental events (''[[Dhamma theory|dhammas]]'') both depend on each other and on previous events of the same category (i.e. mental events must also be conditioned by previous mental events, and so on). In Abhidhamma, the mental event (''citta'') which arises at the first moment of life is called the rebirth consciousness or ''patisandhi-citta.'' According to van Gorkom, "there isn’t any citta which arises without conditions, the ''patisandhi-citta'' must also have conditions. The ''patisandhi-citta'' is the first ''citta'' of a new life and thus its cause can only be in the past."&lt;ref&gt;van Gorkom, Nina, Abhidhamma in Daily Life, 2009 p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pragmatic arguments and wager theories ===
Various Buddhists and interpreters of the Buddhist texts such as [[David Kalupahana]] and [[Étienne Lamotte|Etienne Lamotte]], have argued that the Buddha is a kind of [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] regarding truth, and that he saw truths as important only when they were [[Soteriology|soteriologically]] useful.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Ethics in Early Buddhism, 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Buddhist position on rebirth could be defended on pragmatic grounds instead of empirical or logical grounds. Some modern Buddhists have taken this position.

The American monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] has argued for the acceptance of the Buddhist idea of rebirth as a type of pragmatic [[Pascal's Wager|wager argument]] ([[Pali]]: ''apaṇṇaka'', "safe bet" or "guarantee"). Thanissaro argues that "the Buddha stated that it's a safe wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime for also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the opposite."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, The Truth of Rebirth and Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice © 2012 https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thanissaro cites [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 60 (''Apaṇṇaka sutta'') where the Buddha says that if there is an afterlife, those who perform bad actions have "made a bad throw twice" (because they are harmed in this world and in the next) while those who perform good actions will not, and thus he calls his teaching a "safe-bet teaching".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Thanissaro:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal's wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one's life is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one's life here and now, and the good rewards of one's actions in the afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.060.than.html|title=Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Apannaka Sutta: A Safe Bet, 2008|last=|first=|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] Buddhist philosopher [[K. N. Jayatilleke|K.N. Jayatilleke]] writes that the Buddha's "wager argument" in MN 60 is that a rational person (''viññu puriso'') would reason as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 375, 406-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with rebirth doctrines in Hinduism and Jainism ==

The '''Red Lake shootings''' were a [[spree killer|spree killing]] that occurred on March 21, 2005, in two places on the [[Red Lake Indian Reservation]] in [[Red Lake, Minnesota]], United States. That morning, 16-year-old [[Jeffrey Weise]] killed his grandfather (a tribal police officer) and his grandfather's girlfriend at their home. After taking his grandfather's police weapons and vest, Weise drove his grandfather's police vehicle to [[Red Lake Senior High School]], where he had been a student some months before.

Weise shot and killed seven people at the school and wounded five others. The dead included an unarmed [[security guard]] at the entrance of the school, then a teacher and five students. After the police arrived, Weise exchanged gunfire with them. After being wounded, he shot and killed himself, committing [[suicide]] in a vacant classroom.

== Background ==
By some accounts, at the time of the shooting Weise was living with his paternal grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., a sergeant with the Red Lake Police Department, run by the Red Lake [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwe]] tribal government. The household included his grandfather's younger girlfriend, Michelle Leigh Sigana. His paternal aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier said he had lived mostly with them for the past several years, and they helped him get treatment to deal with some of his behavioral issues and [[Mood disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="Helms"&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/03/25_helmsm_prozacfolo/ Marisa Helms, "Shooting fuels debate over safety of Prozac for teens"], Minnesota Public Radio, 25 March 2005, accessed 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Jeff Weise's mother suffered severe brain damage in a car accident and since then had to receive care in a nursing home. Still a child, Weise was forced to move from Minneapolis to live with his father's family on the reservation. His father had committed [[suicide]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; so Weise was officially placed with his grandmother, Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier.&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier helped care for him, especially after the grandmother's death in 2003.

The reservation of the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe (aka Chippewa) is in northwest Minnesota and is one of two nationally that are "closed"; only Ojibwe tribal members may live there and own land. Its residents suffer high rates of unemployment, violence, and suicide. Housing is poor, and many students do not finish high school.&lt;ref name="Maag" /&gt; Work opportunities are limited on the reservation, which has a population of more than 5,000. A study in 2004 found that a high proportion of students in high school had thought of suicide.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2005/08/08/red_lake/ Kimberly Sevcik, "Reservation for Death"], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', 8 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shootings ==
The day of the shootings, Weise retrieved a [[Ruger MK II]] [[.22 LR|.22 caliber]] pistol from his bedroom and fatally shot his grandfather as he was sleeping; he shot him two times in the head and ten times in the chest. According to Weise's friends, the teenager may have had the gun for as long as a year. He took Lussier's two police-issue weapons, a [[.40 S&amp;W|.40 caliber]] [[Glock 23]] [[pistol]] and a [[Remington 870]] [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]], a gunbelt and a bullet-proof vest.&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt; He fatally shot Sigana, his grandfather's girlfriend, two times in the head as she carried laundry up the stairs.

Weise drove his grandfather's [[Police car|squad car]] to [[Red Lake Senior High School]], arriving at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[North American Central Time Zone|Central Standard Time]]. As he entered the school through the main entrance, he encountered two unarmed security guards manning a [[metal detector]]. Weise shot and killed Derrick Brun, while the other security guard escaped without injury. Weise proceeded into the main corridor of the school.

He began shooting into an English classroom, killing three students and one teacher, and wounding three students.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[http://guardian.co.uk/usguns/Story/0,2763,1443322,00.html "Ten dead in US school shooting | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Lajeunesse said that Chase Lussier (no direct relation to [[Daryl Lussier]]) sheltered her, and was one of those shot by Weise. Jeffrey May, a 16-year-old [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]], tried to wrestle Weise inside the classroom, and stabbed him in the stomach with a [[pencil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/24/national/main682915.shtml?source=search_story "Tales Of School Shooting Bravery, Slain Security Guard, Wounded Student Saved Others From Teen Gunman"], CBS News, 24 March 2005, accessed 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His diversion allowed students to flee the classroom to safety, but Weise shot May two times in the neck and once in the jaw, leaving him seriously injured.&lt;ref name="Maag"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1042470,00.html?promoid=googlep Chris Maag, "The Devil in Red Lake"], ''TIME Magazine'', 27 March 2005, accessed 19 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses said Weise smiled as he was shooting at people. One witness said that Weise asked a student if he believed in [[God]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; This is believed to have been a reference to a widely publicized exchange during the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] between [[Dylan Klebold]] and Valeen Schnurr, a Columbine survivor.

At around 2:52&amp;nbsp;p.m., Weise returned to the main entrance, where he killed two students and wounded two others. The police had arrived quickly and engaged him in gunfire. [[FBI]] special agent Paul McCabe said the shootout lasted for about four minutes. None of the officers were injured.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; After being hit in the abdomen and right arm, Weise retreated to a vacant classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709094008/http://kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=77443 New Header&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], KARE 11 News&lt;/ref&gt; He leaned against a wall, put the shotgun barrel to his chin, and fired, killing himself.&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt;

The night after the shooting, many people of the community gathered at the high school gymnasium for a healing ceremony. They used traditional Ojibwe ceremony and prayer.&lt;ref name="Maag" /&gt;

Within days, preparations started for funerals on the reservation. Tribal members drew from Ojibwe traditions as well as Catholic rites. They "collected bundles of [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], to be given as gifts and burned during funeral ceremonies."&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; Families picked personal items to be placed in the caskets.&lt;ref name="Sage"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/24/nation/na-shooting24 P.J.

== Aid to victims and families ==

Minnesota has a state fund that aids victims and their families. In addition, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa established a memorial fund; it reached $200,000 in donations from across the country by April 2005. Initially the tribe made 15 grants of $5,000 each to victims and families, including one to Weise's relatives. A tribal spokesman noted his family was not eligible for state compensation and said that they carried "a double burden." The grant was to help pay for Weise's funeral and burial.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/15/nation/na-redlake15 "Tribe Gives Victims Aid to Shooter's Family, Citing a 'Double Burden'"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 April 2005, accessed 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2006, the Red Lake school district reached a settlement with the families of the massacre victims. The school district agreed to pay $1,000,000 total to 21 of the victims' families, the maximum amount allowed by Minnesota law. Of the settlement, $900,000 will immediately be granted to the families, and the remaining $100,000 will be set aside for future distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mninjurylaw.com/html/recent-client-settlements/Judge-signs-1-million-order-for-Red-Lake-school-shooting-victims-families.html|title=Rodgers Law Office - Bemidji, MN|website=www.mninjurylaw.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrator ==
Jeffrey Weise was labeled an outsider in the community and had been placed in "homebound" schooling for breaking school rules.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He is remembered as a quiet kid, that normally wore a black trench coat, and gel in his hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/03/18/red-lake-victims|title=The shooting at Red Lake: The victims|last=Enger|first=John|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weise had grown up with a difficult and disrupted family life; his parents were a young unmarried couple who separated before he was born. His 17-year-old mother's family insisted that Joanne Weise give up her son to the father, who was a few years older. Jeff Weise did not live again with his mother until after he was two years old, when she reclaimed him and took him to Minneapolis. In later Internet postings, Weise wrote that his mother had become an [[alcoholic]] who was sometimes physically and emotionally abusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2005/04/03/a-bloody-day-on-the-rez.html "A Bloody Day on the Rez"], ''Newsweek,'' 4 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 she started dating Timothy Troy DesJarlait, and they married in 1998 after having had two children together. Jeffrey attended several different schools during his years as a student.

In 1997, when Weise was eight, his father Daryl Lussier, Jr. committed suicide by shooting himself.&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Monica. "Tribe Buries 3 on a Long Road to Healing," ''The New York Times'', 26 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He had a standoff over several days with the Red Lake Police Department in Red Lake, where his father Daryl Lussier, Sr. was a sergeant with the tribal police.

In 1999, when Weise was ten, his mother was in a car accident and suffered severe brain damage. She had to be committed to a nursing home for rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE7DF173FF937A15750C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 MONICA DAVEY and JODI WILGOREN, "Signs of Danger Were Missed in Troubled Teenager's Life"], ''New York Times'', 24 March 2005, accessed 19 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; After separating from her in 2000, Timothy DesJarlait divorced Weise's mother in May 2004.

Jeff was placed in the custody of his paternal grandmother Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier, who lived on the Red Lake Reservation. He had to leave Minneapolis, where he had lived most of his life, to be with her and other paternal relatives.

=== Motives ===
Police investigators began searching for a motive behind the shootings. According to their findings and media reports, Weise was often bullied or teased in school by classmates. A tall youth weighing 250 pounds (115&amp;nbsp;kg), he was known to wear dark eyeliner,&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; as well as a long black [[trench coat]] and other black clothing to school year round.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; He was referred to as a "[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid" by many of his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/nation/11200369.htm "Shooter is described as 'Goth kid'"]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram|Star-Telegram]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He did not usually respond to taunts. Some fellow students thought of him as a loner, but he had his own circle of friends.

Jeff Weise expressed frustration about living in Red Lake, and felt his life was beyond his control. During these years, he got close to his grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., who gave him a bedroom of his own. Lussier, Sr. lived with his companion Michele Sigana. Weise was said to have a good relationship with his grandfather.&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt;

Although Jeff had been separated from his mother and stepfather for years by the time of their divorce in May 2004, he attempted [[suicide]] soon after, and again in June 2004. At that time, his aunts&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt; and the Red Lake Medical Center arranged for Weise to be taken to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he stayed for three days.&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt;

The teen was prescribed [[Prozac]] as an anti-depressant, to be continued as treatment together with counseling. His doctor had increased his dosage a week before the shooting, to 60&amp;nbsp;mg a day of Prozac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antidepressantsfacts.com/counseling-grandfather.htm Chuck Haga, "Family: Teen had 'a good relationship' with the grandfather he killed"], ''[[Minneapolis StarTribune]],''25 March 2005, accessed 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier, with whom Weise lived much of the time at Red Lake, said they had arranged for his medical care and were concerned about the increase in his dosage.&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt; Weise's murders reopened the debate about Prozac use among children and adolescents. In October 2004, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) had issued a warning about its use; but it is still the only anti-depressant approved for use with children.&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt;

Lorene Gurneau, a relative of his paternal grandmother, said she and other family members thought Jeff had never gotten over his father's suicide in 1997. In addition, his mother's car accident in 1999 had left her comatose and in a nursing home, which meant that Jeff had effectively lost both parents by the age of ten.&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt;

=== Internet activities ===
Weise was discovered to have been active on the Internet. According to [[The Smoking Gun]], Weise created two violent [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] animations for the flash website [[Newgrounds]], using the alias "Regret." One animation entitled ''Target Practice'', features a character who murders three people with a [[rifle]], blows up a police car with a grenade, and kills a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]]. The 30-second animation ends with the shooter committing suicide. Weise had created another Flash animation entitled ''Clown'', in which a clown kills a man by eating his head.&lt;ref&gt;Editors (March 23, 2005) [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0323051weise1.html "School Killer's Animated Terror"], Smokinggun.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A LiveJournal account, apparently created by Weise, contained his three entries posted between December 2004 and January 2005. The [[weblog]] was customized to be rendered in black and white. Weise expressed his desire for change and salvation in his life.

Weise was a fan of the music genre known as [[horrorcore]]. It was reported on KARE 11 that Weise was a fan of horrorcore rappers such as [[Mars (rapper)|Mars]], Jimmy Donn and [[Prozak (rapper)|Prozak]].&lt;ref name="KARE"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mywr4UqU0jY YouTube video]&lt;/ref&gt; Weise was known to frequent the Mars website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Mass Murderers|last=Plaza|first=Valrie|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2015|isbn=978-1312961401|location=|pages=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Donn's song "Game Over" (which is a song about a school shooting) was said to be one of Weise's favorite songs, and Weise owned Jimmy Donn's album ''The Darker Side.''&lt;ref name="KARE"/&gt;

== Legacy and memorials ==
Siblings of the victims and survivors participated in the 2018 School Walk Outs, that was designed to show respect for shooting victims seen nationally but especially in Florida and Red Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/education/4417711-red-lake-site-2005-school-shooting-walkout-carries-deep-significance|title=At Red Lake, site of 2005 school shooting, walkout carries deep...|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Forbidden Archeology''==
{{main article|Forbidden Archeology}}
Coauthor Michael Cremo writes in the Preface to the first edition that the work's central claim, that anomalous paleontological evidence dating in many hundreds of thousands of years, with examples such as the [[Laetoli footprints]] (which are thought by paleontologists to have been made by distant ancestors of homo sapiens, perhaps[[Australopithecus afarensis]]), stretching possibilities toward the low millions, suggest that modern human beings "perhaps ... coexisted with more apelike creatures," and that the scientific establishment, influenced by [[confirmation bias]], has suppressed fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. This argument has been critiqued by mainstream scholars from a variety of disciplines.&lt;ref name=Main&gt;

In [[health care]], '''self-care''' is any necessary human regulatory function which is under [[individual]] control, deliberate and self-initiated.&lt;ref name="hacs"&gt;{{cite book |title=Health and Canadian Society: Sociological Perspectives |editor1-last=Coburn |editor1-first=David |chapter=Exploring the Correlates of Self Provided Health Care Behaviour |authors=Alexander Segall and Jay Goldstein |editor2-first=Alex |editor2-last=D'Arcy |editor3-first=George Murray |editor3-last=Torrance |year=1998 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0802080529 |pages=279–280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ4o0TI5LqwC |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that self-care is a fundamental pillar of health and social care means it is an essential component of a modern [[health care system]] governed by [[primary and secondary legislation|regulations and statutes]].&lt;ref name="nuth"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing Theories: Conceptual and Philosophical Foundations |chapter=The Concept of Self Care|last=Kollack |first=Ingrid |editor1-first=Hesook Suzie |editor1-last=Kim, |editor2-first=Ingrid |editor2-last=Kollak |year=2006 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |isbn=0826140068 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OY1OT_0vDaEC |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-care is considered a primary form of care for patients with chronic conditions who make many day-to-day decisions, or self-manage, their [[illness]].&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = PAtient self-management of chronic disease in primary care |journal = JAMA|date = 2002-11-20|issn = 0098-7484|pages = 2469–2475|volume = 288|issue = 19|doi = 10.1001/jama.288.19.2469|last1 = Bodenheimer|first1 = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-management is critical and self-management education complements traditional patient education in [[primary care]] to support patients to live the best possible [[quality of life]] with their chronic condition.&lt;ref name="hacs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; Self-care is learned, purposeful and continuous.&lt;ref name="scs"&gt;{{cite book |title=Self-care Science, Nursing Theory, and Evidence-based Practice |last=Taylor |first=Susan G. |author2=Katherine Renpenning |author3=Kathie McLaughlin Renpenning  |year=2011 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |isbn=0826107796 |page= |pages=39–41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alHquhnlbHwC |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy, self-care refers to the care and cultivation of [[self]] in a comprehensive sense, focusing in particular on the [[soul]] and the knowledge of self.

==Requisites==
{{see also|Activities of daily living}}
There are a number of self-care requisites applicable to all humans across all ages and necessary to [[fundamental human needs]].&lt;ref name="scs"/&gt;  For example, as humans we need to intake sufficient air, water and food; care also needs to be taken with the process of elimination and [[excrement]]. There must be a balance between [[Sleep|rest]] and activity as well as between [[solitude]] and social activities.&lt;ref name="scs"/&gt; The prevention and avoidance of human hazards and participation in social groups are also requisites.  [[Maturity (psychological)|Maturity]] requires the autonomous performance of self-care duties.&lt;ref name="scepashc"/&gt;

Self-care includes all health decisions people (as individuals or consumers) make for themselves and their families to ensure they are [[physical fitness|physically]] and [[mental health|mentally fit]].

=== Self-care maintenance behaviors ===
Self-care maintenance behaviors include illness prevention, illness behaviors, and proper hygiene. Illness prevention measures include tobacco avoidance, [[physical exercise|exercise]], and diet. [[smoking|Tobacco]] use is the largest preventable cause of death and disease in the US.&lt;ref name="Tobacco use"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tobacco use |url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/tobacco-use#4 |website=Healthy People |publisher=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By avoiding or quitting tobacco use, overall health and quality of life are improved and risk of disease and premature death are reduced.&lt;ref name="Tobacco use" /&gt; The benefits of regular physical activity may include weight control, reduced risk of chronic disease, strengthened bones and muscles, improved mental health, improved ability to participate in daily activities, and increased chance of living longer.&lt;ref name="Physical activity and health"&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical activity and health |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/ |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 hours and thirty minutes of moderate activity each week. Examples of this include brisk walking, swimming, dancing, riding a bike, and even jumping rope. Another important aspect to self care includes [[Healthy diet|eating]] fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats and other proteins. Processed foods should be limited. Limiting saturated fats, trans fats, sugars, and sodium will also contribute to a healthy diet.

Illness behaviors include taking medicines as prescribed and getting [[vaccine|vaccinations]]. When medicines are not taken as prescribed, complications can occur. These complications include disease progression, reduced functional abilities, lower quality of life, and increased hospital visits.&lt;ref name="Jimmy &amp; Jose"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jimmy |first1=B |last2=Jose |first2=J |title=Patient medication adherence: Measures in daily practice |journal=Oman Medical Journal |date=2011 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=155–159 |doi=10.5001/omj.2011.38 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccinations helps protect individuals from serious illnesses and complications related to vaccine-preventable diseases like pneumonia.&lt;ref name="Importance of vaccines"&gt;{{cite web |title=Importance of vaccines |url=http://www.vaccineinformation.org/vaccines-save-lives/ |publisher=The Immunization Action Coalition |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hygiene]] is another important part of self-care maintenance. Hygiene behaviors include adequate sleep, regular oral care, and hand washing. Getting 7–8 hours of sleep each night can protect physical and mental health.&lt;ref name="Why is sleep important"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why is sleep important |url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Sleep deficiency can also lead to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref name="Why is sleep important"/&gt; Teeth brushing and personal hygiene can prevent infection.

Self-care maintenance behaviors can be influenced by external factors, such as access to healthcare and living environments. [[Social determinants of health]] play a huge role in how people take care of themselves. Access to care is one major determinant of one's ability to carry out self-care maintenance behaviors.This includes having access to transportation to visit a health care service, availability of open hours of offices/clinics, and whether or not the care is affordable.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havranek|first=E.P.|last2=Mujahid|first2=M.S.|last3=Barr|first3=D.A.|date=2015|title=Social determinants of risk and outcomes for cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association|url=|journal=Circulation|volume=132|pages=873–898|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000228}}&lt;/ref&gt; These external factors can determine a person's ability to perform self-care maintenance because a person may not be able to perform a behavior based on its availability. Access within a one's living environment is another factor that influences self-care maintenance. An individual's environment determines whether they are able to go to the gym to exercise or go to a grocery store to buy healthy food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Living in a [[food desert]] or having limited resources that allow for physical activity would decrease the likelihood of participating in self-care maintenance behaviors.

Internal factors, such as motivation, emotions, and cognitive abilities also influence self-care maintenance behaviors. Motivation is often the driving force behind performing self-care maintenance behaviors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A person who is motivated to stay healthy and managing and/or prevent a [[Chronic condition|chronic illness]] is more likely to be interested in performing maintenance behaviors, such as those mentioned above. Emotions are also indicative of whether a person is going to perform such behaviors. A person with depression is more likely to have a poor dietary intake low in fruits and vegetables, reduced physical activity, and poor medication adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=J.S.|last2=Safren|first2=S.A.|last3=Cagliero|first3=E.|date=2007|title=Depression, self-care, and medication adherence in type 2 diabetes|url=|journal=American Diabetes Association|volume=30 |issue=9|pages=2222–2227|doi=10.2337/dc07-0158|pmc=4440862}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual with impaired cognitive or functional abilities also has a diminished ability to performing self-care maintenance behaviors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some of these behaviors, such as medication adherence, require the ability to maintain a schedule, but someone with memory impairment may have difficulty completing tasks based on memory.

Skills are also a significant aspect that influences an individual's ability to perform self-care behaviors. Individuals need to be able to plan, set goals, and make appropriate decisions regarding their health needs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, self-care is influenced by an individual's attitude and belief in his or her self-efficacy. Having the confidence to perform an action and to overcome barriers is indicative of success in performing self-care behaviors. Cultural beliefs and values may also influence self-care. Self-care may be viewed as highly important in some countries or within certain cultures that value independence, but in other cultures, self-care may contradict their beliefs and values.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Social support]]s also influence how an individual performs self-care maintenance. Social supports include family, friends, and support groups. Support groups can be through religious groups, groups that manage chronic illnesses, or a community group. These supports can help by having people to talk to or help make decisions about your care. Individuals who live with chronic illness acknowledge that shared care can help make living with a chronic illness less stressful.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If you are suffering from a chronic illness and would like to join a support group, there are resources that could be found online or offered by your primary care provider.

Living with one or more chronic illnesses can be very difficult. There are numerous medications, different specialists, and self-care maintenance behaviors that are necessary. With all of these working parts, it can be difficult to keep track of everything. The presence of co-morbid conditions makes performing self-care maintenance behaviors harder to complete. Pill burden is a huge factor in self-care maintenance of multiple chronic illnesses because many people may complain of not wanting to take all the medication or get confused regarding the schedule of their medications.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayliss|first=E.A.|last2=Steiner|first2=J.F.|last3=Fernald|first3=D.H.|last4=Crane|first4=L.A.|last5=Main|first5=D.S.|date=2003|title=Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases|journal=Annals of Family Medicine|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=15–21|doi=10.1370/afm.4|pmid=15043175|pmc=1466563}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a patient with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] would need to exercise, but if they also have [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] they easily develop shortness of breath which would cause them to stop exercising.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is important to address all the symptoms of each chronic illness an individual suffers from so that individuals with chronic illnesses can successfully perform self-care maintenance behaviors.

The benefits of living a healthy lifestyle were analyzed in the [[Caerphilly Heart Disease Study]]. Evidence showed a risk reduction in chronic diseases (including dementia and cognitive impairment) to be significantly associated with healthy lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elwood |first1=Peter |last2=Galante |first2=Julieta |last3=Pickering |first3=Janet |last4=Palmer |first4=Stephen |last5=Bayer |first5=Antony |last6=Ben-Shlomo |first6=Yoav |last7=Longley |first7=Marcus |last8=Gallacher |first8=John |last9=Sathian |first9=Krish |title=Healthy Lifestyles Reduce the Incidence of Chronic Diseases and Dementia: Evidence from the Caerphilly Cohort Study |journal=PLoS ONE |date=9 December 2013 |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e81877 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081877|pmid=24349147 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...881877E |pmc=3857242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-care is also taking care of minor ailments, long term conditions, or one's own health after discharge from secondary and tertiary health care.  For instances of [[neck pain]], for example, self-care is the recommended treatment.&lt;ref name="mnp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcanal.com/disorders-conditions/pain/41773-most-neck-pain-improves-with-self-care-time.html |title=Most Neck Pain Improves with Self-care, Time |date=12 August 2013 |work=HeathCanal |accessdate=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients who are better informed and more educated possess greater motivation for self-care.&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt; Individuals conduct self-care and experts and professionals support self-care to enable individuals to undertake enhanced self-care. The recognition and evaluation of [[symptom]]s is a key aspect of self-care.&lt;ref name="scilf"&gt;{{cite book  |title = Self-care in Later Life: Research, Program, and Policy Issues |last = Palo Stoller |first = Eleanor |editor1-first = Marcia G. |editor1-last = Ory, |editor2-first = Gordon H. |editor2-last = DeFriese |year = 1998 |publisher = Springer Publishing Company |isbn = 0826196950 |pages = 24–25 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jnDcxXgIYucC |accessdate = 28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main issues involved with self-care and the onset of illness are medically related such managing drug [[side effect]]s, emotions and psychological issues,&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to lifestyle and knowledge acquisition to assist in decision-making.&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;

Self-care support has crucial enabling value and considerable scope in developing countries with an already overburdened [[Health system|health care system]]. But it also has an essential role to play in affluent countries where people are becoming more conscious about their health and want to have a greater role in taking care of themselves.

To enable people to do enhanced self-care, they can be supported in various ways and by different service providers.

== Methods ==
Multifaceted interventions that tailor education to the individual are more effective than patient education alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blickem|first=C|last2=Power|first2=P|last3=Protheroe|first3=J|last4=Kennedy|first4=A|last5=Vassilev|first5=I|last6=Sanders|first6=C|last7=Kirk|first7=S|last8=Chew-Graham|first8=C|last9=Rogers|first9=A|date=2010|title=The role of information in supporting self-care in vascular conditions: A conceptual and empirical review|url=|journal=Health and Social Care in the Community|volume=19|pages=449–459|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2524.2010.00975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches used to improve self-care are summarized here.
* “Teach-back” is used to gauge how much information is retained after patient teaching. Teach-back occurs when patients are asked to repeat information that was given to them. The educator checks for gaps in the patient's understanding, reinforces messages, and creates a collaborative conversation with the patient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=M|last2=Garbez|first2=R|last3=Carroll|first3=M|last4=Brinker|first4=E|last5=Howie-Esquivel|first5=J|date=2013|title=Is "teach-back" associated with knowledge retention and hospital readmission in hospitalized heart failure patients?|url=|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|volume=28|pages=137–146|doi=10.1097/jcn.0b013e31824987bd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for individuals with a chronic illness to comprehend and recall information received about their condition. Teach-back education can both educate patients and assess learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example of how a provider can initiate teach-back is by asking, “I want to make sure that I explained everything clearly. If you were talking to your neighbor, what would you tell her/him we talked about today”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=D|last2=Robinson|first2=P|last3=Jordan|first3=M|last4=Lawrence|first4=S|last5=Casey|first5=K.J.|last6=Salas-Lopez|first6=D|date=2015|title=Reducing readmissions using teach-back: Enhancing patient and family education|url=|journal=Journal of Nursing Administration|volume=45|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1097/NNA.0000000000000155|pmid=25479173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase protects the patient's self-esteem while placing responsibility for understanding on both the provider and patient. One study performed showed that patients with heart failure who received teach-back education had a 12% lower readmission rate compared to patients who did not receive teach-back.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the teach-back method is effective in the short-term, there is little evidence to support its long-term effect. Long-term knowledge retention is crucial for self-care, so further research is needed on this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandula|first=N.R.|last2=Malli|first2=T|last3=Zei|first3=C.P.|last4=Larsen|first4=E|last5=Baker|first5=D.W.|date=2011|title=Literacy and retention of information after a multimedia diabetes education program and teach-back|url=|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=16|pages=89–202|doi=10.1080/10810730.2011.604382}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Habit]]s are automatic responses to commonly encountered situations. One example of a habit is hand washing after restroom use. The main characteristic of a habit is automaticity. A habit is formed when environmental cues result in a behavior with very little conscious deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judah|first=G|last2=Gardner|first2=B|last3=Aunger|first3=R|date=2012|title=Forming a flossing habit: An exploratory study of the psychological determinants of habit formation|url=|journal=The British Journal of Health Psychology|volume=18|pages=338–353|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Behavioral economics]] is a subset of the study of economics that examines how cognitive, social, and emotional factors play in role in an individual's economic decisions. Behavioral economics is now influencing the design of healthcare interventions aimed at improving self-care maintenance. Because humans do not always make rational decisions when it comes to self-care, behavioral economics takes into account the complexity and irrationality of human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matjasko|first=J.L.|last2=Cawley|first2=J.H.|last3=Baker-Goering|first3=M.M.|last4=Yokum|first4=D.V.|date=2016|title=Applying behavioral economics to public health policy: Illustrative examples and promising directions|url=|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=50|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S13–9|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2016.02.007|pmc=4871624|pmid=27102853}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Motivational interviewing|Motivational Interviewing]] is a way to engage people in critically thinking about their self-care needs. MI uses an interviewing style that focuses on the individual's goals and can be used in any context. MI is based on three psychological theories: cognitive dissonance, self-perception, and the [[transtheoretical model of change]]. MI is intended to enhance intrinsic motivation for change.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=L.A.|last2=Wolever|first2=R.Q.|date=2013|title=Integrative health coaching and motivational interviewing: Synergistic approaches to behavior change in healthcare|url=|journal=Global Advances in Health and Medicine|volume=24|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Health coaching]] is another method of promoting motivation to initiate and maintain behavior change. The health coach facilitates behavior change by emphasizing personal goals, life experiences, and values.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Monitoring==
Self-care monitoring is the process of surveillance that involves measurement and perception of bodily changes. Effective self-care monitoring also requires being able to label and interpret changes in the body as normal or abnormal.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riegel|first=Barbara|date=2012|title=A middle-range theory of self-care of chronic illness|url=|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|volume=35|pages=194–204|doi=10.1097/ans.0b013e318261b1ba|pmid=22739426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to your body and recognizing signs and symptoms, increasing factual knowledge towards disease or illness are all important factors. Being able to interpret and label your symptoms, understanding the process of your disease, and knowing how to act and treat accordingly allows competency in knowing when to seek further medical help.

Self-care monitoring consists of both the perception and measurement of [[symptoms]]. Symptom perception is the process of monitoring one's body for signs of changing health. This includes body awareness or body listening, recognizing symptoms relevant to health, and interpreting and labeling these symptoms. For example, a patient with [[diabetes]] may use body listening to perceive feelings of shakiness and sweating. These feelings are labeled as symptoms of low blood sugar, and the patient will decide how to act based on this information.  Prompt and accurate recognition of symptoms is a necessary part of a patient's management of their health. In heart attack patients, delays in seeking treatment for worsening symptoms have been found to contribute to poor health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam|first=C|date=2013|title=Patterns of symptom recognition, interpretation, and response in heart failure patients: An integrative review.|url=|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|volume=28|pages=348–359|doi=10.1097/jcn.0b013e3182531cf7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in health status or body function can be monitored with various tools and technologies. The range and complexity of [[medical devices]] used in both hospital and homecare settings are increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The role of human factors in home health care|last=Olson|first=S|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain devices are specific to a common need of a disease process. For example, various types of [[glucose monitors]] are used by patients with [[diabetes]] to track their blood sugar levels. Other devices can provide a more general set of information, such as a weight scale, [[blood pressure cuff]], [[pulse oximeter]], etc. Less technological tools can include organizers, charts, and diagrams to trend or keep track of things such as amount of calories, mood, vital sign measurements, and more.

===Barriers===
A patient's ability to engage in self-care monitoring greatly impacts the progression of his/her disease. Barriers to monitoring can go unrecognized and end up interfering with effective self-care. Barriers can include knowledge deficits, undesirable self-care regimens, different instructions from multiple providers, and limitations to access related to income or disability.  [[Psychosocial]] factors such as motivation, [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], confidence can also serve as barriers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickson|first=V|date=2011|title=A qualitative meta-analysis of heart failure self-care practices among individuals with multiple comorbid conditions.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51104736_A_Qualitative_Meta-Analysis_of_Heart_Failure_Self-Care_Practices_Among_Individuals_With_Multiple_Comorbid_Conditions.|journal=Journal of Cardiac Failure|volume=17|pages=413–419|doi=10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cost of equipment - This is a common barrier to self-care monitoring. Certain equipment is needed to monitor symptoms, such as test strips and needles in blood glucose monitoring. The cost of equipment can be expensive for some individuals, so they are less motivated and less likely to keep track of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Siew-Siang|last2=Ong|first2=Woon May|last3=Ng|first3=Chirk Jenn|date=2014-02-15|title=Barriers and facilitators to self-monitoring of blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes using insulin: a qualitative study|url=http://www.dovepress.com/barriers-and-facilitators-to-self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-peopl-peer-reviewed-article-PPA|journal=Patient Preference and Adherence|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.2147/ppa.s57567|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lack of knowledge - With monitoring, it is important to understand what you’re looking for and why you’re doing it. For example, some individuals may not understand the implications of high blood sugars or high blood pressure. Thus, they don’t feel the need to monitor it. Also, if you don’t understand the importance of the monitoring, you will not do it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Fear of outcomes/fear of using equipment - In the example of blood glucose monitoring, some people may be afraid of needles, which will deter them from doing [[fingersticks]] to read their blood sugar. Other people may have a fear or anxiety of how results may turn out and may avoid them. For example, a person who did not follow a diet to maintain their blood pressure or blood sugar may have a fear that it is already high and thus, does not want to monitor it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Familial/social support (or lack thereof) - Monitoring something implies doing it on a regular/frequent basis. Doing anything consistently sometimes requires reminders or a little encouragement from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woda|first=A|date=2015|title=Factors influencing self-care behaviors of African Americans with heart failure: A photovoice project|url=|journal=Heart &amp; Lung: The Journal of Acute and Critical Care|volume=44|pages=33–38|doi=10.1016/j.hrtlng.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving self-care monitoring===
Because self-care monitoring is conducted primarily by patients and their caregivers, it is necessary to work with patients closely on this topic.  Providers should assess the current self-care monitoring regimen and build off this to create an individualized plan of care.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Knowledge and education specifically designed for the patient's level of understating is central to self-care monitoring. When patients understand the symptoms that correspond with their disease, they can learn to recognize these symptoms early on.

== Self-care management ==
Self-care management is defined as the response to signs and symptoms when they occur. Self-care management involves the evaluation of physical and emotional changes and deciding if these changes need to be addressed. Changes may occur because of illness, treatment, or the environment. Once treatment is done, it needs to be evaluated to judge whether it would be useful to do again in the future. Treatments are based on the signs and symptoms experienced. Treatments are usually specific to the illness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riegel |first1=Barbara |last2=Jaarsma |first2=Tiny |last3=Strömberg |first3=Anna |title=A middle-range theory of self-care of chronic illness |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |date=2012 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=194–204 |doi=10.1097/ans.0b013e318261b1ba|pmid=22739426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviors===
Self-care management includes recognizing symptoms, treating the symptoms, and evaluating the treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=KS |last2=Lennie |first2=TA |last3=Dunbar |first3=SB |last4=Pressler |first4=SJ |last5=Heo |first5=S |last6=Song |first6=EK |last7=Biddle |first7=MJ |last8=Moser |first8=DK |title=The association between regular symptom monitoring and self-care management in patients with heart failure |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing |date=2015 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1097/JCN.0000000000000128|pmc=4098015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-care management behaviors are symptom- and disease-specific. For example, a patient with [[asthma]] may recognize the symptom of shortness of breath. This patient can manage the symptom by using an inhaler and seeing if their breathing improves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A patient with [[heart failure]] manages their condition by recognizing symptoms such as swelling and shortness of breath.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Self-care management behaviors for heart failure may include taking a water pill, limiting fluid and salt intake, and seeking help from a healthcare provider.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Regular self-care monitoring is needed to identify symptoms early and judge the effectiveness of treatments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Some examples include:
*Inject [[insulin]] in response to high blood sugar and then re-check to evaluate if blood glucose lowered
*Use social support and healthy leisure activities to fight feelings of [[social isolation]]. This has been shown to be effective for patients with chronic lung disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaptein |first1=AA |last2=Fischer |first2=MJ |last3=Scharloo |first3=M |title=Self-management in patients with COPD: theoretical  context, content, outcomes, and integration into clinical car |journal=International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |date=2014 |volume=9 |pages=907–917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors===

'''Access to care:''' Access to care is a major barrier affecting self-care management.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riegel |first1=B |last2=Jaarsma |first2=T |last3=Stromberg |first3=A |title=A middle-range theory of self-care of chronic illness |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |date=2012 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=194–204 |doi=10.1097/ans.0b013e318261b1ba |pmid=22739426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of symptoms might require consultation with a healthcare provider. Access to the health care system is largely influenced by providers. Many people suffering from a chronic illness do not have access to providers within the health care system for several reasons. Three major barriers to care include: insurance coverage, poor access to services, and being unable to afford costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeVoe |first1=J.E |last2=Baaez |first2=A |last3=Angier |first3=H |last4=Krois |first4=L |last5=Edlund |first5=C |last6=Carney |first6=P.A |title=Insurance + access ≠ health care: typology of barriers to health care access to low-income families |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=5 |pages=511–518 |doi=10.1370/afm.748 |year=2007|pmc=2094032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without access to trained health care providers, outcomes are typically worse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

'''Financial constraints:''' Financial barriers impact self-care management. The majority of insurance coverage is provided by employers. Loss of employment is frequently accompanied by loss of health insurance and inability to afford health care. In patients with diabetes and chronic heart disease, financial barriers are associated with poor access to care, poor quality of care, and vascular disease. As a result, these patients have reduced rates of medical assessments, measurements of Hemoglobin A1C (a marker that assesses blood glucose levels over the last 3 months), cholesterol measurements, eye and foot examinations, [[diabetes]] education, and aspirin use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parikh, P.B. et al |title=The impact of financial barriers on access to care, quality of care and vascular morbidity among patients with diabetes and coronary heart disease |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |date=2014 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=76–81|pmid=24078406 |pmc=3889957 |doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2635-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that people in higher social classes are better at self-care management of chronic conditions. In addition, people with lower levels of education often lack resources to effectively engage in self-management behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cramm |first1=J.M |last2=Nieboer |first2=A.P |title=Self-management abilities, physical health and depressive symptoms among patients with cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes |journal=Patient Education and Counseling |date=2012 |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=411–415 |doi=10.1016/j.pec.2011.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Age:''' Elderly patients are more likely to rate their symptoms differently and delay seeking care longer when they have symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lam |first1=C |last2=Smeltzer |first2=S.C |title=Patterns of symptom recognition, interpretation, and response in heart failure patients: An integrative review |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing |date=2013 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=348–359 |doi=10.1097/jcn.0b013e3182531cf7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an elderly person with [[heart failure]] may experience the symptom of shortness of breath differently than someone with [[heart failure]] who is younger. There are many reasons contributing to this difference in symptom experience. Providers should be aware of the potential delay in provider-seeking behavior in elderly patients which could worsen their overall condition.

'''Prior experience:''' Prior experience contributes to the development of skills in self-care management. Experience helps the patient develop cues and patterns that they can remember and follow, leading to reasonable goals and actions in repeat situations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; A patient who has skills in self-management knows what to do during repeated symptomatic events. This could lead to them recognizing their symptoms earlier, and seeking a provider sooner.

'''Health care literacy:''' Health care literacy is another factor affecting self-care management. Health care literacy is the amount of basic health information people are able to understand. Health care literacy is the major variable contributing to differences in patient ratings of self-management support.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=A.S |last2=Carlson |first2=J.R |last3=Malone |first3=R.M |last4=Joyner |first4=J |last5=DeWalt |first5=D.A |title=The influence of literacy on patient-reported experiences of diabetes self-management support |journal=Nursing Research |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=356–363 |doi=10.1097/nnr.0b013e3181ef3025 |year=2010|pmc=2946184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful self-care involves understanding the meaning of changes in one's body. Individuals who can identify changes in their body are then able to come up with options and decide on a course of action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Health education at the patient's literacy level can increase the patient's ability to problem solve, set goals, and acquire skills in applying practical information. A patient's literacy can also affect their rating of healthcare quality. A poor healthcare experience may cause a patient to avoid returning to that same provider. This creates a delay in acute symptom management.  Providers must consider health literacy when designing treatment plans that require self-management skills.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Co-morbid conditions:''' A patient with multiple chronic illnesses may experience compounding effects of their illnesses. This can include worsening of one condition by the symptoms or treatment of another.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayliss |first1=E.A |last2=Steiner |first2=J.F |last3=Fernald |first3=D.H |last4=Crane |first4=L.A |last5=Main |first5=D.S |title=Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |date=2003 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–21|pmid=15043175 |doi=10.1370/afm.4 |pmc=1466563}}&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to prioritize one of their conditions. This limits the self-care management of their other illnesses. One condition may have more noticeable symptoms than others. Or the patient may be more emotionally connected to one illness, for example, the one they have had for a long time. If providers are unaware of the effect of having multiple illnesses, the patient's overall health may fail to improve or worsen as a result of therapeutic efforts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Ways to improve self-care management===
There are many ways for patients and healthcare providers to work together to improve the patient's self-care management. Stoplight and skill teaching allow patients and providers to work together to develop decision-making strategies.

1. '''Stoplight''' is an action plan for the daily treatment of a patient's chronic illness created by the healthcare team and the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, A. N. (2017). Community health paramedicine. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning. Retrieved from: 
https://books.google.com/books?id=jm4aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT960&amp;lpg=PT960&amp;dq=stoplight+action+plan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2cdEMMl5ZB&amp;sig=RupYBfmdp2H0x2JNqEWA16HnGos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJtv-Jk-3SAhVG5CYKHflSCpM4ChDoAQguMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=stoplight%20action%20plan&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It makes decision making easier by categorizing signs and symptoms and determining the appropriate actions for each set. It separates signs and symptoms into three zones:

* ''Green'' is the safe zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms are what is typically expected. The patient should continue with their daily self-care tasks, such as taking daily medications and eating a healthy diet.&lt;ref name="aafa, n.d."&gt;(aafa, n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yellow'' is the caution zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored as they are abnormal, but they are not yet dangerous. Some actions may need to be taken in this zone in order to go back to the green zone, for instance taking an additional medication. The patient may need to contact their healthcare team for advice.&lt;ref name="aafa, n.d."/&gt;
* ''Red'' is the danger zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms show that something is dangerously wrong. If in this category the patient needs to take actions to return to the green category, such as taking an emergency medication, as well as contact their healthcare team immediately. They may also need to contact emergency medical assistance.&lt;ref name="aafa, n.d."/&gt;

The stoplight plan helps patients to make decisions about what actions to take for different signs and symptoms and when to contact their healthcare team with a problem. The patient and their provider will customize certain signs and symptoms that fit in each stoplight category.&lt;ref&gt;(Lung Foundation, n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are three links to sample stoplight plans that can be tailored to a patient's needs:

2. '''Skills teaching''' is a learning opportunity between a healthcare provider and a patient where a patient learns a skill in self-care unique to his or her chronic illness.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, H. D., Coleman, E. A., Parry, C., Bodenheimer, T., &amp; Chen, E. H. (2009). Health coaching for patients with chronic illness. Family practice management, 17(5), 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these skills may be applied to the daily management of the symptoms of a chronic illness. Other skills may be applied when there is an exacerbation of a symptom. An exacerbation of a symptom means that the symptom is in a worsened state or is different from what the patient normally experiences. The patient should not only learn the purpose of self-care skills. It is also important to learn when to apply skills in daily management of a chronic illness and how the skill might be modified or changed when the patient experiences an exacerbation of a symptom.

For example, a patient newly diagnosed with persistent asthma might learn about taking an oral medicine for daily management, control of chronic symptoms and prevention of an asthma attack. However, there may come a time when the patient might be exposed to an environmental trigger or stress that causes an asthma attack. The patient starts to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheezing. When this unexpected symptom occurs, the skill of taking daily medicines and the medicine that is taken may change. Rather than taking an oral medicine daily, a different medication is needed for quick rescue and relief of symptoms. The rescue medication works quickly with an inhaler. Knowing to choose the right medication and knowing how to take the medicine with an inhaler is a skill that is learned for the self-care management of asthma. Here is a source on how to safely use a rescue inhaler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogAdPhk4GJA

In skills teaching, it is important for the patient and provider to discuss skills and address any lingering questions. It is important for the patient to know when and how a skill is to be implemented, and how the skill may need to be changed when the symptom is different from normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Victoria Vaughan |last2=Riegel |first2=Barbara |title=Are we teaching what patients need to know? Building skills in heart failure self-care |journal=Heart &amp; Lung: the Journal of Acute and Critical Care |date=May 2009 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=253–261 |doi=10.1016/j.hrtlng.2008.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingcuriosity.com/index.php/2017/07/11/seeking-curiosity-how-embracing-uncertainty-strengthens-empathy/|title=Seeking Curiosity: How Embracing Uncertainty Strengthens Empathy|date=11 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the summary of tactical and situational skills above. Learning self-care management skills for the first time in the care of a chronic illness is not easy, but with patience, practice, persistence and experience, personal mastery of self-care skills can be achieved.

== Support ==
Self-care support can include the following:
* Self-care information on [[Health information|health]] and human body systems, [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[Nutrition|healthy eating]].
* Support to capture, manage, interpret, and report [[observations of daily living]] (ODLs),&lt;ref name="RWJFe-primer3"&gt;[http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf Health in Everyday Living] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522145954/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf |date=2016-05-22 }} Robert Wood Johnson Foundation primer&lt;/ref&gt; the tracking of trends, and the use of the resulting information as clues for self-care action and decision making.
* Information prescriptions&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationprescription.info/|title=じっくり選ぶ結婚指輪の効果とは – 家内の希望で購入した結婚指輪のおかげで今でも夫婦円満です。|website=www.informationprescription.info|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing personalised information and instructions to enable an individual to self-care and take control of their health

A lack of self-care in terms of personal health, hygiene and living conditions is referred to as [[self-neglect]].  The use of [[caregiver]]s and [[Personal Care Assistant]]s may be needed.

== Philosophy ==
[[Michel Foucault]] understood the art of living (French ''art de vivre'', Latin ''ars vivendi'') and the care of self (French ''le souci de soi'') to be central to philosophy. The third volume of his three-volume study ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' is dedicated to this notion. For Foucault, the notion of ''care of self'' (''epimeleia heautou'') of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy]] comprises an attitude towards the self, others and the world, as well as a certain form of attention. For Foucault, the pursuit of the care for one's own well-being also comprises [[Philosophy of self#Self-knowledge|self-knowledge]] ([[Know thyself|gnōthi seauton]]).&lt;ref&gt;18.Foucault M: Technologies of the Self. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press; 1988. As cited by: {{cite news |author1=Thomas J. Papadimos |author2=Joanna E. Manos, Stuart J. Murray |url=http://www.peh-med.com/content/8/1/7 |title=An extrapolation of Foucault’s Technologies of the Self to effect positive transformation in the intensivist as teacher and mentor |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |year=2013 |volume=8 |number=7 |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981-1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time that Foucault developed his notion of care of the self, the notion of self-care as a revolutionary act in the context of social trauma was developed as a social justice practice in [[Black feminist thought]] in the US. Notably, civil rights activist and poet [[Audre Lorde]] wrote that in the context of multiple oppressions as a black woman, “caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” With the rise of the term in the medical usages, for instance, to combat anxiety, the association with black feminism has fallen away in clinical and popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/fashion/post-election-anxiety-self-care.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in feminist and queer theory, the link to Lorde and other scholars is retained.&lt;ref&gt;https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/26823&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[self-care deficit nursing theory]] was developed by [[Dorothea Orem]] between 1959 and 2001.  The positively viewed theory explores the use professional care and an orientation towards resources.&lt;ref name="nuth"/&gt;  Under Orem's model self-care has limits when its possibilities have been exhausted therefore making professional care legitimate.  These deficits in self-care are seen as shaping the best role a nurse may provide.  There are two phases in Orem's self-care; the investigative and decision-making phase and the production phase.&lt;ref name="dapon"&gt;{{cite book |title=Developing a Philosophy of Nursing |chapter=Commentary |editor1-first=June F. |editor1-last=Kikuchi |editor2-first=Helen |editor2-last=Simmons |last=Laurin |first=Jacqualine |year=1994 |publisher=Sage |isbn=0803954239 |pages=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5dVzZb8MEIC |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of '''self-replicating spacecraft''' has been applied – in theory – to several distinct "tasks". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of [[space exploration]] is known as a '''von Neumann [[Space probe|probe]]'''. Other variants include the [[#Berserkers|Berserker]] and an automated [[terraforming]] seeder ship.

== Theory ==
In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[gas giant]]s, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, "Lungfish" (see [[Self-replicating machines in fiction]]), [[David Brin]] touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a [[Darwinism|Darwinistic]] fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of "species" they might even form a type of [[ecology]], or – should they also have a form of [[artificial intelligence]] – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of "generations".

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm| bibcode=1980JBIS...33..251F}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting [[automatic factory|automated industrial complex]] to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm Comparison of Reproducing and Nonreproducing Starprobe Strategies for Galactic Exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic [[faster-than-light]] propulsion, and speeds limited to an "average cruising speed" of 0.1'''[[Speed of light|c]]'''.) could spread throughout a [[galaxy]] the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as half a million years.

==Implications for Fermi's paradox==
In 1981, [[Frank Tipler]]&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;"Extraterrestrial Beings Do Not Exist", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 21, number 267 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an argument that [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the [[Fermi paradox]] – that is, the question of why we have not ''already'' encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response&lt;ref name="Sagan and Newman"&gt;Sagan, Carl and Newman, William: "The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 24, number 113 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Carl Sagan]] and William Newman. Now known as ''Sagan's Response'', it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=Extraterrestrial Intelligence in the Solar System: Resolving the Fermi Paradox| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=36|date=November 1983| pages=496–500| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ResolvingFermi1983.htm| bibcode=1983JBIS...36..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[nuclear warfare]], [[grey goo|nanoterrorism]], [[resource depletion|resource exhaustion]], [[environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]], or [[pandemic]]s.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. [[Radio]] transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic [[parsec]]) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the [[Hayflick limit]] in cell reproduction.  One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation).  Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel.  The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate.  The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials.  Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is named after [[Hungarian American]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[John von Neumann]], who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called "Universal Assemblers" and which are often referred to as "[[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]]".  While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a [[Bracewell probe]]), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist [[Paul Davies]] of [[Arizona State University]] has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own [[Moon]], having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']].

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the "[[Astrochicken]]", proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]]. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its "home base", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own [[planetary system]], and not explore interstellar space.

Oxford-based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea that future powerful [[superintelligence]]s will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson Swarm]] around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox]. Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berserkers ===
{{noref|section|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- [[Berserker probe]] section-redirects here --&gt;

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the ''Berserker''. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing [[exoplanets]] whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' series of novels by [[Fred Saberhagen]] which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – ''do'' constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] civilization (see ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', by [[Greg Bear]], in the section [[#In fiction|In fiction]] below) or could theoretically "mutate" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for [[terraforming]] processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable [[exoplanet]], or even one that might be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from [[embryo space colonization|stored embryos]] or from stored information using [[molecular nanotechnology]] to build [[zygotes]] with varying genetic information from local raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist."  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 21 (1980): page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to [[Generation ship]]s as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

==In fiction==
	
{{See also|Self-replicating machines in fiction}}
	 
=== Von Neumann probes ===
	 
* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': The [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]s in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[book]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", Clarke's original short story upon which 2001 was based, were not.  The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke's novel.
	 
* ''[[Cold as Ice (novel)|Cold As Ice]]'': In the novel by [[Charles Sheffield]], there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[helium-4]], and various metals from the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]].
	 
* ''[[Destiny's Road]]'': [[Larry Niven]] frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book ''Destiny's Road'', Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans' technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] which serves as the humans' primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.

* ''[[No Man's Sky]]'': In the video game ''No Man's Sky'' mysterious probes called Sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy, analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction. It is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxy.
	 
* ''[[The Devil's Blind Spot]]'': See also [[Alexander Kluge]], ''The Devil's Blind Spot'' (New Directions; 2004.)
	 
* ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]'': In the novel by [[Robert Charles Wilson]], Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth's and the aliens' probes.
	 
* ''[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]'': In the book by [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] (published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity's existence to whoever might encounter them.
	 
* ''[[Von Neumann's War]]'': In ''Von Neumann's War'' by [[John Ringo]] and [[Travis S. Taylor]] (published by [[Baen Books]] in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineers]] some of the probes.
	 
* ''[[Grey Goo (video game)|Grey Goo]]'': In the video game ''Grey Goo'', the "Goo" faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction's units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the [[Grey Goo]] doomsday scenario.

* ''We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'' by [[Dennis E. Taylor]]: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America's religious replacement, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.

=== Berserkers ===
	 
* In the science fiction short story collection ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]], a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same [[fictional universe]] are the origin of the term "Berserker probe".
	 
* In the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (and the subsequent [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 series]]) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
	 
* The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker's massive mechanical Spheres).
	 
* Science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] later borrowed this notion in his short story "[[Limits (novel)|A Teardrop Falls]]".
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Star Control II]]'', the [[Slylandro]] Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks [[starship]]s of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to "resource extraction" mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce "at a geometric rate", the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player's ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
	 
* In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Excession]]'', hegemonising swarms are described as a form of [[Outside Context Problem]]. An example of an "Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object" is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself.  After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the [[Zetetic Elench]] and become "Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects". Such swarms (referred to as "smatter") reappear in the later novels ''[[Surface Detail]]'' (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
	 
* The [[Inhibitors (Revelation Space)|Inhibitors]] from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures.  They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets.  They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to 'remember' the necessary counter-measures.
	 
* Also from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' books, the "Greenfly" terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
	 
* The [[Reapers (Mass Effect)|Reapers]] in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' that they assimilate any advanced species.
	 
* [[Mantrid]] Drones from the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Lexx]]'' were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Infection (Babylon 5)|Infection]]" showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a 'Pure Icaran' based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]" features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization's level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
	 
* [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' deals directly with the concept of "Berserker" von Neumann probes and their consequences.  The idea is further explored in the novel's sequel, ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
	 
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'' series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'', and then in an attack in ''[[Across the Sea of Suns]]''.  The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in ''Across the Sea of Suns''.  The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
	 
* On ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced "races" known. 
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
	 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including [[List of starships in Stargate#Destiny|Destiny]]) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don't bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
	 
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[List of Justice League episodes#ep10|Dark Heart]]", an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
	 
* In the ''[[Homeworld: Cataclysm]]'' video game, a bio-mechanical virus called ''Beast'' has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
	 
* In the SF [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[EVE Online]]'', experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player's ships accidentally created 'rogue drones' which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'', the player may randomly encounter "Von Neumann". A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player's ships.  The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material.  If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones.  If all the player's ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving.  The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points.  The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion ''A Murder of Crows'', Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
	 
* In the ''[[X (computer game series)|X Computer Game Series]]'', the [[X (game series)#Featured races|Xenon]] are a malevolent race of [[AI|artificially intelligent]] machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update.  They are continual antagonists in the [[X (computer game series)#The X Universe|X-Universe]].
	 
* In the comic ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' a character mentions "Von Neumann rectal infestations" which are apparently caused by "Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks".
	 
* In the anime ''[[Vandread]]'', harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
	 
* In ''[[Earth 2160]]'', the Morphidian Aliens rely on {{Not a typo|Mantain}} strain aliens for colonization. Most {{Not a typo|Mantain}}-derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one {{Not a typo|Mantain}} Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they "choose an evolutionary path" and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
	 
* In the European comic series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' No 20 &amp; 21 goes over this subject. A kind of bezerk von Neumann is set to collision course with the pandarve system.
	 
* In PC role-playing game ''[[Space Rangers (video game)|Space Rangers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Space Rangers 2: Dominators]]'', a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
	 
* In the ''[[Star Wolves]]'' video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
	 
* The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
	 
* The Tet in the 2013 film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet's water in order to extract hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]].
	 
* In ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'', an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
	 
* In ''[[Herr aller Dinge]]'' by [[Andreas Eschbach]], an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is purposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.
	 
=== Replicating Seeder Ships ===
	 
* ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn's moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
	 
* ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
	 
* In the ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy|Metroid Prime]]'' subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
	 
* In [[David Brin]]'s short story collection, ''[[The River of Time]]'' (1986), the short story "Lungfish" prominently features von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;The complete text of the story has been placed on the author's website at [http://www.davidbrin.com/lungfish1.html davidbrin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
	 
* In ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as [[fire and forget]] lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their "children".
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep95|Remnants]]", the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)#ep75|Scorched Earth]]", a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the human adventurers live on a ship called ''Destiny''. Its mission was to connect a network of [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]], placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
	 
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' by [[Don Lawrence]] (starting with ''Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine'') is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.

In religious or [[mythological cosmology]], the '''seven heavens''' refer to seven layers of the [[sky]]. These were associated in ancient times both with the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realms of [[Heaven|deities]] and with observed celestial bodies such as the [[classical planets]] and [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hetherington |first=Norriss S.  |date=2014 |orig-year=1st. pub. 1993 |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals) : Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |pages=267, 401 |isbn= 1-306-58055-2 |access-date=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, derived from ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]]s, can be found in the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]; a similar concept is also found in some [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.iv.iv.html [[Origen]], ''De principiis'' III,2,1]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these [[traditions]], including [[Jainism]], also have a concept of seven earths or seven [[underworld]]s.

The number seven corresponds to the seven [[classical planets]] known to antiquity. Ancient observers noticed that these objects moved at different paces in the sky both from each other and from the [[fixed stars]] beyond them: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], the [[Moon]], the [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]. Unlike [[comet]]s, which appeared in the sky with no warning, they did move in regular patterns that could be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Robert |title=Aristotle's 'On the Heavens' |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/959/aristotles-on-the-heavens/ |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopaedia |ref=https://www.ancient.eu/article/959/aristotles-on-the-heavens/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also observed that objects in the sky influenced objects on earth, as when movements of the sun affect [[heliotropism|the behavior of plants]] or movements of the moon affect ocean [[tide]]s. 

Observations like these led to the development of [[geocentrism|geocentric]] [[religious cosmology|cosmologies]]: earth-centered ideas about the structure of the universe. In some cultures the layers, or "heavens", in the sky were understood as vast [[sphere]]s. Each rotated around the earth at its own pace, taking its associated point of light, and any associated heavenly beings, along. Speculation spread about the effect all celestial objects--not only the sun and moon, but other points of light such as Mars, Jupiter, and fixed stars--[[astrology|might exercise over earthly events]]. Stories and symbolic associations followed.

== Mesopotamian religion ==
The concept of seven heavens as developed in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] [[symbol]]ised both physical and metaphysical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard |first=Jody A. |date=2012 |title=The Mysticism of Hebrews: Exploring the Role of Jewish Apocalyptic Mysticism in the Epistle to the Hebrews |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=F9R4UYjeYGoC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=3-16-151881-0 |access-date=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sumerian language]], the words for heaven (or sky) and earth are [[An (mythology)|An]] and [[Ki (mythology)|Ki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-world.org/sumerianwords2.htm |title=Sumerian Words And Their English Translation |website=History World|access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sumer]]ian [[incantations]] of the late second millennium BCE make references to seven heavens and seven earths. One such incantation is: "an-imin-bi ki-imin-bi" (the heavens are seven, the earths are seven.)&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz |first=Wayne |title=Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA208| page=208 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |date=1998 |isbn=0-931464-99-4 |access-date=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding that the heavens can influence things on earth lent heavenly, [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties to the number seven itself, as in stories of seven demons, seven churches, seven spirits, or seven thrones. The number seven appears frequently in [[Babylon]]ian magical [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Adela Yarbro |title=Cosmology and Eschatology in Jewish and Christian Apoocalypticism |publisher=Brill|date=2000 |isbn=90-04-11927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven Jewish and the seven Islamic heavens may have had their origin in [[Babylonian astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

In general, heaven is not a place for humans in Mesopotamian religion. As [[Gilgamesh]] says to his friend [[Enkidu]], in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]: "Who can go up to heaven, my friend? Only the gods dwell with [[Shamash]] forever". Along with the idea of seven heavens, the idea of three heavens was also common in ancient Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lange |first1=Armin  |last2=Tov |first2=Emanuel |last3=Weigold |first3=Matthias |date=2011 |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls in Context: Integrating the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Study of Ancient Texts, Languages, and Cultures |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xM7EnOx7CnYC&amp;pg=PA808 |page=808 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-18903-3 |access-date=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|A depiction of "Muhammed's Paradise". A Persian miniature from ''The History of Mohammed''.]]
The [[Qur'an]] frequently mentions the existence of seven ''samaawat'' (سماوات), plural of ''samaa'a''  (سماء), which is customarily [[English translations of the Quran|translated]] as 'heaven'.  The word is cognate to Hebrew ''shamayim'' (שמים). Some of the verses in which Qur'an mentions seven ''samaawat'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickthall|first1=M.M.|last2=Eliasi|first2=M.A.H.|date=1999|title=The Holy Qur'an (Transliteration in Roman Script)|publisher=Laurier Books Ltd.|isbn=81-87385-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are {{cite quran|41|12|tn=y}}, {{cite quran|65|12|tn=y}}, {{cite quran|71|15|tn=y}}.

There are two interpretations of using the number "seven". One viewpoint is that the number "seven" here simply means "many" and is not to be taken literally (the number 7 is often used to imply that in the Arabic language).&lt;ref name=Al-Islam&gt;"[https://www.al-islam.org/philosophy-islamic-laws-nasir-makarim-shirazi-jafar-subhani/question-34-what-meant-seven-heavens What Is Meant By ‘Seven Heavens’?]," ''[https://www.al-islam.org Al-Islam.org]''&lt;/ref&gt; But many other commentators use the number 7 literally.

One interpretation of "heavens" is that all the stars and galaxies (including the [[Milky Way]]) are all part of the "first heaven", and "beyond that six still bigger worlds are there," which have yet to be discovered by scientists.&lt;ref name=Al-Islam/&gt;

In other sources, the concept is presented in metaphorical terms. Each of the seven heavens is depicted as being composed of a different material, and Islamic prophets are resident in each.  The first heaven is depicted as being made of silver and is the home of [[Adam and Eve]], as well as the angels of each star.  The second heaven is depicted as being made of gold and is the home of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]].  The [[Third Heaven|third heaven]] is depicted as being made of pearls or other dazzling stones; [[Joseph son of Jacob|Joseph]] and [[Azrael]] are resident there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living in Your Soul's Light: Understanding Your Eternal Self |author=Richard Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fourth heaven is depicted as being made of [[white gold]]; [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and the [[Angel of Tears]] resides there.  The fifth heaven is depicted as being made of silver; [[Aaron]] and the Avenging Angel hold court over this heaven.  The sixth heaven is composed of [[garnet]]s and [[ruby|rubies]]; [[Moses]] can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=219–220|title=What Are the Seven Wonders of the World?  And 100 Other Great Cultural Lists: Fully Explained |author=Peter D'Epiro |author2=Mary Desmond Pinkowish |last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Doubleday |year=1998 |isbn=0-385-49062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seventh heaven, which borrows some concepts from its Jewish counterpart, is depicted as being composed of divine light incomprehensible to the mortal man.  [[Abraham]] is a resident of the seventh heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mixer and Server |volume=27 |page=51|year=1918 |author=Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance |author2=Bartenders' International League of America |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some [[hadith]]s, the highest level of [[Jannah]] is ''firdaws'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rustomji|first=Nerina|date=2013|title=The Garden and the Fire: Heaven and Hell in Islamic Culture|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-51183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sidrat al-Muntaha]], a Lote tree, marks the end of the seventh heaven.

According to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] sources, A Hadith from Imam [[Ali]] mentioned the name of Seven Heavens as below:&lt;ref&gt;Al-Burhan fi Tafsir Al-Qur'an V.5 P.415&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Talmud]], the universe is made of seven heavens (''[[Shamayim]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&amp;letter=A#4364 |title=Angelology|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|access-date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish [[Merkabah#Ma.27asei Merkavah|Merkavah and Heichalot]] literature was devoted to discussing the details of these heavens, sometimes in connection with traditions relating to Enoch, such as the [[3 Enoch|Third Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholem|first=Gershom|date=1965|title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and the Talmudic Tradition|location=New York|publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America|oclc=635020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
An explicit reference to the Third Heaven appears in the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] [[Biblical canon|canon]]. A [[Apostle Paul|Pauline]] [[Second_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians|epistle]], penned in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] around 55CE, describes this [[mysticism|mystical]] experience: 

''I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the [[third heaven]]—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught up into [[Paradise]] and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat.'' 
([[2 Corinthians]] 12.2–4 [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])

The description is usually taken as an oblique reference by the author to himself. The passage appears to reflect first-century beliefs among [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] that the realm of [[Paradise]] existed in a different heaven than the highest one--an impression that may find support in the original Greek wording (closer to "caught away" than "caught up").&lt;ref&gt;[[E. W. Bullinger]] A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek  "2, 14, To this "Third heaven" and "Paradise" Paul was caught away, 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4, (not "up", see under "catch") in "visions and revelations of the Lord", 2 Cor. xii. 1. One catching away—with a double revelation of the New heaven and the..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second century, Irenaeus also knows seven heavens (see his ''Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching'' 9; cf. ''Against Heresies'' 1.5.2).

Over the course of the [[middle ages]] [[Christianity|Christian]] thinkers expanded the ancient [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] seven-heaven model into a system of ten heavens. This [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], taught in the first [[Europe|European]] [[university|universities]] by the [[Scholastics]], reached its supreme [[literature|literary]] expression in [[The Divine Comedy]] by [[Dante Aligheri]].

== Apocryphal Text ==
The [[Second Book of Enoch]], also written in the first century CE, describes the [[mysticism|mystical]] ascent of the [[patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] through a [[hierarchy]] of Ten Heavens. Enoch passes through the [[Garden of Eden]] in the [[Third Heaven]] on his way to meet the [[Yahweh|Lord]] face-to-face in the Tenth (chapter 22). Along the way he encounters vividly described populations of [[angel]]s who torment wrongdoers; he sees homes, [[olive oil]], and flowers.&lt;ref name="Langton2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Langton|title=Good and Evil Spirits: A Study of the Jewish and Christian Doctrine, Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT2QBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA248|date=11 July 2014|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-62564-991-1|pages=248–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's depiction of ten heavens represented an expansion of the ancient seven-heaven model. This expanded [[religious cosmology|cosmology]] was developed further in [[middle ages|medieval]] [[Christianity]].

== Hinduism ==
According to some [[Puranas]], the [[Brahmanda]] is divided into fourteen worlds.  Among these worlds, seven are upper worlds which constitute of Bhuloka (the Earth), Bhuvarloka, [[Svarloka]], Maharloka, Janarloka, Tapoloka and [[Satyaloka]], and seven are lower worlds which constitute of Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and [[Patala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshan|date=2010|title=Hinduism:An Alphabetical Guide|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-341421-6|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venerable Thomas Belchiam''' (1508–1537) was an English [[Franciscan]] who died in [[Newgate Prison]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. He is a Catholic [[martyr]], declared venerable by [[Pope Leo XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecatholic.com/a050727.html|title=The Observant Friar Martyrs of Greenwich (Seattle Catholic)|website=www.seattlecatholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year of death is in question: the ''[[Victoria County History]]'' for Kent puts the events in 1534.&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38219|title=Friaries: The observant friars of Greenwich - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It references [[Thomas Bourchier (Franciscan)|Thomas Bourchier]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica de Martyrio Fratrum...'', "though the writer assigns them to 1537".&lt;ref name=Kent/&gt; Dom [[Bede Camm]], O.S.B., places Belchiam's date of death as August 3, 1537.&lt;ref name=Camm&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02394b.htm Camm, Bede. "Ven. Thomas Belchiam." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 2.

==Life==
Belchiam was a friar of the convent at [[Greenwich]]. He was imprisoned, with other Franciscans, for refusing to take the [[Acts of Supremacy|oath of the royal supremacy]], and declaring the king to be a [[heresy|heretic]]. He was considered an accomplished prescher, and wrote a sermon on the text, 'Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses' (Matt. xi. 8), in which he lashed the vices of the court and the avarice and inconstancy of the clergy.&lt;ref name=Camm/&gt; At the intercession of [[Thomas Wriothesley]] some of the friars were released. Belchiam was kept in Newgate, where he died of starvation on 3 August 1537. Belchiam survived the last of his two fellow-prisoners upwards of a month, he likely being the youngest. As he lay dying, "...it so fell out that the frame of the earth gave a surprising shock, that the jail keepers were affrighted, and it was thought to be a universal earthquake...It is said that the king gave orders for the burial of Belchiam, his majesty being startled at the uncommon accidents that happened at his departure out of this life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mIgwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=Thomas+Belchiam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=McW44ZfFiR&amp;sig=99P6iJdlHFndlY5gGWPs8YWkWzs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjajK_BwtLcAhXM24MKHTTIB3s4ChDoATAEegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Belchiam&amp;f=false ''Modern British Martyrology'', Keating, Brown, 1836, p. 87{{PD-notice}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A copy of his sermon, found in the prison after his death, was brought to Henry VIII, who was affected by it, but had it burnt. Another copy was preserved by the friars, and [[Thomas Bourchier (Franciscan)|Thomas Bourchier]], writing in 1583, expressed a hope that it might be published; which apparently was never done.

'''Timothy "Tim" Austin''' (born April 14, 1971 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]) is a retired professional [[boxing|boxer]] from the [[United States]]. He is now a coach at the Cincinnati Golden Gloves gym in Cincinnati.

==Amateur career==
Austin had an outstanding amateur career, compiling a record of 113-9.

== Amateur accomplishments ==
* 1990 [[National Golden Gloves flyweight champion]]
* 1991 National Golden Gloves flyweight champion
* 1991 [[United States Amateur flyweight champion]]
* Representing the United States, Austin won a bronze medal as a flyweight at the 1992 Barcelona [[Olympics]]. His results were:
** 1st round bye
** Defeated [[Yuliyan Strogov]] (Bulgaria) 19-7
** Defeated [[Benjamin Mwangata]] (Tanzania) 19-8
** Lost to [[Raúl González]] (Cuba) RSC 1

==Pro career==
Known as "Cincinnati Kid", Austin won the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Bantamweight title by defeating [[Mbulelo Botile]] in 1997. He successfully defended his title ten times before losing to [[Rafael Marquez (boxer)|Rafael Marquez]] by an 8th-round technical knockout in 2003.

==Legal troubles==
Shortly after the loss to Marquez, Austin was accused, and later acquitted, of raping a 16-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/14/loc_amrep14.html&lt;/ref&gt;   With his legal troubles behind him, Austin resumed his career in 2005 but his comeback was quickly derailed when he lost via TKO to journeyman [[Eric Aiken]], who went on to win the IBF Bantamweight Title.

Austin had another run in with the law in January 2008.  He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after allegedly threatening to kill his wife, and for kicking and punching her about the face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080128/NEWS01/301280059 The Enquirer – Boxer charged with punching wife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name '''''Wiedergänger''''' refers to different [[zombie]] or ghost phenomena from different cultural areas. The word means "one who walks again" in [[German language|German]]. The core of the wiedergänger myth is the concept of the deceased, who — often in the form of a physical phenomenon — return to the world of the living. They usually cause problems and frighten living people. They exist either to avenge some injustice they experienced while alive, or because their [[soul]] is not ready to be released, as a consequence of their former way of life.

== German beliefs ==
In different parts of Germany, until the early 20th century, the belief was common that dead ones lived on, after their death, and exerted a disastrous influence from the grave. This influence was believed to be partly done via a [[telepathic]] effect (sympathy charm), so that the ''[[nachzehrer]]'', as the villain was called, did not need to rise from the grave and still could suck the vitality from living persons with his open mouth, his open eye and by gnawing on the burial shroud. Other undead, in the belief of the people, rose from the graves and jumped on the back of night ramblers. This [[Myling|''Aufhocker'']] could assume different shapes, for example in the [[Rhineland]], the form of the [[werewolf]]. The humans had to carry him, frequently as far as to the wall of the churchyard or to the place where the body was buried. The aufhocker (also called "huckop" or "huckupp") became ever more heavy, and the victim would finally break down exhausted or dead. In some legends, the troubled humans succeeded in banishing or redeeming the villain by a spell or a prayer. Especially in the areas marked by Catholicism the belief of the up-squatting wiedergänger merged with the belief of the soul, so that folklorists around 1920 had considerable difficulties to separate a belief in ghosts from the old nuclear belief of the undead wiedergänger. The Aufhocker after all could, according to the tradition, not be a [[ghost]], because he had a tangible body, which also increased in weight from step to step, which would not have been possible for an immaterial spirit. Another form of the physical wiedergänger is the [[headless horseman|headless rider]] that, frequently mentioned in West German legends, entered into world literature and even into the history of film through the American poet [[Washington Irving]] and his novel ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]''.

==Nordic mythology==
{{see also|Gjenganger}}
In the [[Saga (literature)|sagas]], wiedergänger in the form of [[draugr|draugar]] are a frequent motif. This occurs, for example, in the [[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]] or in the [[Laxdœla saga]]. Whoever met a wiedergänger is often threatened by imminent death. Remarkable here is the stress on the physicality of the wiedergänger, which on the one hand shows in its superhuman power, but on the other hand, in its vulnerability: draugar can be killed by decapitation.

==Early life==
Broadnax was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] in 1916, William Broadnax and Gussie Frazier.

==Career==
After moving to southern [[California]] in the mid-1940s, Wilmer and brother, William, joined the Southern Gospel Singers, a group which performed primarily on weekends. Wilmer and William soon formed their own quartet, the Golden Echoes. William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, but Willmer stayed on as lead singer. In 1949 the group, augmented by future [[Soul Stirrers|Soul Stirrer]] [[Paul Foster (singer)|Paul Foster]], recorded a single of "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]" for [[Specialty Records]]. Label chief [[Art Rupe]] decided to drop them before they could record a follow-up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

In 1950, Broadnax joined the [[Spirit of Memphis Quartet]]. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads -- [[Jethro "Jet" Bledsoe]], a bluesy crooner, and [[Silas Steele]], an overpowering baritone. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]], and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, Broadnax moved on, working with [[The Fairfield Four]], and in the early 1960s as one of the replacements for [[Archie Brownlee]] in the [[Five Blind Boys of Mississippi]]. Until 1965 Wilmer headed a quartet called "Little Ax and the Golden Echoes," which released some singles on [[Peacock Records]]. By then, quartet singing was fading in commercial viability, and Broadnax retired from touring.

==Later years and death==
In retirement, Broadnax continued to record new material occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 1970s and 1980s.

Upon Broadnex's death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was a trans man.&lt;ref name=liner&gt;[[Anthony Heilbut]], liner notes to ''Kings of the Gospel Highway'', Shanachie 2000 (discusses Broadnax's gender)&lt;/ref&gt;
