== Objectives ==
* "The restoration of Irish national sovereignty".
* "To seek to achieve unity among the Irish people on the issue of restoring national sovereignty and to promote the revolutionary ideals of republicanism and to this end involve itself in resisting all forms of colonialism and imperialism."
* "To seek the immediate and unconditional release of all Irish republican prisoners throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.32csm.info/const.html|title=32CSM|publisher=|access-date=20 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317214839/http://www.32csm.info/const.html|archive-date=17 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The organisation was founded as the '''32 County Sovereignty Committee'''&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; on 7 December 1997 at a meeting of like-minded [[Irish republican]]s in [[Finglas]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Those present were opposed to the direction taken by [[Sinn Féin]] and other mainstream republican groups in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], which would lead to the [[Belfast Agreement]] (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) the following year. The same division in the republican movement led to the paramilitary group now known as the [[Real IRA]] breaking away from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at around the same time.

Most of its founders had been members of Sinn Féin; some had been expelled from the party for challenging the leadership's direction, while others felt they had not been properly able to air their concerns within Sinn Féin at the direction its leadership had taken. [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt]],  wife of [[Michael McKevitt]] and a sister of [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger striker]] [[Bobby Sands]], was a prominent member of the group until a split in the organisation.

The name refers to the 32 [[counties of Ireland]] which were created during the [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. With the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1920–22, twenty-six of these counties formed the [[Irish Free State]] which became the [[Republic of Ireland]]; the remaining six counties of [[Northern Ireland]] remain part of the [[United Kingdom]].

Before the referendums on the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], the 32CSM lodged a legal submission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.32csm.info/UNsubmission.html|title=Submission to the UN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the United Nations challenging British sovereignty in Ireland. The referendums were opposed by the 32CSM, but were supported by 71% of voters in Northern Ireland and by 94% in the Republic of Ireland. In November 2005 the 32CSM launched a political initiative titled ''Irish Democracy, A Framework For Unity.''

On 24 May 2014 [[Gary Donnelly (Irish republican)|Gary Donnelly]], a member of the 32 Country Sovereignty Movement, was elected to the [[Derry]] and [[Strabane]] super council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27559217 |title=Gary Donnelly elected in Derry &amp; Strabane |publisher=BBC |date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/dissident-republican-gary-donnelly-takes-derry-and-strabane-super-council-seat-and-faces-ira-bomb-motion-30348381.html |title=Dissident republican Gary Donnelly takes Derry and Strabane super council seat and faces IRA bomb motion |publisher=The Belfast Telegraph |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 a delegation from the 32 County Sovereignty Movement travelled to Canada, to take part in a six-day speaking tour. On arrival the delegation was detained and refused entry into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulsterherald.com/2014/07/28/canadian-detention-a-political-decision-francis-mackey/ |title=Canadian detention a ‘political decision’ – Francis Mackey |publisher=Ulster Herald |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
[[File:Easter Rising Dublin Parade - 25 April 2010 -www.keepvid.com-.ogv|thumb |200px |32CSM march to commemorate [[Easter Rising]], Dublin, April 2010]]
The 32CSM has protested against what it calls "internment by remand" in both jurisdictions in Ireland.

Other protests include ones against former [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) leader [[Ian Paisley]] in [[Cobh]], County Cork, against former British Prime Minister [[John Major]] being given the Keys to [[Cork city]], against a visit to the Republic of Ireland by [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] head Sir [[Hugh Orde]], and against the Israeli [[Palestinian territories|occupation of Palestine]] and Anglo-American [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].

In 2015 the 32CSM organised a demonstration in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] in solidarity with the men convicted of shooting Constable Stephen Carroll, the first police officer to be killed in Northern Ireland since the formation of the PSNI. The organisation says the "Craigavon Two" are innocent and have been victims of a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/video-tempers-flare-at-irish-republican-protest-in-dundee-1.804762|title=VIDEO: Tempers flare at Irish republican protest in Dundee|last=Dinnie|first=Steven|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The 32 County Sovereignty Movement has often been critical of the Real  IRA's military actions.&lt;ref&gt;After the [[Omagh bombing|Omagh bomb attack]], the organisation issued a statement saying "the killing of innocent people could not be justified," and that it was "deeply saddened and devastated" by the attack. From [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/152512.stm "Links with terror group rejected"], BBC News, 17 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However the group is currently considered a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]] (FTO) in the [[United States]], because the group is considered to be inseparable from the Real IRA, which is designated as an FTO.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm|title=Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1330611/Real-IRA-designated-terrorists.html |title=Real IRA designated terrorists |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a briefing in 2001 a spokesman for the [[US Department of State]] stated that "evidence provided by both the British and Irish governments and open source materials demonstrate clearly that the individuals who created the Real IRA also established these two entities to serve as the public face of the Real IRA. These alias organizations engage in propaganda and fundraising on behalf of and in collaboration with the Real IRA." The US Department of State's designation made it illegal for Americans to provide material support to the Real IRA, requires US financial institutions to block the group's assets and denies alleged RIRA members visas into the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2001/2922.htm|title=Real IRA Designation (Taken question)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Ireland==
The 32CSM also operates outside of the island of Ireland to some extent. The [[Michael Gaughan (Irish republican)|Gaughan]]/[[Frank Stagg (Irish republican)|Stagg]] Cumann covers England, Scotland and Wales and has an active relationship of mutual promotion with a minority of British [[hard left]] groups, including the [[Anti-Fascist Action|Anti-Fascist Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gaughanstaggcumann.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/gaughanstagg-cumann32csm-continues-to.html|publisher=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM|title=Gaughan/Stagg Cumann(32CSM) continues to build on the unity between Antifascists and Irish Republicans|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=1542014856068531&amp;story_fbid=1544124079190942|publisher=Facebook|title=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2012/07/497944.html?c=on|publisher=Liverpool Antifascists|title=Antifascist Solidarity Needed in Liverpool on Saturday 21st July!|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Larkin Republican Flute Band (founded in 1996) in [[Liverpool]] and the [[West of Scotland Band Alliance]] (founded in 1979)–the largest section of which is the [[Glasgow]]-based Parkhead Republican Flute Band–are also supporters of the 32CSM&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe|2013|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (the larger flute band communities in these areas tend to be aligned to [[Sinn Féin]] instead). As of 2014 the 32CSM's paramilitary wing, the Real IRA, was also still involved in attempts to perpetrate bombings in Britain as part of the [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign]], which has been ongoing since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26229321 'IRA group' sent suspect packages to army offices].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">The '''Afghan Constitution Commission''' (or '''Afghan Constitutional Commission''') was established October 5, 2002 as required by the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]], which stipulated that a new [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[constitution]] be adopted by a [[loya jirga]]. The loya jirga was required to convene within eighteen months of the establishment of [[Afghan Transitional Administration]], which was established by the [[2002 Loya Jirga|Emergency Loya Jirga]] in June 2002. After some delay, the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|proposed Afghan Constitution]] was presented to President [[Hamid Karzai]] on November 3, 2003. A [[loya jirga (2003)|loya jirga]] began December 14, 2003 (four days after schedule) in [[Kabul]] and was endorsed January 4, 2004.

==Make up of the Commission==

The initial Commission was made up of nine members and started work on October 5, 2002. After its work was completed (although no draft was released) the initial Commission was replaced on May 7, 2003 by a 35-member Reviewing Commission, referred to as the Constitution Commission. The 35 members were all appointed by president Karzai. Seven of the members were women.

The commission set up eight regional offices in [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], [[Herat]], [[Kunduz]], Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar]] and [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] as well as in the [[Pakistan]]i cities of [[Peshawar]] and [[Quetta]], and in the [[Iran]]ian cities of [[Tehran]] and [[Mashhad]].

The process was being monitored by the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] and was funded by the [[United Nations Development Programme]].

==Consultation process==

Consultations with the Afghan public started June 10, 2003. Commission teams from Kabul and regional offices made trips through Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. [[Afghan refugees]] in the [[United States]] were also said to be consulted. The commission also distributed [[poster]]s and [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]]s, and a monthly [[newsletter]]. [[Radio]] and [[television]] announcements were also made.

==Delays and Final Release==

The initial goal was for the Commission to present the draft constitution by September 1, 2003, but in August commission members asked for a two-month delay to allow more time to gather reactions. On August 28 [[Ghulam Farooq Wardak]] announced that the loya jirga had been postponed until December 10. The commission wanted more time to consult with Afghans. [[Ghulam Farooq Wardak]], the director of the commission's secretariat, said the delay would give Afghans more time to decide if they wanted a republic, a parliamentary system, or a return to a monarchy. Other issues, he said, included the degree of centralization in Kabul and the role of Islam. He said 100,000 questionnaires from all provinces of Afghanistan had been completed and sent to the Commission.

The Commission presented its proposed constitution on November 3, 2003. The ceremony was attended by president Karzai, former king [[Mohammad Zaher Shah]], and [[United Nations]] special envoy [[Lakhdar Brahimi]].

The draft was distributed throughout the country to Provincial Governors and Wuluswals for distribution to political leaders. It was also be widely distributed via the Regional Offices of Secretariat of the Constitutional Commission to ELJ district representatives, to the media, including magazines [[Kellid]] and [[Morsal]].

==Opposition to the Proposed Constitution==

[[Bacha Khan Zadran]], a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] warlord in [[Paktia province]], criticized the proposed Constitution for abolishing the hereditary monarchy.

[[Mahbuba Hoquqmal]], the Afghan Minister of Women's Affairs, said the constitution does not grant protection to women's property rights, and does not prevent women being forced to marry without their consent, and does not offer better guarantees of equal treatment by Afghanistan's courts. 

Members of [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]]s, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]s and [[Baloch people|Baluch]] said that the Proposed Constitution alienated their cultures. For example, the draft states that [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] would be the two official languages, and that the national anthem would be sung in Pashto.

Other issues raised by some [[loya jirga (2003)|loya jriga]] delegates included whether former king [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] should maintain the title "father of the nation," whether Afghanistan should be a free market economy, and whether higher education should be free.

The '''African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources''' (known also as '''Algiers Convention''') is a continent-wide agreement signed in 1968 in [[Algiers]]. It supersedes the [[Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State]] of 1933 and has been superseded by the [[African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (revised)]] signed in Maputo in 2003.

{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
The '''All-Russian Central Executive Committee''' ({{lang-rus|Всероссийский Центральный Исполнительный Комитет|Vserossiysky Centralny Ispolnitelny Komitet}} ('''VTsIK''')), was the highest legislative, administrative, and revising body of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (Russian SFSR) from 1917 until 1937. Although the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] had supreme authority, in periods between its sessions its powers were passed to VTsIK.

==Organization==
The [[Russian Constitution of 1918|1918 Russian Constitution]] required that the VTsIK convene the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] no fewer than two times a year (Statute 26 of Article III).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article3.htm 1918 Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R., Article III]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Congresses]] could be called by the VTsIK or on the request of local Soviets. The VTsIK was elected by a full Congress, with no more than 200 individuals. It was completely subordinate to the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Congress]]. The functions of the Collegiate or the [[Presidium]] were not declared in the Constitution, but presumably they were supposed to be purely supervisory or revisionary bodies.

==Provisions==
VTsIK gave a general direction for the policies of the Worker-Peasant government and all bodies of the Soviet power in the country. It united and coordinated activities for legislation and administration as well as supervised the endorsement of the Soviet Constitution, declarations of the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] and central bodies of the Soviet power. The All-Russian Central Executive Committee reviewed and adopted the projects of decrees and other propositions introduced by the [[Council of People's Commissars]] and separate departments as well as issued its own decrees and instructions.

VTsIK summoned the All-Russian Congress of Soviets to which it presented the reports on its activity, general policy, and other inquiries. The All-Russian Central Executive Committee formed the Council of People's Commissars for general administrative affairs of the republic and departments (called People's Commissariats) for the management of separate branches of administration. Members of VTsIK worked in the departments or executed special assignments of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.

The state budget was defined by VTsIK and All-Russian Congress of Soviets together, in addition to defining the budgets of different regions.

==History==
The All-Russian Central Executive Committee was first elected at the very first All-Russian Congress of Soviets in [[St Petersburg|Petrograd]], June 3–24, 1917. The first Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets was not a governing body and its chairman [[Nikolai Chkheidze]] was not the head of Russian state. This changed at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets during the [[October Revolution]].

The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets met in, and elected the second Central Executive Committee. This then became the executive body of the RSFSR.

It was composed of
:62 [[Bolsheviks]]
:29 [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries|Left SRs]]
:10 [[Mensheviks]] and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Right SRs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/a/l.htm Encyclopedia of Marxism: Glossary of Organisations], [[marxists.org]], accessed 1 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chairman of the VTsIK was [[Lev Kamenev]], who directed the day-to-day work of the Committee. He only cast a vote if there was an even split in the committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/a/l.htm Encyclopedia of Marxism: Glossary of Organisations], [[marxists.org]], accessed 7 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name at one time was All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Workers', Peasants', Red Army, and Cossack Deputies (Всероссийский Центральный Исполнительный Комитет Советов рабочих, крестьянских, красноармейских и казачьих депутатов).

From the formation of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922, it downgraded from the highest level (federal) to the second level (federal-republic) of a governing body.

Following the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]], this organ was replaced with the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]].

==Chairmen of the Central Executive Committee of the RSFSR==
* [[Lev Kamenev]] (November 9–21, 1917)
* [[Yakov Sverdlov]] (November 21, 1917 - March 16, 1919) (''died in office'')
* [[Mikhail Vladimirsky]] (''acting'', March 16–30, 1919)
* [[Mikhail Kalinin]] (March 30, 1919 - July 15, 1938)

On December 30, 1922 the Soviet Union was formed. It comprised the Russian SFSR and other communist-controlled Soviet republics.  Mikhail Kalinin retained his position as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets and became Chairman of the newly formed [[Central Executive Committee of the USSR]] as well. Both positions were mostly ceremonial, increasingly so in later years.

'''Ann-Marie Williams''' is a [[Belizeans|Belizean]] public policy advisor, administrator and former journalist. After spending over two decades as a reporter, Williams became the first Executive Director for the National Women's Commission of Belize. She serves as a governmental advisor to the legislature and executive on issues impacting women. She was honored with the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award in 2011.

==Early life==
Ann-Marie Williams was born in [[Belize City]], Belize, the first daughter of a family of six siblings.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} She was raised by a single mother, who worked as a teacher and librarian.{{sfn|Downs|2017}} At the age of seventeen, Williams began working as an announcer at [[Radio Belize]], at the time, the only radio broadcaster in the country. Completing a course on journalism at the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication through the [[University of the West Indies]],{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} she continued her education, earning a bachelor's degree from the [[University College of Belize]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}}

==Career==
In 1988, Williams won the Edison Coleman Award for a program she produced for radio and was among the first reporters to read the news for [[Radio Belize]]. In 1995, she began the newscasts at [[Krem Radio]], both writing and reading the news for a year. She went on to serve as a news anchor for Channel 3 and later at [[Great Belize Television|Channel 5]] television. In 2000, wanting to further her education, Williams attended the [[University of Sussex]] in England, earning a master's degree in gender and development. Upon completion of her degree, she returned to Belize and Channel 5. Perhaps her most remembered expose as a journalist was the breaking of the story on the sale of Belizean passports in 2002, for which she and Channel 5 received awards from the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Union]] for investigative journalism. In 2003, she became an editor at ''[[The Reporter (Belize)|The Reporter]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}}

In 2008, Williams left journalism when she was appointed by the government, as the first executive director of the public policy advisory board on gender, the National Women's Commission. In that capacity, she administered public policy which relates to women's issues and advises the government on policies which expand women's equal access.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In one program she implemented, the Women in Politics Project, women are trained in the political process and requirements to be a public servant.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2012}} In 2011, from a pool of 200 international applicants, she received the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award.{{sfn|''Ambergris Today''|2011}}

Williams and the National Women's Commission came under fire in 2013, after developing a revised gender policy for the country, from various church leaders, who were alarmed at the apparent inclusion of [[LGBT rights in Belize|Belize's LGBT community]].{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}} Williams' position was that the new policy included terminology to bring the document into line with the [[Constitution of Belize]], which bars discrimination.{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}}{{sfn|''7 News''|2013}} At the time, a court challenge to Belize's [[anti-sodomy law]] was pending with several of the church bodies as opponents to legalization.{{sfn|Scott|2015}} Despite the controversy, the cabinet approved the policy by consensus.{{sfn|Ramos|2013}} In 2014, Williams was named a "trailblazer" in the program launched by [[Kim Simplis Barrow]], Special Envoy for Women and Children.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In 2015, she was awarded a Hubert Humphrey Fellowship and completed post-graduate studies at the [[American University Washington College of Law]] on [[human trafficking]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}} Williams launched an initiative for National Women's Commission in 2017 to reduce gender-based violence.{{sfn|''News 5''|2017}}

The '''chain of responsibility''' is a policy concept used in [[Australia|Australian]] [[transport]] [[legislation]] to place legal obligations on parties in the [[transport]] [[supply chain]] or across [[transport]] industries generally.  The concept was initially developed to apply in the heavy vehicle industry in regulated areas such as [[speeding]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and mass,  loading and dimension.  It has since spread to other transport sectors, particularly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] where it has been applied in laws which apply to the rail, bus, marine and taxi industries.

== Background ==
The chain of responsibility concept initially developed out of a recognition that unlawful behaviour by [[truck drivers]] is influenced and often controlled by the actions of other parties.  Concerns arose that transport laws had often focussed on the actions of drivers while failing to sufficiently recognise and regulate the actions of other key parties.  Chain of responsibility laws therefore seek to provide that these other parties cannot encourage, create incentives for, demand or allow drivers to undertake unlawful actions.

== Victorian reforms ==

=== Transport Legislation Review ===
In recent years, the chain of responsibility concept has been widely used as a basis for the reform of transport laws in the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  A major review of policy and legislation in that State, the [[Transport Legislation Review]], has led to the concept being adapted for use in a number of new statutes including the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]], the [[Bus Safety Act |Bus Safety Act 2009]] and the Marine Safety Act 2010.

=== Rail Safety Act ===
[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] faced the problem of ageing and inadequate transport legislation which failed to reflect modern policy.  During his [[second reading]] speech for a new rail safety statute in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the then Minister for Transport explained that -

::"It is now recognised that this legislative framework has not kept pace with contemporary developments in safety regulation ... (T) the legislation does not establish a coherent chain of responsibility for the effective management of rail safety risks.  For example, unlike other modern safety legislation, the (current) Act does not identify the key parties or individuals who can control risks and does not impose performance-based safety responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Hon [[Peter Batchelor]] MP, [[Second Reading]] Speech, [[Hansard]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[Parliament of Victoria]], 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Minister explained that -

::"... the Bill now before the House and include the establishment of performance-based rail safety duties for rail operators, managers of rail infrastructure, contractors working on rolling stock or rail infrastructure, and rail safety workers including drivers and maintainers of rolling stock and infrastructure to ensure safety so far as reasonably practicable. This effectively imposes rail safety duties and obligations on each person in the rail industry who is in a position to affect safety and clearly identifies the roles and the safety chain of responsibility between them. The duties emphasise the responsibility of each participant to take steps as far as reasonably practicable to identify hazards and manage risks to safety that are within their control. This includes persons whose influence on safety exists 'upstream', such as persons involved in design, manufacture, maintenance, repair and modification of rail infrastructure and rolling stock."&lt;ref&gt;Hon [[Peter Batchelor]] MP, [[Second Reading]] Speech, [[Hansard]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[Parliament of Victoria]], 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rail Safety Act]] which emerged from that process therefore imposes a chain of responsibility across all key parties in the rail industry in Victoria who can influence safety outcomes. Accountability at law and sanctions and penalties are allocated according to the level of responsibility each party has for creating and managing safety risks.  Similar approaches were taken by the [[Transport Legislation Review]] in its work which led to new statutes in Victoria in the bus, marine and taxi industries.

=== National impact ===
The Victorian work has had influence beyond that State.  Following the enactment of the Victorian [[Rail Safety Act]] in early 2006, Australian Transport Ministers&lt;ref&gt;Through their participation on the Australian Transport Council.&lt;/ref&gt; approved a national Model Rail Safety Bill in June 2006 which drew heavily on the Victorian work including its adaption of the chain of responsibility concept.  The national Bill proposal has since been adopted by all other States and Territories which have passed Rail Safety Acts reflecting the framework.&lt;ref&gt;See the article on the [[Rail Safety Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' prohibited racial segregation in schools, in 1963, Chicago's public schools continued to be segregated as a result of residential segregation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This was exacerbated by the migration of more black Americans from the [[Southern United States]] to Chicago during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; School boundary lines were drawn specifically to preserve racial segregation, even as predominantly [[Black people|black]] schools grew overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2013/10/22/1963-chicago-public-school-boycott|title=1963 Chicago Public School Boycott|website=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes were held in hallways, and there were not enough books for all of the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some schools held double shifts, meaning students attended less than a full day of class.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-history-200-000-students-boycotted-chicago-public-schools/|title=Today in history: 200,000 students boycotted Chicago public schools|last=Russum|first=Barbara|date=2012-10-22|work=People's World|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than send black students to underpopulated white schools, CPS Superintendent Benjamin Willis instituted the use of mobile classrooms; 625&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/31/obituaries/bc-willis-86-led-chicago-schools-for-13-years.html|title=B.C.

At one high school, these trailers were used to maintain segregation within the school; black students' classes were held in Willis Wagons, while white students went to class in the school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Freedom Day ==
In response to the school segregation enacted by Willis, community members began organizing resistance. Organizers included Chicago activist [[Albert Raby]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO) took the lead, organizing "Freedom Day," the mass boycott and protest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JybHqgpKAkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=sQPpSaWlyj&amp;dq=1963%20chicago%20public%20school%20boycott&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA1|title=Something Better for Our Children: Black Organizing in Chicago Public Schools, 1963–1971|last=Danns|first=Dionne|date=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415935753|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the chairman of the CCCO, Lawrence Landry, "The boycott is an effort to communicate dissatisfaction on how schools are being run."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=It's freedom day! expect thousands to participate|last=|first=|date=October 22, 1963|work=The Chicago Defender|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' estimated that forty percent of CPS students would participate in the boycott.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On October 22, 1963, nearly half of all CPS students skipped school, leaving schools on Chicago's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] and [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] mostly empty.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://facingfreedom.org/public-protest/school-boycott|title=School Boycott {{!}} Facing Freedom|website=facingfreedom.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that 224,770 students were absent from CPS, amounting to 47 percent of the student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=224,770 or 47 Pct. of all Pupils, Miss Classes|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1963|work=Chicago Tribune|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the boycott, nearly 10,000 protesters marched in [[Chicago Loop|Chicago's downtown]], stopping outside the Chicago Board of Education offices. [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] kept protesters from entering the building.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

While Freedom Day was popular and widely covered, it did not have significant impact in changing the policies of Superintendent Willis. This ''[[de facto]]'' school segregation was supported by Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2013/05/20/remembering-chicagos-great-school-boycott-of-1963|title=Remembering Chicago's great school boycott of 1963|last=Joravsky|first=Ben|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who went on to nominate two school board members who did not support the CCCO's push for integration. Ultimately, CPS was not moved to integrate after Freedom Day, despite the best efforts of Black activists and the CCCO.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Use of Willis Wagons prevailed,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Willis himself did not retire until 1966 (albeit four months before the end of his term).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, the size of the first Freedom Day protest inspired subsequent boycotts in Chicago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=2 BIG UPSETS: BOYCOTT WINS!

The Freedom Day protest inspired Reverend [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s move to Chicago in 1966.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before Freedom Day, in August, 1963, then-college student [[Bernie Sanders]] was arrested while protesting the policies of Superintendent Willis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-bernie-sanders-1963-chicago-arrest-20160219-story.html|title=Arrest photo of young activist Bernie Sanders emerges from Tribune archives|last=Skiba|first=Katherine|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary on Freedom Day, ''63 Boycott'', is in production.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, CPS is the most segregated big-city school district in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''colour trade mark''' (or '''color trademark''', see [[spelling differences]]) is a [[non-conventional trademark|non-conventional]] [[trade mark]] where at least one [[color|colour]] is used to perform the trade mark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services. 

In recent times colours have been increasingly used as trade marks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect colours as trademarks through registration, as a colour as such was not considered to be a distinctive 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]],{{ref|TRIPs}} which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to colour trade marks in most countries, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

This category of trade marks is distinguished from conventional (word or logo) trade marks that feature a specific colour or combination of colours; the latter category of trade marks present different legal issues.

Requirements are set out in the ''Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure'' issued by IP Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeno.ipaustralia.gov.au/D:/Exmanual/pt20_29/part21.htm#5|title=- IP Australia|publisher=Xeno.ipaustralia.gov.au|accessdate=29 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community Trade Mark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In Libertel Groep v Benelux Merkenbureau (case C-104/01)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/c-104_01en.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs capable of constituting a trade mark- Distinctive character - Colour per se - Orange) |publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated May 6, 2003 the ECJ repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs of which a trade mark may consist - Distinctive character and graphic representability - Unsuitability of olfactory signs as trade marks)|publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that graphical representation preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

This definition generally encompasses colour marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM or a national trademark in the EC may define their colour trademark using an international colour code such as [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] or [[Pantone]]. In most cases, a colour trademark will be registered only after an enhanced distinctiveness through use in the EC has been proved.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], trade marks consisting of colours or combinations of colours can be registered. However, an applicant's ability to register colour trade marks is limited by several considerations, in line with European Union jurisprudence. Thus, for example, while a trade mark described simply as a colour is registrable, a trade mark described as consisting "predominantly" of a particular colour is not. In a recent case, the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery held that an application to register such a trade mark was permissible in ''[[Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited]]'' (2012), but on appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk-purple-trademark-blocked&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the United States Court of Appeals ruled in 1985 that [[Owens Corning]] had the right to prevent competitors from using the colour [[pink]] in their insulation products, thus making Owens Corning the first company in the United States to trademark a colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-branding-legal-rights | title=Color Branding &amp; Trademark Rights | work=Color Matters | accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the United States Supreme Court further acknowledged that a colour could be used as a trademark in the case of ''[[Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995).
The trademark owner must show that the trademark colour has acquired substantial distinctiveness, and the colour indicates source of the goods to which it is applied.

====Functionality bar====
The Lanham Act specifically states that "[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it (e) Consists of a mark which (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional." {{USC|15|1052(e)(5)}}.
If a colour is held functional for any product, then it is not registrable or protectable as a trademark. 
Several U.S. Courts have dealt with the matter, and colours have been held functional for various purposes.
In [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425 (TTAB 2007), the purple colour was considered functional for coated abrasives, because “[i]n the field of coated abrasives, color serves a myriad of functions, including color coding, and the need to color code lends support for the basic finding that color, including purple, is functional in the field of coated abrasives having paper or cloth backing.” [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425, 1447 (TTAB 2007).
The [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], in [[In re Ferris Corp.]], 59 USPQ2d 1587 (TTAB 2000), held that the colour pink for wound dressings was functional and not registrable, as its colour resembles human skin and was selected for this specific purpose.
In [[In re Orange Communications, Inc.]], 41 USPQ2d 1036 (TTAB 1996), the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] denied registration for the colours orange and yellow for public telephones and telephone booths, because it confers the goods better visibility under any lighting condition.
Also, the colour coral was held functional for earplugs, because it makes them easier to see in safety checks. [[In re Howard S. Leight &amp; Associates Inc.]], 39 USPQ2d 1058 (TTAB 1996).

====Aesthetical functionality bar====
In addition to the functionality bar, the colour cannot have an aesthetically functional purpose in order to be registrable or protected. In [[Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull]], for example, the [[United States Patents and Trademark Office]]'s [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] held that the black colour was not registrable for outboard motors:
"[A]lthough the color black is not functional in the sense that it makes these engines work better, or that it makes them easier or less expensive to manufacture, black is more desirable from the perspective of prospective purchasers because it is color compatible with a wider variety of boat colors and because objects colored black appear smaller than they do when they are painted other lighter or brighter colors. The evidence shows that people who buy outboard motors for boats like the colors of the motors to be harmonious with the colors of their vessels, and that they also find it desirable under some circumstances to reduce the perception of the size of the motors in proportion to the boats." [[British Seagull Ltd. v. Brunswick Corp.]], 28 USPQ 2d 1197, 1199 (1993).
Even though there is no direct function for the colour black in this case, protection was denied under the argument that consumers prefer it for aesthetic purposes.

A similar judgement was entered in [[Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand]]. Deere &amp; Co. tried to establish exclusive use of its John Deere green colour as a trademark, in order to enjoin Farmhand from applying it to its products. Although the John Deere green colour does not provide any specific function to the good to which it is applied, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa|United States District Court for S.D. Iowa]] "found that farmers prefer to match their loaders to their tractor". Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 85, 98 (U.S. Dist. Court S.D. Iowa, 1982). Therefore, if Deere &amp; Co. were awarded exclusive use of the John Deere green, its competitors would be in disadvantage because of reasons unrelated to the functional quality or price of its products.

The '''Community Plant Variety Office''' ('''CPVO''') is an [[agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]], located in [[Angers]], [[France]]. It was established in 1994.  Its task is to administer a system of [[plant breeders' rights|plant variety rights]], also known as [[plant breeders' rights]], a form of [[intellectual property|intellectual property right]] relating to plants.

The CPVO manages the largest system of plant variety rights in the World.  Since the creation of the CPVO in 1995 the office has received over 61,000, of which it granted over 47,000 applications, with over 25,000 titles currently in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpvo.europa.eu/en/about-us/what-we-do/statistics|work=CPVO|title=Statistics|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Plant Variety Right==
Plant variety rights allow plant breeders to protect new varieties (or types of plants). The CPVO was created to encourage the creation of new plant varieties in the European Union, through the provision of better intellectual property protection for plant breeders. The Community plant variety right, gives the holder of this right an exclusive right to market the protected variety within the territory of the European Union. The Community PVR is valid for a period of 25 to 30 years.

=== Breeders’ Exemption ===
The Breeders’ Exemption ensures that anyone is allowed to use protected (PVR) varieties as a basis for the creation of new varieties. The Breeders’ Exemption exists to ensure that PVR and the need to reward breeders for their work is balanced with the need for new &amp; better varieties to reach &amp; benefit the consumer as quickly as possible. It also ensures the continued production of new varieties as breeders need access to as much genetic resources as possible, including protected varieties, in order to create new varieties.

=== Application ===
The CPVO system of PVR protection means that only one application need be made (directly to the CPVO) in order to attain EU wide protection. Before its introduction, EU wide protection was only possible through obtaining national plant variety rights from the individual member states. That option still exists today. 

As part of the application procedure, each candidate variety is tested by an examination office.  The examination offices are based in the member states, where they are operated by national experts.  The examination offices determine whether the variety is distinct, uniform and stable – this is called a DUS test.  The CPVO does not own any technical infrastructure.

The results of the DUS tests are used by the CPVO when taking the decision to grant or refuse a PVR application.

== Organisation of the CPVO ==
[[File:Martin Ekvad, President of CPVO.jpg|left|thumb|146x146px|Martin Ekvad, President of CPVO (2015)]]
Based in Angers, France the CPVO was created by the Council Regulation 2100/94 and has been operational since the 27 April 1995.

The CPVO is entirely self-financed.  It neither takes from nor contributes to the EU budget.  The CPVO’s budget is principally derived from PVR application fees paid by breeders who wish to protect their creations.  
[[File:Administration council (2015).jpg|thumb|286x286px|Administration council of CPVO with the European Commissioner, [[Vytenis Andriukaitis]]. (2015)]]

The President of the CPVO is appointed by the Council of the European Union.  The President is responsible for the overall functioning of the CPVO – this includes the implementation of the CPVO’s legislative duties and all operational aspects of the CPVO. The current president of the CPVO is Martin Ekvad. Ekvad was appointed to this position in 2011.  Prior to his appointment, Ekvad held the position of Head of the Legal Unit of the CPVO from 2003 to 2011.

The CPVO is supervised by the Administrative Council (AC) of the CPVO.  The AC is made up of representatives from across the 28 member states, representatives from the European Commission and observer organisations. The AC is also the budgetary authority of the CPVO and adopts the responsibilities annual work programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5404">The '''Constitutional Court of the Republic of Abkhazia''' was created in 2016. Judges are elected by the [[People's Assembly of Abkhazia|People's Assembly]] with a two-thirds majority for fifteen year terms and may not be re-elected. Candidates are nominated by the [[President of Abkhazia|President]] and must have a law degree, at least fifteen years experience in a legal profession and must at least forty years old.&lt;ref name="inform4919"/&gt; A group of at least one third of all deputies may formally propose candidates to the President.&lt;ref name="inform4920"/&gt;

==Composition==
The law on the Constitutional Court prescribed that it would have five judges, that it would start operating when at least three judges had been sworn in and that this had to happen by 1 January 2017.

In November 2016, President [[Raul Khajimba]] nominated five candidates: former Justice Minister [[Liudmila Khojashvili]], former Central Election Chairman [[Sergei Smir]], two time Presidential candidate [[Iakub Lakoba]], as well as [[Tamaz Ketsba]] and [[Raul Pant]]. On 22 November, the People's Assembly elected Khojashvili and Pant with 26 and 25 votes respectively, while Smyr, Ketsba and Lakoba received only 20, 17 and 12 votes out of 35 total.&lt;ref name="inform4919"&gt;{{cite news|title=ВАЛЕРИЙ БГАНБА СОЖАЛЕЕТ, ЧТО КОНСТИТУЦИОННЫЙ СУД НЕ СФОРМИРОВАН.|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/4919-valerij-bganba-sozhaleet-chto-konstitutsionnyj-sud-ne-sformirovan|accessdate=10 December 2016|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament's failure to approve three out of five candidates was criticised by Khajimba, claiming that the procedure obliged deputies to vote for or against, while many had in fact abstained, and pointing out that Ketsba's candidacy in particular had been proposed by a group of Parliament members.&lt;ref name="inform4920"&gt;{{cite news|title=РАУЛЬ ХАДЖИМБА ПРИЗВАЛ ДЕПУТАТОВ ПАРЛАМЕНТА БОЛЕЕ ОТВЕТСТВЕННО ПОДХОДИТЬ К РАССМОТРЕНИЮ ВАЖНЫХ ДЛЯ ГОСУДАРСТВА ВОПРОСОВ|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/4920-raul-khadzhimba-prizval-deputatov-parlamenta-bolee-otvetstvenno-podkhodit-k-rassmotreniyu-vazhnykh-dlya-gosudarstva-voprosov|accessdate=10 December 2016|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November, Khojashvili and Pant were formally sworn in.&lt;ref name="press_sudi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poluyan|first1=Elena|title=Судьи Конституционного суда Абхазии приняли присягу|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/sudi-konstitutsionnogo-suda-abkhazii-prinyali-prisyagu/|accessdate=11 December 2016|agency=[[Apsnypress]]|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following opposition protests against the government of Khajimba, the opposition and the government reached an agreement whereby the opposition could nominate a new Prosecutor General and two members of the Constitutional Court. It selected the lawyer Roza Zantaria and Sukhumi City Court judge Rustam Chagava. In addition, incumbent Prosecutor General [[Nuri Tania]] was nominated as Constitutional Court judge. However, on 29 December, the People's Assembly postponed the vote stating that it rejected Chagava as too inexperienced and that Zantaria had refused the nomination.&lt;ref name="inform5124"&gt;{{cite news|title=ВОПРОС ИЗБРАНИЯ СУДЕЙ КС ПЕРЕНЕСЕН НА ЯНВАРЬ|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/5124-vopros-izbraniya-sudej-ks-perenesen-na-yanvar|accessdate=26 February 2017|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the deadline on the formation of the Constitutional Court had been missed, on 18 January 2017 the People's Assembly adopted a bill formally postponing the deadline to 1 June 2017.&lt;ref name="press_srok"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poluyan|first1=Elena|title=Срок формирования Конституционного суда продлен до первого июня текущего года|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/srok-formirovaniya-konstitutsionnogo-suda-prodlen-do-pervogo-iyunya-tekushchego-goda/|accessdate=27 February 2017|agency=[[Apsnypress]]|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also elected Tania with the support of 24 of the 27 deputies present.&lt;ref name="inform5189"&gt;{{cite news|title=НУРИЙ ТАНИЯ ИЗБРАН СУДЬЕЙ КОНСТИТУЦИОННОГО СУДА РЕСПУБЛИКИ АБХАЗИЯ|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/5189-nurij-taniya-izbran-sudej-konstitutsionnogo-suda-respubliki-abkhaziya|accessdate=26 February 2017|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, the People's Assembly elected with 25 votes in favour, 2 against and 2 spoiled ballots a different opposition nominee, Head of the Cabinet Staff [[Diana Pilia]].&lt;ref name="inform5318"&gt;{{cite news|title=ДИАНА ПИЛИЯ ИЗБРАНА СУДЬЕЙ КОНСТИТУЦИОННОГО СУДА РЕСПУБЛИКИ АБХАЗИЯ|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/5318-diana-piliya-izbrana-sudej-konstitutsionnogo-suda-respubliki-abkhaziya|accessdate=26 February 2017|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5797">The '''Convention and Statute on the International Régime of Maritime Ports''' is a 1923 [[League of Nations]] [[multilateral treaty]] whereby port states agree to treat ships equally, regardless of the [[maritime flag|nationality of the ship]].

The Convention was concluded in [[Geneva]] on 9 December 1923 and entered into force on 26 July 1926. The states that ratify the Convention agree to allow all ships the freedom to access maritime ports and to not discriminate against ships based on the [[maritime flag]] the ship flies. The Convention remains in force and forms of the basis of the expectation at international law of equal treatment in maritime ports.

The Convention was most recently ratified in 2001, by [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. [[Thailand]] ratified the Convention in 1925 but denounced it in 1973.

The '''Cotton Futures Act of 1914''' authorized the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to establish physical standards as a means of determining color grade, staple length and strength, and other qualities and properties for [[cotton]].  It was intended to minimize speculative manipulation of the cotton market. 

The Act was rendered [[unconstitutional]] in [[Federal district court]] because it originated in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].  As a revenue act, it should have been drafted in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]]. It was replaced by the [[Cotton Futures Act of 1916]].

==Background==
CVN was founded in 2006.  Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, CVN also has offices in New York City, NY; Washington, D.C.; and Sunnyvale, California.

== Litigation ==

On October 14, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that CVN was entitled to webcast a federal hearing over the objection of one of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17784008847269474633&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |title=E*Trade Financial Corp. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 582 F.Supp.2d 528 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) |publisher=Google |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2009, a federal district court's order allowing CVN to webcast a hearing in a high-profile copyright infringement case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Ashby |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/04/08/a-different-kind-of-lawsuit-billion-dollar-charlie-v-the-riaa/ |title=Wall Street Journal Law Blog, "A Different Kind of Lawsuit" |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/gertner/pdf/tenenbaumbroadcastord.pdf |title=Capitol Records v.

'''Denunciation''' in the context of [[Sentence (law)|sentencing philosophy]] is the disapproval of an act by society that is expressed by the imposition of a sentence. This is one of the purposes of sentencing, as well as a possible justification for the imposition of a sentence.

Denunciation arguments can be used to justify more serious sentences than are required by the principles of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] and [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]].

Denunciation arguments can also be used to justify the existence of laws which are never enforced; they stand as statements of a society's values rather than working parts of a criminal justice system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11646">The '''Draft United Nations resolution on Israeli settlements''' placed before the [[United Nations Security Council]]  proposed that all [[Israeli settlements]] established in the [[Palestinian territories|occupied Palestinian territories]] after [[Six-Day War|1967]] be condemned, and urged that [[Israel]] and [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]] comply with their obligations under the [[Road map for peace|Road Map]] plan in order to establish a [[two-State solution]]. The resolution failed to pass after the United States exercised its right to [[veto]] on February 18, 2011. The other 14 members of the council voted in favour of the resolution.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37572&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1= 'United States vetoes Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements.'] UN News Center, 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|peace process]] was revitalized in September 2010, with [[Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010|direct talks]] between Israel and Palestine, with the U.S. supporting the negotiations. With little headway made, the Palestinian National Authority decided to present a draft resolution to the Security Council, resisting strong pressure from both United States President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Greenberg,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/20/AR2011022002203.html 'Palestinians protest U.S. veto of resolution condemning Israel's settlement policy],' at Washington Post, 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A month into the discussions a roadblock was hit when a 10-month settlement construction freeze was allowed to expire on September 26. On October 2, Mahmoud Abbas announced that peace negotiations will not continue until settlement construction is once again stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Saud Abu Ramadan, Emad Drimly, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-10/03/c_13540450.htm  ‘Palestinians halt direct peace talks with Israel, keep contacts with U.S.,’] at [[Xinhuanet]],  October 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Security Council vote==
The resolution was sponsored by over 120 of the UN's 192 members states.
The U.S. attempted several times to persuade Palestine to rescind the resolution or accept a non-binding resolution instead. Palestine refused and brought the resolution to the Security Council. The final vote was 14 for and the U.S., whose vote holds veto power, alone was against it. The United States, in voting against a resolution that would have condemned Israeli settlements as illegal, argued that while settlement activity violated international legality, the resolution, if passed, would only harden the positions of both sides, complicate stalled negotiations and hinter future talks.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barak Ravid and Reuters,[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/palestinians-u-s-veto-of-un-settlement-resolution-harms-the-cause-of-peace-1.344339 'Palestinians: U.S. veto of UN settlement resolution harms the cause of peace,'] at Haaretz 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 120 U.N. member states supported the resolution. This was the first U.N. veto used by the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Sawafta, Maayan Lubell, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/us-palestinians-usa-idUSTRE71I2SU20110219 ‘Palestinians will not spurn U.S. despite veto: Abbas,’] at [[Reuters]] (US), February 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maher Abukhater [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/02/west-bank-obama-calls-abbas-who-calls-for-urgent-leadership-meeting.html WEST BANK: Obama calls Mahmoud Abbas, who calls for urgent leadership meeting,‘] at [[Los Angeles Times]],February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas commented that the US veto allowed Israel to escape its obligations. Israel's Foreign Ministry expressed its appreciation for the US position, and expressed regret that the other Security Council members had refrained from making the same contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Ravid and Reuters,[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/palestinians-u-s-veto-of-un-settlement-resolution-harms-the-cause-of-peace-1.344339 'Palestinians: U.S. veto of UN settlement resolution harms the cause of peace,'] at [[Haaretz]] 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response==
* {{flag|Great Britain}}{{flag|France}}{{flag|Germany}}-Britain, France and Germany put out a joint statement in which they explained they had voted for the resolution "because our views on settlements, including east Jerusalem, are clear: they are illegal under international law, an obstacle to peace, and constitute a threat to a two-state solution. All settlement activity, including in east Jerusalem, should cease immediately." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/19/us-veto-israel-settlement&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|US}}- Ambassador [[Susan E. Rice]], explained her veto of the resolution as "this draft resolution risks hardening the positions of both sides. It could encourage the parties to stay out of negotiations", she made note that the U.S. did not support Israeli settlements but that "[W]e reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity,...Continued settlement activity violates Israel’s international commitments, devastates trust between the parties, and threatens the prospects for peace…"&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;
* {{flag|State of Palestine}}-[[Mahmoud Abbas]], President of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], stated "We only want to protect our interest and our rights as guaranteed in international law", he also stated that "We are not seeking to break from the U.S. administration and it is not in our interest to do that"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/abbas-ties-with-u-s-won-t-be-severed-over-veto-of-un-settlement-resolution-1.344435 Abbas: Ties with U.S. won't be severed over veto of UN settlement resolution,'] at [[Haaretz]], 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hamas]] spokesperson Fawzi Barhoum, said that "The veto reveals the reality of the clear US support to what the Zionist enemy does against our people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsworld.php?id=564902, Hamas Says US Veto ON un Draft Resolution On Jewish Settlement "Arbitrary",]   [[Bernama]].com (Malaysian National News Agency), 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riyad Mansour]], Palestine's permanent observer to the U.N., stated that “Our overarching goal remains to bring an end to the Israeli colonization and occupation of our land and its destruction of the two-State solution...We fear, however, that the message sent today may be one that only encourages further Israeli intransigence and impunity.”&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;
* {{flag|Israel}}- Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s office replied to the veto that "Israel deeply appreciates the decision by President Obama to veto the Security Council Resolution"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-deeply-appreciates-u-s-veto-on-un-resolution-condemning-settlements-1.344390  'Israel ‘deeply appreciates’ U.S. veto on UN resolution condemning settlements,’] at [[Haaretz]] Feb 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibrahim Sarsur]], an Arab member of the Israeli Knesset responded that “Obama cannot be trusted. We knew his promises were lies. The time has come to spit in the face of the Americans.”&lt;ref&gt;Gil Hoffman [http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=208962 ‘Obama can go to hell,’ says Arab MK on UNSC vote,'] at [[Jerusalem Post]], 20 Feb, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel]]i ambassador to the U.N., Meron Reuben, stated that "the resolution before you should never have been submitted,... Instead, the international community and the Security Council should have called upon the Palestinian leadership, in a clear and resolute voice, to immediately return to the negotiating table.”&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;
* {{flag|Egypt}}- The Egyptian Foreign Ministry commented that "The veto, which contradicts the American public stance rejecting settlement policy, will lead to more damage to the United States' credibility on the Arab side as a mediator in peace efforts,"&lt;ref&gt;Nasser Abu Bakr, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ifflqam3p-WgFw7YZaXXD2OnLVig%3FdocId%3DCNG.f3d6e29822cba620b8abbd76ef5e73c8.4a1  'Palestinians to make fresh UN anti-settlement bid,'] at [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] Feb 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|UN}}- Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] did not voice an opinion on the vote outcome, instead stating "The international community agrees on the urgent need for a negotiated settlement that will end the occupation that started in 1967 and establish an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. We must do all we can to help the parties move forward."&lt;ref&gt;Ban KI-Moon [https://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1729 'Press Release,'], Office of Ban Ki Moon,  United Nations, 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Organisation of the Islamic Conference}}- The organisation which represents 57nations responded by stating that "[The veto] is a devastating blow to the credibility of international efforts to resume the peace process"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/166126.html 'OIC slams US veto of UN resolution,'] PressTV, Feb 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Middle East [[Human Rights Watch]] director [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], released the statement, "President Obama wants to tell the Arab world in his speeches that he opposes settlements, but he won’t let the Security Council tell Israel to stop them in a legally binding way,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/18/israel-us-veto-settlements-undermines-international-law 'Israel: US Veto on Settlements Undermines International Law,'] at [[Human Rights Watch]], 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tawfik Tirawi]], a member of [[Fatah]]'s Central Committee, called upon Palestinians to hold a 'day of rage' the following Friday to protest the American vetoing of the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/node/368784 'Day of rage' called to protest US veto,'] at [[Arab News]], 19 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/palestinians-plan-day-of-rage-to-protest-u-s-veto-on-un-settlement-resolution-1.344425?localLinksEnabled=false 'Palestinians plan 'Day of Rage' to protest U.S. veto on UN settlement resolution,'] at [[Haaretz]], 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A protest is held outside the U.S. embassy in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, the day following the vote, with approximately 50 people attending it. One protestor was reported to have stated the protest was part of "a new campaign pointing a finger at the US complicity in Israeli crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hartman [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=208943 'Protesters rally at US embassy in TA to slam UNSC veto,'] at 19 Feb, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; The following Sunday, approximately 3000 Palestinians gather in Ramallah to protest the veto.&lt;ref&gt;Saed Bannoura, [http://www.imemc.org/article/60679 'Thousands of Palestinians Protest U.S. Veto of Settlement Resolution,']  at [[International Middle East Media Center|Imemc]], 21 Feb, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">In the [[United States]] '''Enhanced Use Lease''' ('''EUL''') is a method for funding [[construction]] or renovations on [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] property by allowing a private developer to [[lease]] underutilized property, with rent paid by the developer in the form of cash or in-kind services.  Currently, EULs are used by the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration.  Temporary authority has also been granted to the General Services Agency and the National Aeronatics and Space Administration.  EUL authority is derived from Congress and is specific to each agency (e.g. 10 USC 2667 for the DoD).  The information below is specific to DoD EULs.

Granted a ground lease (the term may vary by agency or project), the developer is able to make improvements to the property which can be leased at market rents to any interested tenants.  Under EUL, the U.S. government retains control over the leased property, the EUL developer (lessee) retaines a lease interest only.

Since the agency can issue enhanced use leases only on land that is unneeded, the improvements must not be directly tied to any programmatic requirements of the installation.   

The advantages to the developer include prime secure convenient locations on military installations, and the opportunity to provide sole-source services and products in lieu of rent for the ground lease. 

The advantages to the federal agency include the possibility of fast-tracking alterations, repairs or new construction so that the improved space becomes available for lease.  In-kind considerations or cash to no less than the fair market value of the property is provided in return by the developer.

The enhanced use lease is becoming a very popular tool to accommodate realignment of military functions under [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC).  Military installations are legally bound, but not necessarily funded, to accommodate BRAC-mandated realignments of functions.  

The use of EULs has mushroomed with the expanded authority of Title 10 USC, Section 2667, of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]].  It remains to be seen whether this form of privatization will create increased financial, security or environmental risks.  Legal complications that have emerged include how EUL-encumbered property will be treated when an installation is targeted for closure under BRAC (example, Building 40 at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]]).

[[Image:Cebus capucinus.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Capuchin monkey]]s are among the primates kept as exotic pets]]
An '''exotic pet''' is a rare or unusual animal [[pet]]: an animal kept within human households which is generally thought of as a wild species rather than as a pet.

==Definition==
The definition is an evolving one; some [[rodent]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[amphibia]]ns have become firmly enough established in the world of [[animal fancy]] to sometimes no longer be considered exotic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Sometimes any unique or wild-looking pet (including common domestic animals such as the [[ferret]] and the [[fancy rat]]) is considered an exotic pet.

"Exotic" generally refers to a species which is not native or indigenous to the owner's locale, and "pet" is a companion animal living with people.&lt;ref&gt;"A framework for assessing the suitability of different species as companion animals, [http://bcspca.pub30.convio.net/assets/documents/welfare/exotic-animal-legislation/appendix-c-framework-for.pdf Appendix C]"; Animal Welfare 2000, 9:359-372, '''p.&amp;nbsp;360''' ''pet animal'', as defined by the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals (Council of Europe 1987) as: ''animals sharing man's companionship and in particular living in his household''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed span|However, many use the term to include native species as well.|date=January 2013}} Therefore, the [[American College of Zoological Medicine]] has defined the group as "zoological companion animals".

Legally, the definition is subject to local jurisdiction, but in the United States is defined federally, in part, as "[An animal] ... that is native to a foreign country or of foreign origin or character, is not native to the United States, or was introduced from abroad" (a broad scope which would include most pets, such as housecats, domesticated dog breeds, horses, canaries, and parakeets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exotic Animal Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/e/exotic-animal/|publisher=USLegal|accessdate=8 October 2012|quote=Exotic animal is defined by 9 CFR 1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "[The term pet] ...excludes exotic animals and wild animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pet animal|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/pet-animal/|publisher=USLeagal|accessdate=8 October 2012|quote=According to 9 CFR 1.1 [Title 9 – Animals and Animal Products; Chapter I – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Legality===

The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or [[CITES]], moderates the trade of some exotic pets around the world, to prevent any threats to their survival and ecological damage. Certain animals may be strictly regulated or restricted outright due to both their [[conservation status]], as well as the possibility of the animal becoming an [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.shtml|title=What is CITES?|accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] issues permits for keeping and breeding certain exotic species, whether captured from the wild or bred. In the United States, for example, it is illegal to import [[non-human primates]] for the pet trade, but animals bred in captivity exist in the trade, using animals descended from those brought in legally before the ban was enacted. As of September 2014, most [[United States|US states]] forbid or regulate the possession of exotic pets, but 5 states have no license or permit requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornfreeusa.org/b4a2_exotic_animals_summary.php Summary of US State laws regarding Exotic Pets from the Born Free USA website] and [http://www.bornfreeusa.org/downloads/pdf/StateLawMaps_EXOTICS.pdf Map of Exotic-Animal-Laws at Born Free USA website]. Both accessed May 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the US Captive Wild Animal Safety Act became law and in September 2007 the US Fish and Wildlife Service enacted rules to enforce the CWASA.  The law now bans the sale or transport of big cats, which includes lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, snow leopards, clouded leopards, cheetahs and their hybrids across state lines for the pet trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/E7-16085.htm Federal Register: August 16, 2007 (Volume 72, Number 158)]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Trafficking===

Illegally transporting exotic pets is also known as [[wildlife smuggling]], and the industry generates an estimated $7 Billion to $23 Billion (USD) each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.awf.org/news/world-wildlife-day-highlights-severity-wildlife-crime|title=World Wildlife Day Highlights Severity of Wildlife Crime|date=2015-03-02|work=African Wildlife Foundation|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While there are many ways that live animals are smuggled across borders, there are often heavy losses due to the methods of transportation; many species of small animals can be piled into tiny, and usually airtight, containers and often die as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25877368 Hundreds of dead wild animals found at South Africa airport].&lt;/ref&gt; In one example of smuggling, [[slow loris]]es trafficked from Indonesia have their teeth removed prior to being sold locally, or exported to Japan or Russia. The animals are not given any pain relievers during their surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/explore-animals-illegal-pet-trade-slow-loris/|title=Are Humans Pushing the Slow Loris to Extinction?|date=2017-09-26|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International treaties (such as [[CITES]]) have been established to combat the illegal sale and transport of vulnerable animals and plants, but failure to properly enforce these regulations leave many loopholes for the illegal trade to continue. For example, the United States has both signed CITES during its creation as well as created its own national laws against the import and sale of elephant ivory, but as of 2008 it was found to be the second largest importer of it behind China. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/080505-us-ivory.html|title=U.S. One of Largest Ivory Markets, New Study Says|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the world===

Historically, trade in exotic pets has been known to drive the destruction and extinction of animals in the wild. To a much smaller extent, this holds today: one of the major factors behind the status of the [[slow loris]] is the fact it is often kept locally as a pet, or traded to Japan.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

However, with captive breeding of exotic animals becoming more prevalent, fewer and fewer animals are being captured from the wild. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Health===

Veterinary costs for treatment of exotic animals may be significantly higher than for a more conventional pet, owing to the increased specialization required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/exotic-pet-faq.html#small|title =Exotic Pet FAQ|accessdate= 2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoonotic disease is known to occur in a small number of exotic pets. The American Veterinary Medical Association, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Animal Control Association, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association and the CDC all discourage the private ownership of certain exotic animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15919624/ Exotic animals bringing health risks with them]&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that are captive-bred in the United States have no risk of contracting any harmful disease as they are not exposed to it in any way.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the UK, where exotic pet ownership is high, voluntary organizations such as "SEEPR" (South East Exotic Pet Rescue) take in unwanted, ill, or lost exotic animals and nurse them back to full health before rehoming them.

===Husbandry===

Providing appropriate environmental conditions, housing and diet for an exotic animal may be difficult for several reasons:

* insufficient information may be available on caring for such animals in captivity, though this is rapidly changing.
* adequate housing may be difficult and/or expensive to procure or build. This is usually only a problem for large and/or highly active animals that need a large amount of space.
* it may be difficult to provide the correct environment (such as temperature or amount of sunlight)
* feeding the correct diet may be difficult or impossible
* providing the right social environment for highly social species may be impractical or impossible in a home setting. 
* licensing may be required for the owning or breeding of some exotic animals. Most US states and municipalities, for example, regulate exotic pet ownership.

However, captive care and husbandry information for many commonly kept amphibians, reptiles, birds, and small exotic mammals are widely available through literature, animal enthusiast groups, and Internet websites and discussion forums.

===Risk to humans===

Exotic animals retain their unpredictable wild nature, with some being physically capable of maiming or killing their owners. Mammals are the most likely exotic pets to injure or kill humans, with non-human primates topping the list. 

Even if they are bred for the pet trade and raised by humans, they may be unpredictable, relatively resistant to training; in some cases, especially as full-grown adults, they can be dangerous. Injuries to humans may be relatively common, but reported yearly deaths due to exotic pet ownership are rare. Statistics compiled by an advocacy organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rexano.org//AboutUs.htm Responsible Exotic Animal Ownership]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate a yearly average of less than 3.5 fatalities per year in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Numbers and Odds of an  Accidental Death in the  USA by Cause of Injury in  2005|url=http://www.rexano.org/Statistics/NumberOddsDeathLifeExotic.pdf|publisher=REXANO|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another lists 87 exotic animal incidents resulting in human death from Jun 20, 1990 to Apr 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exotic Animal Incidents  Category: Escape/Attack resulting in human death|url=http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incidents.php?&amp;exocat=HD&amp;page=1|publisher=Born Free, USA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Primates===
{{globalize|section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Animal market - caged Nycticebus 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three slow lorises curled up in a wire cage on a dirty street|Animal markets in impoverished, tropical countries often sell primates, such as these [[slow loris]]es, to both tourists and local people as pets, despite laws against the trade.]]
It has been estimated that as many as 15,000 [[non-human primates]] are kept by private individuals as pets in the United States.&lt;ref name=ng_petmonkey&gt;{{cite web|title=The Perils of Keeping Monkeys as Pets|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/pf/94367643.html|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine states ban the keeping of non-human primates, but no federal law regulates ownership. In 1975, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] prohibited their import into the US for use as pets. The breeding industry uses descendants of animals imported before 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol4no1/ostrowsk.htm|title=B-virus from Pet Macaque Monkeys: An Emerging Threat in the United States?|date=January–March 1998|accessdate= 2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human primates of various species, including those listed as [[endangered species|endangered]], such as [[cottontop tamarin]]s, [[baboon]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[Diana monkey]]s, [[lemur]]s and [[gibbon]]s are still available for purchase in the US, although due to captive breeding, this does not affect wild populations. For example, chimpanzees are popular in some areas despite their strength, aggression, and wild nature. Even in areas where keeping non-human primates as pets is illegal, the exotic pet trade continues to prosper and some people keep chimpanzees as pets mistakenly believing that they will bond with them for life. As they grow, so do their strength and aggression; some owners and others interacting with the animals have lost fingers and suffered severe facial damage among other injuries sustained in attacks.&lt;ref name="Chimpanzees Don't Make Good Pets"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chimpanzees Don't Make Good Pets |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp-central-pets |website=The Jane Goodall Institute |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202195221/http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp-central-pets |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many professionals, including veterinarians, zoologists, humane societies and others, strongly discourage the keeping of primates as pets, as their complex emotional and social needs and other highly specialized requirements may be difficult to meet by the average owner.&lt;ref name="Chimpanzees Don't Make Good Pets"/&gt;&lt;ref name=about_petmonkey&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem with Pet Monkeys&amp;nbsp;– Keeping Monkeys as Pets|url=http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/primates/a/primatesaspets.htm|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the breeding population has been largely isolated from wild populations outside the US, they still have the potential to transmit [[Zoonosis|zoonotic disease]]. There is a considerable risk of [[monkey B virus]] from [[rhesus macaques]]. Research workers have died from this disease contracted from non-human primate research subjects.&lt;ref name=cdc_bvirus&gt;{{cite web|title=B Virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1) Infection CDC NCID|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/bvirus.htm|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is considerable risk to the non-human primate pet through transmission of human disease. One such example is [[herpes simplex virus]], which can be deadly to certain smaller monkeys.&lt;ref name=ng_petmonkey /&gt;

'''FADO''' (which stands for "False and Authentic Documents Online") is a European image-archiving system that was set up to help combat illegal immigration and organised crime. It was established by a Joint Action of the [[Council of the European Union]] enacted in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA of 3 December 1998 adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the setting up of a European Image-Archiving System (FADO) ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:333:0004:0007:EN:PDF OJ L 33, 9 December 1998, p4]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The proliferation of genuine and false documents means that frequent updating is essential. Ever more sophisticated techniques are being used to produce both genuine documents and forgeries. A computerised system with restricted access has therefore been built that enables fast and secure information exchange between the [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union]] and between document experts in the [[European Union member state]]s, [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]].

==Database contents==
The database established by the FADO Joint Acts includes the following data:

* images of genuine documents,
* information on security techniques (security features),
* images of typical false and forged documents,
* information on forgery techniques, and
* statistics on detected false and falsified documents and identity fraud.

FADO is currently available to document experts in 31 FADO partner states: in all member states of the [[European Union]] (EU) and in [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and in [[Switzerland]].

Part of the information shared by document experts in the classified, restricted system, FADO, is made publicly available, via the [[Public Register of Travel and Identity Documents Online|Public Register of Authentic Documents Online]] (PRADO) website which is managed by the [[Council of the European Union]].

Document descriptions in FADO are available in all 24 official [[languages of the European Union]]. Documents are introduced by document experts in any of the languages and the standardised descriptions are translated automatically; thus, documents are immediately available in all supported languages. Additional free text information contained is translated later on by specialised linguists of the General Secretariat of the Council.

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2955/contents/made The Family Procedure Rules 2010] were introduced by [[Statutory Instrument]] and are effective 6 April 2011.

Part 7 (Paragraph 75) of the [[Courts Act 2003]] [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2003/20030039.htm]  states that "Family Procedure Rules are to be made by a committee known as the Family Procedure Rule Committee", and specifies who should be on that committee. The Courts Act also states, "Family Procedure Rules may modify the rules of evidence as they apply to family proceedings in any court within the scope of the rules".

The Family Procedure Rules 2010 are split into 36 parts, together with the Practice Directions, certain Pre Action Protocols and a complete set of Forms. They are intended to modernise and standardise family court practice across the High Court, County Court and Magistrates’ Court.

Title IX of the United States [[Education Amendments of 1972]]&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits discrimination "on the basis of sex" in educational programs and activities that receive financial assistance from the federal government.  The [[Obama administration]] interpreted Title IX it to cover discrimination on the basis of [[assigned sex]], [[gender identity]], and [[transgender]] status. The [[Trump administration]] determined that the question of access to sex-segregated facilities should be left to the states and local school districts to decide.&lt;ref name="guardian-23feb2017"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Smith|author2=Molly Redden|title=Trump administration rescinds Obama-era protections for transgender students|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|accessdate=February 23, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of the executive's position is being tested in the federal courts.

==Background==
Congress kept the core provision of Title IX very brief, only one sentence long.  The interpretation and implementation of Title IX was left to the executive, whom Congress expressly "authorized and directed to effectuate the [statute] by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of [its] objectives ..."&lt;ref&gt;20 U.S.C. 1682&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] initially directed the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) to carry this out.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh. ''A Place on the Team.'' Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1980, HEW was split into two separate agencies —the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education (DOE)]].&lt;ref name="cases"&gt;[http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html "Landmark Title&amp;nbsp;IX Cases in History"] Gender Equity in Sport. February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary responsibility for Title&amp;nbsp;IX enforcement in educational institutions was delegated to DOE's [[Office for Civil Rights|Office for Civil Rights (OCR)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/dels.html|title=US Department of Education Principal Office Functional Statements: Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The views of the Obama administration==

The Obama administration's efforts to apply Title IX to protect LGBT students go back to President Obama's first term in office.&lt;ref name=resources&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/lgbt.html Resources for Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Students]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an October 2010 "Dear Colleague" letter, OCR issued guidance on clarifying that Title IX protects LGBT students from harassment on the basis of sex stereotypes.&lt;ref name=2010DCL&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, Office for Civil Rights, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf "Dear Colleague" Letter], October 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, OCR stated that, although Title IX does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, "[t]he fact that the harassment [of a hypothetical gender non-conforming student] includes anti‐LGBT comments or is partly based on the target's actual or perceived sexual orientation does not relieve a school of its obligation under Title IX to investigate and remedy overlapping sexual harassment or gender‐based harassment."&lt;ref name=2010DCL/&gt;  In a 2014 Q&amp;A document, OCR wrote unequivocally that "Title IX's sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity and OCR accepts such complaints for investigation."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, Office for Civil Rights, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence], April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously with evolving subregulatory guidance, OCR started conducting enforcement actions under Title IX against school districts where discrimination against transgender students was alleged to have taken place.  For example, in 2013, OCR reached a settlement with the [[Arcadia Unified School District|Arcadia (Calif.) Unified School District]], stemming from the complaint by a transgender boy, who was denied the use of boys' restrooms and locker rooms and was required to sleep alone in a separate cabin on an overnight school trip.&lt;ref name=Geidner&gt;Chris Geidner, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-officials-protect-transgender-student-against-discri Federal Officials Protect Transgender Student Against Discrimination], BuzzFeed, July 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, Office for Civil Rights, [https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2013/07/26/arcadialetter.pdf Letter to Dr. Joel Shawn, Superintendent of the Arcadia Unified School District], July 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaching the conclusion that Title IX applied to the facts of the Arcadia case, OCR took the position discriminating against a transgender student can be a form of sex discrimination, and that the scope of Title IX should be analyzed in light of parallel precedent under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which prohibits discrimination on the basis of "sex" in an employment context. Title VII has also been interpreted to encompass discrimination based on sex stereotypes, gender identity, and transgender status by the [[EEOC]] and many federal courts.&lt;ref name=Geidner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-reaches-agreement-arcadia-california-school-district-resolve-sex-discrimination United States Reaches Agreement with Arcadia, California, School District to Resolve Sex Discrimination Allegations] (press release), July 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eeocfaq&gt;EEOC, [https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/enforcement_protections_lgbt_workers.cfm What You Should Know About EEOC and the Enforcement Protections for LGBT Workers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Dear Colleague letter===

On May 13, 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and DOE issued joint guidance to educational institutions on the scope of Title IX, in the form of a Dear Colleague letter and an accompanying compendium of actual policies and practices, which had previously been enacted by state agencies and school districts throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name=NYT20160512&gt;Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Matt Apuzzo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/obama-administration-to-issue-decree-on-transgender-access-to-school-restrooms.html U.S. Directs Public Schools to Allow Transgender Access to Restrooms], The New York Times, May 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DearColleague16&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, Office for Civil Rights / U.S. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students], May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=compendium&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students], May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidance formalized the administration's previously stated view that Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and clarified that transgender students should therefore be treated consistent with their gender identity at school.&lt;ref name=MayRelease&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-departments-education-and-justice-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights-transgender-students U.S. Departments of Education and Justice Release Joint Guidance to Help Schools Ensure the Civil Rights of Transgender Students], Press Release, May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In practical terms, the administration instructed schools that Title IX's prohibition on discrimination means that schools generally must:
*provide an environment free of sex-based harassment, 
*honor transgender students' preferred names and pronouns, 
*permit all students to participate in sex-segregated activities and use sex-segregated facilities (including bathrooms, locker rooms, and overnight accommodations) in accordance with their gender identity, and 
*protect transgender students' privacy by avoiding [[outing|non-consensual disclosure]] of their gender status.&lt;ref name=NYT20160512/&gt;&lt;ref name=DearColleague16/&gt;  
The guidance permitted a limited exception for athletics, where accommodating transgender students would impair "the competitive fairness or physical safety of the sport."&lt;ref name=DearColleague16/&gt;

Reactions to the Dear Colleague letter were sharply polarized.  Head of the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|DOJ Civil Rights Division]] [[Vanita Gupta]] expressed hope that the guidance would give transgender students "a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow."&lt;ref name=MayRelease/&gt;  First Lady of New York City [[Chirlane McCray]] spoke approvingly of the guidance, saying that it "reaffirms a basic human right."&lt;ref name=solace&gt;Jack Healy and Richard Pérez-Peña, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/transgender-bathrooms.html Solace and Fury as Schools React to Transgender Policy], The New York Times, May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chad Griffin]] of the [[Human Rights Campaign]] said that the guidance "sen[t] a message that every student deserves to be treated fairly and supported by their teachers and schools."&lt;ref name=solace/&gt;

Conservative politicians voiced opposition to the letter.  Texas Lt. Governor [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] urged school officials to disregard the administration's Title IX guidance, which he considered "blackmail."&lt;ref name=reactions&gt;Christine Hauser, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/transgender-students-and-new-rules-in-public-schools.html Transgender Directives for Schools Draw Reaction From Across the Country], The New York Times, May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] called on the federal government to take no position on discrimination against transgender students, which in his view should be an issue for the states.&lt;ref name=reactions/&gt; Rep. [[Brian Babin]] [R-TX] introduced HR 5294 to invalidate the "Dear Colleague" letter until superseded by an [[Act of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|114|H.R.|5294|pipe=Text of the Student Privacy Protection and Safety Act of 2016 |site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 (HR 5812), and again in 2017 (HR 2796) after the prior bill had died in committee, Rep. [[Pete Olson]] [R-TX] introduced federal [[Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2017|legislation which would limit gender identity to biological assignation]], which would remove the ability to apply federal civil rights protections to transgender individuals. Olson stated the legislation was in reaction to "the Obama Administration strongly [overreaching] by unilaterally redefining the definition of "sex" with respect to the Civil Rights Act outside of the lawmaking process." Olson went on to call on Congress to "reject the notion of false power stolen from Congress by a White House seeking to impose social policy on America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://olson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-members-act-to-restore-congressional-authority-on-transgender |title=House Members Act to Restore Congressional Authority on Transgender Definition |author= |date=7 June 2017 |publisher=Office of Congressman Pete Olson, Representing the 22nd District of Texas |accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The views of the Trump administration==

In February 2017, the Department of Justice and Department of Education under the Trump administration withdrew the guidance on gender identity issued by the Obama administration.&lt;ref name="guardian-23feb2017" /&gt; A letter issued by the departments cited a need to "more completely consider the legal issues involved", and stated that "there must be due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing education policy".&lt;ref name="guardian-23feb2017" /&gt;

In June 2017, Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Candice Jackson issued instructions to directors of DOE's regional civil rights offices, providing that, although the Obama-era guidance had been rescinded, they may investigate and resolve certain kinds of allegations of sex discrimination involving transgender students, such as "failure to promptly and equitably resolve a transgender student's complaint of sex discrimination; ... failure to assess whether sexual harassment (i.e., unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature) or gender-based harassment (i.e., based on sex stereotyping, such as acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, such as refusing to use a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns when the school uses preferred
names for gender-conforming students or when the refusal is motivated by animus toward people who do not conform to sex stereotypes) of a transgender student created a hostile environment; ... failure to take steps reasonably calculated to address sexual or gender-based harassment that creates a hostile environment; ... retaliation against a transgender student after concerns about possible sex discrimination were brought to the recipient's attention; ... and different treatment based on sex stereotyping (e.g., based on a student's failure to conform to stereotyped notions of masculinity or femininity)." &lt;ref name="june2017memo"&gt;Holden, Dominic, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student-bathrooms The Education Department Officially Says It Will Reject Transgender Student Bathroom Complaints] Buzzfeed, Feb. 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, a DOE spokesperson clarified that "Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity ... Where students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX ... In the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX."&lt;ref name="june2017memo" /&gt;

In October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person's sex as assigned at birth and could not be changed, effectively eliminating recognition of transgendered students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender "on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?module=inline | title =‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration | first1 = Erica | last1= Green | first2=  Katie | last2=  Benner | first3 =  Robert | last3 = Pear | date = October 21, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the "#WontBeErased" hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html | title = #WontBeErased: Transgender People and Allies Mobilize Against Trump Administration Proposal | first = Sarah | last = Mervosh | date = October 22, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before being vacated by the Supreme Court, the ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals had controlling status in federal courts located in the states served by the Fourth Circuit – Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina – and was expected to influence the litigation over North Carolina's anti-LGBT law, the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Turner, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilona-turner/why-the-gavin-grimm-decis_b_9733828.html Why the Gavin Grimm Decision Is Game-Changing for the Fight Against Anti-Trans Legislation], Huffington Post, April 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Circuit ruling would have served as controlling precedent in the North Carolina litigation with respect to Title IX only – and not with respect to [[Title VII]] claims (discrimination in the employment context).&lt;ref name=casuga&gt;Jay-Anne Casuga, [http://www.bna.com/north-carolina-bathroom-n57982072924/ North Carolina Bathroom Battle May Turn on Deference to Agency], Daily Labor Report, Bloomberg BNA, May 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The two statutes are closely linked, however: according to [[Duke University School of Law]] professor [[Katharine T.

===Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District===

In July 2016, Ash Whitaker, a transgender boy, filed suit against the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin because the district denied him access to the boys' restrooms in violation of [[Title IX]] and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. In September 2016, a federal district court decided that the school district must let him use the boys' restroom. The school district appealed, and a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled in the student's favor, finding that "a policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender non‐conformance, which in turn violates Title IX."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/17-301-opinion-below.pdf Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education v.

On March 23, 2016, North Carolina enacted the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act.  Among the provisions of the Act is a requirement on North Carolina schools to prohibit transgender students from using bathroom and changing facilities corresponding to their gender identity.

'''[[Green building]]''' in '''[[Mexico]]'''

The [[Mexico|Mexican]] town of [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[Baja California]], is home to the largest solar-powered community in North America (3000+ home sites), with completely [[off-the-grid]] neighborhoods within El Dorado Ranch, a {{convert|30000|acre|km2|sing=on}} development in San Felipe.

Because of the [[arid]] climate in this [[Gulf of California]] town, a number of green building initiatives have been implemented including:

*[[Straw-bale construction|Straw-Bale Home Construction]], enabling [[building insulation|insulation]] factors of R-35 to R-50, as verified by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, 1995.
*Predominant use of [[xeriscaping]] - landscaping practices that reduces [[water conservation|water consumption]], energy consumption and toxic chemical usage.
*Golf Course construction utilizing SeaDwarf Grass, one of the most [[halophyte|salt tolerant grasses]] with the ability to withstand ongoing irrigation having [[salinity]] levels in excess of 20 parts per thousand total dissolved solids ([[Total dissolved solids|TDS]]) (equivalent to 55% of marine salinity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">In [[England|English]] law, '''heirs of the body''' is the principle that certain types of [[property]] pass to a descendant of the original holder, recipient or [[grantee]] according to a fixed order of [[kinship]]. Upon the death of the grantee, a designated [[inheritance]] such as a parcel of land, a [[peerage]], or a [[monarchy]], passes automatically to that living, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]], natural descendant of the grantee who is most senior in descent according to [[primogeniture]], males being preferred, however, over their sisters regardless of relative age; and thereafter the property continues to pass to subsequent descendants of the grantee, according to the same formula, upon the death of each subsequent heir. 

[[Baron]]ies created by [[Hereditary_peer#Writs_of_summons|writ of summons]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] usually descend to heirs of the body of the grantee, and may thus be inherited by females. By the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the Crown of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] descends to heirs of the body of the [[Electress Sophia of Hanover]] who are not [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] or married to Catholics, subject to subsequent modification by Parliament (e.g. [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]] and the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]]).

In [[property law]], a [[conveyancing|conveyance]] by the owner O "To A and heirs of the body", without more, creates a [[fee tail]] for the grantee (A) with a [[reversion (law)|reversion]] in the grantor (O) should the natural, lawful descendants of the grantee all die out. Each person who inherits according to this formula is considered an heir at law of the grantee. Since the inheritance may not pass to someone who is not a natural, lawful descendant of the grantee, the heir is necessarily also "of the body" of the grantee. Collateral [[Kinship|kin]], who share some or all of the grantee's ancestry, but do not directly descend from the grantee, may not inherit. When there are no more heirs of the body, the terms of the original grant are expired, and the property becomes extinct (e.g. peerage), or some other criterion for allocating the property to a new possessor must be applied. If the original grant stipulated an alternative formula for succession upon exhaustion of heirs, that formula is immediately applicable. Thus, if a peerage is granted to "heirs of the body of John Smith, failing which, to heirs general", the title would pass to a descendant of John Smith's sibling when all of John Smith's descendants die out.

Thus property settled upon someone and the heirs of their body—whether male, female, or generally—will pass to children, grandchildren and so on, but not to nephews of the grantee, his or her sisters, uncles and their descendants. Nor will a limitation in a grant to someone's "heirs" carry the property to collateral heirs in England, since the law presumes that "heirs of the body" are meant though a grant to the grantee and his [[heirs male]] will.

There are other kinds of formulae for inheritance than heirs of the body, such as heirs male, [[heirs of the line]], [[co-parceners|heirs portioners]], heirs general, etc.

Other chartered corporations, still in existence include the [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] (est 1670) and the [[Bank of England]] (est 1694).]]

The '''history of company law in the United Kingdom''' concerns the change and development in [[UK company law]] within the context of the [[history of companies]], deriving from its predecessors in Roman and English law. Company law in its current form dates from the mid-nineteenth century, however other forms of business association developed long before.

==Medieval business==
{{Main|Guilds|Livery companies|Lex mercatoria}}
In medieval times traders would typically act through private law constructs, such as partnerships. These arose at [[common law]] whenever people acted together with a view to profit. Early [[guilds]] and [[livery companies]] were also often involved in the regulation of trade among themselves.

*[[List of organisations with a British royal charter]]

==Mercantile corporations==
{{Main|Chartered company}}
As England sought to build a [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] [[British Empire|Empire]], the government created corporations under a [[Royal Charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament]] with the grant of a monopoly over a specified territory. The best known example, established in 1600, was the [[British East India Company]]. [[Queen Elizabeth I]] granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Corporations at this time would essentially act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became [[Company rule in India|increasingly integrated]] with British military and colonial policy, just as most UK corporations were essentially dependent on the British navy's ability to control trade routes.

==South Sea Bubble==
{{Main|South Sea Company}}
A similar [[chartered company]], the [[South Sea Company]], was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were backed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed in 1713 as a settlement following the [[War of Spanish Succession]], which gave the United Kingdom an ''[[assiento]]'' to supply slaves and engage in limited trade in other goods in the region for a period of thirty years. The trading started slowly and was in any case limited in extent by the terms of the assiento,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc The South Sea Company’s slaving activities] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209151433/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc |date=9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was hoped that it would lead to breaking into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. Investors in the UK, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from the [[company promoters]], bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy  that it assumed the [[public debt]] of the UK government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the [[Bubble Act 1720]], which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first [[speculative bubble]] the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had "burst", and the share price sank from £1000 to under £100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations, and errant directors, was bitter.

==Prohibition==
The [[Bubble Act 1720]]'s prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until 1824.

Even in 1776, [[Adam Smith]] wrote in [[The Wealth of Nations|''The'' ''Wealth of Nations'']] that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book V, ch 1, part III&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it,

{{Cquote|The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company. It is upon this account, that joint-stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competition against private adventurers.}}

==Development of modern company law==
{{Main|Joint Stock Companies Act 1856}}
[[File:Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Lowe]], then Vice President of the [[Board of Trade]] has been dubbed the "father of modern company law" for his role in drafting the 1855 reforms.]]
By the 1820s the [[Industrial Revolution]] had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity. Restrictions were gradually lifted on ordinary people incorporating until, under the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], it was possible through a simple registration procedure to incorporate. The advantage of establishing a company as a [[separate legal person]] was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled. The most important development, was the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], which allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company. These two features – a simple registration procedure and limited liability – were subsequently codified in the first modern company law Act, the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]]. A series of [[Companies Acts]] up to the present [[Companies Act 2006]] have essentially retained the same fundamental features.

==Twentieth century==
{{See also|Institutional investors|Bullock Report|European Union|UK Corporate Governance Code}}
Over the twentieth century, companies in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the [[Companies Act 1948]], ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority [[vote]].

In 1977, the government's [[Bullock Report]] proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening in across Europe, exemplified by the German [[Codetermination Act 1976]]. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted.

Through the 1990s the focus in [[corporate governance]] turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees to place some check on excessive [[executive pay]]. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], have been complemented principles based regulation of [[institutional investors]] activity in company affairs.

The UK's integration in the [[European Union]] meant a steadily growing body of EU Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Centros Ltd v Erhvervs-og Selskabsstryrelsen]]'' [1999] 2 CMLR 551 (C-212/97) and ''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd]]'' [2003] ECR I-10155 (C-167/01)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Brazil}}
During its independent political history, [[Brazil]] has had seven constitutions. The most recent was ratified on October 5, 1988.

== Imperial Constitution (1824) ==

=== Background ===
Prior to its independence, on September 7, 1822, Brazil had no formal Constitution, since [[Portugal]] only adopted its first Constitution on September 23, 1822, 16 days after Brazilian proclaimed independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arqnet.pt/portal/portugal/liberalismo/const822.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1823, the Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] started the political process of writing a Constitution.

The elaboration of the first Constitution of Brazil was quite difficult and the power struggle involved resulted in a long-lasting unrest that plagued the country for nearly two decades. Two major facts increased the troubles:
* Large numbers of recent immigrants from Portugal (the so-called "Portuguese Party"), who wanted to keep their privileges or who were still loyal to the metropolitan government. These were found both among the wealthier parts of the population, as businessmen controlling Brazil's international trade, and the lower ones, as tradesmen and free urban workers (the Brazilian [[elite]] was mostly rural).
* The majority of the population was composed of [[Slavery in Brazil|slave]]s, prompting the whites to fear being massacred in the event of a rebellion caused by a failing state.

The first circumstance meant that despite strong support of the Crown Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] by the Brazilian landowners (the so-called "Brazilian Party"), the opinions of the ''reinóis'' (name then given to people fresh from Portugal) should be considered. As each side had very distinct and different objectives none could prevail and a compromise was needed.

There were extra problems involved: the Constitutional Assembly had been elected to decide the applicability of Portuguese laws in Brazil, not to draft a new constitution. As a result, some of the Portuguese deputies refused to take part in it. On the other hand, some of the Brazilian deputies, the "liberal" ones, had been persecuted, some exiled others imprisoned. Thus the Constitutional Assembly did not hear an appreciable number of opinions and would end reflecting the objectives of the "Brazilian Party", to the detriment of the "Portuguese Party" and the liberals.

As the draft constitution progressed it became clear that the deputies were trying to establish a constitution that would:
* curtail the powers of the monarch,
* restrict most political rights to landowners and deny them to the Portuguese, and
* establish an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], but [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]], [[monarchy]], whose head of government would be the Emperor himself, aided by a group of ministers of his choice.

[[File:Joao Gomes da Silveira Mendonça.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[João Gomes da Silveira Mendonça|Marquis of Sabará]] was among the noblemen charged with drafting Brazil's first Constitution.]]
The emperor did not want to be removed out all powers and serve as a mere decorative [[figurehead]], but rather to protect the interests of the Portuguese businessmen (who were the main economic base of Brazil) and prevent any further of his power to the [[Parliament]]. 

In a quite predictable move, and in the light of the wave of conservatism led by the [[Holy Alliance]], the Emperor used his influence over the [[Brazilian Army]] to dissolve the Constitutional Assembly, in what became known as the [[Night of Agony]], and imposed on the country a constitution that concentrated the executive power on the Emperor himself (eventually crowned "Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil").

The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as "delegations of the nation" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.

The Constitution of 1824 was rather less [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] than the draft prepared by the Constituent Assembly. In fact, it was for all purposes a peculiar and unique regime: a "presidential" monarchy. That did not mean, by any means, that the Brazilian monarch had prerogatives resembling those of a [[tyrant]] or [[dictator]]. The individual guarantees that guarantee human liberty and dignity were inserted into the articles of the Charter and were respected. The Emperor would not act in areas reserved to the legislative branch and the judiciary, such as to create laws or to judge and sentence. 

Based on the French constitution of 1792 and the Spanish constitution of 1812, the Imperial constitution was considered one of the most liberal of the times, in front of many European liberal powers.

=== The Constitution ===
[[File:PeterI-de Sa.jpg|thumb|upright|Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil.]]
The new constitution, published on March 25, 1824 outlined the existence of '''four''' powers:
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]] — The State Council
* [[Legislative]] — The General Assembly, formed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies
* [[Judiciary]] — The Courts
* ''Moderator'' — Vested in the Emperor, was supposed to resolve any incompatibilities between the other three, acting as a "neutral" power, in accordance to the theories of the Swiss thinker [[Benjamin Constant]].

The Emperor controlled the Executive by nominating the members of the State Council, influenced the Legislative by being allowed to propose motions and having the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies (senators sat for life, being, however, individually chosen by the emperor among the three most voted candidates in a given province) and also influenced the Judiciary, by appointing (for life) the members of the Highest Court.

This constitution established the [[Brazilian Empire]] as a Unitary state (the [[province]]s had little autonomy, if any). The Amendment (''Ato Adicional'') of August 12, 1834, enacted in a period of liberal reform, authorized the provinces to create their own legislative chambers, which were empowered to legislate on financial matters, create taxes and their own corps of civil servants under a chief executive nominated by the central power;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/o-ato-adicional-1834.htm|title=O ato adicional de 1834|last=Sousa|first=Rainer|publisher=brasilescola.com|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was however revised by an "interpretive" act of May 1840, enacted in a period of conservative reaction, which allowed the central power to appoint judges and police officers in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unificado.com.br/novo/didatico/142_file_arquivo.pdf|title=syllabus of Brazilian History|last=Grinschpun|first=Iair|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1847, a Decree (number 523) established the post of [[Prime Minister of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers]] (not to be confused with the State Council, whose ten members sat for life and which in the late Empire functioned solely as an advising body to the Emperor) – actually a [[prime minister]] chosen by the emperor, who should choose the members of the cabinet, being supported by a parliamentary majority in the General Assembly. As no act of the Executive was valid without the signature of the minister ("State Secretary") responsible for the issue concerned, the decree turned the Brazilian Empire into a standard [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]].

The franchise was very limited, being censitary and indirect: no male citizen who was not head of a household  and/or had a net yearly income of less than a hundred [[milréis]] was allowed to vote in the primary elections that chose actual electors, empowered with the right to vote for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;On the requisites to the franchise on various levels, see Chapter VI of the Constitution, according to the text available at [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constitui%C3%A7ao24.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This conservative slant – together with widespread electoral frauds – determined that no Prime Minister chosen by the Emperor – who had the power to order the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and new elections to it – ever failed to win a parliamentary majority in subsequent elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locus.ufjf.br/c.php?c=baixar_artigo&amp;arq=ODI%3D|title=O Conselho de Ministros no Império do Brasil|last=Barbosa|first=Silvana Mota|date=May 2007|work=Revista de História, v 13, no 1|pages=52–62|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 22, 2010}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buscalegis.ufsc.br/revistas/index.php/buscalegis/article/view/28163/27721|title=Evolução Histórico-Sociológica dos Partidos Políticos no Brasil Imperial|last=Soares|first=Carlos Dalmiro da Silva|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of 1824, enacted in the name of the [[Holy Trinity]], also instituted [[Catholicism]] as the [[state religion]], allowing other religions to be practiced only in private: non-Catholic places of worship could not be fashioned to appear as religious buildings from the outside. It also excluded [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]] from Brazilian citizenship, by extending it to all people born in the Brazilian territory, if freeborn or freed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constitui%C3%A7ao24.htm Cf. arts. 5 and 6 of the Constitution of 1824, available at]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Old Republic Constitution (1891) ==

=== Background ===
On November 15, 1889, the emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was deposed, Brazilian monarchy abolished and the 1824 Constitution was put out of effect. No [[provisional constitution]] was used while a definitive successor document was being written. The writing process began in 1889, by a group of [[jurist]]s and [[politician]]s, and the text was later amended by a Constitutional Congress on February 24, 1891.

=== The Constitution ===
[[File:Rui Barbosa2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rui Barbosa]] had a large influence upon the text adopted as the 1891 Constitution of Brazil.]]
In its final form, the new Constitution meant to create a lay federal state to promote, above all, individual liberties, following the basic principles of the [[Constitution of the United States]], albeit with the adoption of a slightly different (and somewhat more centralized) form of [[federalism]].

The main traits of the constitution were:
* Federalism: the provinces were turned into states whose indissoluble union was taken as forming the Body Politic of the Brazilian Federation. Governors (at the time called State Presidents) were to be elected by direct vote and a fixed term of office.
* Separation of the State and Churches.
* Male universal suffrage (with exceptions, mostly [[Literacy|illiterates]], [[Begging|beggars]] and members of [[monastic order]]s) and basic individual rights for all citizens. Abolition of the [[death penalty]].
* Adoption of standard three-way [[separation of powers]] under a [[presidential republic]] on the American model; direct elections for all members of the Legislative and chief officers of the Executive branch. The Executive branch was headed by a President of the Republic, elected by direct voting (in preference to an [[Electoral college]] on the American model) – who had a four-year term and could not be reelected for a second, successive, term – and his freely chosen cabinet of ministers. The Senate was reorganized as the Upper House of the Legislative branch, formed of representatives of the states (as opposed to the representatives of the people in the Chamber of Deputies) directly elected and with fixed terms of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao91.htm |title=Full text of the Constitution available at |access-date=January 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804130509/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao91.htm |archive-date=August 4, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third Constitution (1934) ==

=== Background ===
{{See also|Vargas Era}}
In 1930, after severe political problems, President [[Washington Luís]] was overthrown by a ''[[coup d'état]]''. The 1891 Constitution was annulled and the Provisional President [[Getúlio Vargas]] ruled as a ''[[de facto]]'' personal [[dictator]], but the state landed elites (who had controlled the Brazilian state ever since independence) struggled to prevent this from continuing. In 1932, in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] demanded a Constitution. As a result, a Constitutional Assembly was elected and the constitution was promulgated on July 16, 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao34.htm |title=Portuguese text available at |access-date=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329073529/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao34.htm |archive-date=March 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; four years after the ''coup d'état'' had overthrown the Old Republic. Vargas accepted this constitution in order to legitimate his power.

=== The Constitution ===
This constitution was the shortest-lived Constitution of Brazil, lasting only three years (until 1937).

Despite its short life, this constitution was important because it was the first time a Brazilian constitution was written from scratch by directly elected deputies in multi-party elections. As a consequence of this, it incorporated a number of improvements to Brazilian political, social and economical life:
* Granted complete independence to the Supreme Court and subordinated all other courts to it.
* Extended political rights to all adults, regardless of sex.
* Introduced [[proportional voting]] for elections to the Chamber of Deputies, which included representatives of the people as well as a minority of representatives from trade unions and other professional organizations – a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] device introduced under the shock of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the influence of Italian [[fascism]].
* Created a specific [[electoral court]] to supervise elections, under the control of the Supreme Court (previously the supervision of elections was under control of the Legislative Branch).
* Following a trend set by the German [[Weimar Constitution]], acknowledged a whole host of [[social rights]] alongside political and civil ones: the national [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour workday]], mandatory weekly rest, paid vacations and indemnity for unmotivated firing.
* Created a [[labor court]] to supervise working conditions and codified rights and duties for both the employers and the employees.
* Was the first Brazilian constitution to list all four basic freedoms ([[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of movement|movement]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]]) alongside the basic rights ([[right to life|life]], [[right to freedom|freedom]] and [[right to property|property]]).

== "Estado Novo" Constitution (1937) ==

=== Background ===
[[File:Getulio.gif|thumb|upright|The adoption of the 1937 Constitution marked the beginning of [[Getúlio Vargas]]' dictatorship.]]
{{See also|Estado Novo (Brazil)}}
On the night of November 10, 1937, Vargas announced in a nationwide radio address that he was seizing emergency powers under the pretext of suppressing a [[Communism|Communist]]-backed coup (the so-called ''Plano Cohen'')  On the same night, he promulgated a new constitution that effectively transformed his presidency into a legal dictatorship (the short interval suggesting that the [[self-coup]] had been planned well in advance). It was written by the minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, and proofread by Vargas and his minister of War (joint-commander of the Army and Air Force), [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]].

=== The Constitution ===
The new document was called the "''Polaca''", or [[Poland|Polish]], Constitution because it was inspired by the Polish [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]] of 1935. It was intended to consolidate the powers of the president, while substantially limiting the powers and autonomy of Congress and the judiciary.  While clearly dictatorial, it was not intended to be completely totalitarian and repressive. It kept most social improvements of the previous constitution, and added more: The [[right to education]], the [[right to culture]] preservation and guidelines for [[family rights]], building on the [[Civil Code]] of 1917.

On the other side, however, it heavily concentrated executive power:
* Political parties were dissolved.
* State "presidents" (elected) would be replaced by interventionists (appointed by the president of the republic).
* Mayors would in their turn be appointed by the interventionists.
* [[Capital punishment]] was to be enforced on "[[treason|traitor]]s to the state" (a fairly broad category).
* All requirements for an outright dictatorship ([[censorship]], [[purge]]s, [[militarism]], state [[propaganda]], [[cult of personality]] and others) were either required, allowed or not forbidden by the constitution.

== Fifth Constitution (1946) ==
[[File:Gustavo Capanema 1932.jpg|thumb|[[Gustavo Capanema]] was a member of the 1946 Constitutional Congress.]]

=== Background ===
When Vargas was forced to resign in 1945, a new constitution was written, once again by a directly elected Constitutional Congress.

=== The Constitution ===
This was the first Brazilian constitution to provide full political freedom (even the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] was made legal, though briefly) and the last to officially name the country ''Estados Unidos do Brazil'' (and the spelling of the country's name would change later that year). It was also the first with an additional "Act of Transitory Measures" (a set of laws that came into effect ''before'' the constitution itself and could not be changed).
The key points of this constitution were:
* Restore all rights and freedoms as expressed by the 1934 Constitution which had been suppressed in 1937.
* Reducing the powers of the presidency; while it remained the key institution, safeguards were put in place to prevent another president from abusing his power as Vargas had done.
* Establish full equality before the law.
* Created mechanisms to prevent and fight religious prejudice and censorship (the latter with some exceptions regarding ''moral censorship'' of spectacles and public shows).
* Mentioned the right to postal privacy and the inviolability of homes (until then police could break into anyone's house without a permit).
* Improved [[federalism]] by extending the powers of the member [[States of Brazil|states]] (for instance, it was the first time states were allowed to have [[flag]]s and [[anthem]]s).
* Although it was not the first time all adults were granted full political rights, it was under this constitution that the first free (and quite fair) elections were held at all levels and for all offices.
* Elections for executive offices would be held in a single turn.
* Voters could freely choose candidates of whatever party, including for [[vice president]] and [[vice governor]].

The last two would become the major problems of this constitution, as they were prone to produce and fuel both [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] crises (as the presidents were usually elected by less than the majority of the votes) and conspiracies (as the vice-president was usually from another party).

== {{anchor|sixth}} Sixth Constitution (1967) ==

=== Background ===
[[File:Castelobranco.jpg|thumb|upright|President of Brazil [[Field Marshal|FM]] Castelo Branco.]]
After the military [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|''coup d'état'' of April 1, 1964]] the controllers of the new regime kept the 1946 constitution and promised to restore democracy as soon as possible. However, they eventually did not and were faced with a dilemma, as every major measure they took was strictly against that current constitution, including the coup itself.

The so-called [[Institutional Acts]] sequentially issued by the military presidents were, in practice, placed higher than the Constitution and could amend it.  Even under these circumstances, the first military president, [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco]], was committed to restoring civilian rule in 1966.  However, a large number of military and civilian extremists felt the military had to stay in power for some years.  They also wanted to pass more "proper" laws to fight ''subversive individuals'' (anyone that opposed the regime).

By 1965, however, the situation reached an unbearable point when opposition candidates won the governorship of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]].  Castelo Branco refused to annul the results.  A coup was only averted when Castelo Branco agreed to support the military's reform program.  By this time, the military had decided to drop all pretense of democracy.  It also felt the 1946 constitution was "obsolete" as the "new institutions" were not foreseen in it.

A new constitution was written by a team of lawyers commissioned by Castelo Branco and amended (under the instructions of Castelo Branco himself) by the minister of Justice, [[Carlos Medeiros Silva]] and voted as whole by the [[National Congress of Brazil|Brazilian Parliament]] (already purged of most opponents of the [[status quo]]).

=== The Original Constitution ===
The main features of the new Constitution were:
* Restriction of political rights: direct elections would only be held at state and county level, but not in federal territories or cities considered as of interest of national security for whatever reason (such cities were specified as those lying by the international border, state capitals, "important" industrial centers, university towns, jungle towns, towns close to power plants, mining sites, etc.). About 500 cities/towns were listed--in practice, the largest and most important ones. Presidents and governors were chosen in indirect elections by the correspondent Legislative branch (the National Congress and State Legislatures).  However, these "elections" were elaborate shams. In practice, the president was selected by the military command, while governors were hand-picked by the president and his advisers.  The federal and state legislatures were dominated by government supporters, meaning the government candidate could not possibly be defeated.
* Restriction of civil rights: any meeting, assembly or gathering of people should be formal, must be previously authorized and conducted under supervision. Unauthorized meetings would be disbanded by the police and participants sued (if lucky; they were more likely imprisoned, tortured or worse).
* Military (uniformed) State Police Corps acknowledged as reserve corps of the Federal Army (as well as State Fire Brigades), with the task of  outdoor patrolling to "provide public security", thereby reducing the autonomy of the existing civilian (plainclothes) police, reduced to an investigative role.
* Removal of all privileges of judges, allowing the president to force them to retire or to remove them (the latter never used).
* After previously disbanding of all political parties (which had existed for only twenty years), new rules were written on the formation of parties.  These rules were so restrictive that only two parties were formed—the government party, the [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (Arena), and the controlled opposition of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB).
* Limitation of federated states' autonomy.
* Establishment of a series of controls, commissions and institutions to regulate and report a number of aspects of civil, social and economic life, thus intensifying an already existing trend towards [[bureaucracy]], top-heavy management of the economy by the central government.
* Granting the president the right to issue decrees (''Decretos-Lei'') that would enter in force at the moment of their publication and be inscribed in the statute-book after 30 days in the absence of Congressional deliberation on them.

=== Amendments of 1969 ===
In 1969, this already severely authoritarian document was widely amended by a [[Brazilian Military Junta|provisional military junta]] and made even more repressive.
The 1969 Amendment is sometimes regarded as a seventh Constitution, because it in fact rewrote the whole constitutional text.
The new constitutional text brought some extra tools for the regime:
* Giving the president the right to declare a state of emergency and suspend constitutional freedoms.
* Broadened capital punishment.
* [[Banishment]] – with loss of citizenship – as punishment.
* Suspension of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.
* Special military courts to try members of the military accused of crimes.
* Transfer of command of the [[military police]] from each federal state to the Ministry of the Army.
* Restrictions on travel.

From 1979 onward, however, the constitution was gradually purged of its authoritarian character.  This process accelerated with the return of civilian rule in 1985, culminating in the adoption of a new constitution in 1988.

== Citizen Constitution (1988 – present) ==
[[File:Ulyssesguimaraesconstituicao.jpg|thumb|President of the Constitutional Congress [[Ulysses Guimarães]] holds a copy of the 1988 Constitution.]]

=== Background ===
The seventh and current Brazilian Constitution was [[promulgated]] on October 5, 1988 after a two-year process in which it was written from scratch by a Constitutional Congress elected in 1986.

=== The Constitution ===
It appears as a reaction to the period of [[military dictatorship]], seeking to guarantee all manner of rights and restricting the state's ability to limit freedom, to punish offenses and to regulate individual life. On the other hand, it did not provide clear rules for state reform and kept the economic regulation of the country intact.

Among the new constitutional guarantees are the errand of injunction and the ''habeas data'' (one's right to have access to any data about him kept by the Government). It also anticipated the existence of a Consumers' Defence Code (which was brought out in 1990), of Children's and Youth Code (1990) and of a new Civil Code (2002).

It was the first constitution to demand severe punishment for breaches of civil liberties and rights. Consequently, Brazil later approved a law making the propagation of prejudice against any minority or ethnic group an unbailable crime. This law provided legal redress against those who spread [[hate speech]] (like [[Neo-Naziism|Neo-Nazis]]) or those who do not treat all citizens equally. This second aspect helped disabled people to have a reserved percentage of jobs in the public service (and soon in all large companies), and black people to seek reparation for prejudice in the courts.

Breaking with the authoritarian logic of the Constitution of 1967, it made unbailable crimes those of [[torture]] and of actions directed against the democratic state and the constitutional order, thus creating constitutional devices to block ''coups d'état'' of any kind.

[[File:Bernardo cabral 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Constitutional congressman [[Bernardo Cabral]] wrote the final draft of the Constitution.]]
Willing to create a truly democratic State, the Constitution has established many forms of direct popular participation besides regular voting, such as [[plebiscite]], [[referendum]] and the possibility of ordinary citizens proposing new laws. Examples of these democratic mechanisms were the 1993 plebiscite concerning the form of government, where the [[Presidential system]] was confirmed, and the [[Brazilian firearms and ammunition referendum, 2005|2005 referendum]] concerning the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition.

The mention of God in the preamble of the Constitution (and later on the Brazilian currency) was opposed by most leftists as incompatible with freedom of religion because it does not recognize the rights of polytheists (like the [[Native peoples of Brazil|Amerindians]]) or atheists, but it has not been removed so far. The only State Constitution that does not refer to God is the one of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. The Supreme Federal Court has ruled that this omission of the protection of God was not [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] since the preamble of the constitution is simply an indication of principles that serves as an introduction to the constitutional text and reflects the ideological conceptions of the legislator, falling within the scope of political ideology and not of the Law. Therefore, the preamble which is not actually a part of the supreme law, has no judicial validity whatsoever and cannot impose obligations or create rights.

=== Amendments ===
Despite its advances concerning individual rights and freedoms and also in government control, the Constitutional text brought dispositions that resulted in severe difficulties concerning governmental efficiency. In the following years, especially from 1995 onwards, this it had to be amended many times to get rid of impractical, contradictory or unclear provisions (but also to accommodate the economic reforms conducted by the government, for which such amendments have been sometimes criticized). As of December 2015, this Constitution has been amended 90 times.

On March 30, 2017, the [[North Carolina Senate]] passed HB 142, with 32 ayes, 16 noes, and 2 excused absents. That same day, the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] passed HB 142, with 70 ayes, 48 noes, and 2 excused absents, which Governor [[Roy Cooper]] signed into law that very day, becoming '''Ch.

==Lawsuits==
===''Carcaño v. Cooper''===

On July 21, 2017, the [[Lambda Legal]] and the [[ACLU]] expanded ''Carcaño v. Cooper'' to include more legal challenges and plaintiffs to House Bill 142 (HB 142). On October 18, 2017, the Lambda Legal and the ACLU announced a proposed legal settlement with the state of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nc_carcano-v-mccrory|title=Carcaño v.

===''United States v. State of North Carolina''===
On April 14, 2017, the [[United States Department of Justice]] issued a two-sentence court filing that said it had dropped its lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over House Bill 2, which was filed in 2016 by the Obama administration, because the North Carolina legislature had replaced House Bill 2 with House Bill 142.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-lgbt-idUSKBN17G1B5|title=Trump administration drops North Carolina 'bathroom bill' lawsuit|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1701">'''Instabus''', is a decentralized open system to manage and control electrical devices within a facility. It is developed by Berker, Gira, Jung, Merten and [[Siemens AG]]. There are about 200 companies of electrical supplies using this communication protocol. The EIB (European Installation Bus) allows all electrical components to be interconnected through an [[Bus (computing)|electrical bus]]. Every component is able to send commands to other components, no matter where they are. A typical EIB network is made of electrical components such as [[switches]], pulsers, [[electric motor]]s, electrovalves, [[contactors]], and [[sensors]].

This [[Bus (computing)|electrical bus]] is made of a 2x2x0,8mm [[twisted pair]] cable, that connects all devices within the network. The theoretical maximum number of components is 57375.

EIB system was developed to increase power savings, security, comfort and flexibility.

== System control ==
Although the EIB is a decentralized system and doesn't need any [[electric switchboard]] or control console, it's possible to implement a PC based monitoring system to check device status and to send manual or pre-programmed commands to one or more components of the network.

== Convergence with other standards ==
The Konnex [[KNX (standard)]] was developed as a result of the convergence between EIB, BCi and EHSA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3391">The '''law in Africa''' is a diverse mix of [[common law]], [[customary law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[religious law]] systems. Africa is the second largest continent and has 56 countries contained in it.

==History==
Modern Africa has been shaped primarily through different countries' inheritance of laws which existed in Europe through the nineteenth century. For instance, the primary sources of [[South Africa]] law were Roman-Dutch and English Common law, imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism. Thus it is sometimes termed Anglo-Dutch law. Various lawmaking bodies have existed within South Africa over time. Yet in fact, some of the oldest legal systems began first in Africa. For instance, Ancient Egyptian law used a civil code, based on the concept of [[Ma'at]]. Tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality were key principles.[http://www.cap-press.com/authors/217]&lt;ref&gt;Russ VerSteeg, ''Law in Ancient Egypt'' (2002) {{ISBN|0-89089-978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges kept records, which was used as precedent, although the systems developed slowly.

A [[polycentric law|polycentric]] [[legal system]], called ''[[Xeer]]'' developed exclusively in the [[Horn of Africa]] more than a millennium ago and is still widely used by the [[Somali people]]. Under this system, [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] serve as judges and help mediate cases using precedents.&lt;ref name="LALL"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Xeer is a good example of how [[customary law]] can work in lieu of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and is a good approximation of what is thought of as [[natural law]]. Several scholars have noted that even though Xeer may be centuries old, it has the potential to serve as the legal system of a modern, well functioning economy.&lt;ref name="PLBS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Xeer also shows how influential a system of laws can be with regard to the development of a culture. According to one report, the Somali nation did not begin with the common use of the [[Somali language]] by the Somali clans, but rather with the collective observance of Xeer.

}}
The '''Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009''' ({{USPL|111|2}}, {{USBill|111|S|181}}) is a [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] in the [[United States]] that was the first bill signed into law by [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] on January 29, 2009. The Act amends the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and states that the 180-day [[statute of limitations]] for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action. The law directly addressed ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.]]'', {{ussc|550|618|2007}}, a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not at the date of the most recent paycheck.

An earlier bill seeking to supersede the ''Ledbetter'' decision, also called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, was first introduced in the [[110th United States Congress]] but was not successfully enacted at that time, as it was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but failed in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

During the campaign for the 2008 elections, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] criticized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for defeating the 2007 version of the bill, citing Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]]'s opposition to the bill and candidate [[Barack Obama]]'s support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/08/31/obamas-first-shot-at-palin-focuses-on-equal-pay/ | title=Obama's First Shot at Palin Focuses on Equal Pay | author=Corey Dade | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court rulings==
{{main|Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.}}
The antecedents of the case were posed when [[Lilly Ledbetter]], a production supervisor at a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire plant in [[Alabama]], filed an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], six months before her early retirement in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/colleges/hclas/cld/cld_rlr_fall07_title7_grossman.pdf | title =Title VII's Protection Against Pay Discrimination: The Impact of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. | author =''[[Hofstra University]]'' | publisher =hofstra.edu | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/labor_law/meetings/2010/2010_eeo_007.authcheckdam.pdf | title =Developments in Equal Pay Law: The Lilly Ledbetter Act and Beyond | author =Gary R. Siniscalco | author2 =''[[American Bar Association]]'' | publisher =americanbar.org | date =March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts gave opposite verdicts, first supporting the complaint and later opposing; in conclusion the complaint brought the case to the attention of the Supreme Court. The latter ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice [[Samuel Alito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1074.pdf | title =Syllabus LEDBETTER v. GOODYEAR TIRE &amp; RUBBER CO., INC.  | author =''[[Supreme Court of the United States]]'' | publisher =supremecourt.gov | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]'s dissenting opinion proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20090213.html|title=The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009: President Obama's First Signed Bill Restores Essential Protection Against Pay Discrimination|publisher=[[Writ (website)|Writ]]|accessdate=March 15, 2009|date=February 13, 2009|first=Joanna|last=Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ledbetter'' decision was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed. These cases involved not only Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but also the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]], [[Fair Housing Act]], [[Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act]] and [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment to the Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/politics/05rights.html|title=Justices' Ruling in Discrimination Case May Draw Quick Action by Obama|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=March 21, 2009|date=January 5, 2009|first=Robert|last=Pear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first to criticize the Court's decision that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred was [[Marcia Greenberger]], president of the [[National Women's Law Center]], that saw in the ruling a "setback for women and a setback for civil rights" and called Ginsburg's opinion a "clarion call to the American people that this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052900740.html | title =Over Ginsburg's Dissent, Court Limits Bias Suits | author =Robert Barnes | publisher =washingtonpost.com | date =May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debra L. Ness]], president of the [[National Partnership for Women &amp; Families]], also condemned the decision, saying, "If employers can keep the discrimination hidden for a period of time, they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18920357/ns/business-us_business/t/high-court-limits-pay-discrimination-claims/#.Ufi1bY2TgV0 | title =High court limits pay-discrimination claims | author =''[[Associated Press]]'' | publisher =nbcnews.com | date =May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, the majority's findings were applauded by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|US Chamber of Commerce]], that called it a "fair decision" that "eliminates a potential wind-fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052900740.html|title=Over Ginsburg's Dissent, Court Limits Bias Suits|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=March 15, 2009|date=September 5, 2007|first=Robert|last=Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bill==
[[Image:Lilly Ledbetter DNC 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Ledbetter speaks during the second day of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]].]]
The [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|House Democrats]] were fast to react, coming out on June 12 against the Supreme Court. Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburg's dissenting opinion, which invited the Congress to take action by amending the law, the Democrats announced their intention to intervene: [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Steny Hoyer]] and [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|Education and Labor Committee]] Chairman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with ''Ledbetter'', clearly putting that "a key provision of the legislation will make it clear that discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made, but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision, including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck", as said by Rep. Miller.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1632164,00.html|title=House Dems Target Court's Pay Ruling|publisher=[[Associated Press]] (''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'')|accessdate=March 22, 2009|date=June 12, 2007|first=Jesse J.|last=Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans immediately opposed the bill as drafted, with Education and Labor Committee [[ranking member]] [[Howard McKeon]] raising the issue that business executives would be held liable for actions taken by managers who weren't leading the company anymore: "At the end of the day, such a loophole conceivably could allow a retiring employee to seek damages against a company now led by executives who had nothing to do with the initial act of discrimination".&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"/&gt;

The [[American Bar Association]] passed a resolution supporting the new bill.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401900.html|title=Exhibit A in Painting Court as Too Far Right|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=March 15, 2009|date=September 5, 2007|first=Robert|last=Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neal Mollen, who represented the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] in the Ledbetter case, argued that extending the term limit would put a strain on the chances of an adequate defense for the employers, as to defend themselves one "has to rely on documents and the memory of individuals, and neither of those is permanent.

==Legislative history==
[[File:Barack Obama signs Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 1-29-09.jpg|thumb|300px|President Obama signing the Act into law; to his right is the new law's namesake, [[Lilly Ledbetter]]]]
The bill ({{USBill|110|H.R.|2831}} and {{USBill|110|S.|1843}}) was defeated in April 2008 by Republicans in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] who cited the possibility of frivolous lawsuits in their opposition of the bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/washington/24cong.html?_r=2&amp;sq=&amp;oref=slogin | work=New York Times  | title=Republican Senators Block Pay Discrimination Measure | first=Carl | last=Hulse | date=April 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized Democrats for refusing to allow compromises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042301553.html | work=Washington Post | title=Senate Republicans Block Pay Disparity Measure | first=Lori | last=Montgomery | date=April 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was re-introduced in the 111th Congress (as {{USBill|111|H.R.|11}} and {{USBill|111|S.|181}}) in January 2009. It passed in the House of Representatives with 250 votes in support and 177 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10rights.html?hp | work=New York Times | title=House Passes 2 Measures on Job Bias | first=Robert | last=Pear | date=January 10, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was split along party lines, with three Republicans voting in favor ([[Ed Whitfield]] of [[Kentucky]], and [[Leonard Lance]] and [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] both of [[New Jersey]]) and five Democrats voting against ([[Travis Childers]] of [[Mississippi]], [[Dan Boren]] of [[Oklahoma]], [[Allen Boyd]] of [[Florida]], [[Parker Griffith]] of Alabama, and [[Bobby Bright]] of [[Alabama]]).
The Senate voted 72 to 23 to invoke [[cloture]] on S. 181 on January 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00004 Senate roll call vote 4, 111th Congress, 1st Session]&lt;/ref&gt; The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed the Senate, 61-36, on January 22, 2009. Those in favor included every Democratic senator (except Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was absent from the vote because of health issues), two independents who caucused with Democrats, and five Republican senators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00014 U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress - 1st Session]&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Obama actively supported the bill. The [[Whitehouse.gov|official White House blog]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Obama has long championed this bill and Lilly Ledbetter's cause, and by signing it into law, he will ensure that women like Ms. Ledbetter and other victims of pay discrimination can effectively challenge unequal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/now-comes-lilly-ledbetter/ | work=Whitehouse.gov blog | title=Now Comes Lilly Ledbetter | date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

House Majority Leader [[Steny Hoyer]] announced that the House would vote on S.181 (the bill passed by the Senate) during the week of January 26, getting the bill to President Obama's desk sooner rather than later. On January 27, the House passed S.181 by a 250-177 margin.

On January 29, 2009, Obama signed the bill into law. It was the first act he signed as president, and it fulfilled his campaign pledge to nullify ''Ledbetter v. Goodyear''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28910789/&lt;/ref&gt; However, by signing it only two days after it was passed by the House, he incurred criticism by newspapers, such as the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' which mentioned his campaign promise to give the public five days of notice to comment on legislation before he signed it. The White House through a spokesman answered that they would be "implementing this policy in full soon", and that  currently they were "working through implementation procedures and some initial issues with the congressional calendar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/234/allow-five-days-of-public-comment-before-signing-b/ | work=St. Petersburg Times | title=Barack Obama Campaign Promise No. 234: Allow 5 Days of Public Comment Before Signing Bills | date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent criticism==
While the law sought to address the rights of women in the workplace, some conservative editorialists said the law was "[nothing] more than a trial-lawyer payout."&lt;ref&gt;Strassel, Kinberley, A. "Obama's Inequality Pitch Falls Flat." Potomac Watch. ''The Wall Street Journal'' (print edition). March 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Justice (headed by the Minister of Justice) was established in 2001 after having severed ties with the Ministry of National Security and Justice. As a result, prior to the change in 2001, there are past individuals who were referred to as the Minister of National Security and Justice.

[[File:National Library Kansai.jpg|thumb|Kansai-kan of the National Diet Library]]

The {{Nihongo|'''National Diet Library''' ('''NDL''')|国立国会図書館|Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan}} is the [[national library]] of [[Japan]] and among the [[List of largest libraries|largest libraries in the world]]. It was established in 1948 for the purpose of assisting members of the {{Nihongo|[[National Diet|National Diet of Japan]]|国会|Kokkai}} in researching matters of public policy. The library is similar in purpose and scope to the United States [[Library of Congress]].

The National Diet Library  (NDL) consists of two main facilities in [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], and several other branch libraries throughout Japan.

==History==

The National Diet Library is the successor of three separate libraries: the library of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]], the library of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], both of which were established at the creation of Japan's [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]] in 1890; and the [[Imperial Library (Japan)|Imperial Library]], which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]].

The Diet's power in prewar Japan was limited, and its need for information was "correspondingly small."  The original Diet libraries "never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity."  Until Japan's defeat, moreover, the executive had controlled all political documents, depriving the people and the Diet of access to vital information.  The [[Occupation of Japan|U.S. occupation]] forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] deemed reform of the Diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of Japan after its defeat in [[World War II]].

In 1946, each house of the Diet formed its own National Diet Library Standing Committee.  [[Hani Gorō]], a [[Marxist]] historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] (the successor to the abolished House of Peers) after the war, spearheaded the reform efforts.  Hani envisioned the new body as "both a 'citadel of popular sovereignty," and the means of realizing a "peaceful revolution.'"  The Occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that, although the Occupation was a catalyst for change, local initiative pre-existed the Occupation, and the successful reforms were due to dedicated Japanese like Hani.

The National Diet Library opened in June 1948 in the present-day [[Akasaka Palace|State Guest-House]] (former Akasaka Detached Palace) with an initial collection of 100,000 volumes. The first Librarian of the Diet Library was the politician [[Tokujirō Kanamori]].&lt;ref name="NDL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/aboutus/outline_history.html|title=Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan shōshi|publisher=Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan|language=Japanese|accessdate=13 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116223026/http://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/aboutus/outline_history.html|archivedate=16 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Masakazu Nakai]] served as the first Vice Librarian.&lt;ref name="NDL" /&gt; In 1949, the NDL merged with the National Library (previously called the Imperial Library) and became the only national library in Japan. At this time the collection gained an additional million volumes previously housed in the former National Library in [[Ueno, Tokyo|Ueno]].

In 1961, the NDL opened at its present location&lt;ref&gt;This was the ground of the German Embassy since Meiji-Times. It was confiscated in 1945 and not given back.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nagatachō, Tokyo|Nagatachō]], adjacent to the National Diet.  In 1986, the NDL's Annex was completed to accommodate a combined total of 12 million books and periodicals.  The [[#The Kansai-Kan|Kansai-kan]] (the [[Kansai]] Library), which opened in October 2002 in the [[Kansai Science City]] ([[Seika, Kyoto|Seika]] Town, [[Sōraku District, Kyoto|Sōraku County]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]]), has a collection of 6 million items.  In May 2002, the NDL opened a new  branch, the [[International Library of Children's Literature]], in the former building of the Imperial Library in Ueno.  This branch contains some 400,000 items of children's literature from around the world.

Though the NDL's original mandate was to be a research library for the National Diet, the general public is the largest consumer of the library's services.  In the fiscal year ending March 2004, for example, the library reported more than 250,000 reference inquiries; in contrast, it recorded only 32,000 requests for research from the National Diet.

==Main collection==
As Japan's national library, the NDL collects copies of all publications published in Japan.  Moreover, because the NDL serves as a [[research library]] for Diet members, their staffs, and the general public, it maintains an extensive collection of materials published in foreign languages on a wide range of topics.

==Important special collections==

The NDL also has eight major specialized collections:  Modern Political and Constitutional History; Materials Concerning the Postwar Occupation of Japan; Laws and Preliminary Records; Science and Technology; Maps; Music; Foreign Books About Japan; and Rare Books.

===Modern political and constitutional history===

The Modern Political and Constitutional History Collection comprises some 300,000 items related to Japan's political and legal modernization in the 19th century, including the original document archives of important Japanese statesmen from the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century like [[Itō Hirobumi]], [[Iwakura Tomomi]], [[Sanjō Sanetomi]], [[Mutsu Munemitsu]], [[Terauchi Masatake]], and other influential figures from the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] (1868–1912) and [[Taishō period|Taishō]] (1912–1926) periods.

===Materials concerning the postwar occupation of Japan===

The NDL has an extensive microform collection of some 30 million pages of documents relating to the [[Occupation of Japan]] after World War II.  This collection include the documents prepared by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|General Headquarters]] (GHQ) and the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] (SCAP), the [[Far Eastern Commission]] (FEC), and the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey Team]].  (The originals of these documents are in the possession of the United States [[National Archives]].)

===Laws and preliminary records===

The Laws and Preliminary Records Collection consists of some 170,000 Japanese and 200,000 foreign-language documents concerning proceedings of the National Diet and the legislatures of some 70 foreign countries, and the official gazettes, statutes, judicial opinions, and international treaties pertaining to some 150 foreign countries.

===Science and technology===

The NDL maintains a collection of some 530,000 books and booklets and 2 million microform titles relating to the sciences.  These materials include, among other things, foreign doctoral dissertations in the sciences, the proceedings and reports of academic societies, catalogues of technical standards, etc.

===Maps===

The NDL has a collection of approximately 440,000 maps of Japan and other countries, including the topographical, geological, and hydrological maps and charts dating back to the early [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912) and topographical maps of foreign countries.

===Music===

The NDL collects all phonographic recordings made in Japan, and presently holds a collection comprising 300,000 vinyl records and 200,000 compact disks.

===Foreign books about Japan===

Following the tradition established by the Imperial Library, the NDL collects foreign-language materials about Japan, including rare and ancient documents, such as reports of European missionaries visiting Japan in the 16th century.

===Rare books and old materials===
[[File:The Analects of Confucius WDL11844.pdf|thumb|''The Analects of Confucius'' in the collection of the National Diet Library has a back flyleaf with Nobukata’s autograph provenance notes dated November of the 16th year of the [[Tenbun|Tenmon era]] (1547) and is clearly printed; therefore this seems to be a rare first edition. A sumptuous cover made of [[Nishijin-ori|Nishijin brocade]] was put on the book in the [[Edo period]].]]

The NDL houses the former Imperial Library's collection of Japanese language materials from the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) and earlier periods.  The major catalogues in this collection include: (1) some 6,000 documents relating to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1867), such as records of town magistrates, the shogunal Supreme Court, and the [[Commissioners of Shrines and Temples]], as well as documents concerning the succession of ''[[shōgun]]s''; (2) the [[Itō Bunko]] and [[Shirai Bunko]], consisting of 8,000 handwritten and woodblock printed books dating from the Edo and Meiji periods and concerning Japanese medicine; and (3) the [[Shinjo Bunko]], consisting of 11,000 examples of pre-modern writings on astronomy and calendars, in addition to ancient Chinese works on the [[Qing dynasty]], genealogy, and local history.

==The Kansai-Kan==
{{main|Kansai-kan of the National Diet Library}}
Kansai-kan (Kansai Library), which opened in Kyoto Prefecture in 2002, is the second facility of the NDL.

The NDL has transferred the following collections to the Kansai-kan: most western periodicals; books and other materials in non-Japanese Asian languages; certain scientific and technological materials (technical reports, papers of foreign academic societies, catalogs of Japanese and foreign technical standards, foreign doctoral dissertations, and conference proceedings in Western languages); scientific research reports compiled under grants from the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]; Japanese doctoral dissertations; and books on tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/service/kansai/index.html|title=Kansai-kan of the National Diet Library｜National Diet Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Diet Library online resources==

The National Diet Library has in recent years compiled a detailed website in both Japanese &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp|title=国立国会図書館―National Diet Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/|title=National Diet Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its online databases consist of the National Diet Library Online Public Access Catalog (NDL-OPAC), National Diet Library Digital Collections and the Minutes of the Imperial Diet and National Diet.

===National Diet Library Online Public Access Catalog (NDL-OPAC)===

The NDL provides an Online Public Access Catalog ([[OPAC]]), by which users can search the NDL's entire collection from anywhere in the world in either English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opac.ndl.go.jp/index_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20091211015702/http://opac.ndl.go.jp/index_e.html |archivedate=2009-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opac.ndl.go.jp/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021002060819/http://opac.ndl.go.jp/index.html |archivedate=2002-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using OPAC to identify sources and catalog numbers, overseas users may obtain certain materials from the NDL through [[interlibrary loan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/service/oversea/data_loan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119165445/http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/service/oversea/data_loan.html |archivedate=2005-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the NDL provides a fee-based reproduction service for scholars residing overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/service/oversea/data_copy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051114144736/http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/service/oversea/data_copy.html |archivedate=2005-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017 NDL-OPAC is planned to end at the end of December 2017 and new online services will be launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/2018renewal/index.html| publisher=National Diet Library| title=NDL to Implement a New Search System in January 2018| accessdate=2017-12-13| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213201212/http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/2018renewal/index.html| archivedate=2017-12-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Diet Library Digital Collections ===

NDL Digital Collections provices various online materials such as rare books, audio-visual materials and the materials whose copyrights has expired. The contents consisting of Digital Library from the Meiji Era and Rare Books Image Database (to be mentioned later) are now availablable on NDL Digital Collections. NDL Digitalized Contents was renamed to be NDL Digital Collections in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/en/intro.html| title=About the National Diet Library Digital Collections| publisher=National Diet Library| accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NDLDC_History&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/ja/history.html| publisher=National Diet Library| title=国立国会図書館デジタルコレクションの歩み| language=ja| accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Library from the Meiji Era===
{{Main|ja:近代デジタルライブラリー}}
One of the most important features of the NDL's website is the {{Nihongo|Digital Library of the Meiji Era|近代デジタルライブラリー|Kindai dejitaru raiburarii|lit. Recent Age Digital Library}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/data/endl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013070435/http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/data/endl.html |archivedate=2005-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Digital Library is the digital descendant of the [[Maruzen Meiji Microfilm]], the product of an ambitious project to microfilm the NDL's entire collection of Meiji era books, a collection of some 60,000 volumes.  The digital library contains actual images of these works, which are divided into ten main categories based on [[Nippon Decimal Classification]] (NDC) : {{Nihongo|(0) general|総記|sōki}}; {{Nihongo|(1) philosophy|哲学|tetsugaku}}; {{Nihongo|(2) history|歴史|rekishi}}; {{Nihongo|(3) social sciences|社会科学|shakai kagaku}}; {{Nihongo|(4) natural sciences|自然科学|shizen kagaku}}; {{Nihongo|(5) engineering and manufacturing|工学・工業|kōgaku/kōgyō}}; {{Nihongo|(6) industry|産業|sangyō}}; {{Nihongo|(7) arts and athletics|芸術・体育|geijutsu/taiiku}}; {{Nihongo|(8) language|語学|gogaku}}; and {{Nihongo|(9) literature|文学|bungaku}}.  The images are not coded, so text searches are not possible; however, Japanese-language searches for the title, author, publisher, subject, and table of contents of the works in the database are possible.  Meiji period periodicals are not included in this collection. Digital Library from the Meiji Era was merged into NDL Digital Collections in 2015.&lt;ref name=NDLDC_History /&gt;

===Rare Books Image Database===

The NDL's website also contains the {{Nihongo|Rare Books Image Database|貴重書画像データベース|kichōsho gazō dētabēsu}} a collection of digital images from 37,000 illustrated books published before the Edo Period.  Japanese-language searches by title, author, and call-number are possible in this database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rarebook.ndl.go.jp/pre/servlet/pre_com_menu.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831222030/http://rarebook.ndl.go.jp/pre/servlet/pre_com_menu.jsp |archivedate=2005-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Books Image Database was integrated into NDL Digitalized Contents (now NDL Digital Collections) in 2012.&lt;ref name=NDLDC_History /&gt;

===Minutes of the Imperial Diet and National Diet===

The NDL provides a database of the minutes of both the Imperial Diet and the National Diet, the only one of the NDL's online database that is full-text searchable.  All minutes from the National Diet's inception in May 1947 through the present are searchable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/|title=国会会議録検索システム|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, only minutes from the last two (91st and 92nd) sessions of the Imperial Diet (November 1946 through May 1947) are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teikokugikai-i.ndl.go.jp/|title=帝国議会会議録検索システム|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Patriot Act titles}}
The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 2001 as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It has ten titles, with the [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III|third title]] ("Title III: International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001") written to prevent, detect, and prosecute international [[money laundering]] and the financing of [[terrorism]].

Title III is itself divided into three subtitles. The first subtitle, entitled '''Subtitle A: International Counter Money Laundering and Related Measures''', is designed to put measures into place that counter international money laundering. It does this by requiring that financial institutions take several new special measures against money laundering — identification is dealt with particularly; by restricting or prohibiting the use of certain types of bank accounts; through adding further legislation that regulates a financial institution's dealing with foreign concerns; by adding new penalties for non-compliance of the law; and through regulations that are designed to facilitate and encourage reporting and communication between financial institutions and the U.S. government.

==Sec. 311: Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern==
{{wikisource|USA PATRIOT Act/Title III}}
A new section was added to Title 31, subchapter IV, chapter 53, subchapter II ("Records and reports on monetary instruments transactions") of the [[U.S. Code]]. The section was 5318A, entitled "Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern". It specifies that financial institutions or financial agencies may be required to take special measures when so directed by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. Any such order by the [[United States Treasury]], with the exception of orders that require additional record keeping or reporting for any transaction over an amount greater than the Secretary describes, is issued with a notice of [[rule making]] regarding the special measure. Orders may not remain in effect for more than 120 days, though any ruling may be extended by the Treasury.

When the Secretary of Treasury orders special measures, that person must first consult with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]], any other appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]]), the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], the [[National Credit Union Administration Board]] and any other relevant parties the Secretary of Treasury decides to call on. The special measures must take into account whether similar actions were taken by other nations and multilateral groups; whether the measure will cause any competitive disadvantage for U.S. financial organizations; how the timing or impact of the decision will affect legitimate business activities; and what effect the action would have on U.S. national security and foreign policy.

The special measures must be undertaken for all transactions that are made outside the U.S. in areas where money-laundering has been identified as a concern. The measures involve:
# the maintenance of records of the aggregate amount of transactions made in such areas. Such records must include:
#* the identity and address of the participants in a transaction or relationship, including the identity of the originator of any funds transfer;
#* the legal capacity in which a participant in any transaction is acting;
#* the identity of the beneficial owner of the funds involved in any transaction, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable to obtain and retain the information; and
#* a description of any transaction.
# undertaking reasonable steps to obtain and retain information on foreigners who gain a benefit of ownership of an account which is opened and maintained in the U.S., and yet who do not own the account itself (this is called [[beneficial ownership]])
# the identification of any foreign customers who are authorized to use or route transactions through a [[payable-through account]] in the U.S.

The section also details what is considered a "primary money-laundering concern". The Secretary of Treasury ultimately makes the decision on such areas in consultation with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Several jurisdictional factors must be taken into account, including:
* evidence that [[organized crime]], [[terrorism|international terrorists]], or both, have transacted business in that jurisdiction;
* the extent to which [[bank secrecy]] or special regulatory advantages are given to nonresidents or [[nondomiciliaries]] in the jurisdiction;
* the substance and quality of administration of the bank supervisory and counter-money laundering laws of the jurisdiction;
* the relationship between the volume of financial transactions occurring in the jurisdiction and the size of the economy of the jurisdiction;
* the extent to which the jurisdiction is characterized as an offshore banking or secrecy haven by credible international organizations or multilateral expert groups;
* whether the U.S. has a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] with the jurisdiction, and the experience of U.S. law enforcement officials and regulatory officials in obtaining information about transactions originating in or routed through or to the jurisdiction; and
* whether there are high levels of official or institutional [[Political corruption|corruption]]
The Secretary of Treasury also considers whether financial institutions facilitate or promote money laundering, balanced against the extent to which they perform and promote legitimate business activities. He or she must also decide whether the financial institutions is undertaking any of the special measures specified above when considering whether the jurisdiction, financial institutions, types of accounts, or transactions are or are not primarily a money laundering concern.

==Sec. 312. Special due diligence for correspondent accounts and private banking accounts==
Extra [[due diligence]] requirements were added to {{usc|31|5318}}. Each financial institution that has a correspondent bank account held and managed on behalf of a non-U.S. person must enable (or in some cases enhance) their due diligence policies, procedures and controls to detect and report instances of money laundering. The due diligence requirements focus on identifying the direct and indirect (beneficial) owners of the accounts.

Financial institutions must now undertake steps to identify the owners of any non-U.S. bank that is not [[public company|publicly listed]], along with the interests of each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make sure they are not engaging in money laundering. Reasonable efforts must be undertaken to determine whether the non-U.S. bank provides correspondent bank accounts to other foreign banks and, if it is discovered they do, the U.S. financial institution is expected to try to identify the foreign banks the non-U.S. bank deals with.

Similarly, U.S. financial institutions must also identify the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. The institution must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any [[politician|senior political figure]] where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption. A "private bank account" is defined as any account that has over [[$US]]1 million deposited by one or more people who have a direct or beneficial ownership of the account. Further, the account must be administered in whole or in part by an employee, officer or agent of a financial institution, and who acts as a liaison between the institution and the owners of the account.

==Sec. 313. Prohibition on United States correspondent accounts with foreign shell banks==
{{usc|31|5318}} was amended to prohibit U.S. financial institutions from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing a [[correspondent account]] in the U.S. for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country (otherwise known as a [[shell bank]]). U.S. financial institutions must also take steps to prevent the indirect servicing of a foreign shell bank by allowing a correspondent account to be established and maintained by another foreign bank who acts on behalf of that foreign shell bank. However, exceptions are made if the shell bank is an affiliate (under the control) of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or if the foreign shell bank is subject to supervision by a banking authority in the non-U.S. country regulating the affiliated depository institution, credit union, or foreign bank.

==Sec. 314. Cooperative efforts to deter money laundering==
In order to foster improved communication between financial institutions, the regulators of the financial institutions and law enforcement authorities the U.S. Treasury secretary was directed to create regulations within 120 days after the enactment of the Patriot Act that set out how information was to be shared. The aim of the act was more to encourage law enforcement authorities and financial regulation agencies to share the information they had on foreign individuals or organisations engaged in terrorism. Due to the complex nature of the task on February 26, 2002 the U.S. Treasury initially put together a proposed rule to amend the [[Code of Federal Regulations]],&lt;ref name=Initial103CFR100&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm Treasury announces USA PATRIOT Act Regulations to improve information sharing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415003855/https://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm |date=2006-04-15 }}, [[United States Treasury]], February 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and then on March 14, 2002 they released [https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm 31 CFR 103.100] which was entitled "Special Information Sharing Procedures To Deter Money Laundering and Terrorist Activity".&lt;ref name=103CFR100&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm Also found at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm |date=2005-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation allows [[FinCEN]] to solicit, on behalf of a Federal law enforcement agency, information from a financial institution or group of financial institutions. In order to gain such information, a law enforcement agency must provide a certificate which shows who is the target of the information request — the regulation states that enough information must be provided to the institution to allow them to distinguish between common or similar names — and a contact person from the agency who knows about the request. The financial institution must then expeditiously search records for information that satisfies the request, though at any time the institution can contact the law enforcement agency to clarify the scope or terms of the request. The information that an agency must disclose is:
* any current amounts held for a named suspect
* any account maintained by the suspect during the previous 12 months
* any transaction conducted by or on behalf of a suspected, or any transfer of funds where the suspect was the recipient or the giver of the funds
After identifying the account asked for by FinCEN, the financial institution must provide a report back to FinCEN with:
* the name of the suspect
* the number of accounts owned, or transaction made
* the [[social security number]], taxpayer ID number, passport number, date of birth, address or any other identity information provided by the suspect to the financial institution when they opened their account or performed their transaction

The regulation specifically prohibits the financial institution from using information provided by FinCEN to do anything other than report information back to FinCEN, make a determination whether to do business with the named suspect or suspects, or to help them comply with an order given under the regulation. Furthermore, the financial institution may not disclose that FinCEN made a request for or obtained information to anyone other than FinCEN or to the Federal agency who was using FinCEN to gather information about the suspects. Under the regulation,  financial institutions are expected to maintain appropriate security to keep such information confidential in order to satisfy the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]].

The section also allows financial institutions to share information with other financial institutions when so allowed by the Secretary of Treasury, and they are now legally immune from prosecution if they gather or share information relating to terrorism or financial money-laundering in order to identify and report such activities. The section also gives immunity against breaches of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to any organisation who undertakes actions to comply with this section.

Finally, the section directs the Secretary of Treasury to produce a report semiannually to the financial services industry "containing a detailed analysis identifying patterns of suspicious activity and other investigative insights derived from suspicious activity reports and investigations conducted by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies". This report must be distributed to every financial institution in the United States.

==Sec. 315. Inclusion of foreign corruption offenses as money laundering crimes==
Section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect 1956(c)(7)] of title 18 of the U.S. Code was amended to further include specific acts of unlawful activity in relation to money laundering. Unlawful acts include:
* making a financial transaction in the U.S. in order to commit a crime of violence,&lt;ref name=Sec315_18USC1956c7Bii&gt;Amendment made to {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(ii)}} — for some reason an extra parenthesis was inserted into {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(iii)}}, according to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956-#FN-1 Cornell University], this was probably mistakenly added by law makers&lt;/ref&gt;
* the bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds,
* the smuggling or illegal export of controlled munitions;&lt;ref name=Sec315_MunitionsIllegalExport&gt;Illegal export of controlled munitions is defined in the [[United States Munitions List]], which is part of the [[Arms Export Control Act]] ({{usc|22|2778}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the importation or bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorised by the U.S. Attorney General,&lt;ref name=315_UnauthorisedFirearmAmmunition&gt;See {{usc-clause|18|922|(l)}} and {{usc-clause|18|925|(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the smuggling of any item controlled under the [[Export Administration Regulations]],&lt;ref name="Sec315_ExportAdminRegulations"&gt;Defined in 15 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 730-774&lt;/ref&gt;
* any offense where the U.S. would be obligated under a [[mutual treaty]] with a foreign nation to [[extradite]] a person, or where the U.S. would need to submit a case against a person for prosecution due to the treaty,
* the importation of falsely classified goods,&lt;ref name=Sec315_FalselyClassifiedGoods&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[computer crime]],&lt;ref name=Sec315_ComputerCrime&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* any [[felony]] violation of the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938]]

==Sec. 316. Anti-terrorist forfeiture protection==
This section allows the incorrect seizure of the assets of those suspected to be international terrorist to be contested. The contesting party can file a claim under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and can either assert as an [[affirmative defense]] that their property was seized improperly or plead an [[innocent owner defense]]. The act also states that:

:''In considering a claim filed under this section, a court may admit evidence that is otherwise inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, if the court determines that the evidence is reliable, and that compliance with the Federal Rules of Evidence may jeopardize the national security interests of the United States.''

However, this clause does not deny a property owner of their right to contest the confiscation of assets that are suspected to be owned by international terrorists under the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] or under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]]. It also does not limit the remedies available to property owners defined under the civil forfeiture laws defined in the U.S. Code.&lt;ref name=CivilForfeitureLaws&gt;{{usc|18|981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also made a technical amendment to the General Rules for Civil Forfeiture Proceedings&lt;ref name=GeneralRulesForCivilForfeitureProcedings&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt; by amending the definition of the term "civil forfeiture statute" to exclude the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA).&lt;ref name=IEEPA&gt;{{usc-clause|18|983|(i)(2)(D)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 317. Long-arm jurisdiction over foreign money launderers==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect Section 1956 of title 18] was amended in several ways. [[U.S. district court]]s are now given jurisdiction over any foreign person or financial institution where action is undertaken to prosecute them under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures or under the laws of the country in which the foreigner is found. Offenses where the District court can have jurisdiction are in cases where that person commits an offense that involves money laundering under {{usc|18|1956}}; in cases where that person converts property that a U.S. court has seized; or where the foreigner is a financial institution that maintains a bank account at a U.S. financial institution.

The amendment gives the court the power to freeze bank accounts and property so they can satisfy a judgement under 18&amp;nbsp;[[United States Code|USC]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect §&amp;nbsp;1956]. The courts may appoint a [[Federal Receiver]] to seize or control all assets of a defendant in order to satisfy a judgement of the court. The judgement may be a civil judgement about money laundering; the civil or criminal forfeiture of assets;&lt;ref name=Sec317_Forfeiture&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|981}} and {{usc|18|982}}, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; or made against those who act as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]. The Federal Receiver is appointed by the court after an application is made by a Federal prosecutor or Federal or State regulator, and they must be an officer of the court. The Federal Receiver is governed by {{usc|28|754}} and is able to gain the same information about a defendants assets from FinCen, the Department of Treasury or a foreign government (where a treaty or other agreement is in place with the U.S. government) as a Federal prosecutor.

==Sec. 318. Laundering money through a foreign bank==
This section expanded the definition of a financial institution to be any foreign bank, as defined in section 1 of the [[International Banking Act of 1978]].&lt;ref name=Sec318_sec1IntlBankingAct1978&gt;{{usc|12|3101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 319. Forfeiture of funds in United States Interbank accounts==
Section 319 deals with the forfeiture of funds in [[Interbank account]]s and the ability of Federal banking agencies to subpoena bank records or summons banking staff in order to gain access to bank records. It also gave U.S. courts the authority to order convicted criminal to return property located abroad. Paragraph (c) allowed a (since expired) grace period of 60 days from the enactment of the Act with which financial institutions were required to comply with the provisions of {{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)}}.

Any deposits into foreign banks are considered to be deposited into any Interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S., and thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the Interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were made to allow the Attorney General to suspend or stop such a forfeiture if the Attorney General determines that a [[conflict of law]] exists between the laws of the foreign country in which the foreign bank resides in and with the laws of the U.S.. The Attorney General must also decide whether halting such a forfeiture would be in the interest of justice and that it would not harm the national interests of the U.S.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds that are forfeited in the Interbank account can be contested by the foreign bank under the general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings.&lt;ref name="GenRulesCivilForfeitureProc"&gt;The general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings are defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18USC981k-3"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government does not need to show that the funds being forfeited are directly traceable to the funds deposited at the foreign bank and the government is also not required to apply {{usc|18|984}}, which deals with the civil forfeiture of [[fungible]] property.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 319 requires a financial institution to respond to a request for information from a Federal banking agency within 120 hours of the receipt of the request. Federal banking agencies can request information relating to any money-laundering activities — financial institutions must provide documentation for any account opened, maintained, administered or managed by the institution in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[summon]]s or [[subpoena]] may be issued to any representative of a foreign bank that as a corresponding account in the U.S. — they may be required to include records (even those maintained outside the U.S.) that relate to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank. The summons may be issued to a bank with a representative in the U.S. or in foreign countries where the U.S. has a mutual legal assistance treat, a [[multilateral agreement]] or where the U.S. can expect that they will respond to a request for international law enforcement assistance.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign banks who maintain corresponding accounts must maintain records in the U.S. that will identify the owners' real names and addresses. The banks must be able to provide this information within 7 days of receipt of the request.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a requirement that when so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury (they must consult each other first) the financial institution must terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days. Corresponding accounts can be ordered to be closed if the foreign bank fails to comply with a summons or subpoena (see above), or has failed to legally contest the summons in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-i"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A financial institution is further protected from liability if they terminate a corresponding relationship in accordance with the section,&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-ii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in fact the financial institution faces penalties of [[$US]]10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-iii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(iii)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Code was amended by section 319 to allow a court to order a convicted criminal to return property that is located abroad.&lt;ref name=Sec319_21USC853p&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt; If that property cannot be located, has been transferred or sole, is placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court, is substantially reduced in value, or has been comingled with other property in such a way that it cannot be divided without difficulty&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the court may order that property be forfeited in substitution of the property that must be returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can also order that any property beyond the jurisdiction of the court must be returned to the jurisdiction of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a defendant enters into a pretrial restraint order to stop goods from being seized, then the defendant may be required to deposit the property either into the registry of the court, with the [[United States Marshals Service]], or with the U.S. Secretary of Treasury in an interest-bearing account.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the defendant refuses the law states that they will be charged with [[contempt of court]] and their final sentence may be enhanced under the [[obstruction of justice]] provision of the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 320. Proceeds of foreign crimes==
The U.S. Code was amended to allow the forfeiture of any property within the jurisdiction of the United States that was gained as the result of an offense against a foreign nation that involves the manufacture, importation, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(A)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 321. Financial institutions specified in Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sup_01_31_08_IV_10_53_20_II.html Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code] requires certain reports or records from various financial institutions where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism. Section 321 of the USA PATRIOT Act included [[credit union]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(E)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futures commission merchant]]s, [[commodity trading]] advisors and [[commodity pool operator]]s in its definition of a financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined in all legislation that the term "Federal functional regulator" includes the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).

==Sec. 322. Corporation represented by a fugitive==
The U.S. Code was amended to disallow a corporation whose majority shareholder or owner is a [[fugitive]] from mounting an innocent owner defense to contest the forfeiture of property by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2466|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 323. Enforcement of foreign judgments==
The U.S. Code defines the means by which a foreign nation may seek to have a forfeiture or judgement notification enforced by a district court of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|28|2467}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was amended under section 323 by adding a new paragraph that specifies how the U.S. government may apply for a restraining order&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to {{usc-clause|18|983|(j)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve the availability of property which is subject to a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evaluating whether to issue the restraining order, the court may rely on information provided in an affidavit which describes the overseas investigation that is underway and why the property in question should be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. court may also register and enforce a restraining order that has already been issued by a foreign court and which is certified by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any objections to the restraining order must not include any made on grounds that are part of any parallel foreign litigation over the same property.

Section 323 places a large emphasis on the ability of a foreign court to follow [[due process]] when considering an application for a forfeiture or confiscation judgement to be registered and enforced in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(b)(1)(c)}} &amp; {{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(1)(D)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "forfeiture and confiscation" is defined to mean a final order of a foreign nation which compels a person or entity to pay money for "any violation of foreign law that would constitute a violation or an offense for which property could be forfeited under Federal law if the offense were committed in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(a)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 324. Report and recommendation==
Provisions were made to allow the Secretary of Treasury and various other agencies (including the Attorney General, the Federal banking agencies as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]], the National Credit Union Administration Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission) the ability to evaluate the operations of the provisions of title III and make recommendations to Congress. These were to be made within 30 months of the enactment of the Act.

==Sec. 325. Concentration accounts at financial institutions==
A [[concentration account]] is a single account used for the internal purposes of a financial institution to facilitate the processing and settlement of multiple or individual customer transactions within the bank, usually on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_037.htm Expanded Overview - Concentration Accounts], Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examination Manual&lt;/ref&gt; Such accounts can lead to the concealment by financial institutions transactions made by customers, however section 325 bans their use for such purposes by prohibiting financial institutions from allowing clients to direct transactions that move their funds into, out of, or through the concentration accounts of the financial institution. Financial institutions are also prohibited from informing clients about the existence of such accounts and disallows any disclosure that may give customer a way of identifying such accounts that the financial institution may use. The section also requires that financial institutions document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account that commingles funds belonging to one or more customers.

==Sec. 326. Verification of identification==
The Secretary of the Treasury was given the task of prescribing regulations that set forth the minimum standards that financial institutions must undertake to verify the identity of customers who open accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules implementing section 326 became effective on June 9, 2003, although financial institutions had until October 1, 2003 to
come into compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum requirements under the section require financial institutions to establish procedures to take reasonable and practicable measures to verify the identity of those applying for an account with the institution;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain records of the information used to verify a person's identity, including name, address, and other identifying information;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to consult lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any government agency to determine whether a person seeking to open an account appears on any such list.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(C)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When prescribing the regulations, the Secretary was ordered to take into account the types of accounts available to financial institutions, the various methods someone can use to open accounts, and the various types of identifying information available to the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]], banks and other financial institutions are restricted from carrying out activities that do not relate to financial activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sia.com/capitol_hill/html/bank_holding_company_act_of_19.html Bank Holding Company Act of 1956], ''SIA Primer on Securities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] Sec. 4(k) ({{usc-clause|12|1843|(k)}})&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the regulations must be prescribed jointly by the Secretary and each Federal functional regulator&lt;ref&gt;The section states that this includes regulators "defined in section 509 of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], including the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]"&lt;/ref&gt; appropriate for such financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary also has the power to exempt such institutions from the regulations proscribed under section 326.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also required a report with 6 months of the enactment of the Patriot Act from the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with Federal functional regulators as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As such, on July 23, 2002 the Department of Treasury, FinCEN, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Commission]] (FDIC), the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) and the [[National Credit Union Association]] (NCUA) jointly released a joint notice of rule-making in the [[Federal Register]] for banks,&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48290&lt;/ref&gt; and Treasury simultaneously released an identical notice in the Federal Register for credit unions, private banks and trust companies who did not have a functional regulator.&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48299&lt;/ref&gt; After a considerable response, alterations to the proposed rule making were made and Treasury and the Federal functional agencies released 31 CFR 103.121. The regulation sets out the minimum requirements for setting up a [[Customer Identification Program]] (CIP). These requirements for the CIP are that it must:
# be appropriate for the financial institution's size and type of business, and if it must have an anti-money laundering compliance program then the CIP must be part of this. Credit Unions, private banks and trust companies without a Federal functional regulator must have a CIP approved by their [[board of directors]],
# have identity verification procedures. These must include risk-based procedures that allow the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the identities of each customer. The regulation specifies what is required to identify a customer. If a customer does not provide sufficient information to allow their verification the CIP must include procedures the bank must undertake. The procedures must cover (1) circumstances when the bank cannot verify the customer's identity; (2) should cover circumstances when the bank should not open an account; (3) specify what terms in which a customer may use an account while the bank tries to verify the customer's identity; (4) when a bank should close an account after being unable to verify a customer's identity; and (5) when a bank should file a Suspicious Activity Report,
# have procedures for making and maintaining a record of all verification information gathered by the financial institution,
# have procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations - the bank must determine this within a "reasonable time",
# have procedures for giving adequate notice to customers that the bank is requesting information to verify their identities, and

The regulation allows any Federal regulator, in concurrence with the Secretary of Treasury, to exempt a bank or type of account from the regulations given.

==Sec. 327. Consideration of anti-money laundering record==
The [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] makes it unlawful, except with prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for a bank to take any action that makes another company into a [[bank holding company]] or subsidiary of one; for a bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect shares of more than 5% of a bank; for bank holding companies to acquire all or most of the assets of a bank; and in most circumstances for a bank holding company to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1842|(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 327 amends the Act to make the Board take into consideration the effectiveness of the company or companies in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (6) was added to {{usc-clause|12|1842|(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]] prevents the merger of insured depository institutions with non-insured depository institutions without the written approval of a responsible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended by section 327 to take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches, when approving such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (11) was designated as paragraph (12) and the amendment was added as paragraph (11) to {{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the amendments only apply to applications submitted to either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or responsible agency after December 31, 2001, and which were not approved by the Board or responsible agency before the date of enactment of the Patriot Act.

==Sec. 328. International cooperation on identification of originators of wire transfers==
The Secretary of the Treasury must take all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments to require the inclusion of the name of the originator in [[wire transfer]] instructions sent to the United States and other countries, with the information to remain with the transfer from its origination until the point of [[wikt:disburse|disbursement]]. They must also report annually to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on the progress Treasury is making on this issue and what is impeding progress of implementing the wire transfer identification scheme.

==Sec. 329. Criminal penalties==
An official or employee of the government who acts corruptly — as well as the person who induces the corrupt act — by being influenced for any official act, who is influenced to allow or collude with any fraudulent act, or who is induced to take or not take some action which is in violation of the person's official duties will be fined by an amount that is not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. All violations are subject to [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_227.html chapter 227 of title 18, United States Code], and the provisions of the [[United States Sentencing Guidelines]].

==Sec. 330. International cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups==
This section details that the sense of Congress is to encourage international cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups. The sense is that the [[U.S. President]] should direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate, and in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to seek to enter into negotiations with the appropriate financial supervisory agencies and other officials of any foreign country who do business with the U.S.. Congress's purpose is to ensure that foreign banks and other financial institutions maintain adequate records of transaction and account information relating to any foreign terrorist organization,&lt;ref&gt;As designated under [http://uscis.gov/lpBin/lpext.dll/inserts/slb/slb-1/slb-20/slb-4856?f=templates&amp;fn=document-frame.htm#slb-act219 section 219] of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; any person who is a member or representative of any such organization, or any person engaged in money laundering or financial or other crimes and establish a mechanism whereby, when appropriate, these records may be made available to United States law enforcement officials and domestic financial institution supervisors.

In [[broadcast law]] (particularly within [[U.S. law]]), the '''pervasiveness doctrine''' is the [[doctrine]] that because broadcast [[radio wave]]s are available to anyone and therefore "uniquely pervasive", their [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] is subject to regulation. In general, [[profanity]] and [[sex]], or other adult material deemed "[[morality|indecent]]" by a broadcasting authority, may not be broadcast outside of overnight "[[watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]]" or "safe harbor" hours when children are unlikely to be awake. Material deemed "[[obscene]]" may still be prohibited at all times.
 
This has generally been held to only apply to the [[AM broadcast band]] ([[mediumwave]]), [[FM broadcast band]] ([[VHF]] [[band II]]), and TV broadcast bands (VHF [[band I]] and [[band III]], and [[UHF]]). It does not apply to [[cable TV]], [[cable radio]], [[satellite TV]], [[satellite radio]], or other forms of electronic media, because although they also use publicly owned airwaves, these are subscription services which the listener or viewer must explicitly request, and are subject to [[conditional access]], analog [[scrambler|scrambling]], or digital [[encryption]].

The origin of the name comes from the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s 1978 legal case against [[Pacifica Radio]], when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] used the term to justify the verdict against the broadcaster. The ''[[Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation]]'' case is considered a landmark for American broadcasters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The '''right to disconnect''' is a proposed [[human right]] regarding the ability of people to disconnect from work and primarily not to engage in work-related electronic communications such as e-mails or messages during non-work hours.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staufenberg|first1=Jess|title=France may pass a law on the 'right to disconnect' from work emails at home|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-may-pass-a-law-on-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails-at-home-a6878571.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schofield|first1=Hugh|title=The plan to ban work emails out of hours|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36249647|website=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern working environment has been drastically changed by new communication and information technologies. The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorops-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=December 2016|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason such a right is beneficial. Several countries, primarily in [[Europe]], have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July 24, 2018, the Petition 1057 called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/TravailALaChambre/Petitions/RoleDesPetitions?action=doPetitionDetail&amp;id=1249|title=Petition 1057|last=|first=|date=|website=Chambre des députés du Grand Duché du Luxembourg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==

=== Origins ===
The right to disconnect emerged in [[France]] in a decision in the Labour Chamber of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]]. The decision on 2 October 2001 held that "the employee is under no obligation either to accept working at home or to bring there his files and working tools".&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, October 2, 2001 n°99-42.727&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Supreme Court affirmed this decision and ruled that "the fact that [the employee] was not reachable on his cell phone outside working hours cannot be considered as misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, February 17, 2004 n°01-45.889&lt;/ref&gt;

=== El Khomri Law ===
The [[government of France]] passed the [[El Khomri law]] to reform working conditions for French people. Article 55 under Chapter II "Adapting the Labour Law to the Digital Age" (&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;''Adaptation du droit du travail à l'ère du numérique''&lt;/span&gt;) included a provision to amend the [[French labour law|French Labour Code]] to include the right to disconnect (''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;le droit de la déconnexion&lt;/span&gt;)''. Article 55(1) amended Article L. 2242-8 of the Labour Code by adding a paragraph (7);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/8/8/ETSX1604461L/jo#JORFSCTA000032983228|title=LOI n° 2016-1088 du 8 août 2016 relative au travail, à la modernisation du dialogue social et à la sécurisation des parcours professionnels {{!}} Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"(7) The procedures for the full exercise by the employee of his right to disconnect and the establishment by the company of mechanisms for regulating the use of digital tools, with a view to ensuring respect for rest periods and leave as well as personal and family life. Failing agreement, the employer shall draw up a charter, after consultation with the works council or, failing that, with the staff delegates. This charter defines these procedures for the exercise of the right to disconnect and furthermore provides for the implementation, for employees and management and management personnel, of training and awareness-raising activities on the reasonable use of digital tools."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;"7° Les modalités du plein exercice par le salarié de son droit à la déconnexion et la mise en place par l'entreprise de dispositifs de régulation de l'utilisation des outils numériques, en vue d'assurer le respect des temps de repos et de congé ainsi que de la vie personnelle et familiale. A défaut d'accord, l'employeur élabore une charte, après avis du comité d'entreprise ou, à défaut, des délégués du personnel. Cette charte définit ces modalités de l'exercice du droit à la déconnexion et prévoit en outre la mise en œuvre, à destination des salariés et du personnel d'encadrement et de direction, d'actions de formation et de sensibilisation à un usage raisonnable des outils numériques"&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt; As prescribed in Article 55(2), Article 55(1) entered into force on January 1, 2017.

=== Context ===
The government of France adopted the right into its Labour Code in response to a September 2015 report on the impact of digital technologies on labour which supported a right to "professional disconnection".&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/archives/archives-courantes/loi-travail-2016/les-principales-mesures-de-la-loi-travail/article/droit-a-la-deconnexion|title=Droit à la déconnexion|date=2017-05-31|work=Ministère du Travail|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was presented to the French Minister of Labour [[Myriam El Khomri]] after the previous minister sought information on the effect of digital transformation on Labour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/154000646.pdf|title=Report on Digital Transformation and Work Life|last=Mettling|first=Bruno|date=September 2015|website=|page=52|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended such a measure stating that a correct balance between work and private life is essential to allow digital transformation to have a positive effect on workers' quality of life and that knowing how to disconnect was a skill which needs to be supported by employers. The report identified cognitive and emotional overload which can lead to a sense of fatigue as a psycho-social risk of being constantly connected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The government viewed it necessary to adopt such a law to adapt to the changing nature of the workplace, recognizing that digital technologies have blurred the line between work and private lives. It viewed the introduction of the right to disconnect necessary for the health of French employees.&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"/&gt;

The introduction of this law followed a 2016 study that discovered that 37% of workers were using professional digital tools (e.g. work mobile phones) outside of work hours and that 62% of workers wanted more controls and rules to regulate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleas.fr/app/uploads/2016/10/CP-Eleas-Enqu%C3%AAte-Pratiques-num%C3%A9riques-2016.pdf|title=Digital Asset Practices in France in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
The right to disconnect is applied to each company in its own way. The El Khomri Law introduces the right but does not define it, allowing companies to choose the most practical ways to implement the right taking into consideration the nature of the business (for example, whether it operates with countries in foreign time zones, or whether the employees work nights or in the weekend).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bersay-associes.com/en/2017-01/the-right-to-disconnect/|title=The right to disconnect {{!}} Bersay Associés|website=www.bersay-associes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For companies with more than 50 employees the right is to be included in their Mandatory Annual Negotiation (MAN) on gender equality and the nature of quality of life at work, that is already required by the El Khomri Law, by considering ways in which the use of digital tools can be regulated and the means to do this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the absence of this a "charter of good conduct" is to be negotiated with union representatives detailing the times that employees can disconnect from their digital tools, when they would not be expected to connected to their smartphones or laptops.  Companies with less than 50 employees are expected to release a document to their employees outlining the rules for their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/key-measures-in-france-s-contested-labour-reform-1.2900757|title=Key measures in France's contested labour reform|date=2016-05-13|work=CTVNews|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right as it exists in the El Khomri Law does not extend to those independent workers who are part of online [[Crowdsourcing|crowdworking]] regimes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donini Forlivesi Rota Tullini|first=Annamaria Michele Anna Patrizia|date=2017|title=Janus and the trade union challenge of digital technology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1024258916688863#_i11|journal=Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research|volume=23 |issue=2|pages=207–223|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not provide any guidance on possible ways to manage the use of digital tools or ways to train or raise awareness among workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, while the new law imposes an obligation for large companies to negotiate there is no obligation to reach an agreement, therefore if no agreement is reached between company and employees the right cannot be applied and enforced. It is assumed that the obligation that applies to small companies, for employers to draw up a charter, would then apply. Again there is no penalty for companies who do not do this. Furthermore, such a charter has no legal value in France, unless it contains terms providing or sanctions against employees which allow it to be considered as an appendix to the internal rules of a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorps-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers who fail to include the right to disconnect in the MAN are liable to criminal prosecution for obstructing the exercise of union rights, punishable by 1 year in prison and a €3,750 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Article L.2243-2 of the French Labor Code&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As an example for other countries ===
It is likely that other [[European Union]] nations will follow the example of France and enact a similar law themselves. Outside of a formalized right it is likely that employees and unions could negotiate for similar provisions to apply the right to disconnect to their own workplace, resulting in the right becoming commonplace by human resource management best practice, industry practice, or contractual norms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Germany ==
While not having actual laws relating to the right to disconnect, [[Germany|German]] companies have a history of implementing policies to the same effect.

[[Volkswagen]] implemented a policy in 2011 stating that it would stop email servers from sending emails to the mobile phones of employees between 6pm and 7am. Other German companies such as [[Allianz]], Telekom, [[Bayer]] and [[Henkel]] all have similar policies in place to limit the amount of digital connection employees have after work hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalhrlaw.com/resources/anti-stress-legislation-in-germany--how-realistic-is-the-prospect|title=Anti-stress legislation in Germany – how realistic is the prospect? - Ius Laboris Knowledge Base|last=Verhoek|first=Corinna|date=30 September 2014|website=www.globalhrlaw.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Germany's employment ministry banned its managers from contacting staff after hours as part of a wider agreement on remote working. It was done in order to protect the mental health of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10276815/Out-of-hours-working-banned-by-German-labour-ministry.html|title=Out of hours working banned by German labour ministry|last=Vasagar|first=Jeevan|date=30 August 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, automobile company [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] introduced a software called "Mail on Holiday" that its employees could use to automatically delete incoming emails while they were on vacation. This was done to allow Daimler's employees the opportunity to get a break and come back to work refreshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3116424/daimler-vacation-email-out-of-office/|title=The most radical way to end vacation email overload ever|last=Gibson|first=Megan|website=Time|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German employment minister in 2014, [[Andrea Nahles]], sought to introduce "anti-stress legislation" in response to the rising levels of stress and mental health issues in Germany. Such legislation would ban companies from making contact with employees out of work hours. Nahles commissioned the [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to produce a report researching mental health in the work place and the viability of legislation to target it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/29/germany-anti-stress-law-ban-on-emails-out-of-office-hours|title=German minister calls for anti-stress law ban on emails out of office hours|last=Stuart|first=Keith|date=2014-08-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was completed and published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baua.de/EN/Service/Publications/Report/Mental-Health.html|title=BAuA  -  Publications - Mental Health in the Working World - Determining the current state of scientific evidence|last=publisher|website=www.baua.de|language=en|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
The right to disconnect has recently entered [[Italy|Italian]] law through Senate Act no 2233-B "Measures to safeguard non-entrepreneurial self-employment and measures to facilitate flexible articulation in times and places of subordinate employment". Article 19(1) of the Act governs the implementation for an Agreement on Aggregate Work and includes some form of the right to disconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/17/DDLMESS/1022243/index.html|title=senato.it - Legislatura 17ª - Disegno di legge n. 2233-B|website=www.senato.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Agreement on Aggregate Work shall be stipulated in writing for the purpose of administrative and probative regularity and shall govern the performance of the work performed outside the premises of the company, including with regard to the forms of exercise of the executive power the employer and the tools used by the worker. ''The agreement also identifies the worker's rest periods as well as the technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure that the worker is disconnected from the technological equipment''." [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span lang="it" dir="ltr"&gt;''"L'accordo relativo alla modalità di lavoro agile è stipulato per iscritto ai fini della regolarità amministrativa e della prova, e disciplina l'esecuzione della prestazione lavorativa svolta all'esterno dei locali aziendali, anche con riguardo alle forme di esercizio del potere direttivo del datore di lavoro ed agli strumenti utilizzati dal lavoratore. L'accordo individua altresì i tempi di riposo del lavoratore nonché le misure tecniche e organizzative necessarie per assicurare la disconnessione del lavoratore dalle strumentazioni tecnologiche di lavoro."''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Philippines ==
House Bill 4721 was introduced to the [[Congress of the Philippines|Seventeenth Congress]] of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB04721.pdf|title=H.B 4721|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long title of the proposed Act is "An act granting employees the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications after work hours" and seeks to amend the Labour Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No.442).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_442_1974.html|title=P.D. No. 442|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly it aims to make time spent engaging with work-related electronic tools outside of work hours come under the definition of 'hours worked' under Article 48, secondly it would insert Articles 48-A and 48-B which read;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right to disconnect -- An employee shall not be reprimanded, punished, or otherwise subjected to disciplinary action if he or she disregards a work-related communication sent after work-hours, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy to be established by the employer as required in Article 84-B hereof"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Policy on after-hours use of technology -- It shall be the duty of every employer to establish the hours when employees are not supposed to send or answer work-related e-mails, texts, or calls. The employer shall determine the conditions and exemptions therefrom, subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Labor and Employment may provide"&lt;/blockquote&gt;This bill has already begun to take effect. In February 2017 the Department of Labour and Employment in the Philippines stated that employees have a right to disconnect from work after hours by disregarding work-related communications without facing discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/workers-right-disconnect-dole/310057/|title=Workers have right to ‘disconnect’ - DOLE - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has received the support of the General Alliance of Workers Association (GAWA), a labour group in the Philippines. GAWA particularly supports the amendment to Article 48 calling it undeclared labour. GAWA cited the dangers of constant connection as a reason why the bill should pass, referring to the risk of burning or physical and mental stress caused by inability to rest. Additionally they pointed out that employers would see benefits as their employees would be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/business/2017/02/03/labor-group-supports-workers-right-disconnect-523687|title=Labor group supports workers’ ‘right to disconnect’|last=Nicavera|first=Erwin P.|date=2017-02-03|work=SunStar|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links to existing international human rights ==
The right to disconnect shares similarities with several preexisting human rights. The most notable of these is the right to rest and leisure found in article 24 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichrp.org/en/article_24_udhr|title=Article 24|website=www.ichrp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right explicitly places limitations on the amount of time people can work for, something that the right to disconnect takes further and places into the modern age. The right to disconnect also crosses into the article 23 of the UDHR, that everyone has the right to work and receive fair remuneration and to join trade unions to protect their interests.

The [[International Labour Organization]] is also a relevant source of measures and rights supplementary to the right to disconnect. A recent study endorsed by the ILO has affirmed the need for workers to be able to disconnect from technology in order to avoid the blurring of the lines between work life and personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_544108/lang--en/index.htm|title=New report highlights opportunities and challenges of expanding telework|date=2017-02-15|access-date=2017-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[corporation]]'s '''share capital'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intracen.org/tfs/docs/glossary/se.htm Glossary on Trade Financing Terms - S] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028181134/http://www.intracen.org/tfs/docs/glossary/se.htm |date=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''capital stock''' (in US English) is the portion of a corporation's [[shareholders' equity|equity]] that has been obtained by the issue of [[share (finance)|share]]s in the corporation to a shareholder, usually for [[cash]]. "Share capital" may also denote the number and types of shares that compose a corporation's share structure.

In a strict [[accounting]] sense, share capital is the nominal value of [[issued shares]] (that is, the sum of their [[par value]]s, as indicated on share certificates). If the allocation price of shares is greater than their par value, as in a rights issue, the shares are said to be sold at a premium (variously called ''[[share premium]]'', ''additional paid-in capital'' or ''paid-in capital in excess of par''). Commonly, the share capital is the total of the aforementioned nominal share capital and the premium share capital. Conversely, when shares are issued below par, they are said to be issued at a discount or part-paid.

Sometimes, shares are allocated in exchange for non-cash consideration, most commonly when corporation A acquires corporation B for shares (new shares issued by corporation A). Here the share capital is increased to the par value of the new shares, and the merger reserve is increased to the balance of the price of corporation B.

In practice, the concept of "par value" has very little meaning, since shares usually represent a [[residual claim]]; they do not endow their owners with a claim toward any fixed sum of money. In some jurisdictions, share par values have been either abolished or made optional, so a corporation can issue shares having no par value. In that case, from an accounting perspective, all of the corporation's share capital is premium.

Besides its meaning in accounting, described above, "share capital" may also describe the number and types of shares that compose a corporation's share structure. A corporation might have an "outstanding share capital" of 500,000 shares (the "structure" usage); it has received for them a total of 2 million dollars, which is the "share capital" in the balance sheet (the accounting usage).

The legal aspects of share capital are mostly dealt with in a jurisdiction's [[corporate law]] system. An example of such an issue is that when a company allocates new shares, it must do so without inequitably [[share dilution|diluting]] its existing shareholders.

==Legal capital==
'''Legal capital''' is a concept used in [[UK company law]], [[EU company law]], and various other [[corporate law]] jurisdictions to refer to the sum of assets contributed to a company by shareholders when they are issued shares. The law often requires that this capital is maintained, and that dividends are not paid when a company is not showing a profit above the level of historically recorded legal capital.

In the UK, a public limited company must have a minimum legal capital of £50,000. There is no such requirement for a private company.

The '''Spanish confiscation''' was the Spanish government's seizure and sale of property, including from the [[Catholic Church]], from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. It was a long historical, economic, and social process beginning with the so-called "Confiscation of Godoy" in 1798—although there was an earlier precedent during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain]]—and ending on 16 December 1924. 

Confiscation consisted of the forced expropriation of land and property from the "[[mortmain]]s" (i.e., the Catholic Church and [[religious order]]s, which had accumulated it from grants, [[will and testament|wills]], and [[intestate]]s) and from municipalities. The government then sold the property on the market or through [[Public auction|public auctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=El Marco Politico de la Desamortizacion en España |author= Francisco Tomás y Valiente | year = 1972 | pages = 44 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon occurred in other countries, such as [[Mexico]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in [[Mexico]], the ''Law of confiscation of the rural and urban properties of the civil and religious corporations of Mexico'', nicknamed the [[lerdo law]], was issued on 25 June 1856 by President [[Ignacio Comonfort]]. [http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1856_149/Ley_Lerdo_Ley_de_desamortizaci_n_de_bienes_de_la_i_247.shtml] 500 years of Mexico in documents: Lerdo Law. Law of confiscation of properties of the church and corporations&lt;/ref&gt; 

The principal goal in Spain was to obtain money to pay off the public debt securities, known as ''vales reales,'' that the state issued to finance itself. The government also hoped to increase national wealth, to create a [[bourgeoisie]] and a middle class of farmers who owned the lands they cultivated, and to foster [[Capitalism|capitalist]] conditions (e.g., [[privatization]] and a strong financial system) so that the state could collect more taxes. Confiscation was one of the political weapons with which Spanish [[liberalism|liberals]] modified the system of ownership of the [[Ancien Régime]] during the first half of the 19th century.

== Confiscation in the Ancien Régime ==

=== Proposals of Olavide and Jovellanos ===
[[File:Pablo Olavide.jpg|thumb| A portrait of [[Pablo de Olavide]] by Juan Moreno Tejada, painted before 1805.]]
Officials attributed the struggles of Spanish agriculture during the Ancien Régime to the amount of [[Amortization|amortized]] property held by the "mortmains" (primarily the Church and municipalities). These lands were generally poorly cultivated and remained outside the market because they were [[Alienation (property law)|inalienable]]—that is, they could not be sold, mortgaged or given away. This led to an increase in the price of "free" land, and the amortized property was not taxable because of the [[privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]] of its owners.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 12-15}} In a report in 1787, [[José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca|José Moñino]], the 1st Count of Floridablanca and minister to [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], complained of "major damages of the amortization".{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 15}}

[[Pablo de Olavide]] and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] both proposed selling disused [[Solar (Spanish term)|solars]]: uncultivated and uninhabited municipal lands that were generally used as pasture for cattle.

Olavide viewed the protection given to livestock as a cause of agricultural backwardness and argued that "all the lands should be put to work". Under his proposal, disused solars would be sold mainly to the rich, because they had the means to cultivate the land, with a smaller number reserved for farmers who had two pairs of oxen. The proceeds would be used to establish a provincial [[Savings bank (Spain)|savings bank]] that would provide funds for public works such as roads, canals and bridges.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 16-18}}
[[File:Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos by Goya (1798).jpg|thumb| left|[[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], portrayed by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]].]]Jovellanos's proposal was much more radical, because unlike Olavide—who called for the sale only of disused solars, thereby respecting municipal resources—he suggested privatizing "council lands", including municipal properties that brought in tax revenue. Jovellanos, a fervent supporter of [[economic liberalism]], defended the "free and absolute" sale of these properties, with no distinctions among the potential buyers. Unlike Olavide, he was not worried about the possibility that the land would pass into the hands of a few magnates, because, as noted by [[Francisco Tomás y Valiente]], he considered the "liberation" of disused solars and council lands to be "a good in itself". Jovellanos's ideas, which were widely disseminated through his 1795 ''Report on Agrarian Law'', influenced the liberals who launched the confiscations of the 19th century much more than Olavide's proposals, which were not as well publicized.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 20-23}}

Olavide and Jovellanos did not advocate the confiscation of Church property, but they suggested limiting, by peaceful means, the acquisition of more land for ecclesiastical institutions. This proposal was rejected by the Church and by most members of the [[Council of Castile|Royal Council]] when it was put to a vote in June 1766. Two leaflets defending it were included in the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]: ''Report on Agrarian Law'' (1795), by Jovellanos, and ''Treaty of the Royalty Payment of Amortization'' (1765), by [[Pedro Rodríguez, Count of Campomanes]].{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 23-31}}

=== Charles III ===
In an effort to quell the [[Esquilache Riots]] in the spring of 1766, the [[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]-[[intendente]] of [[Badajoz]] ordered the renting of city property to "needy neighbors", with priority given to [[day labor]]ers who could work the land. The [[Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, 10th Count of Aranda|10th Count of Aranda]], newly appointed by Charles III, extended the measure by royal decree to all of [[Extremadura]] on 2 May 1766, and to the whole kingdom the following year. A subsequent order in 1768 explained that the measure was intended to serve the poorest farmers and laborers, to promote the "common good".{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 31-32}} However, the measure was repealed on 26 May 1770. 

Strictly speaking, this measure was not a confiscation, because the land in question was not sold; it was leased and remained the property of the municipalities. The royal decree that replaced it prioritized leases "to the laborers of one, two and three yokes", thus abandoning the initial social purpose. To justify the change, the government alluded to "problems that have followed in the practice of the various provisions issued earlier about distribution of lands", referring to the fact that many laborers and poor peasants who had received plots of lands had been unable to cultivate them properly and lacked the means to pay the censuses, since the original decree was not accompanied by loans. 

Olavide—who had openly criticized the first measures because he believed the beneficiaries lacked the means to put the land to full use—went on to direct projects in [[Andalusia]] and the [[Sierra Morena]] region, in which settlers received enough money to begin to cultivate the land they were granted, and were initially exempt from taxes and censuses.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 34-36}}

As Francisco Tomás y Valiente noted, the actions of Charles III were driven more by economic concerns (the need to farm uncultivated land) than by a desire for social reform. However, they were connected to a wider goal of reforming Spain's agricultural economy.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 36-37}}

=== Confiscation of Godoy ===
During the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], in September 1798, the Confiscation of Godoy was launched by [[Mariano Luis de Urquijo]] and Miguel Cayetano Soler, the Secretary of the Treasury (who had held that position during the government of [[Manuel Godoy]], removed from power six months before).{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 116-117}} Charles IV obtained permission from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to expropriate land belonging to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and other religious entities, including hospitals, hospices and residential colleges. Altogether, the confiscations accounted for one-sixth of the Church's property.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|first=José Antonio|last=Escudero|title=Curso de historia del derecho|location=Madrid|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Tomás y Valiente called the Confiscation of Godoy a turning point in linking confiscation to the problems of public debt, unlike the approach taken by Charles III, who presented confiscation as a way to reform (to a very limited extent) the agrarian economy. The subsequent liberal confiscations of the 19th century continued the approach of the Confiscation of Godoy, not that of Charles III.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 46-47}}

== Confiscation in the 19th century ==

=== Joseph Bonaparte (1808–13) ===
On 18 August 1809, [[Joseph Bonaparte]] ordered the removal of "all regular, monastic, mendicant and clerical Orders", whose assets would automatically belong to the nation. Many religious institutions were thus dissolved with no consideration of [[canon law]]. 

Bonaparte also ordered a lesser confiscation, which did not seize property, but rather the income derived from property. The money went to support the French troops in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. This confiscation ended in 1814.&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite journal|first1=F. |last1=Tomás y Valiente |last2=Donézar|first2=J|last3=Rueda|first3=G|last4=Moro|first4=J M|title=La desamortización|journal=Cuadernos historia|volume=16|issue=8|year=1985|isbn=84-85229-76-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cortes de Cádiz (1810–14) ===
[[File:José Canga Argüelles (Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando).JPG|thumb|[[José Canga Argüelles]], portrayed by José Cabana.]]
In March 1811, the deputies of the [[Cádiz Cortes|Cortes de Cádiz]] (the Spanish national assembly) recognized the huge debt accumulated in the form of ''vales reales'' during the reign of Charles IV—a debt that the acting treasury secretary, [[José Canga Argüelles]], estimated to be 7 billion reales. After rejecting the argument that the ''vales reales'' should only be recognized for their market value—which was well below their [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal value]], and would have bankrupted the holders and made it impossible to obtain new loans—the Cortes de Cádiz approved a proposal made by Argüelles. The proposal called for the confiscation of certain goods from the mortmains, which would then be auctioned. Two-thirds of the auction price would go toward the payment of national debt securities, which included the ''vales reales'' of the previous reign as well as new "notes of liquidated credit", which were issued from 1808 on to defray the expenses of the [[Peninsular War|War of Spanish Independence]]. The remainder of the auction proceeds was dedicated to the payment of interest and the capital of the national debt.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 48-52}}

A decree on 4 January 1813 called for the confiscation of all disused solars in order to provide "relief" to non-landowning citizens and "an award for the meritorious defenders of the homeland". To achieve three purposes at once—fiscal, patriotic and social—it divided the confiscated property in half. The first portion would be sold at auction, and the proceeds used to pay the national debt. The second would be divided into lots of land to be given for free to people who had served in the war, and for a fee to landless citizens. If the latter recipients failed to pay the fee, they lost the assigned lot, which diminished the social aim proclaimed in the decree.

In a decree on 13 September 1813, which included the Argüelles proposal, the term "national goods" was applied to the properties that were to be confiscated. The targets of the confiscation included supporters of Manuel Godoy, the French, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and four Spanish [[Military order (monastic society)|military orders]] (the [[Order of Santiago]], [[Order of Alcántara]], [[Order of Calatrava]] and [[Order of Montesa]]); the convents and monasteries suppressed or destroyed during the war; the farms of the Crown, except sites intended for the service and recreation of the king; and half of the disused municipal solars.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 52}} This decree was never carried out because of the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] and the [[absolute monarchy|absolute state]], according to Francisco Tomás y Valiente, but it established the legal principles and mechanisms of subsequent confiscations.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 53-54}}

=== Trienio Liberal (1820–23) ===
In 1820, after the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]] was restored, the [[Trienio Liberal]] once again faced the problem of the national debt, which had not been resolved during six years of absolutist rule (1814–20). On 9 August 1820, the new courts revalidated the Cortes de Cádiz's decree of 13 September 1813, but added properties obtained in the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to the list of confiscation targets. The new decree differed from previous ones in that it measured ''vales reales'' by their nominal value, which was much higher than the market value.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 66-67}}

Because the market value of debt securities was so low compared with their nominal value, the cash paid by buyers was much lower than the appraised price—in some cases, less than 15 percent of the nominal value. As a result, in 1823, some deputies proposed suspending the confiscation decree and the delivering ownership of the properties in question to their tenants. One of these deputies declared that "the farms have been taken over by rich capitalists, and these, once they have taken possession of them, have made a new lease, generally increasing the rent to the poor farmer, threatening to spoil if they do not pay on time". But despite the criticism, the confiscation process continued unchanged.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 69}}

By an order of 8 November 1820 (which would be replaced by another decree on 29 June 1822), the Trienio revived the Cortes de Cádiz's decree of 4 January 1813 on the sale of unused lands and goods from the municipalities.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 67-68}} A decree on 1 October 1820 also included ecclesiastical confiscation, which the Cortes de Cádiz had not addressed. This decree concerned the monasteries of the monastic orders; the [[Canons Regular|regular canons]] of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], [[Order of Saint Augustine|St. Augustine]] and the [[Premonstratensians]]; the convents and colleges of the military orders, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Orders of [[John of God|Saint John of God]] and the [[Bethlehemite Brothers]]; and "all other hospitals of any kind". Their goods and immovable properties were "applied to the public credit" as "national assets" subject to immediate confiscation. A few days later, on 11 October 1820, a law was issued prohibiting real estate purchases by mortmains, a measure first advocated in the 18th century by Rodríguez and Jovellanos.{{sfnp|Tomás y Valiente|1972|p= 70-71}}

=== Confiscation of Mendizábal (1836–37) ===
[[File:Juan Álvarez Mendizábal.jpg|thumb|220px|Prime Minister [[Juan Álvarez Mendizábal]].]]
{{Main article|Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal}}
[[Juan Álvarez Mendizábal]] (prime minister of [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Queen Regent Maria Christina]]) and [[Pascual Madoz]] (finance minister of [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabel II]]) were responsible for the two most important liberal confiscations.&lt;ref name=B /&gt; The 1836 [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|Ecclesiastical Confiscation of Mendizábal]], in particular, had major consequences for the economic and social history of Spain.

The division of land was entrusted to municipal committees, which took advantage of their power to create large lots that were affordable only for very wealthy oligarchs.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Small farmers could not enter competitive bids, and the land was bought by nobles and the urban bourgeoisie, preventing the development of a true middle class that could pull Spain out of stagnation.&lt;ref name="propietarios"&gt;{{cite web|author=Historias Siglo XX|title=Evolución económica y social. El arranque del movimiento obrero (1833–1875)|url=http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/10d-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the confiscation applied only to regular clergy members, the Church decided to [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] both the sellers and buyers of the land. As a result, most people chose not to buy lots directly. Instead, they made their purchases through intermediaries or [[strawperson]]s.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

=== Confiscation of Espartero (1841) ===
On 2 September 1841, the newly appointed regent, [[Baldomero Espartero]], ordered the confiscation of the estates of the Church and religious orders, with a bill authored by the finance minister, Pedro Surra Rull. The law was repealed three years later.

In 1845, during the [[Década moderada|Moderate Decade]], the government tried to restore relations with the Church, leading to the signing of the [[Concordat of 1851]].

=== Confiscation of Madoz (1855) ===

During the ''[[bienio progresista]]'' period (at the forefront of which were Espartero and [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan|Leopoldo O'Donnell]]), Finance Minister Madoz carried out a new confiscation, which was executed with greater control than Mendizábal's. The order was published in ''La Gaceta de Madrid'' on 3 May 1855, and the instruction to carry it out was given on 31 May. It included the lands and censuses of the state; of the clergy; of the military orders of Santiago, Alcántara, Montesa and St. John of Jerusalem; of [[Confraternity|confraternities]], sanctuaries and shrines; of a former [[infante]], [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]]; and of the mortmains. The religious schools and hospitals of St. John of God were exempt because they reduced government spending in these areas. 

Confiscation had long been a subject of confrontation between conservatives and liberals, but there came a time when all political parties recognized the need to put idle assets to use in order to promote Spain's economic development. The application of the Madoz law was suspended on 14 October 1856 but resumed two years later, on 2 October 1858, when O'Donnell was president of the Council of Ministers. The changes of government did not affect the auctions, which continued until the end of the century. 

Although the Confiscation of Mendizábal has received more attention from historians because of its duration and societal repercussions, the Confiscation of Madoz involved far more sales.&lt;ref name=C /&gt; In 1867, 198,523 rural properties and 27,442 urban properties were sold. The state collected 7,856,000,000 reales between 1855 and 1895, almost twice that obtained in the Confiscation of Mendizábal. The money went mainly toward the budget deficit, public debt repayment and public works, with 30 million reales per year reserved for the "reconstruction and repair" of certain churches. 

The Madoz law has been called a civil confiscation, but this is a misnomer. A large number of farms that had been the common property of the people were, in fact, auctioned, but many more of the properties that were sold had belonged to the Church, and especially to the [[secular clergy]]. Nonetheless, the confiscation of farms belonging to rural Spaniards who depended heavily on them condemned millions to emigration and [[proletarianization]] in cities. Of all the property auctioned off, it is estimated that 35% belonged to the Church, 15% to charity and 50% to municipalities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} 

The Municipal Statute of 1924, pushed by [[José Calvo Sotelo]], repealed confiscation laws and thus ended the Confiscation of Madoz.

== Consequences ==

=== Social ===
At the time of the confiscations, Spain could be roughly divided into a southern area with a predominance of [[Latifundium|large estates]] and a northern area of small and medium-size farms. According to the historian [[Richard Herr]], one result of the confiscations was that the demographics of the two regions diverged dramatically based on the size of the lots put up for auction, and the structure of land ownership changed.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rK2a0vi9IK4C&amp;pg=PA144 Richard Herr: ''Contemporary Spain'', Marcial Pons, Ediciones de Historia S.A., Madrid, 2004], {{ISBN|84-95379-75-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Small lots were typically bought by the inhabitants of nearby villages, while larger lots were acquired by rich Spaniards who lived in cities, often far away.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; In the south, very few small farmers had the financial resources to bid for the large estates, which reinforced the region's [[Feudalism|landlordism]]. In the north, however, this did not generally happen.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

Another consequence was the privatization of communal properties that had belonged to the municipalities. Many farmers were deprived of resources on which they depended for survival (e.g., firewood and pastures), which fueled the emigration of the rural population to industrialized areas of the country or to the Americas. This migration reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== Religious ===
The confiscations also led to the [[exclaustration]] of thousands of [[Religious (Catholic Church)|religious]] by the government of the [[Count of Toreno]]. The Royal Order of Ecclesiastical Exclaustration of 1835, issued on 25 July, suppressed convents with fewer than twelve professed members. On 8 March 1836, a new decree suppressed virtually all monasteries (with some exceptions, such as [[Piarists]] and Hospitallers), and a decree on 29 July 1837 did the same for female convents (except for the [[Sisters of Charity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Julio Caro Baroja| title = Introducción a una historia contemporánea del anticlericalismo español | year = 1980 | pages = 160–161 | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julio Caro Baroja]] has drawn attention to the figure of the old, exclaustrated priest, who—unlike young men, many of whom joined the [[Carlism|Carlists]] or the [[National Militia (Spain)|National Militia]]—lived "enduring their misery, emaciated, &lt;!--(''deleted the word "enlevitado" cuz has no meanings in my translator)''--&gt;teaching Latin in the schools, or doing other underpaid odd jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Julio Caro Baroja | title = Introducción a una historia contemporánea del anticlericalismo español | year = 1980 | pages = 161 | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in addition to economic consequences, the suppression of the religious orders had a "huge impact on the social history of Spain". Caro Baroja quotes the liberal progressivist Fermín Caballero, who wrote in 1837, shortly after the secularization, that "the total extinction of the religious orders is the most gigantic step Spain has taken in the present time; it is the real act of reform and revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introducción a una historia contemporánea del anticlericalismo español | author = Julio Caro Baroja | year = 2008 | orig-year = 1980 | pages = 159 | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confiscations also changed the appearance of Spain's cities by secularizing them. For example, Salustiano de Olózaga, the [[Basques|Basque]]-born governor of [[Madrid]], tore down 17 convents there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Caro Baroja | author = Julio Caro Baroja | year = 2008 | pages = 160 | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
The confiscations brought in more than 14 trillion reales from auctions, thus improving public finances. They also increased the nation's agricultural productivity and cultivated acreage, and improved and specialized crops through new investment by landowners. In [[Andalusia]], for example, olive and wine production grew considerably. These gains, however, were accompanied by the negative effects of [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="V"&gt;Francisco Tomás y Valiente: ''El proceso de desamortización de la tierra en España'', Agricultura y sociedad, ISSN 0211-8394, Nº 7, 1978, pp. 11-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, most ordinary Spaniards suffered because of the harm done to the [[subsistence economy]] when communal lands that had been used primarily for grazing passed into private hands.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[[Francisco Martí Gilabert]]: ''La desamortización española'', Ediciones Rialp S.A, 2003, {{ISBN|84-321-3450-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural ===
[[File:Museo Bellas Artes Sevilla 20120728.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]] has a large collection of confiscated religious art from convents and monasteries of Seville. The building itself was once a convent.]]

Many paintings (including some [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]) and monastery libraries were sold at low prices and eventually exported to other countries, though many books also went to public libraries or universities. Others fell into private hands and were lost. 

The confiscations left numerous buildings of artistic interest, such as churches and monasteries, to ruin, but others, such as the Church of San Martín in [[Cuéllar]], were preserved as museums or other public institutions.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

=== Political ===
One of the goals of the 19th-century confiscations was to consolidate the liberal regime. However, although the people who bought properties in the north formed a new class of small and medium-size landowners who supported the regime, the goal was undermined by large landowners' acquisition of most of the confiscated lots in southern Spain.&lt;ref name="propietarios" /&gt;

Around half of the lands that were confiscated had belonged to peasants and other rural people, and rural areas still account for 90% of the territory of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs. COAG. Publication of the UAP | title = Población y Sociedad Rural|url=http://www.coag.org/rep_ficheros_web/b930604ec8357cb3e78b977e637bdedf.pdf | date = 12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communal lands supported the peasants' precarious economy, and their confiscation meant the destruction of the peasants' way of life and self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Various authors | title = Iura Vasconiae.

=== Ecological ===
As a result of the confiscations, millions of hectares of forest fell into private hands and were cleared and plowed, causing immense environmental damage that is still visible today. Indeed, the cost of [[reforestation]], ongoing for 70 years, far exceeds what was obtained from the sales.

The confiscations of the 19th century were one of the biggest environmental disasters for the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in centuries. The Confiscation of Madoz, in particular, resulted in the privatization of huge expanses of publicly owned forest. The oligarchs who bought the land paid, for the most part, with wood obtained from it. Much of the deforestation of the Iberian Peninsula occurred at that time, leading to the extinction of many plant and animal species in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Instituto Saavedra Fajardo. www.murciaeduca.es | title = Item 11: The double civil and ecclesiastical confiscation (Isabel II) | url = https://www.murciaeduca.es/iessaavedrafajardo/sitio/upload/Tema_11_LAs_desamortizaciones.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The confiscation of convents contributed to the modernization of Spanish cities, transforming them from cities dominated by religious structures to bourgeois cities with taller buildings and new public spaces. Many former convents became public buildings, including museums, hospitals, offices and barracks. Others were demolished to make room for streets, squares and even multistory car parks. Still others became parishes or, through auctions, passed into private hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Instituto Saavedra Fajardo. www.murciaeduca.es | title = Item 11: The double civil and ecclesiastical confiscation (Isabel II) | url = https://www.murciaeduca.es/iessaavedrafajardo/sitio/upload/Tema_11_LAs_desamortizaciones.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many old landmarks, mainly in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and Madrid, [[:Category:Destroyed landmarks in Spain demolished during the Spanish confiscation period|were demolished]] during or as a consequence of the liberal confiscations.

'''''Stone v. Trump''''' (1:17-cv-02459-MJG) is a lawsuit filed on August 28, 2017 in the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]]. The lawsuit alleges that President [[Donald Trump]]'s ban on [[transgender]] personnel joining the U.S. military violates their [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and [[Due Process Clause|due process]] rights. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) of [[Maryland]] filed the suit on behalf of [[Petty Officer First Class]] Brock Stone, an 11-year veteran of the [[U.S. Navy]], and several other transgender service members.&lt;ref name="sfgate-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=ACLU sues Trump over transgender military ban|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/ACLU-sues-Trump-over-transgender-military-ban-12045392.php|accessdate=August 28, 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 28, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021920/http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/ACLU-sues-Trump-over-transgender-military-ban-12045392.php|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=ACLU sues Trump over transgender military ban|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-aclu-sues-trump-over-transgender-1503932393-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 28, 2017|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Merrit|title=2 Lawsuits Challenge Trump's Ban On Transgender Military Service|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546731931/2-lawsuits-challenge-trumps-ban-on-transgender-military-service|accessdate=August 28, 2017|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|title=ACLU challenges Trump administration’s transgender military ban|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/aclu-challenges-trump-administrations-transgender-military-ban/2017/08/28/f3fb8ffc-8c09-11e7-8df5-c2e5cf46c1e2_story.html|accessdate=August 28, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to President Trump, the suit names as defendants the Secretaries of [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] ([[James Mattis]]), the [[United States Army|Army]] ([[Ryan McCarthy (U.S. Army)|Ryan McCarthy]], acting), the [[United States Navy|Navy]] ([[Richard V.

==Background==
Trump first announced a policy banning transgender people from serving in the military in "any capacity" in a series of tweets on July 26, 2017, stating that allowing such service members would incur "tremendous medical costs and disruption". The decision reversed [[Obama administration]] policy to allow the enlistment of transgender personnel, which was initially approved by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to begin July 1, but was delayed by Defense Secretary Mattis.&lt;ref name="wapo-28aug2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Vogue|first1=Ariane|title=Transgender service members sue over Trump military ban|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/politics/transgender-service-members-military-ban/index.html|accessdate=August 28, 2017|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump issued formal guidance on the ban to the Secretaries of Defense and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] in a memorandum on August 25, 2017.&lt;ref name="wh-25aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/25/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-and-secretary-homeland|accessdate=August 28, 2017|publisher=[[The White House]]|date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The initial complaint was filed on August 28, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of five named and one anonymous transgender personnel either currently serving on active duty or in the National Guard. The complaint cited news articles that "indicate that President Trump's motivations in abruptly announcing a transgender ban were largely political, reflecting a desire to placate legislators and advisers who bear animus and moral disapproval toward men and women who are transgender" and further stated there was "no evidence that this about-face in policy was supported by any study of the issue or any consultation with military officers, DoD [Department of Defense] officials, other military experts, or medical or legal experts".&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-complaint |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

An amended complaint was filed on September 14, noting that one of the named plaintiffs, Staff Sergeant Kate Cole, had been denied medically-indicated surgery on September 8.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc39&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/39-Amended-Complaint.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

In the attached memorandum in support, the Plaintiffs noted that "President Trump’s asserted military justifications have already been studied at length and rejected ''by the military itself''. The Ban reflects a decision to single out a disfavored group and withdraw legal protection based not on evidence but animus, moral disapproval, and crass political calculation." The memorandum also argued that "each day that President Trump’s unconstitutional directive remains in effect, Plaintiffs and their families continue to grapple with the stress and uncertainty of having their careers, their livelihoods, and their medical care jeopardized by a Commander-in-Chief who rejects their service and their sacrifice."&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc40-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/40-P-Mtn-PI.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

The [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division]] (USDOJ) filed a motion to dismiss on October 12, 2017, calling the request for a preliminary injunction "premature several times over" as Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance of September 14, 2017 would prevent involuntary discharge, separation, or denied re-enlistment at least until March 2018.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc52-1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-defendants-memo-support-motion-dismiss-and-opposition-preliminary |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

In response, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed an opposing motion on October 27, 2017 which noted the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, 2017 prohibited the accession (enlistment and commissioning) of transgender people into the military as of January 1, 2018, the funding of "sex-reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel" would cease on March 23, 2018, and the Secretary of Defense was directed to "return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service" which required involuntary discharge of personnel solely on the basis of their transgender status, also on March 23.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc66&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-defendants-memo-support-motion-dismiss-and-opposition-preliminary |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

During this time, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued a partial preliminary injunction to the proposed ban in ''Doe v. Trump'' on October 30. For ''Stone v. Trump'', the Plaintiffs filed a memorandum on October 31, asking to continue consideration of the preliminary injunction as several of the plaintiffs in this case were affected by the ban on medically necessary surgeries implemented by the Presidential Memorandum of August 25.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc74&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/74-P-Supp-Authority-iso-PI-oppn-MTD.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

===Preliminary injunction===
{{quote |text=President Trump’s tweets did not emerge from a policy review, nor did the Presidential Memorandum identify any policymaking process or evidence demonstrating that the revocation of transgender rights was necessary for any legitimate national interest.

===Appeals===
USDOJ filed a notice of appeal on December 5.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc86&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/86-Ds-Notice-of-Appeal.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

This date resulted from the postponement by Secretary Mattis of six months after the initial deadline of July 1, 2017 under the accession plan proposed by [[Ashton Carter|Secretary Carter]] in 2016. USDOJ asked for the clarification to be issued by noon, December 14.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc91 /&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name=17-cv-2398/&gt;{{rp|1;6–7}} The parties had a conference on December 13, confirming that discovery should conclude by April 24, 2018, and the trial or hearing would be held in July 2018.&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc94&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/94-Order-Confirming-Conference.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

On December 14, USDOJ filed an emergency motion for a stay on Judge Garbis's order with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/14/trump-administration-not-done-fight-trans-military-enlistments/ |title=Trump admin not done fighting transgender military enlistments |author=Johnson, Chris |date=14 December 2017 |newspaper=Washington Blade |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency motion used similar language to the emergency motion filed on December 11 with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia|D.C. Circuit]] in ''Doe v. Trump''.&lt;ref name=17-cv-5267-doc1708433&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/trump-trans-military-dc-appeal.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v. Donald J.

Alternatively, the stay could act to narrowly constrain the preliminary injunction to allow the accession of only Seven Ero George, the single Plaintiff in ''Stone v. Trump'' that Judge Garbis ruled had standing to challenge the ban on accessions.&lt;ref name=17-cv-2398&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2017/12/Stone-CA4-Stay-Motion-FINAL-1.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

Plaintiffs followed up with a memorandum of supplemental authority on December 19 after the Pentagon memorandum of December 8 outlining guidance for accession of transgender candidates was introduced in ''Karnoski v. Trump''.&lt;ref name=17-cv-2398-doc23-1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-supplemental-authority-department-defense-memo |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

On December 21, 2017, a panel of three judges on the Fourth Circuit denied USDOJ's emergency motion for a stay on Judge Garbis's order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-transgender/u-s-court-rejects-trump-bid-to-stop-transgender-military-recruits-on-jan-1-idUSKBN1EF2PP |title=US Court Rejects Trump Bid to Stop Transgender Military Recruits on Jan. 1 |author=Chung, Andrew |agency=Reuters |date=22 December 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=17-cv-2398-doc31&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-order-denying-stay |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

===Discovery===
On January 26, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel initial disclosures,&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc105&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/105-Mtn-to-Compel-Initial-Disclosures.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

As in ''Doe v. Trump'', USDOJ moved to dismiss the claims against the President and partially dissolve the preliminary injunction on March 1, 2018, arguing "the President is not a proper defendant in this case" as [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] dictates "the non-ministerial conduct of the President when he acts in his official capacity cannot be enjoined."&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc115&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/115-D-Part-JOTP-and-Mtn-to-Dissolve-PI-in-part-.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

This court has the power to determine whether the President has acted within the law, and to declare that the President violated the law." They added the "Defendants’ argument that the President has absolute immunity from a lawsuit challenging
his own unconstitutional actions is based on little more than sleight-of-hand", noting the USDOJ arguments relied on citing cases where [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] was applied, instead of [[Declaratory judgment|declaratory relief]].&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc117&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/117-P-Oppn-D-Part-JOTP-and-Mtn-to-Dissolve-PI-in-part-.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

===New Trump memorandum===
After President Trump issued [[Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security Regarding Military Service by Transgender Individuals by Donald Trump (March 23, 2018)|a new memorandum on March 23, 2018]], revoking the prior Memorandum of August 25,&lt;ref name=17-cv-02459-doc119&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.eqcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/119-D-Notice-New-Policy.pdf |title=''Stone, et. al. v.

On April 23, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint addressing the new Memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/stone-v-trump-second-amended-complaint|title=''Stone, et. al. v.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] on 22 August 1990. The new constitution would introduce multi-party democracy for the first time since independence, as well as limiting the [[List of heads of state of São Tomé and Príncipe|President]] to two terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/st.html Elections in São Tomé and Príncipe] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 95.3% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M &amp; Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p745 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[São Tomé and Príncipe legislative election, 1991|Parliamentary]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe presidential election, 1991|presidential]] elections were held the following year.

'''The Hague Justice Portal''' (in French: ''''Portail judiciaire de La Haye'''' ) is a website that promotes, and provides greater access to, the institutions, courts and organisations in [[The Hague]], [[The Netherlands]], working in the field of international peace, justice and security. The Portal was officially launched by Her Royal Highness [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]] in The Hague on 6 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/ '''Hague Justice Portal''']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portal is a gateway to the legal activities taking place in The Hague, a city which, in the words of former [[United Nations Secretary-General]], Mr. [[Kofi Annan]], "''amply deserves its reputation as the International City of Peace and Justice''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/presscom/index.php?pr=1005&amp;lg=en&amp;pt=1&amp;p1=6&amp;p2=1/ '''UN Secretary-General''']&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovative project created by the [[Hague Academic Coalition]], the Portal was officially launched in April 2006. In addition to the core legal institutions in The Hague such as the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], the Portal promotes, and provides greater access to, the work and the development of the large number of other international organisations, institutes and research centres based in The Hague, which are relevant to the pursuit of international peace, justice and security.

The management of the Portal was transferred to a committee led by  Philipp Amann on the 1st of March 2014 and a new stream-lined version of the website was created.  The new committee are based in The Hague and have a strong vision for the future of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=13026 Cf. the website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections of the Portal==
The Portal itself comprises five main sections: ‘News and Events’, ‘Projects’, ‘Academic Research’, ‘The Hague’ and ‘Portal’.

'''''News and Events''''': This [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/30.TD0.html/ news section] includes up-to-date information about what happens in the international courts and about their crucial judgments and decisions, issued from official sources and edited by legal experts. The [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/34.TD0.html/ event calendar] announces legal events, conferences, lectures and speeches taking place in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/30.TD0.html/ news section]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/34.TD0.html/ event calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Academic Research''''': This is the focal point of the Portal where court documents, commentaries, articles, press releases and an important bibliography of books are accessible. The [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/5/475.html/ Hague Justice Journal – Journal Judiciaire de La Haye] contains articles and commentaries by expert commentators analysing legal issues, as well as an overview of recent decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/5/475.html/ The Hague Justice Journal – Journal Judiciaire de La Haye]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Projects''''': Currently, the Hague Justice Portal has two specific projects. The first one is undertaken in close collaboration with the '''[[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA)''' for the sake of digitalising a number of the [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/5/251.html/ Court’s historic international arbitral awards] which were previously unavailable in electronic format. The second one is called the [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/6/579.html/ DomCLIC project], which is a pilot for an ever-expanding database of domestic jurisprudence relating to [[international criminal law]] from countries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/5/251.html/ Court’s historic international arbitral awards]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/6/579.html/ DomCLIC project]&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2014, Colette O'Donovan agreed to lead a new project. The Hague Justice Gender Project will focus on raising awareness of issues and events specifically relating to gender in international law.

'''''The Hague''''': This part of the website offers an interesting insight into the city of The Hague. Whether you are a tourist or an expatriate, or consider moving to The Hague, the Portal wishes to guide you in your first steps. Visitors also have access to a [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/56.TD0.html/ vacancy list] of job opportunities in the city, including legal and justice-related employment and internship positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/56.TD0.html/ vacancy list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portal''''': This final section provides information about the [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/73.TD0.html/ Hague Academic Coalition](HAC) to which the Portal pertains. This consortium of institutions that work in the fields of international relations and international law offers their latest publications and research papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/73.TD0.html/ Hague Academic Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception by jurists==
The Portal has already acquired considerable attention from the community of jurists.

Having historical PCA [[arbitration]] awards on line, freely-accessible and in one place, is helpful to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.nl/news/pca_awards_on_hague_justice_portal Institute of Social Studies web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1044 PCA official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904032614/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1044 |date=2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information is also easily available on such important cases as that of [[Slobodan Milošević]], [[Charles G. Taylor]], [[Thomas Lubanga Dyilo]] and [[Vojislav Šešelj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denhaag.com/default.asp?id=4595&amp;ep= Den Haag official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/en/links/useful-links/browse/1.html TrIAl Track Impunity Always web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, persons around the world will be able to monitor ICC [[trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=trialmonitor ICC News web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cornell Law School]]'s web site, a well-used web site for legal research, now links to the Portal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/ForeignLawGuide/default.aspx?id=265 Cornell Law School web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Justice Tribune]], another site for [[International law]] also links to the Portal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justicetribune.com/index.php?page=v2_sites-reference Justice Tribune web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholars so far have used and cited the Portal in their research, one about the [[David Hicks]] case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/viewtopic.php?t=10406 Blog about David Hicks]&lt;/ref&gt; and another about the [[Hariri]] Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblog.leidenuniv.nl/fdr/1948/index.xml Leiden University blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ohio Uniform Traffic Ticket.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States]]: The [[Ohio]] Uniform [[Traffic ticket|Traffic Ticket]] prescribed by the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]] for use in [[moving violation|violation]]s of the traffic code {{pufc|Ohio Uniform Traffic Ticket.jpg}}]] --&gt;

'''Traffic code''' (also '''motor vehicle code''') refers to the collection of local statutes, regulations, ordinances and rules that have been officially adopted in the [[United States]] to govern the orderly operation and interaction of [[motor vehicle]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[pedestrian]]s and others upon the [[public road|public]] (and sometimes [[private road|private]]) [[road|ways]].  

The traffic code generally includes provisions relating to the establishment of [[authority]] and enforcement procedures, statement of the [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]], and other safety provisions.  Administrative regulations for [[driver license|driver licensing]], vehicle ownership and [[Registry of Motor Vehicles|registration]], [[insurance]], vehicle safety [[inspection]]s and [[parking violation]]s may also be included, though not always directly related to driving safety.  Violations of traffic code (i.e., a "[[moving violation]]") are often dealt with by forfeiting a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] in response to receiving a valid citation ("getting a [[Ticket (notification)|ticket]]").  Other violations, such as [[drunk driving]] or vehicular [[homicide]] are handled through the [[Criminal law|criminal]] courts, although there may also be [[lawsuit|civil]] and administrative cases that arise from the same violation (including payment of [[damages]] and loss of driving privileges).  In some jurisdictions there is a separate [[Code Enforcement|code-enforcement]] branch of government that handles illegal parking and other non-moving violations (e.g., noise and other emissions, illegal equipment).  Elsewhere, there may be multiple overlapping [[police]] agencies patrolling for violations of state or federal driving regulations.

==US==

In 1949, US is involved in the treaty named [[Convention sur la circulation routière]] (Genève, 19 September 1949) in the goal to «establishing certain uniform rules». Such treaty defines for instance dimension of vehicles: 2m50 or 8 feet 20 and in the other side 3m80 or 12 feet 50&lt;ref&gt;
treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20125/v125.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt; or a model of driving permit (USA ratification 30 August 1950). It also assumes existence of national legislation in this domain.

In the [[United States]] each state has its own traffic code, although most of the rules of the road are similar for the purpose of uniformity, given that all states grant reciprocal driving privileges (and [[Traffic Violations Reciprocity|penalties]]) to each other's licensed drivers.  There is also a "[[Uniform Vehicle Code]]" which has been proposed by a private, non-profit group, based upon input by its members.  As with many such offerings, some states adopt selected portions as written, or else with modifications, and others create their own versions.  Similarly, most states have adopted relevant standards for signs and signals, based upon the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  Many of the standard rules of the road involve consistent interpretation of the standard signs and signals, such as what to do when approaching a stop sign, or the driving requirements imposed by a [[double yellow line]] on the street or highway.  Many federal departments have also adopted their own traffic code for enforcement on their respective reservations (e.g., national parks, military bases).

List of some standard Rules of the Road:
*Entering and leaving roadways.
*[[Traffic#Right of way|Right of way]] at marked and unmarked [[intersection (road)|intersections]] under various conditions.
*Observing and interpreting [[traffic sign]]s (especially [[warning signs|warning]], [[priority signs|priority]] or [[prohibitory traffic sign]]s)
*Keeping to right side (or left side) except to pass others, where passing is allowed.
*Direction of travel and turning (one way, do not enter, no [[U-turn (maneuver)|U-turn]], etc.)
*Speed, height, width and weight limits.
*Bicycle and pedestrian priority.
*Yielding to special vehicles (emergency, funeral, school bus).
*Vehicle [[lighting]] and [[traffic signal|signalling]].
*Stopping if there has been a [[collision]].

Georgia’s new law which took effect from July 01, 2018 prohibits the drivers from holding any devices ([[Mobile phone|Mobile phones]] or any [[electronic devices]]) in hand while driving. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fox5atlanta.com/good-day/hands-free-options-for-obeying-the-distracted-driving-law|title=Hands-free options for obeying the distracted driving law|last=FOX|work=WAGA|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside US ==
Most countries define a national legislation relative to car driving and penalties. Most of those regulation have some common basis to help people driving from one country to one other: [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] and [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] have helped this harmonization effort.

Road, driving and traffic regulations are the subject to specific [[codification (law)|codification of the law]] in countries such as:
* Austria: ''{{lang|de|Straßenverkehrsordnung}}''
* Brasil: ''{{lang|pt|Código de Trânsito Brasileiro}}'', basis is Vienna convention
* Canada and Québec: L.R.Q., chapitre C-24.2 {{lang|fr|[[:fr:Code de la sécurité routière (Québec)|Code de la sécurité routière]]}}
* Canada and Manitoba: the ''{{lang|fr|Codification Permanente des Lois du Manitoba}}'' contains a legislation named 'Highway Traffic Act'' translated as ''{{lang|fr|Code de la route}}'' in French (chaptre H 060).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/h060f.php |title=Code de la route |publisher=Web2.gov.mb.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco, the law «loi n°52-05 portant code de la route» deals with a new traffic code, approved on 14 January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtpnet.gov.ma/MET_New/Fr/MenuServices/code+de+la+route/Textes+Juridiques/La+loi+52.05+relative+au+code+de+la+route.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221050838/http://www.mtpnet.gov.ma/MET_New/Fr/MenuServices/code+de+la+route/Textes+Juridiques/La+Loi+52.05+relative+au+code+de+la+route.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-02-21 |title=Ministère de l'Equipement et du Transport |publisher=Mtpnet.gov.ma |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2011-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted on 11 February 2010 (26 safar 1431).

&lt;!--
La [[Réglementation de la circulation routière en Allemagne|réglementation routière en Allemagne]] est définie par plusieurs lois, notamment Straßenverkehrs-Ordnung et Straßenverkehrsgesetz; elle y est connue sous le nom de stvo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://guide.munich-french-connection.net/R%C3%A8glementation_routi%C3%A8re_en_Allemagne&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In Belgium this regulation is not a code although it is road traffic specific. It is defined by ''Koninklijk besluit houdende algemeen reglement op de politie van het wegverkeer en van het gebruik van de openbare weg. [KB. 09.12.1975]''.

In Switzerland, this legislation is not considered as code it is legislation number 741.01.

In United Kingdom there is no codification. Some piece of laws such as a Road Traffic Act and a  Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions do exist; a book named [[Highway Code]] is edited by public entity with guidelines based and/or compatible with local law.

In European Union federal level, legislation is more oriented on transport competition and not on sharing the road. There is some effort oriented to issues such as driving license and car control.

Due to his political views and personal style, Alksnis was nicknamed "the Black Colonel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Remnick |first=David |authorlink=David Remnick |title=Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ84S-QRNXYC&amp;hl=en&amp;pgis=1 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |year=1994 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn=978-0-679-75125-0 |oclc=29389418 |quote=With his high black pompadour and black leather jacket, Alksnis was known in the liberal press as the "black colonel," the Darth Vader of the hard-line set. |page=385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCauley |first=Martin |title=Who's Who in Russia Since 1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4A6rFD_AXOEC&amp;hl=en |accessdate=28 November 2008 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London; New York |isbn=978-0-415-13898-7 |oclc=35593895 |quote=He acquired the sobriquet the 'black colonel'[.] |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Senn |first=Alfred Erich |authorlink=Alfred E.

==Family history==
In the 1930s, Alksnis's grandfather, [[Yakov Alksnis]] ({{lang-lv|Jēkabs Alksnis}}) was the head of the Soviet Air Force. He also took part in the military tribunal for the [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization]], which sentenced [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and other high-ranking Soviet officers to death on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s order. However, only eight months later, Yakov Alksnis himself was also arrested and executed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Alksnis's grandmother spent 14 years in labor camps and his father was discriminated for being the son of an "enemy of the people".&lt;ref&gt;"Hardliner helped topple leading Soviet reformers; Viktor Alksnis influential as Kremlin turns to right" in ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 12, 1991, p. E11&lt;/ref&gt;

During the destalinization of late 1950s Yakov Alksnis was posthumously rehabilitated; the Air Forces college in Riga was named in his honour. Despite these Stalin-era persecutions of his family members, Viktor Alksnis became a staunch supporter of the Soviet political system.

In 1973 Alksnis graduated from the Riga Higher Military Aviation Engineering School named for his grandfather as a qualified military radio engineer.&lt;ref name="NV"/&gt;

Alksnis's Latvian heritage was the subject of slander allegations in 2007 involving comments on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Илья |last= Азар |script-title=ru:ЖЖ-лузер |url= http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/03/06/oa_233283.shtml |work= Газета.Ru |date= 2007-03-06 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viktor Alksnis was a strong opponent of the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] and of the independence of the [[Baltic States]]. He claims that the Baltic states are [[apartheid]] regimes, that the Russian population in these states suffers repression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1989 he was elected into the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1990 he was elected to the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]]. In 1990, he was one of the founders of a hard-line group "[[Soyuz (faction)|Soyuz]]" within the USSR Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoover Institution]] [http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3439296.html ''Policy Review'' - "Shevardnadze's Journey"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083515/http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3439296.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He once proposed the ousting of Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] from power, dissolving the parliament, outlawing all parties, the declaration of [[martial law]] and the handing of power to a Military "Committee of National Salvation", which would avoid the disintegration of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;"Mayday for the USSR", in ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', May 3, 1991, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Colonel Urges Shifting of Rule From Gorbachev", in ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 17, 1990, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

He has described the internationally non-recognized  [[Transnistria|Transnistrian Republic]] as the base from which the restoration of the Soviet Union would begin.&lt;ref&gt;John Mackinlay and Peter Cross (editors), ''Regional Peacekeepers: The Paradox of Russian Peacekeeping'', United Nations University Press, 2003, p. 137. {{ISBN|92-808-1079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years Alksnis claimed to be a principal figure behind the [[Riga]] [[OMON]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://v-alksnis2.livejournal.com/11620.html#cutid1 Viktor Alksnis's blog on LiveJournal]&lt;/ref&gt; known for opposing the secession of Latvia from the USSR and actions such as the [[Soviet OMON assaults on Lithuanian border posts]].

He was designated [[persona non grata]] in Latvia after he left the country in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfromrussia.com/cis/2002/10/01/37547.html "Viktor Alksnis: Latvia's Fate Decided in Russia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091813/http://newsfromrussia.com/cis/2002/10/01/37547.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}, in ''[[Pravda]]'', 1 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time he  has taken part in Russian politics, representing left-wing and nationalist positions. Alksnis was one of the leaders of the [[National Salvation Front (Russia)|National Salvation Front]] that united nationalist and communist movements that opposed Yeltsin's policies. In 2005, he was named ''persona non grata'' in [[Ukraine]] as well, after he called for a Russian-Ukrainian border revision while speaking at a rally in [[Simferopol]], [[Crimea]].

==Free software advocacy campaign==
[[File:Ponosov and Alksnis.JPG|200px|thumb|Alexander Ponosov and Viktor Alksnis]]

In 2007, Alksnis launched a campaign to promote the use of [[Free Software]] such as the [[Linux]] operating system in Russian state institutions to secure software independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v-alksnis2.livejournal.com/77904.html#cutid1 Виктор Имантович Алкснис - CNews Форум 2007 "Информационные технологии завтра"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osp.ru/pcworld/2007/08/4388326/ Нужна ли России своя операционная система?

In February 2008 he joined forces with [[Aleksandr Ponosov]], a school teacher accused of [[software piracy]], to form Center of Free Technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centercest.ru/ Official site of the Center of Free Technology] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit initiative which will research methods of usage of [[Free Software]] in the [[Ministry of Education (Russia)|Russian education system]].

Alksnis has met with project coordinator Aleksey Bragin to promote the development of the [[ReactOS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v-alksnis2.livejournal.com/32900.html Виктор Имантович Алкснис - Знакомство с проектом ReactOS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also invited [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the [[GNU]] project and [[Free Software Foundation]] to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securitylab.ru/news/306059.php Депутат Алкснис пригласил Ричарда Столлмана в Москву - SecurityLab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit however was canceled by Stallman due to the controversy surrounding Alksnis.

==Views on global politics==
In 2006, Alksnis said in an interview that [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] are enemies of [[Iran]]'s peaceful nuclear program, and their hostile attitude towards Iran is an attempt to cover-up the United States' mistakes in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060415/2006041502.html "Duma member: US, Israel enemies of Iran nuclear program"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930220216/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060415/2006041502.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WAP billing''' is a mechanism for consumers to buy content from [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) sites that is charged directly to their mobile phone bill. It is an alternative payment mechanism to debit or credit cards and premium SMS for billing.&lt;ref name="New Media Age, July 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.co.uk/news/ericsson-ipx-puts-wap-purchases-on-phone-bill/28421.article |title=New Media Age, July 2006 |publisher=Nma.co.uk |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118891713.html |title=New Media Age, June 2004 |publisher=Highbeam.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using WAP billing, consumers can buy mobile content without registering for a service or entering a username or password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200602/ai_n16063017/ |title=BNET, February 2006 |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user clicks on a link and agrees to make a purchase, after which they can download content.

WAP billing is particularly associated with downloading mobile entertainment content like ringtones, mobile games and wallpapers. Some commentators have suggested it could compete with Premium SMS as a leading payment channel for mobile content.&lt;ref name="highbeam2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mobinode2006"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gang Lu |url=http://www.mobinode.com/2006/03/31/premium-sms-billing-vs-wap-billing/ |title=Mobinode, March 2006 |publisher=Mobinode.com |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mobile-ent1"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Stuart |url=http://www.mobile-ent.biz/features/94/Bill-it-and-they-will-come |title=Mobile Entertainment, August 22 |publisher=Mobile-ent.biz |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How WAP billing works==
WAP billing works with WAP-enabled mobile phones over a [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] or [[3G]] wireless connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1018738/ericsson-still-likes-the-wap-word |title=The Inquirer, July 2006 |publisher=Theinquirer.net |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customer initiates a WAP session with the content service provider by browsing a WAP page, for example.&lt;ref name="mobinode2006"/&gt; The WAP site hoster obtains the visitor’s [[MSISDN]] without the visitor having to register on a specific WAP gateway or service. This information is provided through integration with the operator's own MSISDN lookup service.

Consumers confirm a purchase by clicking on a ‘confirm purchase’ link on their mobile phone and the WAP billing platform informs the WAP application of the completed purchase transaction. Consumers are redirected to the content they have purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ericsson Launches IPX in UK |url=http://www.mobile-weblog.com/50226711/ericsson_launches_ipx_in_uk.php |title=The Mobile Weblog, July 2006 |publisher=Mobile-weblog.com |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchases are recorded and billed directly via the mobile phone bill using the MSISDN.&lt;ref name="mobinode2006"/&gt;

==Cross-operator WAP billing==
Attempts have been made to create a single, cross-operator WAP billing platform that can support the purchase of products on any mobile network.&lt;ref name="mobile-ent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmaglobal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/ericsson-ipx-first-live-payforit-services-uk |title=Mobile Marketing Association |publisher=Mmaglobal.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mobile-ent2"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Stuart |url=http://www.mobile-ent.biz/features/94/Bill-it-and-they-will-come |title=Mobile Entertainment, August 2008 |publisher=Mobile-ent.biz |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other markets, like Ireland, WAP Billing is available across O2 and Vodafone mobile operators, via MSIDSN forwarding. WAP billing is only available to mobile aggregators operating in the Irish market on a case by case, business model basis, unlike the UK market.

==Benefits of WAP billing==
The benefits cited for WAP Billing include the ability to sell to minors who lack a credit card or bank account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmforum.org/Community/groups/revenue_management_group/blog/archive/2009/01/09/billing-on-mobile-emerging-as-new-revenue-stream.aspx |title=TM Forum, September 2009 |publisher=Tmforum.org |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an improved customer experience including ‘Single click’ purchases where&lt;ref name="mobile-ent2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk/2008/09/bango-sees-grow.html |title=Mobile Marketing Magazine, September 2008 |publisher=Mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; transactions are completed without consumers having to send or receive a text message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Stuart |url=http://www.mobile-ent.biz/news/30965/PlayPhone-plugs-into-Ericsson-IPX |title=Mobile Entertainment, July 2008 |publisher=Mobile-ent.biz |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or remember shortcodes.&lt;ref name="mobinode2006"/&gt; It has been claimed that WAP Billing also reduces the possibility of fraud when paying for mobile content.&lt;ref name="mobinode2006"/&gt; Another benefit cited for WAP Billing is the assertion that users experience the same ‘browse and buy’ experience they are used to via their [[Personal Computer|PC]] on the Internet.

==Critique of WAP billing==

WAP billing lacks transparency to the customer. The act of signing a contract, handing out money to a human, reading, understanding and writing or at least typing something and thus also indirectly proving that you are a legitimate customer is reduced to a single touch. Even a child or a pet that occasionally touches the screen may trigger a purchase. Often a customer doesn't notice that they've actually paid for something or bought a subscription, until they look at their phone bill afterwards.

To silently start billing with a single click is very inviting for malicious apps and malicious embedded ads. This misuse of WAP billing is a form of [[clickjacking]].

Once triggered it is hard to stop or cancel a payment. 
Normally there are three entities involved in the claim of the money: 
* Your mobile provider, 
* a payment gateway provider and finally 
* the 3rd party provider that offers its paid service.

Thus, the service is indirectly paid through your phone bill. This makes it more complicated to deny the payment or to claim your money back.

In 2013, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] settled with [[Jesta Digital|Jesta Digital LLC]] concerning unauthorized WAP billing charges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/08/jesta-digital-settles-ftc-complaint-it-crammed-charges-consumers&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
=== Headquarters and offices ===
Xunlei Building, the new headquarters building of Xunlei, is under construction and expected to be completed in 2020. Xunlei Building is located in Shenzhen Nanshan District, adjacent to Shenzhen Metro Line 1 and Line 2. The building has 30 floors, and the total construction area of the building is about 65,000 square meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=迅雷大厦深圳奠基 打造多功能总部基地|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/114749674_114822|website=Sohu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and criticisms ==
=== LinkToken ===
LinkToken is one kind of virtual token&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/e3f6396e-5449-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Xunlei, and this token must be obtained through the sharing of user's network bandwidth, storage space or other resources. Xunlei said this token can be used to pay for network acceleration services, cloud storage services and other internet content. The company explained that the digital token would allow transparent bookkeeping for the computing resources that users share on the company's cloud platform. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/xunlei-ceo-on-class-action-lawsuits-at-boao-forum-for-asia.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On account of the prohibition of virtual currency trading and [[Initial coin offering|ICO]] in China, Xunlei declare that LinkToken does not constitute an ICO and it cannot be purchased or traded in cash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OneCoin Constitutes ICO, Says It Cannot Be Purchased or Traded in Cash|url=https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/xunlei-denies-blockchain-product-onecoin-constitutes-ico-says-it-cannot-be-purchased-or-traded|website=yicaiglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the company has issued lawyer's letters to third-party trading platforms, requiring them to stop LinkToken trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=急发律师函 迅雷叫停玩客币交易行为|url=http://epaper.bjbusiness.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2017-11/06/content_384468.htm?div=-1|website=北京商报}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the trading price of the token still rose 30 times in a month on some unofficial trading platforms, and some critics assert that the token is too speculative and may face some regulatory risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=迅雷玩客币半月涨价30倍 矿主囤货炒作|url=http://www.21jingji.com/2017/11-2/4MMDEzODFfMTQxOTQ4MQ.html|website=21经济网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2018, Xunlei  entered into a strategic partnership with Newland Hi-Tech Group Co., Ltd. In connection with the Strategic Partnership, Xunlei also entered into a series of transactions with Beijing LinkChain Co., Ltd., an associated company of Newland, to transfer the exclusive right to operate LinkToken program within mainland China, including without limitation, the formulation, amendment and execution of the rules governing the rewarding of LinkToken to users, LinkToken Pocket and the LinkToken Mall, and the related assets and liabilities to Beijing LinkChain (the “Transfer”). Upon the completion of this Transfer, Xunlei will cease operating the LinkToken program within mainland China. This Transfer will allow Xunlei to put more focus on research and development of the underlying blockchain technology and infrastructure, such as ThunderChain and ThunderChain File System (TCFS). &lt;ref&gt;http://ir.xunlei.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xunlei-announces-strategic-partnership-newland-hi-tech-group-and&lt;/ref&gt;

=== File sharing ===
Xunlei is different from [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] tools in that it does not support active file sharing. While copyright advocates view Xunlei as a P2P tool that facilitates copyright violation, P2P advocates criticize Xunlei as a [[leech (computing)|leech]] with much more downloading than [[upload|uploading]]. Also it is often observed that Xunlei prioritizes file sharing with Xunlei users rather than other client users. Many pure P2P tools have blocked Xunlei, although this trend weakened after Xunlei began balancing the number of downloads and uploads. 

Xunlei sets up its own storage servers to backup the files which are not active or shared any longer. This feature is named as High-Speed Channel and allows Xunlei users retrieve data faster than others. But only paying users have access to these servers and download files.
