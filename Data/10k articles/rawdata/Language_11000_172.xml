An '''administrative proceeding''' is a ''non-judicial'' determination of fault or wrongdoing and may include, in some cases, penalties of various forms.  They are typically conducted by government or military institutions.

In a military setting, a "Captain's Mast", held by a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy unit is one such administrative proceeding. As a consequence of the proceeding, the commander may impose [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]] upon members of the command.

Various other administrations of government (for example, a department regulating motor vehicles, air pollution, forestry practices, or real estate sales agents) may impose fines or revocation of permits or licenses upon persons or [[corporation]]s for acts of [[Act of commission|commission]] or [[Act of omission|omission]] found to be violating operating, permitting, reporting, or other rules. Such rules are typically formulated in the ''specific'' by the administrative authority under ''general authority'' established and limited by ''[[statute]]''.

There may be additional paths of judicial appeal in some cases, provided all appeal paths internal to the administrative group have been exhausted., In general, such appeals are usually not based on the determination of fact (unless relevant evidence was not allowed to be presented), but rather on some legal theory that the administrative body exceeded its statutory authority, or that the administrative body did not follow its own established rules of procedure, or that the authorising statute itself or the subsequently derived rules are defective in some way, for example by being an [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] infringement of some constitutional right. In these cases the case may be [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed to the authority for further examination and determination under the new rules established by the court or the administrative decision may be declared null and void with prejudice.

{{IPA notice}}
[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] has a similar phonology to other [[West Germanic languages]], especially [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

==Vowels==
[[File:Afrikaans vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|[[Monophthong]]s of Afrikaans on a vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Wissing|2012|p=711}}]]

Afrikaans has an extensive [[vowel]] inventory consisting of 17 vowel phonemes, among which there are 10 [[monophthong]]s and 7 [[diphthong]]s. There are also 7 marginal monophthongs.

====The phonetic quality of the close vowels====
* {{IPA|/y/}} tends to be merged with {{IPA|/i/}} into {{IPAblink|i}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=5}}
* {{IPA|/u/}} is weakly rounded and could be more narrowly transcribed as {{IPA|[u̜]}} or {{IPA|[ɯ̹]}}. Thus, it is sometimes transcribed {{IPA|/ɯ/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=5}}

====The phonetic quality of the mid vowels====
* {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː, ɔ, ɔː/}} vary between mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɛ̝ː}}, {{IPA link|ɔ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɔ̝ː}}]}} or close-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|o}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=sections "The unrounded mid-front vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}}" and "The rounded mid-high back vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}}"}}
* According to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the stressed allophone of {{IPA|/ə/}} is actually closer than mid ({{IPAblink|ɪ̈}}).{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=4, 6}} However, other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Le Roux|de Villiers Pienaar|1927}} or {{Harvcoltxt|Wissing|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; do not distinguish between stressed and unstressed schwas. This article uses the symbol {{IPA|[ə]}} regardless of the exact height of the vowel.
* The central {{IPA|/ə, əː/}}, not the front {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː/}} are the unrounded counterparts of {{IPA|/œ, œː/}}.{{sfnp|Swanepoel|1927|p=38}}{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=section "The rounded and unrounded mid-central vowels"}} Phonetically, {{IPA|/ə, əː, œ, œː/}} have been variously described as mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ə}}, {{IPA link|əː}}, {{IPA link|ɞ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɞ̝ː}}]}}{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=section "The rounded and unrounded mid-central vowels"}} and open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɜ}}, {{IPA link|ɜː}}, {{IPA link|ɞ}}, {{IPA link|ɞː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Wissing|2012|p=711}}
* {{IPA|/œ, œː/}} are rather weakly rounded, and many speakers merge {{IPA|/œ/}} with {{IPA|/ə/}} into {{IPAblink|ə}}, even in formal speech.{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=section "The rounded and unrounded mid-central vowels"}} The merger has been noted as early as 1927, when it was stigmatised.{{sfnp|Swanepoel|1927|p=39}}

====The phonetic quality of the open vowels====
* In some words such as ''vanaand'' {{IPA|/faˈnɑːnt/}} 'this evening', unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} is actually a schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}, not {{IPA|[a]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=4, 6}}
* {{IPA|/a/}} is open near-front {{IPAblink|a|a̠}},{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=section "The unrounded low-central vowel {{IPA|/ɑ/}}"}} but older sources describe it as near-open central {{IPAblink|ɐ}}&lt;ref&gt;See the vowel chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Le Roux|de Villiers Pienaar|1927|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=7}} and open central {{IPAblink|ä}}.{{sfnp|Lass|1984|pp=76, 93–94, 105}}
* {{IPA|/ɑː/}} is either open near-back {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̟ː}} or open back {{IPAblink|ɑː}}. Especially in stressed positions, the back realization may be rounded {{IPAblink|ɒː}}, and sometimes it may be even as high as the {{IPA|/ɔː/}} phoneme. The rounded realization is associated with younger white speakers, especially female speakers of northern accents.{{sfnp|Wissing|2016|loc=section "The unrounded low-central vowel {{IPA|/a/}}"}}

====Other notes====
* As phonemes, {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} occur only in the words ''spieël'' {{IPA|/spiːl/}} 'mirror' and ''koeël'' {{IPA|/kuːl/}} 'bullet', which used to be pronounced with sequences {{IPA|/i.ə/}} and {{IPA|/u.ə/}} respectively. In other cases, {{IPAblink|iː}} and {{IPAblink|uː}} occur as allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} respectively before {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=4–6}}
* Like {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}} is phonetically long {{IPAblink|yː}} before {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=5–6}}
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} contrasts with {{IPA|/ɛː/}} only in the minimal pair ''pers'' {{IPA|/pɛrs/}} 'press' – ''pers'' {{IPA|/pɛːrs/}} 'purple'.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=3}}
* Before the sequences {{IPA|/rt, rd, rs/}}, the {{IPA|/ɛ–ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ–ɔː/}} contrasts are neutralized in favour of the long variants {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=7}}
* {{IPA|/əː/}} occurs only in the word ''wîe'' 'wedges', which is realized as either {{IPA|[ˈvəːə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈvəːɦə]}} (with a weak {{IPA|[ɦ]}}).{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=4, 6–7}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/œː.ə/}} is realised as either {{IPA|[œː.ə]}} or {{IPA|[œː.ɦə]}} (with a weak {{IPA|[ɦ]}}).{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=7}}
* {{IPA|/œː, ɔː/}} occur only in a few words.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=7}}
* As a phoneme, {{IPA|/æ/}} occurs only in some loanwords from English, such as ''pêl'' {{IPA|/pæl/}} 'pal', as well as in some words such as ''vertrek'' {{IPA|/fərˈtræk/}} 'departure'. As an allophone of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} before {{IPA|/k, χ, l, r/}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} occurs dialectally, most commonly in the former [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] provinces.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=3, 7}}
* As a phoneme, {{IPA|/æː/}} occurs only in some loanwords from English (such as ''grênd'' {{IPA|[græːnt]}} 'grand'), as well as before {{IPA|/k/}} in some words. {{IPAblink|æː}} also occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɛː/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} and the sequences {{IPA|/rs, rt, rd/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=3, 7}}
* {{IPA|/a/}} has been variously transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|a}}}},&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Le Roux|de Villiers Pienaar|1927}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɐ}}}}&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɑ}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Wissing|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|a}}}}.
* {{IPA|/ɑː/}} has been variously transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɑː}}}}&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Le Roux|de Villiers Pienaar|1927}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|aː}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wissing|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses the former symbol.
* In some words, such as ''hamer'', short {{IPA|/a/}} is in free variation with long {{IPA|/ɑː/}} despite the fact that the spelling suggests the latter. In some words, such as ''laat'', the pronunciation with short {{IPA|/a/}} occurs only in colloquial language. In some other words, such as ''aambeeld'' {{IPA|/ˈambɪəlt/}} 'anvil', the pronunciation with short {{IPA|/a/}} is already a part of the standard language.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=6}} The shortening of {{IPA|/ɑː/}} has been noted as early as 1927.{{sfnp|Swanepoel|1927|p=22}}
* The orthographic sequence {{angle bracket|ae}} can be pronounced as either {{IPA|[ɑː]}} or {{IPA|[ɑːɦə]}} (with a weak {{IPA|[ɦ]}}).{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=6}}

====Nasalized vowels====
In some instances of the postvocalic sequence {{IPA|/ns/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as nasalisation (and lengthening, if the vowel is short) of the preceding monophthong, which is stronger in some speakers than others, but there also are speakers retaining {{IPA|[n]}} as well as the original length of the preceding vowel.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=3, 5}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/ans/}} in words such as ''dans'' is realised as {{IPA|[ãːs]}}. In monosyllabic words, that is the norm.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=3}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/ɑːns/}} in more common words (such as ''Afrikaans'') is realized as either {{IPA|[ɑ̃ːs]}} or {{IPA|[ɑːns]}}. In less common words (such as ''Italiaans''), {{IPA|[ɑːns]}} is the usual pronunciation.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=3}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/ɛns/}} in words such as ''mens'' is realized as {{IPA|[ɛ̃ːs]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=3}}
* The sequence {{IPA|/œns/}} in words such as ''guns'' is realised more often as {{IPA|[œns]}} than as {{IPA|[œ̃ːs]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=5}} For speakers with the {{IPA|/œ–ə/}} merger, these transcriptions are to be read as {{IPA|[əns]}} and {{IPA|[ə̃ːs]}}, respectively.
* The sequence {{IPA|/ɔns/}} in words such as ''spons'' is realised as {{IPA|[ɔ̃ːs]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=5}}

{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003}} analyze the pre-{{IPA|/s/}} sequences {{IPA|/an, ɛn, ɔn/}} as ''phonemic'' short vowels {{IPA|/ɑ̃, ɛ̃, ɔ̃/}} and note that this process of nasalising the vowel and deleting the nasal occurs in many dialects of Dutch as well, such as [[The Hague dialect]].{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=71}}

===={{IPA|/ɪø, ɪə, ʊə/}}====
* According to {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1987}}, the first elements of {{IPA|[ɪø, ɪə, ʊə]}} are close-mid,{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}} more narrowly transcribed {{IPA|[ë, ë, ö]}} or {{IPA|[ɪ̞, ɪ̞, ʊ̞]}}. According to {{Harvcoltxt|De Villiers|1976}}, the onsets of {{IPA|[ɪə, ʊə]}} are near-close {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}}.{{sfnp|De Villiers|1976|pp=56–57}} For simplicity, both variants will be written simply as {{IPA|[ɪø, ɪə, ʊə]}}. {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}} are commonly used for centralized close-mid vowels anyway - see [[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]] and [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]].
* Some sources prescribe monophthongal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|øː}}, {{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}} realizations of these; that is at least partially outdated:{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}}{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=8}}
** There is not a complete agreement about the realisation of {{IPA|/ɪø/}}:
*** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1987}}, it is realised as either rising {{IPA|[ɪ̯ø]}} or falling {{IPA|[ɪø̯]}}, with the former being more common. The unrounded onset is a rather recent development and is not described by older sources. The monophthongal realisation {{IPAblink|øː}} is virtually nonexistent.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|p=117}}
*** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}}, it is realised as {{IPA|[øə]}}. Its onset is sometimes unrounded, which can cause it to merge with {{IPA|/eə/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=8–9}}
** There is not a complete agreement about the realisation of {{IPA|/ɪə, ʊə/}}
*** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1987}}, they may be realised in four ways:
**** Falling diphthongs. Their first element may be short {{IPA|[ɪə̯, ʊə̯]}} or somewhat lengthened {{IPA|[ɪˑə̯, ʊˑə̯]}}.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}}
**** Rising diphthongs {{IPA|[ɪ̯ə, ʊ̯ə]}}. These variants do not seem to appear word-finally. The sequence {{IPA|/ɦʊə/}} is commonly realised as {{IPA|[ɦʊ̯ə]}} or, more often, {{IPA|[ɦʊ̯ə̤]}}, with {{IPA|/ɦ/}} realised as [[breathy voice]] on the diphthong.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}}
**** Indeterminate diphthongs {{IPA|[ɪə, ʊə]}}, which may occur in all environments.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}}
**** Monophthongs, either short {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}} or somewhat lengthened {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪˑ}}, {{IPA link|ʊˑ}}]}}. The monophthongal realisations occur in less stressed words as well as in stressed syllables in words that have more than one syllable. In the latter case, they are in free variation with all of the three diphthongal realisations. In case of {{IPA|/ʊə/}}, the monophthongal {{IPAblink|ʊ}} also appears in unstressed word-final syllables.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|pp=117–119}}
*** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}}, they are realized as either {{IPA|[eə, oə]}} or {{IPA|[iə, uə]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=8}}
* {{IPA|/ɪə/}} also occurs in words spelled with {{angle bracket|eë}}, like ''reël'' {{IPA|/ˈrɪəl/}} 'rule'. Historically, these were pronounced with a disyllabic sequence {{IPA|/eː.ə/}} and so ''reël'' used to be pronounced {{IPA|/ˈreː.əl/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=8}}
* There is not a complete agreement about the dialectal realisation of {{IPA|/ɪə, ʊə/}} in the [[Boland, Western Cape|Boland]] area:
** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1987}}, they are centralized close-mid monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}, which do not merge with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|p=118}}
** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}} and De Villiers,&lt;ref name="dv"&gt;Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1987|pp=117–118}}. The preview on Google Books makes it unclear whether De Villiers' book is "Afrikaanse klankleer. Fonetiek, fonologie en woordbou" or "Nederlands en Afrikaans", as both are cited at the end of Lass's chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; they are close monophthongs, long {{IPA|[{{IPA link|iː}}, {{IPA link|uː}}]}} according to {{Harvcoltxt|Donaldson|1993}}, short {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}} according to De Villiers.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=8}}&lt;ref name="dv"/&gt;

====Other diphthongs====
* The scholar Daan Wissing argues that {{IPA|/əi/}} is not a phonetically correct transcription and that {{IPA|/æɛ/}} is more accurate. In his analysis, he found that {{IPA|[æɛ]}} makes for 65% of the realisations, the other 35% being monophthongal, {{IPAblink|ə}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɛ}}.{{sfnp|Wissing|2009|p=333}}
* Most often, {{IPA|/œi/}} has an unrounded offset. For some speakers, the onset is also unrounded. That can cause {{IPA|/œi/}} to merge with {{IPA|/əi/}}, which is considered non-standard.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=10}}
* {{IPA|/ɔi, ai/}} occur mainly in loanwords.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=10}}
* Older sources describe {{IPA|/œu/}} as a narrow back diphthong {{IPA|[ou]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=9}}{{sfnp|Swanepoel|1927|p=44}} However, newer sources describe its onset as more front. For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|1984}}, states that the onset of {{IPA|/œu/}} is central {{IPA|[ɵu]}}.{{sfnp|Lass|1984|p=102}}
** In some words, which, in English, are pronounced with {{IPA|/əʊ/}}, the Afrikaans equivalent tends to be pronounced with {{IPA|/œu/}}, rather than {{IPA|/ʊə/}}. That happens because Afrikaans {{IPA|/œu/}} is more similar to the usual South African realization of English {{IPA|/əʊ/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=9}}

====Long diphthongs====
The long diphthongs (or 'double vowels') are phonemically sequences of a free vowel and a non-syllabic equivalent of {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}: {{IPA|[iu, ui, oːi, eu, ɑːi]}}. Both {{IPA|[iu]}} and {{IPA|[eu]}} tend to be pronounced as {{IPA|[iu]}}, but they are spelled differently: the former as {{angle bracket|ieu}}, the latter as {{angle bracket|eeu}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=12}}

===='False' diphthongs====
In diminutives ending in {{IPA|/ki/}} formed to monosyllabic nouns, the vowels {{IPA|/u, ɪə, ʊə, ɛ, ə, œ, ɔ, a, ɑː/}} are realised as closing diphthongs {{IPA|[ui, ei, oi, ɛi, əi, œi, ɔi, ai, ɑːi]}}. In the same environment, the sequences {{IPA|/ɛn, ən, œn, ɔn, an/}} are realized as {{IPA|[ɛiɲ, əiɲ, œiɲ, ɔiɲ, aiɲ]}}, i.e. as closing diphthongs followed by palatal nasal.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=10–11}}

* The suffixes {{angle bracket|-aad}} and {{angle bracket|-aat}} (phonemically {{IPA|/ɑːd/}} and {{IPA|/ɑːt/}}, respectively) and the diminutive suffix {{IPA|/ki/}} are realised as {{IPA|[ɑːci]}} (with a monophthong), rather than {{IPA|[ɑːici]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=10}}
* In practice, the diphthong {{IPA|[əi]}} is realised the same as the phonemic diphthong {{IPA|/əi/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=11}}
* {{IPA|[œi]}}, when it has arisen from diphthongisation of {{IPA|[œ]}}, differs from the phonemic diphthong {{IPA|/œi/}} by having a slightly different onset, although the exact nature of that difference is unclear. This means that ''puntjie'' 'point' sounds somewhat different than ''puintjie'' 'rubble'.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=11}}

===Obstruents===
* All obstruents at the ends of words are [[final-obstruent devoicing|devoiced]] so that, for instance, a final {{IPA|/d/}} is realised as {{IPA|[t]}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=13–15}}
* {{IPA|/p, b/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].
** According to some authors,&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvcoltxt|Den Besten|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/v/}} is actually an approximant {{IPAblink|ʋ}}.
* {{IPA|/p, t, k, tʃ/}} are unaspirated.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=14–16}}
* {{IPA|/k/}} may be somewhat more front before front vowels; the fronted allophone of {{IPA|/k/}} also occurs in diminutives ending in ''-djie'' and ''-tjie''.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=15}}
* {{IPA|/dʒ, z/}} occur only in loanwords.
* {{IPA|/χ/}} is most often uvular, either a fricative, {{IPAblink|χ}} or a voiceless trill {{IPAblink|ʀ̥}}, the latter especially in initial position before a stressed vowel.{{sfnp|Den Besten|2012}}&lt;ref name="wellsblog"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wells's phonetic blog: velar or uvular?|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/12/velar-or-uvular.html|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=12 February 2015}} Only this source mentions the trilled realization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowerman"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bowerman|2004|p=939}}: "White South African English is one of very few varieties to have a velar fricative phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} (see {{Harvcoltxt|Lass|2002|p=120}}), but this is only in words borrowed from Afrikaans (...) and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] (...). Many speakers use the Afrikaans uvular fricative {{IPA|[χ]}} rather than the velar."&lt;/ref&gt; The uvular fricative is also used by many speakers of White [[South African English]] as a realisation of the marginal English phoneme {{IPA|/x/}}.&lt;ref name="bowerman"/&gt; In Afrikaans, velar {{IPAblink|x}} may be used in a few "hyper-posh" varieties, and it may also, rarely, occur as an allophone before front vowels in speakers with otherwise uvular {{IPAblink|χ}}.&lt;ref name="wellsblog"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} occurs only in loanwords. In some environments,{{fix|text=which?|date=July 2015}} {{IPA|[ɡ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/χ/}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|pp=13–14}}

===Sonorants===
* {{IPA|/m/}} is [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]].
* {{IPA|/n/}} merges with {{IPA|/m/}} before labial consonants. Phonetically, this merged consonant is realized as bilabial {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/p, b/}}, and labiodental {{IPA|[ɱ]}} before {{IPA|/f, v/}}.
** {{IPA|/n/}} merges with {{IPA|/ŋ/}} before dorsals ({{IPA|/k, χ/}}). Phonetically, this merged consonant is realized as velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and the {{IPA|[ɡ]}} allophone of {{IPA|/χ/}},{{fix|text=can {{IPA|[ɡ]}} occur after {{IPA|[ŋ]}}?|date=May 2015}} and as uvular {{IPAblink|ɴ}} before {{IPA|/χ/}}.
* {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarisation|velarised]] {{IPAblink|ɫ}} in all positions, especially noticeably non-prevocalically.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|p=117}}{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=15}}
* {{IPA|/r/}} is usually an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}} or tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}.{{sfnp|Lass|1987|p=117}} In some parts of the former [[Cape Province]], it is realised uvularly, either as a trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}} or a fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}}.{{sfnp|Donaldson|1993|p=15}} The uvular trill may also be pronounced as a tap {{IPAblink|ʀ̆}}.

'''Alien languages''', refers to languages of [[extraterrestrial being]]s, are a hypothetical subject since none have been encountered so far.  The research in these hypothetical languages is variously called  '''exolinguistics''', '''xenolinguistics'''&lt;ref&gt;An early use of the term "xenolinguistics" in [[science fiction]] occurred in 1986, in the novel "Triad" by [[Sheila Finch]] ({{Cite book|title = Triad|last = Finch|first = Sheila|publisher = Spectra|year = 1986|isbn = 9780553257922 |location = New York}} New edition: {{Cite book|title = Triad |last = Finch|first = Sheila|publisher = [[Wildside Press]]|year = 2012|isbn = 9781434447913 |location = Rockville, Maryland}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''astrolinguistics'''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T. "Aliens And Linguists (Book Review)." Library Journal 105.13 (1980): 1516. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schirber, Michael. "Use Grammar To Decipher Alien Tongues." New Scientist 199.2678 (2008): 12. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of what form alien languages might take and the possibility for humans to recognize and translate them has been part of the linguistics and language studies courses, e.g., at the [[Bowling Green State University]]  (2001).&lt;ref name=wells1&gt;[http://personal.bgsu.edu/~swellsj/xenolinguistics/ Course notes] by assistant professor [http://personal.bgsu.edu/~swellsj/ Sheri Wells-Jensen], [[Bowling Green State University]] (retrieved June 19, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] (1983), basing on his theory of the existence of a [[genetics|genetically-predetermined]] [[universal grammar]] of human languages, holds that it would be impossible for a human to naturally learn an alien language because it would most probably violate the universal grammar inborn in humans. Humans would have to study an alien language by the slow way of discovery, the same way as scientists do research in, say, physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/198311__/ "Things No Amount of Learning Can Teach"], Noam Chomsky interviewed by John Gliedman, ''Omni'', 6:11, November 1983 (retrieved June 19, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[Keren Rice]] posits that basic communication between humans and aliens should be possible, unless "the things that we think are common to languages—situating in time [and] space, talking about participants, etc.—are so radically different that the human language provides no starting point for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alien Interpreters: How Linguists Would Talk to Extraterrestrials|url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-interpreters-how-linguists-would-talk-to-extraterrestrials/|website = Scientific American |accessdate = 2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGill University]] Linguistics Professor, [[Jessica Coon]] was consulted for the linguistic aspect of the 2016 film ''[[Arrival (film)| Arrival]]''. While acknowledging that the language used in the film was art, she states that film is a fairly accurate portrayal of the approach human linguists would use in trying to understand an alien language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival' nails how humans might actually talk to aliens, a linguist says|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anasuya Shankar''' (1 September 1928 – 29 July 1963), popularly known by her pen name as '''Triveni''', was an Indian writer of modern fiction in [[Kannada language]]. Her novels have been made into feature films, most prominently, ''[[Belli Moda]]'' (1967)'' and [[Sharapanjara]]'' (1971) – both directed by [[Puttanna Kanagal]] and featuring actress [[Kalpana (Kannada actress)|Kalpana]]. Her small stories collection ''Samasyeya Magu'' won the Devaraja Bahadur Prize in 1950. Her novel ''Avala Mane'' earned the [[Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="toi1"/&gt;

==Life==
Anasuya Shankar was born on 1 September 1928 in the [[Chamarajapuram, Mysore|Chamarajapuram]] suburb of [[Mysore]], in the erstwhile [[Kingdom of Mysore]] of [[British India]] (in present-day [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]]), to B. M. Krishnaswamy and Thangamma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kannada Novelist Triveni's House In City To Be A Museum|url=http://starofmysore.com/kannada-novelist-trivenis-house-city-museum/|website=Star of Mysore|accessdate=25 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425194906/http://starofmysore.com/kannada-novelist-trivenis-house-city-museum/|archivedate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also called Bhagirathi. She had a younger sister [[Aryamba Pattabhi]], who went on to become a writer as well. Other writers in her family were uncle [[B. M. Srikantaiah]] and cousin [[Vani (writer)|Vani]].

She graduated with a gold medal in her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Maharani's Arts College in [[Mysore]]. In 1947, she was awarded the Siddegowda gold medal for excellence on [[political science]].&lt;ref name="toi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triveni’s house in Chamarajapuram to be converted into a museum|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/trivenis-house-in-chamarajapuram-to-be-converted-into-a-museum/articleshow/57543901.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married S. N. Shankar (1925–2012) in 1951, an English professor at [[Sarada Vilas College]], Mysore.&lt;ref name="ie1"/&gt; 

Anasuya adopted the pen name Triveni out of respect for [[Mahatma Gandhi]], whose ashes following his death, were immersed in the confluence of the three Indian rivers of [[Ganges]], [[Yamuna]] and the invisible [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]], known as the [[Triveni Sangam]].&lt;ref name="toi1"/&gt; Anasuya died of [[pulmonary embolism]] on 29 July 1963, 10 days after giving birth to Meera, at the Mission Hospital in Mysore.&lt;ref name="ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kannada novelist dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19630731&amp;printsec=frontpage|newspaper=The Indian Express|accessdate=25 April 2017|page=7|date=31 July 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have noted he has created a poetic language of his own with frustration, sorrow and satire as its basic elements in his ghazals. The language is described as simple, reader-friendly, lucid and full of freshness carrying a natural poetic flow and rhythm not only of the words but of the content as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Savaar Thai Ne – Anil Chavda|last = Topiwala|first = Chandrakant |author-link=Chandrakant Topiwala |date = 1 September 2013|journal = Pratyaxa|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Center console''' (British English: '''centre console''') is a type of single-[[Deck (ship)|decked]] open hull [[boat]] where the console of the boat is in the center of the boat. There is a [[Cabins (ship)|cabin]] on some models; these cabins are usually located in the bow and hold small berths for sleeping.  The boat deck surrounds the console so that a person can walk all around the boat from stern to bow with ease.

The console of a boat is where all the controls are located, including steering, ignition, trim control, radio and other electronic devices, switches etc. It may have a small storage space and/or a [[Head (watercraft)|head]].  In general there is no weather protection or berths, making the design ill-suited to cruising. The console may have a T-Top cover to provide limited relief from the sun and rain, but this is not universal because it interferes with fishermen's casting. Most center consoles are powered by [[outboard motor]]s.

A center console boat is popular as a small boat on a large ship.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Center console boats may range in length from 13 feet to about 53 feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">A '''chain of title''' is the sequence of historical transfers of [[title (property)|title]] to a [[property]]. It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property’s historical ownership timeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirositecorp.com/products/environmental-property-assessment-data/chain-of-title-report/ Chain of Title Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The "chain" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or [[civil law notary]].

==Chain of title for real property==

[[Real estate]] is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. Various registration systems, such as the [[Torrens title]] system, have been developed to track the ownership of individual pieces of [[real property]]. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue [[title insurance]] based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records.  In other cases, the chain of title is established by an [[abstract of title]], sometimes, although not always, certified by an [[Lawyer|attorney]].  In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed.  Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, [[Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems]] (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments.&lt;ref&gt;"Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS)."

Harper's Magazine, January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  US states have objected and even sued over this practice.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts attorney general sues big banks over foreclosure practices." Washington Post, 10 December 2011. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/massachusetts-attorney-general-sues-big-banks-over-foreclosure-practices/2011/12/01/gIQAgwnUIO_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity ==

In the [[film|motion picture]] industry, the '''chain of title''' involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a [[film]]. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under [[license]]) in the [[intellectual property]] in a film, book or encyclopedia.

Chain of title documentation can include:

* [[copyright]] clearances on [[music]] from the regional [[collecting society]], and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
* [[trademark]] clearances;
* [[artist|talent]] agreements, which should incorporate a [[legal release]] from the talent, be they [[actor]]s (including crowds), [[film director|director]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[choreographer]]s, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other [[personality rights]] in the film;
* proof of errors and omission [[insurance]] (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).

Specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of [[United States Copyright Office]] screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. This involves reviewing US Copyright Office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and Library of Congress records.

Sets of '''ritual bronzes''' (in [[chinese language|chinese]]: '''中国青铜器''') are the most impressive surviving objects from the [[Chinese Bronze Age]]. During the [[Shang dynasty]], China became one of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and cast metal to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other household items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese lived by interpreting from lacquer paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=All About China: Stories, Songs, Crafts and More for Kids |last=Branscombe |first=Allison |date=November 21, 2014  |isbn=978-0804841214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being from around 1650 BCE, these elaborately decorated vessels were deposited as [[grave goods]] in the tombs of royalty and the nobility, and were evidently produced in very large numbers, with documented excavations finding over 200 pieces in a single royal tomb.  They were produced for an individual to use in ritual offerings of food and drink to his ancestors in family temples or ceremonial halls over tombs, or rather ritual banquets in which both living and dead members of a family participated; early literary records speak of these.  On the death of the owner they would be placed in his tomb, so that he could continue to pay his respects in the afterlife; other examples were cast specifically as grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 44-60&lt;/ref&gt; The zoomorphic motives are similar with the art of the [[karasuk culture]].

The ritual bronzes were probably not used for normal eating and drinking; they represent larger, more elaborate versions of the types of vessels used for this, and made in precious materials. Apart from table vessels, weapons and some other objects were made in special ritual forms. Another class of ritual objects are those, also including weapons, made in [[jade]], which was probably the most highly valued of all, and which had been long used for ritual tools and weapons, since about 4,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 44-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

At least initially, the production of bronze was probably controlled by the ruler, who gave unformed metal to his nobility as a sign of favour.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

They contain between 5% and 30% [[tin]] and between 2% and 3% [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lumea chineză (the first volume)| first1=Jaques|last1=Gernet|page=67 și 68|publisher=[[Editura meridiane]]|year=1987|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Bronzes ({{zh|s=青铜器 |t=青銅器 |p=qīng tóng qì |w=ch'ing t'ong ch'i}}) are some of the most important pieces of ancient [[Chinese art]], warranting an entire separate catalogue in the Imperial art collections.  The Chinese Bronze Age began in the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2070 – ca. 1600 BC), and bronze ritual containers form the bulk of collections of Chinese antiquities, reaching its zenith during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC) and the early part of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045–256 BC).

The majority of surviving Chinese ancient bronze artefacts are ritual forms rather than their equivalents made for practical use, either as tools or weapons.   Weapons like daggers and axes had a sacrificial meaning, symbolizing the heavenly power of the ruler. The strong religious associations of bronze objects brought up a great number of vessel types and shapes which became regarded as classic and totemic and were copied, often in other media such as [[Chinese porcelain]], throughout subsequent periods of [[Chinese art]].

The ritual books of old China minutely describe who was allowed to use what kinds of sacrificial vessels and how much. The king of Zhou used 9 [[Ding_(vessel)|ding]]s and 8 [[Gui_(vessel)|gui]] vessels, a duke was allowed to use 7 dings and 6 guis, a baron could use 5 dings and 3 guis, a nobleman was allowed to use 3 dings and 2 guis.  Turning to actual archaeological finds, the [[tomb of Fu Hao]], an unusually powerful Shang queen, contained her set of ritual vessels, numbering over two hundred, which are also far larger than the twenty-four vessels in the tomb of a contemporary nobleman.  Her higher status would have been clear not only to her contemporaries, but also, it was believed, to her ancestors and other spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the pieces were cast with inscriptions using the posthumous form of her name, indicating there were made especially for burial in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_fu.shtm "Excavations at the Tomb of Fu Hao"], accessed August 4, 2007,  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metallurgy and origin==
The origin of the ores or metals use for Shang and other early chinese bronze is a current (2018) topic of research. As with other early civilisations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus) the Shang period development was centered on river valleys, and driven in part by the introduction of intensive agriculture - in China such areas lacked ore deposits and required the import of metallurgical material. Typical Shang period bronzes contain over 2% lead, unlike contemporary coppers of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. Analysis of the ore/metals origins has been based on lead content and  trace isotope analysis.&lt;ref name="iso1"&gt;{{citation| doi= 10.1111/arcm.12352| title = DID CHINA IMPORT METALS FROM AFRICA IN THE BRONZE AGE?| first = S. |last=Liu| first2 = K.L.| last2= Chen| first3=Th.| last3=Rehren| first4= J.J. |last4 = Mei| first5 = J.L.| last5 = Chen| first6 = Y.|last6 = Liu| first7 = D.| last7= Killick| journal =  Archaeometry | year = 2018| volume=60|issue=1| pages = 105-117|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Shang period bronzes, various sites, from early to late Shang period, numerous samples of the bronze alloy are characterized by high [[radiogenic]] Lead isotope content (derived from both [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] decay), unlike most known native Chinese lead ores. Potential speculative sources of the ore include [[Qinling]], middle to lower [[Yangtze]] area, and south-west china; the possibility that ore or metal was imported from Africa in this period has been proposed, based on potential isotopic matches, but challenged and rejected by other researchers. Pre-Shang ([[Erlitou culture]]) bronzes do not contain the radiogenic lead isotopes.&lt;ref name="iso1"/&gt;

==Classification of pieces in the Imperial collection==
The appreciation, creation and collection of Chinese bronzes as pieces of art and not as ritual items began in the [[Song dynasty]] and reached its zenith in the [[Qing dynasty]] during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], whose massive collection is recorded in the catalogues known as the ''[[Xiqing gujian]]'' (西清古鑑) and the ''Xiqing jijian'' (西清繼鑑).  Within those two catalogues, the bronzeware is categorized according to use:
*Sacrificial vessels (祭器, jìqì),
*Wine vessels (酒器, jiǔqì),
*Food vessels (食器, shíqì),
*Water vessels (水器, shuǐqì),
*Musical instruments (樂器, yuèqì),
*Weapons (兵器, bīngqì),
*Measuring containers (量器, liángqì),
*Ancient money (錢幣, qiánbì), and
*Miscellaneous (雜器, záqì).

The most highly prized are generally the sacrificial and wine vessels, which form the majority of most collections. Often these vessels are elaborately decorated with ''[[taotie]]'' designs.

===Sacrificial vessels ===
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Houmuwu ding]] ({{zh|s=后母戊鼎|p=Hòumǔwù dǐng}}), the largest ancient bronze ever found]]
*''[[Ding (vessel)|Dǐng]]'' (鼎)  Sacrificial vessel (祭器), originally a cauldron for cooking and storing meat (食器). The Shang prototype has a round bowl, wider than it is tall, set on three legs (足); there are two short handles on each side (耳). Later examples became larger and larger and were considered a measure of power. It is considered the single most important class of Chinese bronzeware in terms of its cultural importance. There is a variation called a ''fāngdǐng'' (方鼎) which has a square bowl and four legs at each corner. There exist rare forms with lids. 西清古鑒 contains over two hundred examples, and this is the most highly regarded of all Chinese bronzes.
*''Dòu'' (豆): Sacrificial vessel (祭器) that was originally a food vessel. Flat, covered bowl on a long stem.
*''Fǔ'' (簠): Rectangular dish, triangular in vertical cross-section. Always with a lid shaped like the dish.
*[[Zun|''Zūn'']] (尊 or 樽 or 鐏): Wine vessel and sacrificial vessel (器為盛酒亦祭用也). Tall cylindrical wine cup, with no handles or legs. The mouth is usually slightly broader than the body. In the late ''Zhōu'' (周) dynasty, this type of vessel became exceedingly elaborate, often taking the shape of animals and abandoning the traditional shape. These later types are distinguished from gōng (觥) by retaining a small, roughly circular mouth. This type of vessel forms the second largest group of objects in the ''Xiqing gujian'', after the ''dǐng'' (鼎).
*''Zǔ'' (俎): Flat rectangular platform with square legs at each corner. Not represented in the ''Xiqing gujian''.
*''Yí'' (彝): Sacrificial vessel. Two forms: A. Large squat round pot with two handles; B. Tall box-like container, the base narrower than the mouth with a roof-like lid. Later became a generic name for all sacrificial vessels.

These later types are distinguished from gōng (觥) by retaining a small, roughly circular mouth. This type of vessel forms the second largest group of objects in the ''Xiqing gujian'', after the dǐng (鼎).

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">[[File:Julien de Vriendt.JPG|125px|thumb|Juliaan De Vriendt, who proposed the law with Edward Coremans]]
The '''Coremans-De Vriendt Law''', also dubbed the '''Law of Equality''' ({{lang-nl|Gelijkheidswet}}), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[law]] passed on 18 April 1898 which enforced formal legal equality of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language]]s in the country. It is seen as a landmark in the history of the [[Flemish Movement]] and of [[Language legislation in Belgium|linguistic equality in Belgium]].{{sfn|Hensley|2008|p=15}}

The law was named after two Flemish deputies, [[Juliaan De Vriendt]] and [[Edward Coremans]], who proposed the law. The law decreed equal validity for legal texts written in both French and Dutch, as well as decreeing bilingual signage in Flanders.{{sfn|Hensley|2008|p=15}} As a result, parliamentary debates could be held in both languages and henceforth all laws were voted, passed and published in legally equivalent French and Dutch versions.{{sfn|Hermans|1992|p=15}} The law followed a period of greater official acceptance of Dutch, starting in around 1886 when coins became bilingual.{{sfn|McRae|1986|p=25}} The law's passing, along with the introduction of universal male [[suffrage]] (but with [[plural voting]]) in 1893, caused the Flemish Movement to enter a "third stage" of mass-membership - facilitated also by the major electoral reform of 1899.{{sfn|McRae|1986|p=26}}{{sfn|Hermans|1992|p=15}}

'''Gela''' is a [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]] language spoken in three [[dialect]]s on four islands in the central [[Solomon Islands]]. Each of the dialects is very similar, differing mainly on a small number of phonological points.

==Phonology==

===Phonemes===

====Consonants====
Gela has the following consonant phonemes:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
!
!colspan="2"| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]

NOTE:
The Gela dominant Voiced is "h" not "z". "Z" is found in Savosavo language speakers (and Bugotu and part of Guadalcanal) who also speak Gela - primarily due to their use of the Church of Melanesia Common Prayer Books and Hymns (written in Gela in the 1940s).

====Vowels====
Gela uses {{IPA|/i, e, a, o, u/}} with no contrastive vowel length.

===Stress===
Stress generally occurs on each word's penultimate syllable.

==Sample Vocabulary==

===Numbers===

# keha (keha or sakai, not keza)
# rua
# tolu
# vati
# lima
# ono
# vitu
# alu
# hiua (not hiwa)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4859">'''Global Recordings Network''' (GRN) was founded by [[Joy Ridderhof]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1939 as "Gospel Recordings." The mission of GRN is "In partnership with the church, to effectively communicate the Good News of Jesus Christ by means of culturally appropriate audio and audio-visual materials in every language."  This is accomplished by recording the stories of the [[Bible]] in the native language or dialect,  by a mother tongue speaker and providing them in an audio format to the community.  Often the languages do not have a written form.  GRN has recorded over 6,000 languages or dialects.  GRN has offices in more than 20 countries.

The language professor [[Alexander Arguelles]] notes that it is possible to use these recordings and the accompanying text in a language the learner knows, to start learning any of the languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Language Museum|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=Arguelles|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many there is no other way to learn the language. 1300 of the languages accompany the stories with standardized pictures, shown for 10-20 seconds, which allow learners to find short parallel sections in the language they know and the one they want to learn.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/goodnews |title="Good News" audio-visual |website=Global recordings network |language=en |access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haitian Vodoun Culture Language''' (known as '''Langay''' and '''Langaj;''' literally "language") is a specialized vocabulary used in [[Haiti]] for religion, song, and dance purposes. It appears to not be an actual language, but rather an assortment of words, songs, and incantations – some secret – from various languages once used in [[Haitian Vodoun]] ceremonies.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;  

It's unknown exactly which African languages have contributed to the formation of this language/vocabulary, but the [[Fon language|Fon]] and [[Kongo language|Kongo]] languages would most likely have had large contributions, just as they contributed to the formation of [[Haitian Creole]] and the cultures associated with these languages (namely the [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]] peoples) contributed to the formation of [[Haitian Vodou]] and [[Haitian culture]] as a whole.

'''Indosphere''' is a term coined by the linguist [[James Matisoff]] for areas of Indian linguistic and cultural influence in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is commonly used in [[areal linguistics]] in contrast with [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area|Sinosphere]].

==Influence==
{{Main|Sprachbund}}

The [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family of languages, which extends over a huge geographic range, is characterized by great typological diversity, comprising languages that range from the highly tonal, monosyllabic, analytic type with practically no affixational morphology, like the [[Loloish languages]], to marginally tonal or atonal languages with complex systems of [[Grammatical conjugation#Verbal agreement|verbal agreement]] morphology, like the [[Kiranti]] group of Nepal. This diversity is partly to be explained in terms of [[areal features|areal influences]] from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] on the one hand and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] on the other.&lt;ref name=Matisoff&gt;{{citation |first=James Alan |last=Matisoff |title=Handbook of Proto-Tibeto-Burman: System and Philosophy of Sino-Tibetan Reconstruction |pages=6–7 |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn= 0-520-09843-9|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/19d79619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matisoff proposed two large and overlapping areas combining cultural and linguistic features – the "Sinosphere" and the "Indosphere", influenced by China and India respectively.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;Robert M.

Some languages and cultures firmly belong to one or the other. For example, the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Khasi language|Khasi]] branches of [[Austroasiatic languages]], the Tibeto-Burman languages of Eastern [[Nepal]], and much of the "[[Tibeto-Burman languages#Matisoff (1978)|Kamarupan]]" group of Tibeto-Burman, which most notably includes the [[Meitei language|Meitei]] (Manipuri), are Indospheric; while the [[Hmong–Mien]] family, the [[Kam–Sui languages|Kam–Sui]] branch of [[Kadai]], the Loloish branch of Tibeto-Burman, and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (Viet–Muong) are Sinospheric. Some other languages, like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], have been influenced by both Chinese and Indian culture at different historical periods. Still other linguistic communities are so remote geographically that they have escaped significant influence from either. For example, the [[Aslian languages|Aslian branch]] of [[Mon–Khmer]] in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], or the [[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese branch]] of Mon–Khmer in the [[Nicobar Islands]] of the Indian Ocean show little influence by Sinosphere or Indosphere.&lt;ref name=Matisoff/&gt; The [[Bodish languages]] and [[Kham language]]s are characterized by hybrid [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic properties]] akin to related Indospheric languages towards the west and also Sinospheric languages towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Miestamo &amp; Bernhard Wälchli, ''New Challenges in Typology'', page 90, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, {{ISBN|3-11-019592-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages of the [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti group]] in the Indosphere rank among the morphologically most complex languages of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;David Levinson &amp; Karen Christensen, ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia: a berkshire reference work'', page 494, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002, {{ISBN|0-684-80617-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian cultural, intellectual, and political influence&amp;nbsp;– especially that of [[Pallava alphabet|Pallava]] writing system&amp;nbsp;– began to penetrate both insular and peninsular [[Southeast Asia]] about 2000 years ago. Indic writing systems were adopted first by [[Austronesian languages|Austronesians]], like [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Cham language|Cham]], and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatics]], like [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Mon people|Mon]], then by [[Tai languages|Tai]] ([[Thai language|Siamese]] and [[Lao language|Lao]]) and Tibeto-Burmans ([[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Karen languages|Karen]]). Indospheric languages are also found in [[Indochina|Mainland Southeast Asia]] (MSEA), defined as the region encompassing [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Thailand]], as well as parts of [[Burma]], Peninsular [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]]. Related scripts are also found in South East Asian islands ranging from [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], south [[Sulawesi]] and most of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haspelmath, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCRcARRN9nsC&amp;pg=PA569&amp;dq=indosphere&amp;lr=&amp;ei=cObSR7zSINC4igH0ldirBQ&amp;sig=NZzfitQOiVvLf3LOSI04oXn3Rzs The World Atlas of Language Structures], page 569, Oxford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-925591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learned components of the vocabularies of Khmer, Mon, Burmese and Thai/Lao consist of words of [[Pali]] or [[Sanskrit]] origin. Indian influence also spread north to the Himalayan region. Tibetan has used Devanagari writing since 600 AD, but has preferred to calque new religious and technical vocabulary from native morphemes rather than borrowing Indian ones.&lt;ref name=Matisoff/&gt; The Cham empires, known collectively as [[Champa]], which were founded around the end of 2nd century AD, belonged directly to Indosphere of influence, rather than to the Sinosphere which shaped so much of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] culture and by which [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]] were influenced later and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Ansaldo, Stephen Matthews &amp; Lisa Lim, ''Deconstructing Creole'', page 113, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|90-272-2985-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Main|Morphological typology}}

Languages in the "Sinosphere" (roughly [[Southeast Asia]]) tend to be analytic, with little morphology, [[monosyllabic]] or [[minor syllable|sesquisyllabic]] lexical structures, extensive compounding, complex tonal systems, and serial verb constructions. Languages in the "Indosphere" (roughly the [[Himalayas]] and [[South Asia]]) tend to be more agglutinative, with [[polysyllabic]] structures, [[grammatical case|extensive case]] and verb morphology, and detailed markings of interpropositional relationships.&lt;ref name=Dixon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matisoff1990"/&gt; Manange (like other [[Tamang language|Tamangic languages]]) is an interesting case to examine in this regard, as geographically it fits squarely in the "Indospheric" Himalayas, but typologically it shares more features with the "Sinospheric" languages.&lt;ref name=Dixon/&gt; Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the Sinosphere tend to be more isolating, while those spoken in the Indosphere tend to be more morphologically complex.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald &amp; Robert M. W. Dixon, ''Grammars in Contact'', page 4, Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-920783-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages in the western side of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]], which includes the Tibeto-Burman languages, show significant typological resemblances with other languages of the [[South Asia]], which puts them in the group of Indosphere. They often have heavier syllables than found in the east, while [[tone (linguistics)|tone systems]], though attested, are not as frequent.&lt;ref name=carol&gt;[[Carol Genetti]], ''A Grammar of Dolakha Newar'', page 3, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, {{ISBN|3-11-019303-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indospheric languages are often toneless and/or highly [[suffix]]al.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew, April M. S. McMahon &amp; Robert Lawrence Trask, ''Time Depth in Historical Linguistics'', page 334, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, 2000, {{ISBN|1-902937-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often there is considerable [[Inflected preposition|inflectional]] morphology, from fully developed [[Grammatical case|case marking]] systems to extensive [[Reflexive verb|pronominal]] morphology found on the verb. These languages generally mark a number of types of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|inter-casual relationships]] and have distinct construction involving [[Auxiliary verb|verbal auxiliaries]].&lt;ref name=carol/&gt; Languages of the Indosphere typically display [[retroflex consonant|retroflex stop consonants]], postsentential [[relative clause]]s and the extended grammaticalization of the verb ''[[wiktionary:Say|say]]''.&lt;ref name=anju/&gt; In Indospheric languages, such as the Tibeto-Burman languages of Northeast India and Nepal, for example, the development of relative pronouns and correlative structures as well as of retroflex initial consonants is often found.&lt;ref name=LaPolla/&gt;

The '''Kx'a languages''', also called '''Ju–ǂHoan''', are a [[language family|family]] established in 2010 linking the [[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂ’Amkoe]] (ǂHoan) language with the [[!Kung language|ǃKung (Juu)]] dialect cluster, a relationship that had been suspected for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Honken, H. and Heine, B. 2010. [http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/57434/1/jaas079001_ful.pdf "The Kx'a Family: A New Khoisan Genealogy"]. ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' (Tokyo), 79, p. 5–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Tuu languages]] and [[Khoe languages]], they are one of three language families indigenous to southern Africa, which are typologically similar due to [[Sprachbund|areal]] effects.

==Languages==
*[[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂ’Amkoe]] (moribund)
*[[!Kung language|ǃKung]] (also ''ǃXun'' or ''Ju,'' formerly ''Northern Khoisan''; a dialect cluster) 

ǂ’Amkoe had previously been lumped in with the Tuu languages, perhaps over confusion with the dialect name ǂHȍȁn, but the only thing they have in common are [[language typology|typological]] features such as their [[bilabial click]]s. 

Honken &amp; Heine (2010) coined the term ''Kx'a'' for the family as a replacement for the rather inaccessible compound ''Ju–ǂHoan'' (easily confused with the [[Juǀʼhoan]] language), after the word {{IPA-xx|kxʼà|}} 'earth, ground', which is shared by the two branches of the family, though also by neighboring languages such as [[Kwadi language|Kwadi]].

==Features==
Honken &amp; Heine (2010) reconstruct six click families for Kx'a: the five that occur in the most conservative dialects of ǃKung, plus the bilabial clicks of ǂHoan. [[Bilabial click]]s became dental in ǃXun; [[retroflex click]]s became lateral in ǂHoan and northern ǃXun, alveolar in southern ǃXun, and remained retroflex only in central ǃXun. However, [[Georgiy Starostin|Starostin]] (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Starostin G. (2003) [http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/khoilex.pdf A lexicostatistical approach towards reconstructing Proto-Khoisan], page 22. ''Mother Tongue'', vol. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the bilabial clicks are a secondary development in {{IPA|ǂHoan}}. He cites the {{IPA|ǂHoan}} words for 'one' and 'two', {{IPA|/ŋ͡ʘũ/}} and {{IPA|/ʘoa/}}, where no other Khoisan language has a labial consonant of any kind in its words for these numerals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8056">[[File:Breton dialectes.svg|thumb|[[Linguistic boundary of Brittany]] between Celtic-speaking (west) and Romance-speaking (east) Brittany.]]

A '''language border''' or '''language boundary''' is the line separating two language areas. The term is generally meant to imply a lack of mutual intelligibility between the two languages. If two adjacent languages or dialects are mutually intelligible, no firm border will develop, because the two languages can continually exchange linguistic inventions; this is known as a [[dialect continuum]].  A "language island" is a language area that is completely surrounded by a language border.

==Important concepts==
The concept of [[mutual intelligibility]] is vague. More important, the ability to distinguish languages from one another can also be difficult, since some languages share writing systems but are spoken differently and some are identical when spoken but are written using different alphabets. There are often also shared terms between two languages even between languages that have nothing to do with each other.&lt;ref name="(2)"&gt;Urciuoli, Bonnie. "Language and Borders." ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 24, (1995), pp. 525–546. This article discusses the role of language and nationalistic identity and its role near the border. It explores whether or not people tend to make a connection between nationalism and language.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Spanish is spoken in most Central American and South American countries, but also in Spain. There are subtle but recognizable differences between the dialects, but there are different dialects even within the country of Spain. In many cultures there are still subtle differences between the terminology (called the [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]) used when talking to your boss and talking to your mother or talking to your friends.&lt;ref name="(4)"&gt;Eastman, Carol M. ''Codeswitching''. Multilingual Matters Ltd., 1992. Discusses the implications of codeswitching and its acceptability based upon where the utterance occurs. Indicates the mixture of languages and borrowing of words throughout any area. Explores the differences between codeswitching and borrowing, and the views that speakers have on these two phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; So where are the language borders?

==Difficulties==
[[File:Map Languages CH.png|thumb|[[Röstigraben]] in Switzerland]]
There can also be people within a country who speak the "native" language of a different country, some of whom may be [[bilingual]].&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; Also, an inherited language may evolve and perhaps absorb some of the characteristics or terms of the new area's predominant language. In cases such as these, it becomes even more difficult to identify specific languages.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; 

When speakers have a foreign accent, they are often perceived to be less intelligent and are less likely to be hired.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "(3)"&gt;Hidalgo, Margarita. "Language Contact, Language Loyalty, and Language Prejudice on the Mexican Border." ''Language in Society'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (June 1986), pp. 193–220. This article is about the role of language and code-switching in Juarez, Mexico. It researches the impact of English versus Spanish and their roles in society, including the social ramifications of language usage and the prevalence of codeswitching. It includes interviews of many Juarez residents concerning their feelings toward the use of English and Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same with an accent from a peripheral area, rather than the accent from the urbanized core: a peripheral person is typically perceived as speaking a "less correct" by those who are more educated,&lt;ref name="(4)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(1)"&gt;Woolard, Kathryn A. and [[Bambi B. Schieffelin]]. "Language Ideology." ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 23, (1994), pp. 55–82. This article explores the role of language in ideological and political identity. It researches the ways in which dialects and grammar can affect perceptions in society. It investigates the implications of using a particular type of communication in a certain setting.&lt;/ref&gt; while those who are not as educated do not perceive any difference in the "correctness".&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt; Colonial histories could also help this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt;

A well-known example of a language border is the border between [[Romance languages]] and [[Germanic languages]] that stretches through [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Italy]].

==Politics and language borders==
===European expansion===
However, it is important to remember that language borders do not always reflect political borders; the tendency to correlate language with ethnicity is a common error&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt; that seems to have its basis during the period of 19th century European expansion&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt; (e.g., the term ''Anglo'' in Mexico and the southeastern U.S., or the term ''Angrez'' – literally, "English" – in North India). The usage of a particular language can reflect positively or negatively on its speaker depending upon the situation. For example, there is perception that only English speakers are American and only non-Americans are non-English-speakers.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; It is suspected that this assumption began because states would have "official" languages for the purposes of book publishing and therefore for the purposes of education, so intelligence would come to be associated with speaking the language that was written.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt;
Because of this idea, there are also often social benefits which result from being able to speak English.&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt; A prime example of this is the prevalence of bilingualism near the U.S.–Mexican border,&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt; which also indicates the porosity of the border and illustrates the difficulty of drawing a "border" around all speakers of a given language, especially because there is not usually much correlation between ethnicity and language.&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt; Such common bilingualism leads to the practice of code-switching, or the changing freely between languages while speaking&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; although this trait is somewhat looked down upon&lt;ref name="(4)"/&gt; because those living in areas of frequent code-switching seem to develop a sort of language loyalty.&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt;

===Colonialism===
Another example of the difference between language borders and political borders is the spread of languages via colonialism, causing languages to be spoken in multiple, not necessarily adjacent countries.&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt;

===Other examples===
Although language borders and political borders do not always agree, there have been instances where political leadership has attempted to enforce language borders.&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt; One instance of this is the passing of [[Bill 101]] in [[Quebec]], Canada, which declared French to be the only official language of the area.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; Another similar example is that of Ciudad Juarez on the American–Mexican border, where social efforts have been made to curb the amount of American influence taking place—but at the same time, as in other foreign cultures, the class benefits of English proficiency are acknowledged and to this end schools teach in English and many television channels are in English.&lt;ref name="(4)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(3)"/&gt; There are also instances of intolerance to the speaking of Native American languages at some schools, thus forcing those students to create small communities in which they can speak their native language, thereby creating "language boundaries" on a very small scale.&lt;ref name="(2)"/&gt; Examples like these illustrate the impact that language boundaries can have on cultural boundaries, even if they are not necessarily one and the same.&lt;ref name="(1)"/&gt;

[[File:Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brock Lesnar]] being accompanied by his "Advocate", [[Paul Heyman]]]]
In [[professional wrestling]], a '''manager''' is a [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|supporting character]] paired with a wrestler (or wrestlers) for a variety of reasons. A [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] woman accompanying, or "seconding", a male wrestler to a match is sometimes referred to as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Valet|valet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=elWutuNtfUMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=manager+professional+wrestling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX4tez0q7XAhWHQZoKHcNSBWgQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=manager%20professional%20wrestling&amp;f=false | title=Professional Wrestling: Sport and Spectacle | author=Mazer, Sharon | year=1998 | pages=136 | isbn=1604736550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performers who assume this role may be non-wrestlers, occasional wrestlers, older wrestlers who have retired or are nearing retirement, or new wrestlers who are breaking into the business (or a specific company) and need experience in front of the crowds. The wrestler who is paired with a manager may be referred to as his or her charge, client, or ward. A professional wrestling manager has nothing to do with their [[Talent agent|real-world counterpart]] or with a promotion's [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#agent|road agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/717877-pro-wrestling-10-greatest-managers-of-all-time | title=Pro Wrestling 10 greatest Managers of all time | publisher=Bleacher Report | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managers are somewhat like [[kayfabe|storyline]] [[Talent agent|agent]]s for an [[actor]] or an [[Sportsperson|athlete]]; they help their client to book matches and appearances, and otherwise work to further and guide their career. Within the context of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]], the manager positions their client for [[Championship (professional wrestling)|title opportunities]], generally acts as a mouthpiece on their behalf, decides whom to trust as an ally, or even just acting as an exposed [[Achilles' heel]] to be exploited by their client's opponents. Managers could be utilized by a promotion's [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#B|booker]] to instigate and strengthen storylines; their involvement could form the center of a controversy, for instance if they double-cross their clients or inadvertably cause the loss or forfeiture of their clients' championship titles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/top-15-hottest-old-school-wrestling-valets/ | title= Top 15 Hottest Old School Wrestling Valets| author=Rock, Rob | publisher = TheSportster.com|date = 28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Outside of storylines, a manager's job is to help the wrestler they're paired with [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#O|get over]].  The manager would cut [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]]s on behalf of clients who may not be as charismatic (or had [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]s depicting them as silent, or with limited ability to speak [[English language|English]]). As such, successful managers almost invariably had the "[[Blarney Stone|gift of the gab]]", though it wasn't unheard of to see managers paired with wrestlers who had no trouble cutting their own promos. A notable example of this would be [[CM Punk]], who was managed by [[Paul Heyman]] from 2012 to 2013. Punk had no trouble cutting his own promos, but Heyman would also cut his own promos alongside Punk in support of his client's act.

While the basic goal of a manager to give his or her wrestlers a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] does not change, the tactics depend on several factors, especially alignment. Managers, when used judiciously, are capable of completely change the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match. A heel manager, for example, may instruct their clients to constantly duck tougher opponents or interfere in their matches to secure a win by cheating. A [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|interview time]] talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they've worked with, can change a wrestler's alignment, making them a sudden fan favorite or heel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/7-things-learn-pro-wrestling-manager | title=7 Things You Learn as a Pro Wrestling manager | publisher=What Culture | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a "handler." If a wrestler's character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behaviour of a "wild" wrestler's who is prone to "go out of control". A classic example of this was [[The Undertaker]], who in his early [[The Undertaker#Debut and various feuds .281990.E2.80.931994.29|Deadman]] persona could only be controlled by [[Paul Bearer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.therichest.com/sports/wrestling/top-20-greatest-managers-in-pro-wrestling-history/ | title=Top 20 Greatest Managers in Pro Wrestling History | publisher=The Richest | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker's powers. A legitimate example is [[Arnold Skaaland]], who not only managed [[Andre The Giant]] for a time but was once assigned by promoter [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite| url=https://drunkard.com/10_06_andre_giant/174735832588632/| title=The Greatest Drunk on Earth: Andre the Giant | publisher= Modern Drunkard Magazine| author=English, Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A few managers, like [[Paul Ellering]], are [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#legit|legitimate]] managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1fsWqWR0V8 | title=Jim Cornette on "Precious" Paul Ellering Legitimately Managing the Road Warriors in NWA/WCW | author=Cornette, Jim | date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others, such as [[Jim Cornette]] or [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.

== History ==
[[File:Jimmy Hart.jpg|thumb|upright|Veteran wrestling manager [[Jimmy Hart]]]]
In the [[History_of_professional_wrestling#1887%E2%80%931950s|early years of pro wrestling]], the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like [[Miss Elizabeth]], [[Sherri Martel]] and [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] made their debuts during the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers. 

Up until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: "getting [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]." During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include "The Mouth of The South" [[Jimmy Hart]] in Memphis, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]], and the "Three Wise Men" ([[Lou Albano]], [[Freddie Blassie]], and [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]) in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now the WWE)&lt;ref name ="Managers"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1114/567352/views-from-the-turnbuckle-a-look-at-histories-greatest-managers/| title=Views From The Turnbuckle: A Look At Histories Greatest Managers, Managers Today And More | publisher= Wrestling Inc| author=Collings, Jesse | date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

By the 2000's, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by [[Professional wrestling authority figures|people who hold on-screen power]] as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions&lt;ref name ="Managers" /&gt;. However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as [[Paul Heyman]] and [[Vickie Guerrero]] have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.geek.com/news/professional-wrestlings-best-managers-1639645/| title=Professional wrestling’s best managers | publisher= Geek.com| author=Sitterson, Aubrey | date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although managers and valets are terms used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is usually depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler's career, while the latter may serve as little more than [[Attractiveness#Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)|eye candy]] and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]]s with their [[Sexual attraction|sex appeal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=95ZzAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=valet+eye+candy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=59_foYEYnD&amp;sig=EWnTOH3U-WPGZWaxRQBJC_G55QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWoNq4z9fYAhXKxLwKHTPOB5wQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=valet%20eye%20candy&amp;f=false | title=A Fool for Old School ... Wrestling, That is | author=Berger, Richard | isbn=	0981249809}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cut promos]] on their associated wrestler's behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits&lt;ref name="Valet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/do-valets-still-have-a-place-in-pro-wrestling.html | title=Do Valets still have a place in pro wrestling | publisher=Paste Magazine | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;; other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it.

In spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/old-school-wrestling-8-specialty-matches-we-loved-and-7-we-hated/ | title=Old-School Wrestling: 8 Specialty Matches We Loved And 7 We Hated | author=Rock, Rob | publisher = TheSportster.com|date = 28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], [[Trish Stratus]], and [[The Fabulous Moolah]]&lt;ref name="Valet"/&gt;. 

Male supporting characters who fit the original definition of a [[valet]] are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was [[Ricardo Rodriguez (wrestler)|Ricardo Rodriguez]], who performed as [[Alberto Del Rio]]'s on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/81002/five-moves-of-news-headlines-from-the-world-of-pro-wrestling| title=Five Moves of News: Headlines From the World of Pro-Wrestling!| author=Mateja, Jesse | publisher = Den Of Geek|date = 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare&lt;ref name="Valet"/&gt;.
[[File:Christian cage 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Travis Tomko|Tomko]] (left) working as [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]'s enforcer]]
While they are not managers in the traditional sense, [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#enforcer|enforcers]] — full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring — also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care.  Larger but less charismatic wrestlers are conventionally booked in the role of an enforcer; this is done so that these wrestlers can get over with the crowd by sharing the charisma of the wrestler they accompany. A wrestler can also be the enforcer for an entire stable, traditionally serving as the biggest and strongest individual in the group (if not the entire promotion). In this scenario, the enforcer is utilized to "protect" the leader of the faction, and is often relegated to tag team matches to help them get over with the fans. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. [[The Acolytes Protection Agency]] (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference.

Perhaps the best-known example in professional wrestling history is [[Arn Anderson]], whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] stable as "The Enforcer". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.postandcourier.com/staff/mike_mooneyham/arn-anderson-was-heart-of-the-horsemen/article_bf908834-3c67-52b4-9170-29bde4a5875b.html| title=Arn Anderson was heart of the Horsemen| author=Mooneyham, Mike | publisher = The Post and Courier|date = July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. {{ISBN|9780827607521}}. p.&amp;nbsp;209.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Russian author and translator who wrote in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

Markel-Mosessohn was born in Volkovyshki, in the [[Russian Empire]] (today, [[Vilkaviškis]], Lithuania), the daughter of a wealthy Jewish merchant, Shimon Wierzbolowki, and his wife Ḥayyah.&lt;ref name=Balin-EncyclJudaica/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balin-JWA"&gt;Balin, Carole B. (March 1, 2009). "[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/markel-mosessohn-miriam  Miriam Markel-Mosessohn]." ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. Jewish Women's Archive. www.jwa.org. Retrieved 2016-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; She had two brothers, Yosef and Shmuel, and a sister, Devorah; both the daughters and the sons of the family attended the local Jewish school, where they learned to read and write Hebrew; although she did not attend [[cheder]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the traditional elementary school where young boys studied the [[Chumash (Judaism)|chumash]] (the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; her father hired a private tutor so that she could pursue her desire to study scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, at the age of 12, she moved with her family to Suvalk (today, [[Suwałki|Suwałki, Poland]]), in the part of the empire known as [[Congress Poland]], where she continued her Hebrew studies under the Hebraist [[Judah Loeb Paradiesthal]].&lt;ref name="Kayserling"&gt;[[Meyer Kayserling|Kayserling, Meyer]] (1879). "[http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/pageview/539686 Mirjam (Markel) Mosessohn]" {{de icon}}.  In: Kayserling, ''Die jüdischen Frauen in der Geschichte, Literatur und Kunst''. Leipzig: Brockhaus. p.&amp;nbsp;311–312; here: p.&amp;nbsp;311. As Balin (2000) notes (p.&amp;nbsp;32), Kayserling's entry on Markel-Mosessohn was inaccurate on several points, especially in his mistaken assumption that she had children, and that her parental responsibilities were what hindered her from publishing more than she did.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balin-2000-p28"&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; During her two and a half years of study under Paradiesthal he also instructed her in  [[German language|German]] and, to a lesser extent, [[French language|French]] languages and literatures.&lt;ref name="Kayserling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balin-2000-p28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldstein"&gt;Waldstein, A. S.; Rosenthal, Herman (1905). "[https://archive.org/stream/jewishencycloped09sing#page/94/mode/2up Mosessohn (Markel), Miriam (née Wiersbolowsky)]". In: Isidore Singer (Ed.), ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;9. New York: Ktav Publishing House. p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; When he left to take a position as a tutor in Warsaw, Markel-Mosessohn continued her Hebrew studies independently, shifting her focus from formal study of the language to intensive reading of whatever Hebrew works she could obtain; in this way she absorbed the products of the [[Revival of the Hebrew language|Jewish cultural revival]] then under way.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1860s she began focusing her efforts on translation of works into Hebrew, and completed a Hebrew version of [[Ludwig Philippson]]'s German-language historical [[novella]] ''Der Flüchtling aus Jerusalem'' (in manuscript).&lt;ref name="Waldstein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Anshel Markel-Mosessohn (1844&amp;ndash;1903), of Kovno ([[Kaunas]], Lithuania), in 1863, when she was 24 and he 19.&lt;ref name="Hearts31"&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband corresponded in Hebrew and shared an interest in the Hebrew revival; he was supportive of her writing, as well as of her efforts to publish her work.&lt;ref name=Hearts-p32&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; She assisted him in his business dealings at points.&lt;ref name=Hearts-p32/&gt; The two remained married for forty years, until Anshel Markel-Mosessohn's death, in 1903; they never had children.&lt;ref name=Hearts-p32/&gt;

In 1869 she published the first volume of ''Ha-Yehudim be-Angliya'', her elegant Hebrew translation of {{Interlanguage link multi|Isaac Ascher Francolm|de}}'s ''Die Juden und die Kreuzfahrer unter Richard Löwenherz'', a historical work about the [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]] in the era of the [[crusades]], under [[Richard I of England|Richard I ('the Lionheart')]].&lt;ref name="Balin-JWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldstein"/&gt; The second volume was not published until 1895 (both volumes appeared in Warsaw).&lt;ref name=Balin-EncyclJudaica/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balin-JWA"/&gt; Poor health and financial problems were at least partially the cause for the long delay in her bringing the second volume to completion.&lt;ref name=Balin-EncyclJudaica/&gt;

Over the course of her life Markel-Mosessohn corresponded with three prominent ''[[maskil]]im''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; her male colleagues in the Hebrew revival&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Abraham Mapu]], [[Judah Leib Gordon]], and [[Moses Lilienblum]].&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Mapu was the first fellow Hebrew writer with whom she initiated a correspondence, in 1861, writing to him in Hebrew and enclosing an original piece of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;30&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded appreciatively, complimenting the lucidity of her style and dubbing her a "maskelet", or enlightened woman.&lt;ref name="Hearts31"/&gt; They exchanged a handful of letters over the next year or two, and also met briefly in person on two occasions, in 1861, and again in 1866 or 1867, both times at Mapu's home in Kovno.&lt;ref name="Hearts31"/&gt;

Markel-Mosessohn wrote to Judah Leib Gordon for the first time in 1868, after she had completed a draft of the first part of ''Ha-Yehudim be-Angliya'', her translation of Francolm's work.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon responded enthusiastically to the translation; he assisted her in finding a publisher, and contributed a laudatory preface to the published volume.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; Their correspondence spanned 20 years, and reflected a mutually supportive friendship, although they never met in person.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Gordon dedicated to her his poem  "Kotzo shel yud" (The tip of the [letter] yud), which evokes empathy for a modern-day woman trapped by oppressive strictures of Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;14-15, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later she acknowledged the honor, while writing to him for moral support, at a time when her husband had been imprisoned in connection with questionable financial dealings.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1870s Markel-Mosessohn became more involved than before in her husband's business affairs, and moved several times, at one point staying three years

She renewed her correspondence with Gordon in 1887, when she had completed the second volume of her Hebrew translation of Francolm's ''Die Juden und die Kreuzfahrer unter Richard Löwenherz''; she requested he write a few lines for the preface of her book, and he readily complied, as pleased with the second as he had been with the first volume.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1887, upon Gordon's urging, Markel-Mosessohn hesitantly agreed to become the Viennese correspondent for the Hebrew newspaper ''[[Ha-Melitz]]'' (The advocate), of which he was then editor.&lt;ref name="Balin2000p40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balin-JWA"/&gt; Between May and July 1887 she published four progressively more developed articles, the last two being, respectively, a report detailing the appearance of political [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] during the latest Hungarian elections in the village of [[Tiszaeszlár]], where a [[blood libel]] had occurred five years before, in 1892; and a feuilleton about summer in Vienna, and Viennese Jewry more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Balin (2000), ''To Reveal Our Hearts'', p.&amp;nbsp;42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
There are two [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] in Muinane: high and low.

==Grammar==
Word order in Muinane is generally [[subject–object–verb|SOV]].  Case marking is [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]].

==Writing System==
Muinane is written using a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]].  A chart of symbols with the sounds they represent is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!Latin!!IPA!!Latin!!IPA!!Latin!!IPA!!Latin!!IPA!!Latin!!IPA!!Latin!!IPA
|-
|a||{{IPA|/a/}}||b||{{IPA|/b/}}||c||{{IPA|/k/}}

*Palatalized consonants are written using the unpalatalized forms plus y: ty {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, dy {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, ry {{IPA|/rʲ/}}.  For the purposes of alphabetization, these are considered sequences of letters.
*Tone is not generally indicated in writing.  When it is shown, it is indicated by an acute accent over the vowel: á, é, í, ɨ́, ó, ú.
*The Muinane writing system is based on [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography.  For that reason, the sound {{IPA|/k/}} is written as '''c''' before a, ɨ, o, and u and as '''qu''' before e and i.  Likewise, the sound {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is written as '''gu''' before e and i, and '''g''' elsewhere.

|L.K. Advani|{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend92.htm |title=The Constitution (One-hundredth Amendment) Bill, 2003}}}}

The bill, as introduced, was referred to the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, which presented its report to the [[Rajya Sabha]], recommending that the Bill be passed in the present form. The Report was laid on the table of the Lok Sabha on 5 December 2003. The Bill was debated by the Lok Sabha on 22 December 2003 and passed on the same day, with a formal amendment changing the short title from "One-hundredth" to "Ninety-second". During the consideration of the Bill in the House, an amendment was moved by L.K. Advani to include three other languages, namely, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri in the Eighth Schedule. The amendment was adopted by the House, and a newly substituted section 2 provided for inclusion of Bodo as Entry No. 3, Dogri as Entry No. 4, Maithili as Entry No. 10, Santhali as Entry No. 18 and also for consequential re-numbering of the existing entries, accordingly.&lt;ref name="Constitution Amendment in India"/&gt; The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 23 December 2003.&lt;ref name="Constitution Amendment in India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Government to bring comprehensive legislation on languages|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/12/24/stories/2003122406841100.htm|work=The Hindu|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=24 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the Lok Sabha on 22 December, Advani stated that the constitutional amendment to include Bodo was "in pursuance of a very valuable Memorandum of Settlement arrived at between the representatives of the Bodo community, the Government of Assam and the Government of India". A part of the settlement was that the Government of India would consider inclusion of Bodo language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/786004/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janeshwar Mishra]], [[Samajwadi Party]] Rajya Sabha MP, stated that no Indian language could flourish as long as the recognition given to English remained. Reacting to the demand for substituting [[English language|English]] with any other Indian language, Advani stated that it was necessary that both English and Hindi co-exist for the unity of the country, stating, "National unity is more important than language issue." He further stated that de-linking from English was not a good thing, as he felt that knowledge of English gave India an advantage over [[China]] in the [[Information technology in India|Information Technology sector]]. [[Laxmi Mall Singhvi]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] Rajya Sabha MP, stated that the legislation's intention was not to reduce the impact or acceptability of [[Hindi]] by including more languages in the Eighth Schedule.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;

[[Indian National Congress|Congress]] member [[Pranab Mukherjee]], stated that while he had no objection to any language being included in the Eighth Schedule, the Government should have consulted the Standing Committee to bring "a comprehensive and well thought-out legislation". He further added that, "piecemeal legislations as this would only create rift in the country". [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]] member Chandrakala Pandey named more than a dozen languages that she believed should be included in the Eighth Schedule. SP member Rama Shankar Kaushik felt that the Government needed to differentiate between "''Bhasaha aur Boli''" (language and dialect), stating, "If you cease to differentiate between language and dialect, you will end up reducing the status of Hindi as the official language and that will create tension on the basis of language." [[Rashtriya Janata Dal|RJD]] chief [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]] felt that inclusion of a language or dialect in the Eighth Schedule should be done carefully and comprehensively to ensure that there was no dispute on the language medium of examinations, finding teachers, and programmes on radio and television.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;

[[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] member S. Viduthalai Virumbi stated that Hindi was not a "majority language", and demanded that the official language of a State be included as official language of the country. Verumbi was interrupted by SP member [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], who objected to opposition to Hindi, saying, "I respect [[Tamil language|Tamil]] but to oppose Hindi is not correct."&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;

The bill received assent from then President [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] on 7 January 2004, and came into force on the same date.&lt;ref name="Constitution Amendment in India"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/amendment.htm |title=The Constitution (Amendment) Acts |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was notified in ''[[The Gazette of India]]'' on 8 January 2004.&lt;ref name="Constitution Amendment in India"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Adivasi]] youths celebrated the passage of the 92nd Amendment by bursting crackers and distributing sweets at various tribal-dominated areas such as Karandih, Parsudih, Kadma and [[Birsanagar]].&lt;ref name = "thetelegraph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joy greets language victory|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1031223/asp/jamshedpur/story_2709439.asp|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=23 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BJP Lok Sabha MP from [[Mayurbhanj district|Mayurbhanj]], [[Odisha]], Salkhan Murmu termed the day that the bill passed as historic for tribal people. Murmu further expressed that the long-cherished dreams of the tribals had been fulfilled, saying, "This is the first time that the Adivasis have got recognition". Murmu had tabled the proposal for the inclusion of the Santhali language in the Eighth Schedule in the Lok Sabha. Murmu stated that he would now fight for the inclusion of other tribal languages like Ho, Kuruk and Munda in the Eighth Schedule.&lt;ref name = "thetelegraph"/&gt;

President of [[Jharkhand Disom Party]] (JDP) women cell Sumitra Murmu stated that the long battle which Salkhan initiated 20 years ago for the inclusion of the language in the Eighth Schedule had been won. [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]] chief [[Shibu Soren]] described inclusion of Santhali language as "not surprising", saying, "It was a political decision and had to happen some day."&lt;ref name = "thetelegraph"/&gt;

The [[Ojibwe language]] is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian language]] spoken throughout the [[Great Lakes]] region and westward onto the northern plains. It is one of the largest American Indian languages north of Mexico in terms of number of speakers, and exhibits a large number of divergent dialects. For the most part, this article describes the Minnesota variety of the Southwestern dialect. The orthography used is the [[Ojibwe language#Writing system|Fiero Double-Vowel System]].

Like many American languages, Ojibwe is [[polysynthetic]], meaning it exhibits a great deal of [[Synthetic language|synthesis]] and a very high [[morpheme]]-to-word ratio (e.g., the single word for "they are Chinese" is ''aniibiishaabookewininiiwiwag'', which contains seven morphemes: elm-&lt;small&gt;PEJORATIVE&lt;/small&gt;-liquid-make-man-be-&lt;small&gt;PLURAL&lt;/small&gt;, or approximately "they are leaf-soup [i.e., tea] makers"). It is [[agglutinative language|agglutinating]], and thus builds up words by stringing morpheme after morpheme together, rather than having several affixes which carry numerous different pieces of information.

Like most Algonquian languages, Ojibwe distinguishes two different kinds of third person, a ''proximate'' and an ''obviative''. The proximate is a traditional third person, while the obviative (also frequently called "fourth person") marks a less important third person if more than one third person is taking part in an action. In other words, Ojibwe uses the obviative to avoid the confusion that could be created by English sentences such as "John and Bill were good friends, ever since the day he first saw him" (who saw whom?). In Ojibwe, one of the two participants would be marked as proximate (whichever one was deemed more important), and the other marked as obviative.

==Gender==
Rather than a [[Grammatical gender|gender]] contrast such as masculine/feminine, Ojibwe instead distinguishes between [[Animacy|animate]] and [[Animacy|inanimate]]. Animate nouns are generally living things, and inanimate ones generally nonliving things, although that is not a simple rule because of the cultural understanding as to whether a noun possesses a "spirit" or not (generally, if it can move, it possesses a "spirit"). Objects with great spiritual importance for the Ojibwe, such as rocks, are very often animate rather than inanimate, for example. Some words are distinguished purely by their noun class; for example, ''mitig'', if it is animate (plural ''mitigoog''), means "tree;" if it is inanimate (plural ''mitigoon''), it means "stick."

==Number==
[[Grammatical number|Number]] in Ojibwe is a simple singular/plural contrast. Nouns and pronouns can be either singular or plural, and verbs inflect for the number of their subject and object, although some nouns and verbs lack singular forms. Plural forms differ from word to word depending on the word's gender, root, and historical stress. By examining the plural form of the word, one can generally determine the word's gender and root. Animate plurals end in ''-g'', while inanimate plural nouns (and obviative nouns) end in ''-n''. The [[underlying form]] of a root determines the "linking vowel" — the vowel that appears before the plural suffix (''-g'' or ''-n'') but after the root itself.

==Person==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Anishinaabe language]] --&gt;
There are seven Ojibwe inflectional categories expressing [[Grammatical person|person]]/gender combinations for each of the two numbers (singular and plural).&lt;ref name="NRG122"&gt;{{harv|Valentine|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the singular and plural categories do not always exactly correspond.  The total number of 14 "persons" arises from taking into consideration all the contrasts of animate/inanimate, proximate/obviative, and singular/plural.

Characteristics of the resulting 14 persons are built into Ojibwe nouns and pronouns, thus dictating which verb forms would be used in speech.  In nouns and verbs, all 14 forms of persons may or may not present themselves, as words are divided as either animate or inanimate genders and very few words exist as both, but all 14 forms of persons generally do appear with pronouns.

==Pronouns==
Ojibwe pronouns, along with distinguishing singular and plural number and first, second, third, and fourth (obviative) persons, also carry a distinction between inclusive and exclusive first person plural. Pronouns may present themselves either as independent words or as series of prefixes and suffixes.

An ''inclusive'' first person plural indicates that the pronoun includes the addressee, i.e., "we including you" (''giinawind''). An ''exclusive'' first person plural indicates that the addressee is not included, i.e., "we excluding you" (''niinawind'').

The other personal pronouns are the first singular ''niin'', second singular ''giin'', third singular ''wiin'', second plural ''giinawaa'', and third plural ''wiinawaa''.

Like the independent words, Ojibwe pronominal prefixes indicate first person with ''n-'', second person with ''g-'' and third person with ''w-''.  However, the associated suffixes for these persons will be different depending on if the word is a verb or a noun.&lt;ref&gt;Kegg, 1990, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
In many Ojibwe-speaking communities, the first person prefix is used without the initial ''n''.  Due to vowel syncope in some communities, those prefixes are further reduced without the initial ''i''.  However, among Saulteaux communities, the first person prefix ''nim-'' and ''nin-'' are instead reduced to ''ni-'', ''nind-'' to ''nid-'' and ''nindo-'' to ''nido-''.

Ojibwe also has a set of [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, distinguishing animate/inanimate, here/there/yonder/over here, singular/plural, and proximate/obviative. The demonstratives differ in their phonetic forms very significantly across Ojibwe dialects and communities, so this table, based on the Minnesota dialect of Southwestern Ojibwe, will not be entirely correct for many speakers:

Ojibwe also has a set of "indefinite" pronouns (''awiiya'', "someone", ''gegoo'', "something," both of which can be preceded by ''gaawiin'' or ''akina'' to mean "no one, nothing" and "everyone, everything," respectively).

In contrast to the Southwestern Ojibwe's demonstrative pronouns, Central Ojibwe, Northwestern Ojibwe and Western Ojibwe—which includes a larger set of obviatives—have a larger set of demonstratives:

==Verbs==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Anishinaabe language]] --&gt;
Ojibwe verbs mark information not only on the subject (their animacy, person, and plurality) but also on the object. There are several different classes of verbs in the language, which differ based on whether they are [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] and whether they take animate or inanimate subjects. These are the main classes:

Verbs mark tenses with prefixes (''gii-'', past, ''ga-'' and ''da-'', future, and ''wii-'', desiderative future), but also can take a myriad of affixes known as "preverbs", which convey a great amount of additional information about an action. For example, the preverb ''izhi-'' means "in such a way," and so its addition to the verb root ''-ayaa-'', "to be," makes the verb ''izhi-ayaa'', "to be a certain way." The preverb ''bimi-'', "along," combines with the verb root ''-batoo-'', "to run," to form ''bimibatoo'', "to run along, run by."  The preferred order of these prefixes are personal prefix, tense prefix, directional prefix, relative prefix, any number of preverbs, and finally the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Kegg, 1990, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the initial syllable may be modified [[Ojibwe grammar#Modifications of sound|by an initial vowel change or by an initial syllable reduplication]].&lt;ref&gt;Kegg, 1990, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols and Nyholm, 1995, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRG155-156"&gt;{{harv|Valentine|2001|pp=155–156, 508–510, 913–915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there are three so-called "orders" of Ojibwe verbs. The basic one is called '''Independent Order''', and is simply the [[indicative mood]]. There is also a '''Conjunct Order''', which is most often used with verbs in [[subordinate clause]]s, in questions (other than simple yes-no questions), and with participles (participles in Ojibwe are verbal nouns, whose meaning is roughly equivalent to "someone who is (VERB), does (VERB)," for example, the word for "traveler," ''bebaamaadizid'', is the third singular conjunct of ''babaamaadizi'', "to travel about," and literally means "someone who travels about"). The final order is the '''Imperative Order''', used with commands and corresponding to the [[imperative mood]].

Negatives are generally introduced by the leading word ''gaawiin'', which is usually translated as "no," before introducing the actual words in their negative form. Negatives are generally formed by adding ''sii'' (or ''zii'') for independent order and ''si'' (or ''zi'') for conjunct order, both adding the negative element immediately after the root but before other suffixes.  The ''sii''/''si'' are found after vowels while the ''zii''/''zi'' are found after ''n''.  In some words, the final consonant is dropped and the ''sii''/''si'' are added to the remaining vowel, in other words the final ''m'' is converted to ''n'' before adding ''zii''/''zi'', yet in other words a linking vowel ''i'' (or ''aa'') is added after the final consonant and then the ''sii''/''si'' added.  Imperatives do not follow the ''sii'' (''zii'')/''si'' (''zi'') pattern.

There are three imperatives in Ojibwe: the ''immediate'' imperative, used to indicate that the action must be completely right away (''nibaan!'', "Sleep (right now)!"), the ''delayed'' imperative, used to indicate that the action should be completely eventually, but not immediately (''nibaakan!'', "Sleep (in a little bit)!"), and the ''prohibitive'' imperative, used to indicate that the action is prohibited (''(gego) nibaaken!'', "Don't sleep!").  Like the negatives, the "k" in ''-k'', ''-ken'', ''-keg'' and ''-kegon'' take on the lenis form and become "g" after ''n''.  Also like the negatives, the general the connector vowel between the imperative suffix and the terminal consonant here is ''i''; however, for ''k''/''g'', the connector vowel instead is ''o''.

All verbs can also be marked for four "modes:" indicative (neutral), [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] (the speaker is unsure about the validity of what they are saying, for example: ''bakade'', "he is hungry," but ''bakadedog'', "he must be hungry; he could be hungry"), preterit (which emphasizes that the action occurred in the past, and is also used to refer to attempted or intended but uncompleted actions, for example: ''imaa ninamadab'', "I'm sitting there," but ''imaa ninamadabiban'', "I was sitting there; I meant to sit there"), or preterit-dubitative (which expresses doubt about a past action: ''imaa namadabigoban'', "she must have sat there; she could have sat there").

===Intransitives===
As an example of some of the Ojibwe verbal distinctions at work, consider the conjugation of positive and negative indicative long-vowel-final VAI verbs (using the example ''nibaa'', "to sleep"):

Passives in intransitives can be expressed by using the &lt;small&gt;INVERSE&lt;/SMALL&gt; marker '''''igw''''', which may undergo a minor structural modification. Some examples of verb final containing the &lt;small&gt;INVERSE&lt;/SMALL&gt; marker '''''igw''''' are:

|}

===Transitives===
Ojibwe, as with other Algonquian languages, also exhibits a [[Direct–inverse language|direct–inverse system]], in which transitive verbs are marked for whether or not the direction of the action follows a "topicality hierarchy" of the language. The topicality hierarchy in Ojibwe is '''2 &gt; 1 &gt; X &gt; 3 &gt; 3’ &gt; 0''', determined by 1) person, 2) gender, and 3) obviation.&lt;ref name="NRG266-265"&gt;{{harv|Valentine|2001|pp=266–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojibwe has no [[Grammatical case|case]] distinctions among agent, patient and experiencer [[theta roles]], so in a transitive verb with two participants, the only way to distinguish subject from object is through direct/inverse/goal suffixes.

''Note: C, N, nN, S and Y are used in some of the tables below to indicate a generic [[consonant]], n\zh varying consonant, n\nzh varying consonant, s\sh varying consonant, and Ø\i varying palatializer, respectively.''

Transitive verbs can become VAI class of verbs by adding the actor-focused &lt;small&gt;DETRANSITIVE&lt;/small&gt; marker '''''ige''''', which modifies the stem in a similar fashion as the &lt;small&gt;INVERSE&lt;/small&gt; marker '''''igw'''''. However, due to differences in dialects, how the actor-focused &lt;small&gt;DETRANSITIVE&lt;/small&gt; marker '''''ige''''' may show up differently.

For the first person and second person &lt;small&gt;GOAL&lt;/small&gt;s, their &lt;small&gt;ACTOR&lt;/small&gt;s are specified if the words are in their '''Independent Order''', and can also be known as '''local direct''' (first person &lt;small&gt;GOAL&lt;/small&gt;) and '''local inverse''' (second person &lt;small&gt;GOAL&lt;/small&gt;). A &lt;small&gt;DIRECT&lt;/small&gt; suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone higher on the person hierarchy on someone lower on the person hierarchy (e.g., by the addressee on the speaker, or by a proximate third person on an obviative):
:{{interlinear|lang=oj-Latn|glossing = no abbr
|top={{lang|oj-Latn|obizindawaan}}
|o- bizindaw -aa -n
|3- listen.to -DIRECT -3OBVIATIVE
|"He listens to the other one."}}

An inverse suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone lower on the person hierarchy on someone higher on the person hierarchy (e.g., by the speaker on the addressee, or by an obviative third person on a proximate):

:{{interlinear|lang=oj-Latn|glossing = no abbr
|top={{lang|oj-Latn|obizindaagoon}}
|o- bizindaw -igoo -n
|3- listen.to -INVERSE -3OBVIATIVE
|"The other one listens to him."}}

As can be seen, the only difference between these two verbs is the direct–inverse opposition, rather than case markers (or word order, when distinct nominals are used). An inverse verb is '''not''' equivalent to a [[grammatical voice|passive]] verb. There is a separate passivity marker, denoted in literature as "indefinite person (X)", ranked in topicality hierarchy below first and second persons, but higher than animate and inanimate third persons:
:{{interlinear|lang=oj-Latn|glossing = no abbr
|top={{lang|oj-Latn|bizindawaa}}
|{} bizindaw -aa
|X- listen.to -DIRECT
|"He is listened to."}}

To illustrate this, a generic VTA and VTI paradigm table, arranged by person hierarchy, is shown below. Note that the reflexive forms shown in a darker background with the reflexive theme '''/-idizo/''' happen to be VAI. The table depicts only the paradigm for Independent Order, Positive Voice, Neutral Mode.

==Preverbs==
Ojibwe language is rich in its use of [[preverb]]s, which is a prefix that comes before verbs, nouns, and particles, to provide an additional layer of meaning. In Ojibwe, there are four classes of preverbs ranked in importance by six degrees:
* class 1—tense, aspect, mode, or syntactic prefix appearing on verbs
** mode-subordinator: 
*** subordinator: gaa-
*** modal: ga[d]-, da-, daa-, ji-, ge[d]-.
** tense-negativity
*** tense: a'- [e'-], gii'- [gaa'-], wii'- [waa'-].
*** negativity: aano-, bwaa-.
* class 2—directional prefix occurring on verbs
* class 3—relational prefix occurring on verbs (and on some nouns and particles): ako- [eko-], onji- [wenji-], izhi- [ezhi-], apiichi- [epiichi-], dazhi- [endazhi-], daso- [endaso-].
* class 4—lexical prefix occurring on verbs, nouns, or particles.
** aspectual
** manner, degree, quality/evaluative, quantitative/numeric

Preverbs, when they occur before a noun, are called a [[prenoun]]. Preverb class units when written are separated with a hyphen, with the exception of the class 4 preverb indicating manner, degree, quality/evaluative, or quantitative/numeric, which can also serve as functional part of a word stem as an initial. If several preverbs of the same class occur, they are written as a single block in order of rank of importance, with the most important preverb located closest to the word. Pronominal prefixes are written directly onto the head of the word group, so it may be found attached directly to the preverb if a preverb is present. When constructed, an Ojibwe word (in the example below, a verb) may have some or all of the pieces in the following form:

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan=5 | prefix || colspan=4 | word stem || colspan=3 | suffix
|-
| pronominal&lt;br&gt;prefix || preverb-&lt;br&gt;(class 1) || preverb-&lt;br&gt;(class 2) || preverb-&lt;br&gt;(class 3) || preverb-&lt;br&gt;(class 4) || verb (initial) || verb (medial) || verb (concrete final)  || verb (abstract final) || negativity || pronominal&lt;br&gt;suffix || mode
|}

Example, using ''nibaa'', "to sleep"

{| class="wikitable"

! English

|-
| nibaa
| he/she sleeps

|-
| ninibaamin
| we sleep
| likewise, with pronominal prefix and pronominal suffix
|-
| '''gii-'''nibaa
| he/she slept
| has past tense preverb (class 1)
|-
| nin'''gii-'''nibaamin
| we slept
| likewise, with pronominal affixes
|-
| '''gii-maajii-'''nibaa
| he/she started to sleep
| has past tense preverb (class 1), and a lexical preverb (class 4)
|-
| nin'''gii-maajii-'''nibaamin
| we started to sleep
| likewise, with pronominal affixes
|}

==Nouns==
Nouns distinguish plurality, animacy, obviation, and case with suffixes. Animacy is only overtly marked on plural nouns. There are no core cases to distinguish categories such as "subject" or "object", but rather various [[oblique case]]s, including a [[Locative case|locative]] (e.g., ''wiisiniwigamig'', "restaurant", ''wiisiniwigamigong'', "in the restaurant") and a [[Vocative case|vocative plural]] (e.g., ''Ojibwedog'', "(you) Ojibwes!"). Other suffixes are: pejorative (e.g., ''jiimaan'', "canoe", ''jiimaanish'', "worthless canoe"), diminutive (e.g., ''zhooniyaa'', "money", ''zhooniyaans'', "coin"), contemptive (e.g., ''odaabaan'', "car", ''odaabaanenh'', "just some old car"), preterit (which marks a deceased or no-longer existent person or object, e.g. ''nookomis'', "my grandmother", ''nookomisiban'', "my late grandmother"), and preterit-dubitative (which marks a deceased or no-longer existent person or object which was never known by the speaker, e.g. ''a'aw mindimooyenh'', "that old woman", ''a'aw mindimooyenyigoban'', "that late old woman I never knew").

Some nouns are considered "[[inalienable possession|dependent]]" and cannot be presented by themselves.  Instead, these dependent nouns are presented with pronoun prefixes/suffixes attached to them.  An example of a dependent noun is ''nookomis'' ("my grandmother") where the dependent root ''-ookomis-'' ("grandmother") must be presented with a pronoun affix, which in this case is ''n-''.

===Verb to noun transforms===
Other nouns are derived from verbs by transforming them to their participle form.  Of the choices, third person (and thus third person plural) is the most common form.  Though each class of verbs may have their own participle-forming patterns, for simplicity, only the VAI neutral mode, positive participles are shown in the example, again, using ''nibaa'' ("sleep").

''Note: C, V, and VV are used in some of the tables below to indicate a generic [[consonant]], a generic short [[vowel]], and a generic long vowel, respectively.''

&lt;small&gt;* For participles, the word experiences [[Ojibwe grammar#Initial vowel change|initial vowel change]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; -nh in [[Ottawa dialect|Odaawaa]].&lt;/small&gt;

Verbs additionally can be transformed into nouns representing concepts by adding ''-win'', or into nouns representing an object by adding ''-gan'' or ''-n''.

===Plurals and obviative===
Plurals and obviative suffixes are the easiest to add to Ojibwe words.  By examining the plural, one can generally determine the underlying root of the word.  Generally, animate plurals end with ''-g'', while inanimate plurals and obviatives end with ''-n''.  Often, a linking vowel is required to join the root to one of these endings.  Underlying ''-w'' or ''-y'' or an augment may affect the choice of linking vowels.

&lt;small&gt;1 In [[Central Ojibwa language|Central Ojibwa]], [[Northwestern Ojibwa language|Northwestern Ojibwa]] and [[Western Ojibwa language|Western Ojibwa]], singular obviative ends with " n " while plural obviative ends with " ' ". This distinction in obviative is not made in other Ojibwe language dialects.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;2 In [[Eastern Ojibwe language]] and in the [[Ottawa language]], [[Ojibwe grammar#Diminutives and Contemptives|contemptive]] plurals are CVVnyig and CVVnyin instead of CVVnyag and CVVnyan.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;3 In [[Oji-Cree language]], this is a " j " and not a " d ".&lt;/small&gt;

===Diminutives and contemptives===
Diminutives in Ojibwe express an idea of something that is smaller or younger version of the noun.  All diminutives are treated as a '''Consonant Stem''' when made into one of the plural forms or into the obviative form, thus taking on the linking vowel ''-a-''.  Contemptives are formed in a similar fashion as diminutives and are used to express negative or depreciative attitude the speaker may have of the noun.  Contemptive plurals and obviatives remain as contemptives, but can take on the linking vowel ''-i-'' to add a possible pejorative.  Many words to express fauna are often in contemptive forms.  In the ''Ojibwemowin'' spoken in [[Wisconsin]] and certain areas of northwestern [[Ontario]], often contemptives are reduced from ''-nh''/''-ny-'' forms to ''-ø''/''-y-''; in Algonquin and in most Northwestern Ojibwe, the contemptives instead is reflected by ''-nzh''.  In Odaawaa, the frequency of contemptives in fauna are higher than in other ''Anishinaabemowin'' dialects.  For example, it is from the ''Daawaamwin'' word '''''jidmoonh''''' ("red squirrel") where the English word "chipmunk" has its origins, while the same word in ''Ojibwemowin'' is '''''ajidamoo'''''.  When contemptive suffix is added for terms of endearment, any other d, t, z and s in the word are changed to j, ch, zh and sh respectively.

===Locatives, possessives and obviation possessor theme===
Locatives indicate a location, and are indicated with ''-ng''.  Locatives do not take on any plurals or obviative suffixes, but obviation possessor or the number can be added before the locative suffix.  Another set of affixes in the Anishinaabe language is indicated by the possessive theme ''-m'' or the obviative possessor theme ''-ni''.  Generally, dependent nouns and nouns ending with either ''-m'' or ''-n'' do not take the possessive theme ''-m''.  A small group of nouns also do not ever take the possessive theme suffix.

Rarely do either the possessive theme ''-m'' or the obviative possessor theme ''-ni'' stand by themselves.  The above examples for the possessive theme ''-m'' were for the first person singular.  For other persons or number, again using the possessive theme ''-m'' as an example, the word is conjugated as following:

===Pejoratives and vocative plurals===
Pejoratives, marked with the ''-sh'' suffix, generally indicates a stronger negative feelings a speaker may have than that of the contemptive.  However, pejorative may also indicate a term of affection.  Some words take on different meaning in the pejorative, such as ''aniibiish'', which means "no good elm" but also means "leaf".  In some dialects, some words are always shown in their pejorative forms, such as ''animosh'' for "dog".

Vocative plurals mimic pejorative conjugation patterns.  It is identified with the ''-dog'' suffix, which in the Ottawa dialect shows up instead as ''-dig'' suffix.

When the diminutive suffix ''ens'' or the affective suffix ''is'', is followed by the other,  the ''s'' becomes ''z'', as in ''izens'' or ''enzis''.  When the pejorative suffix ''ish'' is added to the diminutive suffix ''ens'', combination yields ''enzhish'', while adding the diminutive suffix ''ens'' to the pejorative suffix ''ish'', just as with any other Consonant Stem patterns, yields ''ishens''. In Northwestern Ojibwe dialect when the pejorative suffix ''ish'' is added, any other ''d'', ''t'', ''z'' and ''s'' in the word are changed to ''j'', ''ch'', ''zh'' and ''sh'' respectively.

Singular vocatives do not follow a systematic pattern like plural vocatives do, with various strategies in achieving the vocative case:
{|class="wikitable"
! nominative 
! vocative 
! gloss 
! mechanism for vocative
|-
| ''noos'' || ''noose''! || my father || adding a vowel
|-
| ''Aanji-binesi'' || ''Aanji-bines''! || Changing Bird || dropping the final vowel
|-
| ''Noodinookwe'' || ''Noodinook''! || Wind-woman || dropping the final vowel and medial ''w''
|-
| ''ningashi'' || ''ninga''! || my mother || dropping the final vowel and affective suffix
|-
| ''ningwizis'' || ''ningwis''! || my son || dropping of affective suffix
|-
| ''nookomis'' || ''nooko''! || my grandmother || dropping of affective suffix and the possessive theme ''m''
|-
| ''noozhishenh'' || ''noozis''! || my grandchild || dropping of contemptive suffix and de-palatalize effected affective suffix consonants
|}

However, many irregular forms of achieving the vocative case also exist, including in some dialects unchanged forms such as ''noozhishenh''! (my grandchild) used as a vocative, and vocative beyond the regular changed forms such as ''ninge''! (my mother).

==Adjectives==
Ojibwe has no adjectives per se but verbs that function as adjectives. Thus, instead of saying "the flower is blue," Ojibwe says something like to "the flower blues" (''ozhaawashkwaa waabigwan'') or "be a blueing flower" (''waabigwan-ozhaawashkwaa''). Ojibwe has a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], in some situations, which has a verb (several, in fact) that can be translated as "to be" and used in situations to equate one thing with another. However, a copula is not always used in Ojibwe, such as if [[demonstrative pronoun]]s are used (''jiimaan o'ow'', "this is a canoe").

==Adverbs==
===Particles===
Ojibwe language with its [[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]]ic accent system and relatively atonal word stresses, has any nuance of expressing word emphasis, stress, mood, etc., being expressed by particles like these:
* ''mii'' — discourse sequencer, topical focuser
* ''(i)dash'' — topical shift indicator; may even appear as ''-sh''
* ''(i)go'' — emphasises heightened assertiveness
* ''(i)sa'' — emphasises novelty
* ''(i)sha'' — emphasises contradiction
* ''(i)maa'' — emphasises cooperation (either actual or desired)
* ''(i)naa'' — emphasises evaluative information
* ''wii'' — unexpectedness indicator
The short initial 'i' is omitted typically when following a word or particle ending in a vowel or ending in 'n'.

Other particles may be [[interjection]]s like these:
* ''ambe'' — "come on..."
* ''(a)tayaa'' — "indeed"
* ''(a)was'' — "go away"
* ''boozhoo'' — "hello"
* ''enh'' — "yes"
* ''gaawiin'' — "no"
* ''(i)kawe'' — "hold on..."
* ''miigwech'' — "thank you"
The short initial vowel may be omitted typically in excited speech.

===Counting===
Ojibwe numbers are classified as a [[biquinary]] [[base-10]] system.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;In theory&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Historically, either ''niizh midana'' or ''niizhidana''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Many speakers omit the initial ''n'' (shown in parentheses).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;In Algonquin and Algonquin-influenced communities, ''new'' and ''newin midana'' are used instead of ''niiwin'' and ''niimidana'', respectively.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;In [[Northwestern Ojibwa language|Northwestern Ojibwe]], [[Oji-Cree language|Oji-cree]], and [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]], ''o'' is used instead of ''i'' as the connector vowel for the suffixes ''-midana'' and ''-midanaak''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;In some dialects, such as in parts of [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]], ''zhaang'' is used instead of ''zhaangaswi''; the shorter form was historically recorded as being the more pervasive form, but it now is rarely used.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Richard Rhodes reports that some Algonquin speakers use a connector, ''-di'', before ''-swi'', ''-somidana'', and ''-somidanaak''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;''(n)ingod'' is "one" in [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] but "something" in Ojibwe.&lt;/small&gt;

==Modifications of sound==
Ojibwe initials of words may experience morphological changes under three modification strategies: ''initial consonant change'', ''initial vowel change'' and ''initial syllable reduplication''.

===Initial consonant change===
Ojibwe consonants are divided into lenis and fortis values:
* lenis-fortis pairs: ''′'' - ''h'', ''b''-''p'', ''d''-''t'', ''g''-''k'', ''j''-''ch'', ''z''-''s'', ''zh''-''sh''
* unpaired fortis: ''m'', ''n'', ''w'', ''y'' 

When either the past tense preverb ''gii-'' or the desiritive future tense ''wii-'' is added to a verb, if the verb begins with a lenis consonant, it may change to its fortis counterpart. In some dialects, such as with the Red Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, this rule is suspended if the consonant in the verb's second syllable already contains a fortis consonant. In some dialects as in Odaawaa, this rule is not applied.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ojibwe (without ''gii-'')
! English
! Ojibwe (with ''gii-'')
! English
! Comment
|-
| '''a'''yekozi
| he/she is tired
| gii-'''a'''yekozi
| he/she was tired
| not applicable, as this word begins with a vowel
|-
| '''n'''ibaa
| he/she sleeps
| gii-'''n'''ibaa
| he/she slept
| initial consonant is already a fortis
|-
| '''j'''iibaakwe
| he/she cooks
| gii-'''ch'''iibaakwe
| he/she cooked
| initial consonant changes to its fortis counterpart
|-
| '''j'''aka'ige
| he/she pokes
| gii-'''j'''aka'ige
| he/she poked
| '''Red Lake''': initial consonant is not changed due to a fortis consonant (in this case, '''k''') in the second syllable
|-
| '''zh'''aabobide
| he/she drives through
| gii-'''zh'''aabobide
| he/she drove through
| '''Odaawaa''': this dialect does not implement the initial consonant change
|}

===Initial vowel change===
In general, verbs in conjunct and partitive orders and nouns of subjunctive order change the vowel quality of the first syllable in the manner shown in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
! unchanged
! changed
|-
| ''-a-''
| ''-e-''
|-
| ''-aa-''
| ''-ayaa-''
|-
| ''-e-''
| ''-aye-''
|-
| ''-i-''
| ''-e-''
|-
| ''-ii-''
| ''-aa-''
|-
| ''-o-''
| ''-we-''
|-
| ''-oo-''
| ''-waa-''
|}

However, in some words beginning in ''dan-'', ''dazh-'', ''das-'', ''dash-'' or ''daa-'' instead take on the prefix ''en-'' to form ''endan-'', ''endazh-'', ''endas-'', ''endash-'' or ''endaa-''.  The directional prefix ''bi-'', meaning "over here," instead becomes ''ba-''.

===Initial syllable reduplication===
Words typically conveying repetitive actions have their very first syllable experience reduplication.  Reduplication may be found in both verbs and in nouns.  Vowel syncope process Eastern Ojibwe and Odaawaa experiences happen after the word has gone through reduplication.  The most general reduplication pattern for the initial syllable is ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' but the table below shows the most common reduplication strategies.

{| class="wikitable"
! unchanged
! reduplicated
! unchanged
! reduplicated
|-
| ''a-''
| ''aya-''
| ''Ca-''
| ''CaCa-''
|-
| ''aa-''
| ''aayaa-''
| ''Caa-''
| ''CaaCaa-''
|-
| ''e-''
| ''eye-''
| ''Ce-''
| ''CeCe-''
|-
| ''i-''
| ''ayi-''
| ''Ci-''
| ''CaCi-'' or ''CeCi-''
|-
| ''ii-''
| ''aayii-''
| ''Cii-''
| ''CaaCii-'' or ''CeCii-'' or ''CiiCii-''
|-
| ''o-''
| ''wawo-''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''wawi-''
| ''Co-''
| ''CaCo-''
|-
| ''oo-''
| ''oo'oo-''
| ''Coo-''
| ''CaaCoo-'' or ''CeCoo-'' or ''CooCoo-''
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''ayo-'' in [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]].&lt;/small&gt;

In some words, the reduplicated consonant shifts from their lenis value to their fortis value.  Yet in some stems, initial ''Cw-'' retains the ''-w-'' while others do not.  Those words experiencing the prefix ''en-'' may change to ''in-'' before experiencing reduplication. Other prefixes such as ''gino-'' (long) does not follow the typical ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' pattern, and instead becomes ''gagaano-''.

==Syntax==
As Ojibwe is highly synthetic, word order and sentence structure is relatively free, since a great deal of information is already encoded onto the verb. The subject can go before or after the verb, as can the object. In general, whichever participant is deemed more important or in-focus by the speaker is placed first, before the verb, and the less important participant follows the verb. Ojibwe tends to prefer a VS order (verb–subject) when subjects are specified with separate nominals or pronouns (e.g., ''bakade a'aw asabikeshiinh'', be.hungry that.there.&lt;small&gt;ANIMATE&lt;/small&gt; net.make.&lt;small&gt;PEJORATIVE&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;CONTEMPTIVE&lt;/small&gt;, "that spider is hungry").

In anthropology, a '''pantribal sodality''' is a social grouping which is not determined by family membership (non-kin), and which extends across an entire [[tribe]].  Pantribal [[sodality (social anthropology)|sodalities]] sometimes arise in areas where two or more different cultures overlap and are in regular contact.  Such sodalities are especially likely to develop in the presence of warfare between tribes.  Drawing their membership from different villages of the same tribe, such groups could mobilize men in many local groups for attack or retaliation against another tribe.  

The best examples come from the [[Great Plains]] of North America and from tropical [[Africa]].  During the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada experienced a rapid growth of pantribal sodalities.  This developmental reflected an economic change that followed the spread of horses, which had been reintroduced to the Americas by the Spanish, to the states between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River.  Many Plains Indian societies changed their adaptive strategies because of the horse.

'''Prison of the peoples''' ({{lang-ru|Тюрьма́ наро́дов}}) is a [[phrase]] first used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in 1914. He applied it to [[Russian Empire]], describing the national policy of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brandenberger |first=David |date=2002 |title=National Bolshevism: Stalinist Mass Culture and the Formation of Modern Russian National Identity, 1931-1956 |url= |location= |publisher=Harvard University Press |page= |isbn=9780674009066 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of calling Russia a prison is based on [[Marquis de Custine]]'s book ''[[La Russie en 1839]]''.

{{for|the soteriological term|Effectual calling}}
A '''calling''', in the religious sense of the word, is a religious [[vocation]] (which comes from the Latin for "call") that may be [[professional]] or [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] and, idiosyncratic to different religions, may come from another person, from a divine messenger, or from within oneself.

==History==
The idea of a vocation or "calling" has played a significant role within [[Christianity]]. Since the early days of the Christian faith, the term has applied to candidates for the [[clergy]]. It soon began to be applied to those who felt drawn to a more rigorous observance of their faith through the [[contemplation|contemplative]] lifestyle of the [[hermit]]s and [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Holy See|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Christ's Faithful - Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Martin Luther]] taught that each individual was expected to fulfill his God-appointed task in everyday life. Although the Lutheran concept of the calling emphasized vocation, there was no particular emphasis on labor beyond what was required for one's daily bread. [[Calvinism]] transformed the idea of the calling by emphasizing relentless, disciplined labor. [[John Calvin|Calvin]] defined the role of "the Christian in his vocation", noting that God has prescribed appointed duties to men and styled such spheres of life vocations or callings.&lt;ref name="Calvin"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]] |last=Calvin |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1536 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinists distinguished two callings: a general calling to serve [[God]] and a particular calling to engage in some employment by which one's usefulness is determined.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

The [[Puritan]] minister [[Cotton Mather]] discussed the obligations of the personal calling, writing of "some special business, and some settled business, wherein a Christian should for the most part spend the most of his time; so he may glorify God by doing good for himself".&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Christian at his Calling |last=Mather |first=Cotton |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1701 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mather admonished that it wasn't lawful ordinarily to live without some calling: "for men will fall into "horrible snares and infinite sins".&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt; This idea has endured throughout the history of Protestantism. Almost three centuries after John Calvin's death in 1564 [[Thomas Carlyle]] would proclaim, "The latest [[Gospel]] in this world is, 'know thy work and do it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Past and Present |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1843 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of this religious ethic continues to exert its influence in [[secular]] society. Modern occupations which are seen as vocations often include those where a combination of skill and community help are implied, such as medical, care-giving, and veterinary occupations. Occupations where rewards are seen more in spiritual or other non-financial terms, such as [[religious]] occupations, are also seen as vocations. Borderline occupations, where [[community service]] and more personal reward are more evenly balanced, such as [[politics]], may often be regarded{{By whom|date=April 2011}} as vocations.

==Distinctions among different denominations==
===Catholicism and Orthodoxy===
In both the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], a candidate to the [[diaconate]] and [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] is referred to as being called to this service in the Church. The term is also used for those in [[consecrated life]].

===Protestant churches===
In [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, the decision of a church to invite for appointment a particular minister - to "invite in due form to the pastorate of a church (Presbyterian or Nonconformist)" ([[OED]]) may be referred to as a ''call'', such as ''extending a call to so and so'', and is first cited from 1560 by the OED.&lt;ref&gt;OED, "call", 6b&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Evangelicalism]], the sense of deliberate purpose before God is generally an expected part of the choice to seek ministerial work in the first place and is often referred to as a ''calling'' or ''call''.

===Latter-day Saints===
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] describes a calling as "a duty, position, or responsibility in the Church that is issued to a member by [[Priesthood_(LDS_Church)#Priesthood_leadership_callings|priesthood leaders]].... [it is] an opportunity to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Calling |url=http://mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-beliefs/glossary/glossary-definition/calling |date= |work=Glossary |publisher=[[LDS Church]] |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509080535/http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-beliefs/glossary/glossary-definition/calling |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church uses a lay [[Clergy#Latter-day Saints|clergy]], with no members receiving compensation for the execution of their callings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ludlow | first=Daniel H. | coauthors= | title=Clergy | url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5607 | date=1992 | work=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] | publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] | accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent church leader [[J. Reuben Clark]] said, "In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In the [church], one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Oaks | first=Dallin H. | authorlink=Dallin H.

[[File:Room Service (3771453509).jpg|thumb|200px|Room service]]
'''Room service''' or '''in-room dining''' is a [[hotel]] service enabling guests to choose [[menu]] items for delivery to their hotel room for consumption there, served by staff. Room service is organized as a subdivision within the Food &amp; Beverage Department of high-end hotel and [[resort]] properties. It is uncommon for room service to be offered in hotels that are not high-end, or in [[motels]].

A similar room service may be provided for guests onboard [[cruise ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipdetective.com/ships/princess_star.htm|title=Star Princess|publisher=Shipdetective|language=English|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room service may be provided on a 24-hour basis or be late night service.

Due to the convenience of room service and the [[minibar]], prices charged to the patron are much higher than the hotel's restaurant or [[tuck shop]].

'''S. M. Abdul Jabbar''' (born June 26, 1939, Sathankulam, Tamil Nadu) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] radio broadcaster, cricket commentator, writer and actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.viruba.com/atotalbooks.aspx?id=334|title=காற்று வெளியினிலே|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
S. M. Abdul Jabbar was born into a middle class Muslim family and grew up in the small town of [[Sathankulam]], presently in [[Thoothukudi district]] in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Having relatives in [[Sri Lanka]], he relocated to [[Colombo]] for his higher studies. After completing his education he moved back to India due to the tense [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|political situation]] in Sri Lanka.

== Radio and cricket commentary ==
Born in the [[Golden Age of Radio]], Jabbar became a regular radio listener during his childhood in India and Sri Lanka. He often wrote letters to radio stations about their programs. On one occasion, he wrote a letter to [[All India Radio]] that was critical of its [[Tamil language]] cricket commentary. The letter was read on air, and he was invited to show his skill by providing Tamil commentary of the [[Ranji Trophy]] match between [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]. The opportunity changed his life.

Abdul Jabbar already had considerable experience anchoring Tamil programs for the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] when he joined the AIR [[Chennai]] Tamil commentary team in 1979.&lt;ref name="WI"/&gt; He learned substantially from commentating with Tamil radio pioneer and cricket writer V Ramamurthy. The AIR Tamil commentary team covered every [[Test cricket|test match]] and [[one day international]] played in Chennai, and many of the regional matches. Jabbar's commentary remained popular through the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Indian Express|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/in-search-of-the-beginnings-of-chepauks-walajah-road-end-4850065/|access-date=4 July 2018|date=19 September 2017|title=India vs Australia: In search of beginnings of Chepauk’s Walajah Road End|first=Sandip|last=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a fan base in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka that included [[LTTE]] supremo [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/tamil/en/audiotrack/prabhakarans-appreciation-was-best-award-received-life|title=Prabhakaran’s appreciation was the best award received in life|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he interviewed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Tamil Muslims and the Dravidian Movement: Alliance and Contradictions|first=S|last=Anwar|title=Frontiers of Embedded Muslim Communities in India|isbn=9781136196805|location=London|publisher=Routledge India|pages=199–200|year=2011|editor-first=Vinod K.|editor-last=Jairath}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AIR Tamil commentary team was disbanded in 2004, after which Abdul Jabbar continued providing Tamil commentary for the [[television channels]] [[ESPN]], [[Neo Sports]], [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] and [[Zee TV|Zee]].&lt;ref name="WI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisdenindia.com/almanack-2015/languages-cricket-english-effect/179416|title=Languages of cricket – The English effect|publisher=Wisden India|access-date=4 July 2018|date=10 September 2015|first=Badri|last=Seshadri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In B. R. Ambedkar's various movements, during the writing of the books, [[Indian Constitution]] and [[Hindu code bills]] and [[Dalit Buddhist movement|Buddhist mass conversion]], she helped him from time to time.

==Early life and education==
Savita Ambedkar was born on January 27, 1912 at [[Bombay]] in [[Saraswat]] [[Brahmin]] family. Her birth name was "Sharada". Her mother's name was Janaki and father name was Krishnarao Vinayak Kabir. Her family were a resident of Doors village, located in [[Rajapur, Maharashtra|Rajapur tehsil]] of [[Ratnagiri district]], [[Maharashtra]]. Later, her father came from Ratnagiri to [[Bombay]]. On the Sir Rao Bahadur C. K. Bole Road, near the pigeon in the west of [[Dadar]] The Kabir family had rented a house in Sahru's house in Matruchaya.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2018/06/dr-savita-bhimrao-ambedkar-jinake-lie-ambedkar-se-mahatvpurn-kuchh-bhi-n-tha/|title=डॉ. सविता भीमराव आंबेडकर, जिनके लिए आंबेडकर से महत्वपूर्ण कुछ भी न था|date=2018-06-21|work=फॉरवर्ड प्रेस|access-date=2018-11-13|language=hi-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savita Ambedkar was a brilliant student. Her early education was completed in [[Pune]]. After that, around 1937 she did [[MBBS]] from [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals|Grant Medical College]], Bombay. When her studies were completed, she was appointed as the first class medical officer in a major hospital in [[Gujarat]]. But after a few months of illness, she left his job and returned hime. Her six of eight siblings had [[Inter-caste marriage|inter-caste marriages]]. Those days it was an extraordinary thing for [[Saraswat Brahmin]]. Savita said, "Our family did not oppose inter-caste marriages, because the whole family was educated and progressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P. V.|publisher=Kaushaly Prakashan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=17|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and meeting with Ambedkar ==
[[File:Maisaheb and Babasaheb.jpg|thumb|Maisaheb and Babasaheb]]
At Bombay's [[Vile Parle]], lived a doctor named S.M. Rao who had close links with [[B. R. Ambedkar]]. When Ambedkar came from [[Delhi]] to Bombay, he often used visit the doctor. Sharda Kabir also used to visit Dr. Rao's house as she had a family relation with him. One day Babasaheb Ambedkar had come from Delhi and Dr. Sharada Kabir was also present at that time. Dr. Rao formalized his identity by saying, "This girl of my daughters friend is very clever, while being MBBS, Dr. Malavankar is working as a junior for a well-known doctor .... etc." Babasaheb was then the [[Minister of Labour|Labor Minister]] in the [[Viceroy's Executive Council]]. Until that time Dr. Sharda did not know much about Dr. Ambedkar, except that he is in Viceroy Council member. Dr. Sharada was impressed with Dr. Ambedkar's stunning personality. In his first meeting, she realized that Dr. Ambedkar was an extraordinary and great figure, In this first meeting, Ambedkar inquired about Kabir with apathy. The reason for this was that they were working on the advancement of women. Ambedkar congratulated them. There was also discussion about [[Buddhism]] in this meeting.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P. V.|publisher=Kaushaly Prakashan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=17-18|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second meeting took place in the Advice Room of Dr. Mavalankar. Ambedkar had blood pressure, blood sugar and joint pain at that time. In 1947, during the writing of the [[Indian Constitution]], Bhimrao Ambedkar got health related problems due to [[diabetes]] and high [[blood pressure]]. He did not sleep. having neuropathic pain in the legs, Insulin and some homeopathic medicines could provide relief to some extent. He went to Bombay for treatment. At the same time, Dr. Sharada came closer to Ambedkar during treatment. Ambedkar's first wife, [[Ramabai Ambedkar]], died in 1935 after a long illness. In this way, the rounds of meetings continued. Later correspondence also happened. And Ambedkar had a good life. There was talk of [[literature]], [[society]], [[religion]] etc. Sometimes they also debated. Ambedkar used to listen to Savita's arguments carefully and then respond. In 1947, Ambedkar started worrying about his health. There must be someone to take care of their health. In a letter to [[Dadasaheb Gaikwad]] on March 16, 1948, Ambedkar wrote, "To keep a woman nurse or to take care of the house for service, there will be doubts in people's mind, so marriage is a better way." After the death of Yashwant's mother ''(Ramabai)'', I had decided not to marry, but in today's situation, I will have to give up my decision." Ambedkar took medical service from doctor Sharda Kabir for nature reasons. And both of them decided to get married.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/article/EDT-babasaheb-ambedkar-column-2481860.html|title=डॉ. आंबेडकरांचा बौद्ध धम्म|work=divyamarathi|access-date=2018-11-13|language=mr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P.

==Marriage==
[[File:Dr. B.R. Ambedkar with wife Dr. Savita Ambedkar in 1948.jpg|thumb|right|B.R. Ambedkar and Savita Ambedkar in 1948]]

On 15th April, 1948 Sharda Kabir married Bhimrao Ambedkar. She was 39 and he was 57. After their marriage, she was popularly called "Mai" ([[mother]]) by his followers. As registrar for marriage, Rameshwar Dayal, Deputy Commissioner, was called in Delhi. This marriage was completed as a Civil Marriage under the Civil Marriage Act. Among those who attended this occasion were Rai Sahab Puran Chand, Mr Macy (Private Secretary), Neelkanth, Ramkrishna Chandiwala, Estate Officer Meshram, nephew of Chitre, his wife, Sharda Kabir's brother. Also Home Secretary Banerjee On November 28, 1948, the newly married couple, the then governor-general of India, [[C. Rajagopalachari]], invited them for the ''Sneh Bhoj'' and greeted them. After marriage Sharda adopted the name 'Savita'. But Ambedkar used to call him "Shārū" in old name, which was a word of "Shāradā". They already knew each other's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patrika.com/news/noida/why-there-was-anger-over-baba-saheb-dr-bhimrao-ambedkar-s-second-marriage-news-in-hindi-1553264/|title=जानिये, बाबा साहेब अंबेडकर के दूसरे विवाह पर क्यों फैली थी नाराजगी|work=www.patrika.com|access-date=2018-11-13|language=hi-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P.

After marriage, Savita started serving husband. Ambedkar's health was steadily getting worse. She continued her care with full devotion till the last of Ambedkar's service. Ambedkar mentioned the help he received from wife in a book written on March 15, 1956, in a book ''[[The Buddha and His Dhamma]]''. In this preface, he mentioned that Savita Ambedkar increased his age by 8-10 years. After Ambedkar's death, his close friends and followers removed this role from this book. Its address dates back to 1980 AD. When the Bengali Buddhist author Bhagwan Das published his preface as a "rare preface".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P.

On [[Dhammachakra Pravartan Day|Ashok Vijaya Dashami]] ''(The Day on which Buddhism was accepted by Emperor [[Ashoka the Great]])'' 14 October 1956, Savita Ambedkar accepted [[Buddhism]] along with her husband Bhimrao Ambedkar in [[Deekshabhoomi]], [[Nagpur]]. She was given the initiation of Buddha's Dhamma by the Burmese [[Bhikkhu]] Mahastavir Chandramani giving [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels]] and ''[[Five precepts]]''. After this, B. R. Ambedkar himself initiated Buddhism by giving 500,000 followers of Three Jewels, Five precepts and twenty-two pledges. This oath took place at 9 a.m.. Savita Ambedkar became the first woman to accept Buddhism of this conversion movement.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Allegations and contradictions ==

Many People from Delhi came to meet B. R. Ambedkar at 26, Alipur Road, where Ambedkar was in residence. It wasn't possible that everyone should get a glimpse Ambedkar as he was sick. While on Savita Ambedkar was besides as wife and his doctor she had dual responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P. V.|publisher=Kaushaly Prakashan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=57|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Babasaheb Ambedkar, some Ambedkarites blamed Savita Ambedkar for killing him. She separated from the Ambedkarite movement by describing her as a Brahmin. She took herself up to his farmhouse in Mehrauli in Delhi. The then [[Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] formed a committee to investigate the matter, and that committee released her from the charges after the investigation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loksatta.com/lekha-news/the-buddha-and-his-dhamma-dr-b-r-ambedkar-1594868/|title=उपोद्घाताची कथा..|date=3 December 2017|website=Loksatta.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repatriation with the Dalit movement ==

[[Republican Party of India]] leader [[Ramdas Athavale]] and Gangadhar Gadhe brought her back to the mainstream Ambedkarite movement. Later on, she was separated from him as she grew older. Babasaheb Ambedkar was given the '[[Bharat Ratna]]', the highest civilian award, it was accepted by Savita Ambedkar honoured by the then President [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]] on April 14, 1990. It was his legendary birth anniversary. This award ceremony was held at the Darbar Hall / Ashok Hall of [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maaisahebanche Agnidivya|last=Sukhadeve|first=P.

==Death==
Savita Ambedkar became lonely after her husband's death. Later, she rejoined the Dalit movement for some time. On April 19, 2003, she suffered difficulties in breathing, and was admitted to J.J. hospital. She died on 29 May 2003 at the age of 94 at J.J. Hospital in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2003/05/30/stories/2003053002081300.htm|title=The Hindu : President, PM condole  Savita Ambedkar's death|website=Thehindu.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/mumbai/B-R-Ambedkars-widow-passes-away/amp_articleshow/47838403.cms|title=B R Ambedkar's widow passes away - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], a '''serial''' is a printing format by which a single larger [[Work of art|work]], often a work of [[Narrative|narrative fiction]], is published in smaller, sequential ''installments''. The installments are also known as ''numbers'', ''parts'' or ''fascicles'', and may be released either as separate [[Publication|publications]] or within sequential issues of a [[periodical publication]], such as a magazine or newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism|last1= Law|first1= Graham|editor1-first= Laurel|editor1-last= Brake|editor2-first= Marysa|editor2-last= Demoor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover|chapter= Serials and the Nineteenth-Century Publishing Industry|year= 2009|publisher= Academia Press|location= London|isbn= |page= 567|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA567|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' and ''[[Artamène|Le Grand Cyrus]]''. At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost installments called fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Roger|title=Technology and Economic Exploitation: The Serial as a Form of Narrative Presentation|journal=Wide Angle: A Film Quarterly of Theory, Criticism and Practice|year=1988|volume=10|issue=4|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th and early 20th centuries ==
Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's [[Victorian era]], due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book |title= Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press |last= Law |first= Graham |year= 2000 |publisher= Palgrave |location= New York &amp; Hampshire, UK |isbn= 0-312-23574-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=serial+fiction+victorian+graham+law&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vF6kToWdEqXo0QHN9oSfBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serial%20fiction%20victorian%20graham%20law&amp;f=false | accessdate= October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} Most [[Victorian novels]] first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|13}} The wild success of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature.  During that era, the line between "quality" and "commercial" literature was not distinct.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|31}} Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were [[Wilkie Collins]], inventor of the [[detective fiction|detective novel]] with ''[[The Moonstone]]'' and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who created the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories originally for serialization in ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]'' magazine.

While American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format.&lt;ref name=Lund&gt;{{cite book |title= AMERICAS CONTINUING STORY An Introduction to Serial Fiction, 1850-1900 |last= Lund |first= Michael |year= 1993 |publisher= Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn= 0-8143-2401-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=serialized+fiction+victorian+&amp;ots=VywkLjckG4&amp;sig=XUtZjmFc3-LidHeTA8yBNt6UYRI#v=onepage
| accessdate= October 23, 2011}} As [[Scribner's Monthly]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} As a piece in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' explained in 1878, "Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first."&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|52}} Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were [[Henry James]] and [[Herman Melville]]. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], which was published over a 40-week period by ''[[The National Era]]'', an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue.

Serialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|30}} The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;

In France, [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Eugène Sue]] were masters of the serialized genre. ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' each appeared as a ''[[feuilleton]]''. ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' was stretched out to 139 installments. Eugène Sue's serial novel ''Le Juif errant'' increased circulation of ''Le Constitutionnel'' from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' was serialized in ''[[La Revue de Paris]]'' in 1856.

Some writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. [[Wilkie Collins]], for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German-speaking countries]], the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875.&lt;ref name = Belgum1&gt;Kirsten Belgum: "Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube" in: ''Women in German Yearbook 9'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-8032-9754-8}} pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'' serialized [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' from 1873 to 1877 and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] wrote several serialized novels: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (1885–86), ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1887–89), ''[[The New Woman]]'' (1890–93), and his sole [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894–95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895–96).

In addition, works in late [[Qing dynasty]] China had been serialized. ''[[The Nine-tailed Turtle]]'' was serialized from 1906 to 1910.&lt;ref name=WangDeweip181&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David Der-wei]].

== Late 20th and early-21st centuries ==
With the rise of broadcast—both radio and [[television series]]—in the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success.

The first several books in the ''[[Tales of the City]]'' series by [[Armistead Maupin]] appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as ''[[The Serial]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/marin_a_and_e/book_reviews/article_3f9b2c1e-65b4-11e2-9dd9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=That '70s book|publisher=Pacific Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976; [[Marin County]]), ''Tangled Lives'' (Boston), ''Bagtime'' (Chicago), and ''Federal Triangle'' (Washington, D.C.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915212,00.html |title=The Press: Soap Operas Come to Print |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 8, 1977 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1984, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ragen|first=Brian Abel|title=Tom Wolfe: A Critical Companion|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT:|isbn=0-313-31383-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander McCall Smith]], author of ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel ''[[44 Scotland Street]]'' in instalments every weekday in ''[[The Scotsman]]''. [[Michael Chabon]] serialized ''[[Gentlemen of the Road]]'' in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 2007.

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] prompted some authors to revise a serial format. [[Stephen King]] experimented with ''[[The Plant]]'' (2000), and [[Michel Faber]] allowed ''The Guardian'' to serialise his novel ''[[The Crimson Petal and the White]]''. In 2005, [[Orson Scott Card]] serialized his out-of-print novel ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' in the first issue of his online magazine, ''[[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''. In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel ''[[Corduroy Mansions]]'', with the audio edition read by [[Andrew Sachs]] made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, [[pseudonym]]ous author Wildbow published ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'', which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time.&lt;ref name="Beacon-Villager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/article/20150702/NEWS/150709367|title=Adam Sherman of Maynard publishes web serial|first=Jesse|last=Collings|publisher=Wicked Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/online-exclusive/reading-revolution/2014/02/20/discipline-and-determiniation/|title=Discipline and determination pay off for webserial writer|date=20 February 2014|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow|title=Wildbow is creating Web serials|publisher=[[Patreon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[fan fiction]] on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as [[FanFiction.Net]] and [[Archive of Our Own#Archive of Our Own|Archive of Our Own (AO3)]].

Many aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as [[LiveJournal]], Fictionpress.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fictionpress.com Fictionpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; fictionhub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionhub.io|title = fictionhub|date = |accessdate = |website = fictionhub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wattpad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattpad.com Wattpad]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Many Books Do You Need To Sell To Become A Bestseller?|url=http://www.bookpromotionhub.com/6103/how-many-books-do-you-need-to-sell-to-become-a-bestseller/|website=www.bookpromotionhub.com|publisher=book promotion hub|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/monthly-views-june.jpg|website=wildbow.wordpress.com|title=Thoughts: A Reflection on growth over two years|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jukepopserials.com/ JukePop Serials]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Serial Box&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/6/16849756/serial-box-serialized-books-peak-tv|title=Meet a new kind of book, designed for the age of Peak TV|work=Vox|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serialbox.com/|title=Serial Box is the Newest Medium for Series Drama|website=www.serialbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with iOS&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-serial-stories-jukepop/id579377848?mt=8 JukePop Serials] (iOS)&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jukepop&amp;hl=en JukePop Serials] (Android)&lt;/ref&gt; apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.

==Early life and career==

He produced [[Wizkid (musician)|Wizkid]]'s "[[Love My Baby (Wizkid song)|Love My Baby]]", a song from the artist's debut studio album ''[[Superstar (Wizkid album)|Superstar]]'' (2011). He has been credited for producing "[[Skelewu]]" and "[[Gobe (song)|Gobe]]". He was also the producer behind [[Wande Coal]]'s highly controversial songs "Baby Face" and "Go Low". Shizzi has worked with Sasha, Harrysong, OD Woods, [[Naeto C]], Sauce Kid, [[Wande Coal]], [[Wizkid (musician)|Wizkid]], D'Prince, May D, Danagog, [[Emmy Gee]], Shank and [[Skuki]], among others.

In 2013, he co-produced [[Davido]]'s "Tchelete" with Uhuru/dj maphorisa featuring [[Mafikizolo]]. On 26 June 2014, Shizzi worked alongside Davido, [[Tiwa Savage]], [[Lola Rae]], [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]], [[Diamond Platnumz]] and [[Mi Casa]] to produce [[MultiChoice]]'s Africa Rising campaign song.

A "'''soft target'''" is "a person or thing that is relatively unprotected or vulnerable, especially to military or [[terrorist attack]]."{{Sfn|Oxford Dictionaries Online||}}
==Etymology==
The terms "soft target" and "hard target" are flexible in nature and the distinction between the two is not always clear.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=38}} However, typical "soft targets" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include [[national monument]]s, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers,  movie theaters, [[café]]s and restaurants, [[places of worship]], nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as [[railway station]]s, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}{{Sfn|Preston|1987|}} Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, [[diplomatic missions]], and [[power station]]s.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}

==History==
Terrorist groups almost exclusively choose to strike soft targets.{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=40}} Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|pp=39-40}} The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} [[Clark Kent Ervin]] notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=158}} In 2011, while preparations were being made for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the deputy commissioner of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=103}}

Military and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent.

'''Swarachakra''' (Devanagari: स्वरचक्र) is a free text input application developed by the IDIN group at [[Industrial Design Center]] (IDC), [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay]] for [[Indic scripts]].&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/vruthanta-news/marathi-typing-easily-possible-on-android-phone-550133/ आता अँड्रॉइड फोनवर मराठी टायिपग सहज शक्य]&lt;/ref&gt; Swarachakra's alphabetical keyboard layout performed better than the Inscript layout (a [[QWERTY]]-based design and government standard in India). Currently, it is available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarachakra-marathi.android.informer.com/ Swarachakra Marathi Keyboard - Android Informer.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pressrel"&gt;[http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/mobile/marathi-mobile/articleshow/31050924.cms मराठीसाठी चक्र फिरलं] Maharashtra Times.&lt;/ref&gt; in twelve languages.

Work on other languages is in progress. This is one of the many projects taken up to develop interactive products for developing countries at IDC.

== Motivation ==
[[File:Languages on Indian Currency.jpg|thumb|right|22 official languages]]
India is a multilingual country with 1,635 languages (including dialects and sub dialects) while Indian currency notes display 15 major languages. Although smartphone penetration is increasing in India, text input in Indic scripts has been a challenge for many years. According to the 2005 India Human Development Survey, the surveyed households reported that 72 per cent of men did not speak any English, 28 per cent spoke some English, and five per cent spoke fluent English. Among women, the corresponding percentages were 83, 17, and 3. While Indian languages are preferred in other means of communication in India (e.g. oral and written communication, radio, TV, newspapers and magazines), English is still the most preferred language for text input.

The focus of this project is to increase the Indian text input on smartphones and tablets.  A better text input mechanism will be helpful to people with little or no knowledge of English, and also for those who prefer not to use English.

== Challenges ==
[[File:Devanagari INSCRIPT Keyboard.JPG|thumb|Devanagari INSCRIPT Keyboard]]
Text entry in Indian Languages has many challenges. Devanagari, for example, requires 52-65 keys to input just the frequently used characters (25 consonants, 9 semi-vowels, 3 frequent conjuncts, 13 vowels, a halant and the 13 vowel modifiers), whereas 26 keys are sufficient to represent Latin script. The government standard Inscript uses 42 keys but takes away many punctuation marks, including commonly used ones such as question marks and quotation marks. Further, it clubs unrelated characters on same key such as  म ण, ह ङ, ऍ १, र ३, ज्ञ ५, त्र ६, क्ष ७, श्र. This is believed to be why Inscript and most other qwerty-based text input mechanisms have not become popular up until now.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== History ==
Researchers at IDC have been working on alternatives to QWERTY-based keyboards for Indic text input since 2001. Earlier projects included the design of hardware devices such as Dynakey, Barakhadi, Keylekh&lt;ref name="paper1"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=985950 Keylekh: a keyboard for text entry in indic scripts]&lt;/ref&gt; and e-Lekh. As mobile phones became smarter and more powerful, this group started working on text input alternatives for mobile phones in 2007 with Saral.&lt;ref name="paper2"&gt;[http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/globicomp2009/papers/Paper-11-SARAL-revised%20paper.pdf Saral: Devanagari text input system in mobile phones]&lt;/ref&gt; Swarachakra and Disha were two designs developed in 2010 for touch-screen devices.&lt;ref name="paper3"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2037422 Design and evaluation of Devanagari virtual keyboards for touch screen mobile phones]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Swarachakra was launched on Android devices. {{As of|2017|08}}, more than 20 lakh people have downloaded Swarachakra from Google play store. Swarachakra has received appreciation from local newspapers in India &lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pressrel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pressrel" /&gt;

== Cultural Significance ==
Contrary to common academic [[Reliability of Wikipedia|criticism of Wikipedia]] in the Western countries, the Tamil Wikipedia is widely regarded as an important source of information in the [[Tamil language]] on the Internet.&lt;ref name="mayuonline.com"&gt;[http://mayuonline.com/eblog/2007/01/04/tamil-wikipedia-1000-articles-cd-project-proposal-%E2%80%93-version-10/ Tamil Wikipedia 1000 Articles CD Project Proposal – Version 1.0 : MAYU’s Personal Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206075956/http://mayuonline.com/eblog/2007/01/04/tamil-wikipedia-1000-articles-cd-project-proposal-%E2%80%93-version-10/ |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia undergoes far less vandalism compared to larger Wikipedia projects, largely because the project has slower growth, mainly due to the lack of computers or Internet service in rural areas of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Most of the project's development comes from the overseas [[Tamil diaspora]].&lt;ref name="mayuonline.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiruba.com/2009/01/photologue-of-tamil-wikipedia-academy.html The Photologue of the Tamil Wikipedia Academy | kiruba.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Tamil Internet Conference held a contest for college students across the state of Tamil Nadu, India for increasing content on the Tamil Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/04/01/stories/2010040162430800.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Move for more Tamil content in Wikipedia | date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was made with regards to the [[World Classical Tamil Conference 2010]], a meeting of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] scholars across the world who discuss modern development of the language. With over 2000 contestants enrolled, the contest concluded with the creation of 1,200 new academically reviewed articles on the Tamil Wikipedia in various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/article457800.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Karthik | last=Madhavan | title=1,200 articles selected to Tamil Wikipedia upload | date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[systemic functional grammar]], a '''thematic equative''' is a thematic resource in which two or more separate elements in a clause are grouped together to form a single constituent of the [[topic–comment|theme-plus-rheme]] structure. An example of this is:

:'''What the guests need for breakfast''' is an omelette.

Here, the theme—the grammatical point of departure—is in bold text; it announces at the start to the listener or reader what the message will be about—the writer's or speaker's angle ("I'm going to tell you what they need for breakfast"). The rheme (the rest of the clause) is in regular text. This type of clause sets up the theme-plus-rheme structure in the form of an equation, where theme = rheme. The equation is always expressed by some form of the verb ''be''.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1967/8) Notes on transitivity and theme in English 1–3, ''Journal of Linguistics'', 3.1, 3.2 and 4.2:3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

A thematic equative allows for all possible parts of a clause to be shifted to the start, to be the theme, so that the message can be structured in whatever way the speaker or writer wants. For example:

:'''An omelette''' is what the guests need for breakfast. [I'm going to tell you something about an omelette.]

Many common expressions are what are known as ''marked'' thematic equatives; these expressions include those that start with "That's why ..." and "That's what ..." ("'''That''''s why you can't do it," "'''That''''s what I meant").&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK, revised by Matthiesson CM (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thematic%20equative%22&amp;f=false An introduction to functional grammar]'', 3rd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique feature of the thematic equative is its conveying of a meaning of exclusiveness in the rheme.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK, revised by Matthiesson CM (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thematic%20equative%22&amp;f=false An introduction to functional grammar]'', 3rd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, 71&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these examples, the meaning is that the ''only'' thing the guests need for breakfast is an omelet. This is in contrast with "'''The guests''' need an omelette for breakfast," which leaves open the possibility that they also need other things for breakfast.

[[Image:Starting point of Little stony man nature trail Shenandoah NP 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Trailhead sign]]
A '''trailhead''' is the point at which a [[trail]] begins, where the trail is often intended for hiking, biking, horseback riding, or off-road vehicles. Modern trailheads often contain rest rooms, maps, sign posts and distribution centers for informational brochures about the trail and its features, and parking areas for vehicles and trailers.

[[Image:Trailhead.JPG|thumb|left|Kiosk at a trailhead]]
Historically, the cities located at the terminus of major pathways for foot traffic such as the [[Natchez Trace]] and the [[Chisholm Trail]] were also known as trailheads.

For mountain climbing and hiking, the elevation of the trailhead above [[sea level]] is given to give an idea of how high the mountain is above the [[Height above average terrain|average terrain]].

'''WikiBhasha''' is a [[multi-lingual]] content creation application for the online [[encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/write-wikis-in-any-language-with-new-multilingual-content-creation-tool-2111447.html "Write wikis in any language with new multilingual content creation tool"] ([[Relaxnews]] story), ''The Independent'', 20 October 2010. Retrieved 10 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; that must be installed in the computer.

== Overview ==

WikiBhasha enables contributors to Wikipedia to find content from Wikipedia articles, translate it into other languages, and then either compose new articles or enhance existing articles in the various language versions of Wikipedia.  The tool acts as a simple and intuitive user interface layer that stays on the target language Wikipedia article that is being created or enhanced during the user-session.  At the end of the session, all the additions or modifications of content are submitted to the target language Wikipedia in the updating process.

WikiBhasha supports content creation in more than 30 languages. It enables easy content creation in non-English Wikipedias by leveraging the large volume of English Wikipedia content as the source of information. Initially, the Wikimedia Foundation and Microsoft Research were working closely with the Wikipedia user communities focusing on content creation in [[Arabic]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  The word Bhasha means language in many North Indian languages, and is related to the word Bahasa of Malaysia and Indonesia.

The software is similar to the [[Google Translator Toolkit]] used to translate Wikipedia articles since 2008. The key difference between the two is that WikiBhasha runs as an overlay within the Wikipedia interface, while the Google toolkit runs elsewhere and requires a Google account.

==Availability==
As of 2010, WikiBhasha (Beta) was available as:
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiBhasha MediaWiki extension], under Apache 2 License and partly under GPL v2,
* installable bookmarklet (and a Grease Monkey Script for Firefox users) from the [http://www.WikiBhasha.org WikiBhasha] site.

==User guide==
The WikiBhasha beta [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/wikibhasha/wikibhasha_beta_user_doc_1.0.pdf user guide] provides instructions for installation and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10686">A '''wordfilter''' (sometimes referred to as just "'''filter'''" or "'''censor'''") is a script typically used on [[Internet forum]]s or [[chat room]]s that automatically scans users' posts or comments as they are submitted and automatically changes or [[censorship|censors]] particular words or phrases.

The most basic wordfilters search only for specific strings of letters, and remove or overwrite them regardless of their context. More advanced wordfilters make some exceptions for context (such as filtering "butt" but not "butter"), and the most advanced wordfilters may use [[regular expression]]s.

==Functions==
Wordfilters can serve any of a number of functions.

===Removal of vulgar language===
A ''swear filter'', also known as a ''profanity filter'' or ''language filter'' is a [[software]] subsystem which modifies text to remove words deemed offensive by the administrator or community of an [[online forum]]. Swear filters are common in custom-programmed [[chat room]]s and [[online video game]]s, primarily [[MMORPG]]s. This is not to be confused with [[content filtering]], which is usually built into internet browsing programs by [[third-party developer]]s to filter or block specific websites or types of websites. Swear filters are usually created or implemented by the developers of the Internet service.

Most commonly, wordfilters are used to censor language considered inappropriate by the operators of the forum or chat room. [[Profanity|Expletive]]s are typically partially replaced, completely replaced, or replaced by nonsense words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filesharingtalk.com/vb3/lounge/t-when-did-we-get-wordfilter-88125|title=When the **** did we get a wordfilter?|accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relieves the administrators or moderators of the task of constantly patrolling the board to watch for such language. This may also help the message board avoid [[content-control software]] installed on users' computers or networks, since such software often blocks access to Web pages that contain vulgar language.

Filtered phrases may be permanently replaced as it is saved (example: [[phpBB]] 1.x), or the original phrase may be saved but displayed as the censored text. In some software users can view the text behind the wordfilter by quoting the post.

Swear filters typically take advantage of [[string replacement]] functions built into the [[programming language]] used to create the program, to swap out a list of inappropriate words and phrases with a variety of alternatives. Alternatives can include:
* [[wikt:grawlix|grawlix]] nonsense characters, such as !@#$%^&amp;*
* Replacing a certain letter with a shift-number character or a similar looking one.
* Asterisks (*) of either a set length, or the length of the original word being filtered. Alternatively, posters often replace certain letters with an asterisk.
*[[Minced oath]]s such as "heck" or "darn", or invented words such as "flum".
* Family friendly words or phrases, or euphemisms, like "LOVE" or "I LOVE YOU", or completely different words which have nothing to do with the original word.
* Deletion of the post. In this case, the entire post is blocked and there is usually no way to fix it.
* Nothing at all. In this case, the offending word is deleted.

Some swear filters do a simple search for a string. Others have measures that ignore [[Whitespace character|whitespace]], and still others go as far as ignoring all non-[[alphanumeric]] characters and then filtering the plain text. This means that if the word "you" was set to be filtered, "y  o u" or "y.o!u" would also be filtered.

===Cliché control===
[[Cliché]]s—particular words or phrases constantly reused in posts, also known as "memes"—often develop on forums. Some users find that these clichés add to the fun, but other users find them tedious, especially when overused. Administrators may configure the wordfilter to replace the annoying cliché with a more embarrassing phrase, or remove it altogether.

===Vandalism control===
Internet forums are sometimes attacked by [[vandalism|vandals]] who try to fill the forum with repeated nonsense messages, or by [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] who try to insert links to their commercial web sites. The site's wordfilter may be configured to remove the nonsense text used by the vandals, or to remove all links to particular websites from posts.

===Lameness filter===
'''Lameness filters''' are text-based wordfilters used by Slash-based websites (i.e. [[Textboard]]s and [[Imageboard]]s) to stop [[spam (electronic)|junk]] comments from being posted in response to stories. Some of the things they are designed to filter include:

*Too many capital letters
*Too much repetition
*[[ASCII art]]
*Comments which are too short or long
*Use of HTML tags that try to break web pages
*Comment titles consisting solely of "first post"
*Any occurrence of a word or term deemed (by the programmers) to be offensive/vulgar

==Circumventing filters==
{{main|Internet censorship circumvention}}
Since wordfilters are automated and look only for particular sequences of [[character (computing)|characters]], users aware of the filters will sometimes try to circumvent them by changing their lettering just enough to avoid the filters. A user trying to avoid a vulgarity filter might replace one of the characters in the offending word into an asterisk, dash, or something similar. Some [[forum administrator|administrators]] respond by revising the wordfilters to catch common substitutions; others may make filter evasion a punishable offense of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/tou.html|title=GameFAQs Terms of Use|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example of evading a wordfilter would be entering symbols between letters or using [[leet]]. More advanced techniques of wordfilter evasion include the use of images, using hidden tags, or [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic characters]] (i.e. a [[IDN homograph attack|homograph spoofing attack]]).

Another method is to use a [[soft hyphen]]. A soft hyphen is only used to indicate where a word can be split when breaking text lines and is not displayed. By placing this halfway in a word, the word gets broken up and will in some cases not be recognised by the wordfilter.

Some more advanced filters, such as those in the online game ''[[RuneScape]]'', can detect bypassing. However, the downside of sensitive wordfilters is that legitimate phrases get filtered out as well.

==Censorship aspects==
Wordfilters are coded into the Internet forums or chat rooms, and operate only on material submitted to the forum or chat room in question. This distinguishes wordfilters from [[content-control software]], which is typically installed on an end user's PC or computer network, and which can filter all Internet content sent to or from the PC or network in question. Since wordfilters alter a user's words without his or her consent, some users still consider them to be [[censorship]], while others consider them an acceptable part of a forum operator's right to control the contents of the forum.

==False positives==
{{main|Scunthorpe problem}}
A common quirk with wordfilters, often considered either comical or aggravating by users, is that they often affect words that are not intended to be filtered. This is a typical problem when short words are filtered. For example, one may see, "Do you need istance for playing clical music?"  Multiple words may be filtered if whitespace is ignored, resulting in "as suspected" becoming " uspected".    Prohibiting a phrase such as "hard on" will result in filtering innocuous statements such as "That was a hard one!" and "Sorry I was hard on you," into "That was a  e!" and "Sorry I was  you."

Some words that have been filtered accidentally can become replacements for profane words. One example of this is found on the [[Myst]] forum Mystcommunity. There, the word 'manuscript' was accidentally censored for containing the word 'anus', which resulted in 'm****cript'. The word was adopted as a replacement swear and carried over when the forum moved, and many substitutes, such as " 'scripting ", are used (though mostly by the older community members).

Place names may be filtered out unintentionally due to containing portions of swear words. In the early years of the internet, the British place name [[Penistone]] was often filtered out from spam and swear filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8528672.stm|title=How spam filters dictated Canadian magazine's fate|last=Sheerin|first=Jude|date=29 March 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Many games, such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and more recently, [[Habbo Hotel]] and [[RuneScape]] allow the user to turn the filters off. Other games, especially free [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s, such as [[Knight Online]] do not have such an option. 

Other games such as [[Medal of Honor]] and [[Call of Duty]] (except ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 2]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 3]]'') do not give users the option to turn off scripted foul language, while [[Gears of War]] does.

In addition to games, Profanity Filters can be used to moderate the user generated content in forums, blogs, social media apps, kid's websites, and product reviews. There are many profanity filter APIs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webpurify.com/documentation/methods/replace/|title=Profanity Filter API Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; like [https://www.webpurify.com/profanity-filter/ WebPurify] that help in replacing the swear words with other characters (i.e. "@#$!"). These profanity filters APIs work with profanity search and replace method.

'''YouTube Poop''' (commonly abbreviated '''YTP''') is a type of video [[mashup (video)|mashup]] created by editing pre-existing media sources for [[Humour|humorous]], [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[Annoyance|annoying]], [[Confusion|confusing]], [[Shock value|shocking]], or dramatic purposes. YouTube Poop videos are traditionally uploaded to the [[video sharing website]] [[YouTube]], hence the name, but may be mirrored or uploaded on other sites like [[Newgrounds]], [[Vimeo]] and [[Dailymotion]] (usually for reasons involving copyright).

==Techniques==
A typical YouTube Poop video uses visual and auditory effects to alter the [[underlying work]]. Some of these videos may involve completely or partially repurposing sources to create or convey a story, while others follow a [[non-linear narrative]], and some may contain no storyline at all.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt; Alternatively, a YouTube Poop may consist solely of an existing video repeated in a slowed or remixed loop.&lt;ref name="demorgen"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, YouTube Poops utilize a [[Surreal humor|bizarre sequence of elements]] that may entertain, confuse, or irritate, depending on the viewer.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Associate professor of [[cultural anthropology]] at [[Kansas State University]], [[Michael Wesch]], has defined YouTube Poops as "absurdist remixes that ape and mock the lowest technical and aesthetic standards of remix culture to comment on remix culture itself".&lt;ref name=EFF&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Media sources of YouTube Poops include [[Television program|television shows]], [[Film|movies]], cartoons, commercials, video games, and other videos obtained from YouTube or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NsWtPHNl88C | title=YouTube: Online Video and Participatory Culture | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | date=2013 | accessdate=28 March 2016 | author=Burgess, Jean | page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s, [[Cutscene|cutscenes]] from games released on the [[Philips CD-i]] platform (most notably, ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', [[Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon|''Link: The Faces of Evil'', and ''Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon'']], and later ''[[I.M. Meen]]'') were an incredibly common source in YTPs, because the [[Camp (style)|campy]] and egregious nature of the animations made them ripe for satire.
&lt;!--Please refrain from adding to the list of common YouTube Poop sources without reliable sourcing.--&gt;

YouTube Poop is often derivative in the sense that the work of one artist (or "pooper") is sometimes used as the underlying work for another video. [[Lawrence Lessig]], Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]], referred to this behavior as an example of "call &amp; response" within a [[remix culture]].&lt;ref name=Lessig&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, two YouTube Poopers may engage in "YTP tennis" or "YTP soccer", wherein the same video is remixed back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ytp-tennis | title=YTP Tennis | date=2010 | accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent type of video in the community is known as a "[[Collaboration|collab]]", which is where a group of YouTube Poopers' videos are compiled to make a longer video; often, the videos featured are made exclusively for the collab and are not uploaded to YouTube prior to the collab's release.

==Copyright and fair use==
Due to the use of copyrighted materials and the manner in which these sources are depicted, YTPs may be removed from YouTube following a [[DMCA takedown notice|DMCA complaint]]. However, political scientist and author Trajce Cvetkovski noted in 2013 that, despite [[Viacom]] filing a copyright infringement lawsuit with YouTube in 2007, YouTube Poops such as "The Sky Had a Weegee" by Hurricoaster, which features scenes from the animated series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (in particular, the episode "Shanghaied") and Weegee (a satiric caricature based on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Luigi]] as he appears in DOS version of ''[[Mario Is Missing]]''), remained on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;

The law in the [[United Kingdom]] does allow people to use copyrighted material for the purposes of [[parody]], [[pastiche]], and [[caricature]] without infringing on the copyright of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111116029|title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014|author=|date=|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright owners are only able to sue the parodist if the work contains hateful or discriminative messages. If the case is then taken to court, it will be down to a judge to decide whether the video meets these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29408121|title=Parody copyright laws set to come into effect|author=|date=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual responses==
Individuals involved in YouTube Poops sometimes make efforts to take YouTube Poopers' videos down because [[mature content|mature]] and [[defamatory]] content is prevalent in them, especially if they have a large audience of children watching their work. Children's poet [[Michael Rosen]] (who claims to have "become a [[cult]]" among YouTube Poopers)&lt;ref name=Litup666&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= 29 May 2011|title= Michael Rosen discusses the poop debacle|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0axzt7krqt4|access-date= 25 October 2015|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= YouTube|time= |location= |publisher= LitUp666|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; initially attempted to take his videos down, but after a few frank discussions with YouTube Poopers, he decided to allow the videos to stay online, comparing the remixes to the use of [[photo manipulation|photo editing]] software in a later interview.&lt;ref name=Litup666 /&gt; Rosen issued a warning on his website, saying that:
{{cquote|Quite a few people have fun taking my videos and making new versions of them, known as 'YouTube Poops'. Many of these are not suitable for young children. I am not responsible for either the words or pictures of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rosen, Michael|authorlink1=Michael Rosen|title=News - For Adults|url=http://www.michaelrosen.co.uk/foradults_news.html|website=michaelrosen.co.uk|accessdate=25 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311053545/http://www.michaelrosen.co.uk/foradults_news.html|archivedate=March 11, 2015 |date=29 May 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

He put a similar warning on his YouTube channel's about page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=artificedesign - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/artificedesign/about|website=YouTube|publisher=Michael Rosen|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
