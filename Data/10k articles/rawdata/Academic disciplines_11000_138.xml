The '''Amazon Tall Tower Observatory''' or '''ATTO''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Observatório de Torre Alta da Amazônia'') is a scientific research facility in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. It contains three research tower, one with a height of {{convert|325|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="Brazil builds"&gt;{{cite news

They are equipped with a broad range of instruments to measure chemicals and physical properties of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], such as [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations, [[aerosol]]s and meteorological data. The observatory also contains lab containers, a base camp and several near-by field sites to study soil and forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreae et. al.|first2=|date=2015-09-28|title=The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO): overview of pilot measurements on ecosystem ecology, meteorology, trace gases, and aerosols|url=https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/10723/2015/acp-15-10723-2015.html|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|language=English|volume=15|issue=18|pages=10723–10776|doi=10.5194/acp-15-10723-2015|issn=1680-7316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The observatory is a joint project between Germany and Brazil coordinated by the [[Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry]] on the German side and the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, [[National Institute of Amazonian Research|INPA]] (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia) on the Brazilian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.attoproject.org/contact/|title=ATTO - Amazon Tall Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|work=ATTO - Amazon Tall Tower Observatory|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major research partners include the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]] and the [[Amazonas State University|University of the State of Amazonas]], UEA (Universidade do Estado do Amazonas), with over 20 research institutes and universities in Brazil, Germany and other countries participating. The initial building cost of 8.4 million Euros was shared about equally by the German and Brazil partners.&lt;ref name="ATTO Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpic.de/en/research/collaborative-projects/atto/factsheet-atto.html|title=Factsheet ATTO|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is distant from any human presence, about 150 kilometres northeast of [[Manaus]], "far from disturbances caused by human influences."&lt;ref name="ATTO Factsheet" /&gt; The towers are used to study the atmosphere and its interactions with the largely untouched rainforest and soil below. It measures greenhouse gases, aerosols and weather data and provides information about a roughly 100 square kilometer area around the tower.

The joint project is dedicated to the exploration of the rainforest [[biosphere]] and how it responds to [[global warming]]. According to  the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research ([[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|BMBF]]), ATTO allows to reach new levels of measurements regarding the greenhouse gases and the complex interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the measuring tower will contribute to gather and assess “climate-relevant chemical and physical processes over the Amazon” and thus create new principles for climate protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fona.de/en/tallest-measurement-tower-opened-in-brazil-20354.html|title=Tallest Measurement Tower opened in Brazil - FONA|website=Forschung für Nachhaltige Entwicklung (FONA)|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/News/GlobalTallNews/tabid/4810/Article/2871/language/en-US/view.aspx|title=Amazon Tall Tower Observatory Completes in Rainforest Near Manaus|last=|first=|date=18 May 2015|work=CTBUH Global News|access-date=22 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATTO's counterpart “ZOTTO” ([[Zotino Tall Tower Observation Facility]]) is located in the [[Siberia]]n Taiga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7804">{{otheruses4|the classification of sets|making complex decisions|Analytic hierarchy process}}
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[descriptive set theory]], the '''analytical hierarchy''' is an extension of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. The analytical hierarchy of formulas includes formulas in the language of [[second-order arithmetic]], which can have quantifiers over both the set of [[natural numbers]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and over functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The analytical hierarchy of sets classifies sets by the formulas that can be used to define them; it is the [[lightface]] version of the [[projective hierarchy]].

== The analytical hierarchy of formulas ==
The notation &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_0 = \Pi^1_0 = \Delta^1_0&lt;/math&gt;
indicates the class of formulas in the language of [[second-order arithmetic]] with no set quantifiers. This language does not contain set parameters.  The Greek letters here are [[lightface]] symbols, which indicate this choice of language. Each corresponding [[Boldface (mathematics)|boldface]] symbol denotes the corresponding class of formulas in the extended language with a parameter for each  [[real number|real]]; see [[projective hierarchy]] for details.

A formula in the language of second-order arithmetic is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if it is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists X_1\cdots \exists X_k \psi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. A formula is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall  X_1\cdots \forall X_k \psi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.   This inductive definition defines the classes &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; for every natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

Because every formula has a [[prenex normal form]], every formula in the language of second-order arithmetic is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  Because meaningless quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is given the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; it will be given the classifications &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_m&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; greater than  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== The analytical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers ==
A set of natural numbers is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  The set is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  If the set is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; then it is given the additional classification &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; sets are called '''hyperarithmetical'''.  An alternate classification of these sets by way of iterated computable functionals is provided by [[hyperarithmetical theory]].

== The analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor and Baire space ==
The analytical hierarchy can be defined on any [[effective Polish space]]; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic. [[Cantor space]] is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers.  These are both [[Polish space]]s.

The ordinary axiomatization of [[second-order arithmetic]] uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space.   A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  The set is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  If the set is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt; then it is given the additional classification &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_n&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to the characteristic function of its graph.   A subset of Baire space is given the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification.  An equivalent definition of the analytical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the analytical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space.  This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.

Because Cantor space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, and Baire space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, the analytical hierarchy applies equally well to finite Cartesian power of one of these spaces.
A similar extension is possible for countable powers and to products of powers of Cantor space and powers of Baire space.

== Extensions ==
As is the case with the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], a relativized version of the analytical hierarchy can be defined.  The language is extended to add a constant set symbol ''A''.  A formula in the extended language is inductively defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{1,A}_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{1,A}_n&lt;/math&gt; using the same inductive definition as above.  Given a set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, a set is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{1,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{1,A}_n&lt;/math&gt; formula in which the symbol &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;; similar definitions for &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{1,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{1,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; apply.  The sets that are &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{1,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{1,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt;, for any parameter ''Y'', are classified in the [[projective hierarchy]].

== Examples ==
* The set of all natural numbers which are indices of computable ordinals is a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set which is not &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set of elements of Cantor space which are the characteristic functions of well orderings of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set which is not &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact, this set is not &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{1,Y}_1&lt;/math&gt; for any element &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of Baire space.
* If the [[axiom of constructibility]] holds then there is a subset of the product of the Baire space with itself which is &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_2&lt;/math&gt; and is the graph of a [[well ordering]] of Baire space.  If the axiom holds then there is also a &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_2&lt;/math&gt; well ordering of Cantor space.

== Properties ==
For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have the following strict containments:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n \subset \Sigma^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n \subset \Pi^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n \subset \Pi^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n \subset \Sigma^1_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

A set that is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt; for some ''n'' is said to be '''analytical'''.  Care is required to distinguish this usage from the term [[analytic set]] which has a different meaning.

'''Astronomical year numbering''' is based on [[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]] year numbering, but follows normal [[decimal]] [[integer]] numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a [[0 (year)|year 0]]; the years before that are designated with [[negative number]]s and the years after that are designated with positive numbers.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html|title=Year Dating Conventions|last=Espenak|first=Fred|work=NASA Eclipse Web Site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208212742/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html| archivedate= 8 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers use the [[Julian calendar]] for years before 1582, including the year 0, and the [[Gregorian calendar]] for years after 1582, as exemplified by [[Jacques Cassini]] (1740),&lt;ref name=Cassini&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 Tables Astronomiques]'' (1740), Explication et Usage pp. 5 (PA5), 7 (PA7), Tables pp. 10 (RA1-PA10), 22 (RA1-PA22), 63 (RA1-PA63), 77 (RA1-PA77), 91 (RA1-PA91), 105 (RA1-PA105), 119 (RA1-PA119). {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Newcomb]] (1898)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Newcomb, [https://archive.org/details/06AstronomicalPapersPreparedForTheUse "Tables of the Motion of the Earth on its Axis and Around the Sun"] in ''Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, Volume&amp;nbsp;VI: Tables of the Four Inner Planets'', (United States Naval Observatory, 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;27 &amp;amp; 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Espenak]] (2007).&lt;ref name=Espanak&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html Phases of the Moon: −99 to 0 (100 to 1 BCE)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605101653/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html |date=5 June 2009 }} ''NASA Eclipse web site''&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common Era) are dropped.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and in general the year ''n'' BC/BCE is numbered "−(''n'' − 1)"&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; (a negative number equal to 1 − ''n''). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive sign; thus in general ''n'' AD/CE is simply ''n'' or +''n''.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; For normal calculation a [[0 (number)|number zero]] is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in [[astronomy]]. Few other disciplines outside [[history]] deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being [[dendrochronology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geology]], the latter two of which use '[[Before Present|years before the present]]'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like [[eclipses]] or [[planetary conjunction]]s to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.

==Year zero usage==
{{Main|Year zero}}
In his [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), [[Johannes Kepler]] used a prototype of year zero which he labeled ''Christi'' (Christ's) between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (Before Christ) and ''Post Christum'' (After Christ) on the mean motion tables for the Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae]'' (1627) Pars secunda, 42 (Zu Seite 191), 48 (197), 54 (203), 60 (209), 66 (215), 72 (221), 78 (227). (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1702, the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), and immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae - Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4. (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick Teresi, [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm "Zero"], ''The Atlantic'', July 1997 (see under Calendars and the Cosmos).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html "Calendars"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210184836/http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html |date=10 February 2012 }}, ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', ed. P. Kenneth Seidelmann, (Sausalito, California: University Science Books, 1992/2005) 579.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of Julian years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (before Jesus Christ or BC), and immediately before Julian years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (after Jesus Christ or AD).&lt;ref name=Cassini/&gt;

Cassini gave the following reasons for using a year 0:&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PT30 Tables Astronomiques]'', Explication et Usage 5, translated by Wikipedia from the French:&lt;br&gt; "L'année 0 est celle dans laquelle on suppose qu'est né J. C. que plusieurs Chronologistes marquent 1 avant la naissance de J. C. &amp; que nous avons marquée 0, afin que la somme des années avant &amp; après J. C. donne l'intervalle qui est entre ces années, &amp; que les nombres disibles par 4 marquent les années bissextiles tant avant qu'après J. C."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The year 0 is that in which one supposes that Jesus Christ was born, which several chronologists mark 1 before the birth of Jesus Christ and which we marked 0, so that the sum of the years before and after Jesus Christ gives the interval which is between these years, and where numbers divisible by 4 mark the leap years as so many before or after Jesus Christ.|Jacques Cassini}}

Fred Espanak of [[NASA]] lists 50 phases of the moon within year 0, showing that it is a full year, not an instant in time.&lt;ref name=Espanak/&gt; Jean Meeus gives the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms'' (Richmod, Virginia: Willmann-Bell, 1991) 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a disagreement between astronomers and historians about how to count the years preceding year 1. In [''Astronomical Algorithms''], the 'B.C.' years are counted astronomically. Thus, the year before the year +1 is the year zero, and the year preceding the latter is the year −1. The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year −584.
The astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose. For example, in the historical practice of counting, the rule of divisibility by 4 revealing Julian leap-years no longer exists; these years are, indeed, 1, 5, 9, 13, ... B.C. In the astronomical sequence, however, these leap-years are called 0, −4, −8, −12, ..., and the rule of divisibility by 4 subsists.|Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms''}}

==Signed years without year 0==
Although he used the usual French terms "avant J.-C." (before Jesus Christ) and "après J.-C." (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian [[Venance Grumel]] used negative years (identified by a minus sign, −) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table. He did so possibly to save space and put no year 0 between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1958) 30. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.0 of the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema language]], often used to describe data interchanged between computers in [[XML]], includes built-in primitive datatypes '''date''' and '''dateTime'''. Although these are defined in terms of [[ISO 8601]] which uses the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] and therefore should include a year 0, the XML Schema specification states that there is no year zero. Version 1.1 of the defining [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]] realigned the specification with ISO 8601 by including a year zero, despite the problems arising from the lack of [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Biron, P.V. &amp; Malhotra, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12979">In [[botanical nomenclature]], '''author citation''' refers to citing the person or group of people who validly published a [[botanical name]], i.e. who first published the name while fulfilling the formal requirements as specified by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN'').&lt;ref name="icn"&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

In [[botany]], it is customary (though not obligatory) to abbreviate author names according to a recognised [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|list of standard abbreviations]].

There are differences between the botanical code and the normal practice in [[Author citation (zoology)|zoology]]. In zoology, the publication year is given following the author name(s) and the authorship of a new combination is normally omitted. A small number of more specialized practices also vary between the recommendations of the botanical and zoological codes.

==Introduction==
In biological works, particularly those dealing with taxonomy and nomenclature but also in ecological surveys, it has long been the custom that full citations to the place where a scientific name was published are omitted, but a short-hand is used to cite the author of the name, at least the first time this is mentioned. The author name is frequently not sufficient information, but can help to resolve some difficulties. Problems include:

* The name of a taxon being referred to is ambiguous, as in the case of [[Homonym (biology)|homonyms]] such as ''[[Ficus]]'' L., the fig tree genus, vs. ''[[Ficus (gastropod)|Ficus]]'' Röding, 1798, a genus of molluscs.
* The publication of the name may be in a little-known journal or book. The author name may sometimes help to resolve this.
* The name may not have been validly published, but the supposed author name may be helpful to locate the publication or manuscript in which it was listed.

Rules and recommendations for author citations in botany are covered by Articles 46–50 of the ''International Code of Nomenclature'' (''ICN'').&lt;ref name="icn" /&gt; As stated in Article 46 of the botanical Code, in botany it is normal to cite only the author of the taxon name as indicated in the published work, even though this may differ from the stated authorship of the publication itself.

==Basic citation==
The simplest form of author citation in botany applies when the name is cited in its original rank and its original genus placement (for binomial names and below), where the original author (or authors) are the only name/s cited, and no parentheses are included.

The Latin term "et" or the ampersand symbol "&amp;" can be used when two authors jointly publish a name.&lt;ref name="icn"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Recommendation 46C.1&lt;/sup&gt;

In many cases the author citation will consist of two parts, the first in parentheses, e.g.:

* ''Helianthemum coridifolium'' (Vill.) Cout.

This form of author citation indicates that the epithet was originally published in another genus (in this case as ''Cistus coridifolius'') by the first author, [[Dominique Villars]] (indicated by the enclosing parentheses), but moved to the present genus ''[[Helianthemum]]'' by the second (revising) author ([[António Xavier Pereira Coutinho]]). Alternatively, the revising author changed the rank of the taxon, for example raising it from subspecies to species (or vice versa), from subgenus to Section, etc.&lt;ref name="icn"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Article 49&lt;/sup&gt; (Again, the latter is in contrast to the situation in zoology, where no authorship change is recognized within family-group, genus-group, and species-group names, thus a change from subspecies to species, or subgenus to genus, is not associated with any change in cited authorship).

==Abbreviation==
When citing a botanical name including its author, the author's name is often abbreviated. To encourage consistency, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' ''ICN'' recommends&lt;ref name="icn"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Recommendation 46A, Note 1&lt;/sup&gt; the use of Brummitt &amp; Powell's ''[[Authors of Plant Names]]'' (1992), where each author of a botanical name has been assigned a unique abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brummitt |first=R.K. |last2=Powell |first2=C.E. |year=1992 |title=Authors of Plant Names |publication-place=Kew |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens |isbn=978-1-84246-085-6 |lastauthoramp=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These standard abbreviations can be found at the [[International Plant Names Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html |title=Author Query Page |publisher=International Plant Names Index |accessdate=29 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060207002421/http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html| archivedate=February 7, 2006&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in:

* ''[[Rubus]]'' L.

the abbreviation "L." refers to the famous botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] who described this genus on p.&amp;nbsp;492 of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.

* ''[[Rubus ursinus]]'' Cham. &amp; Schldl.

the abbreviation "Cham." refers to the botanist [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] and "Schldl." to the botanist [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]]; these authors jointly described this species (and placed it in the genus ''[[Rubus]]'') in 1827.

=={{anchor|ex}}Usage of the term "ex"==
When "ex" is a component of the author citation, it denotes the fact that an initial description did not satisfy the rules for [[Valid name (botany)|valid publication]], but that the same name was subsequently validly published by a second author or authors (or by the same author in a subsequent publication).&lt;ref name="icn"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Article 46.4&lt;/sup&gt; However, if the subsequent author makes clear that the description was due to the earlier author (and that the earlier author accepted the name), then no "ex" is used, and the earlier author is listed alone. For example:

* ''Andropogon aromaticus'' Sieber ex Schult.

indicates that [[Schult.|Josef Schultes]] validly published this name (in 1824 in this instance), but his description was based on an earlier description by [[Franz Sieber]]. (Note that in botany, the author of the earlier name precedes the later, valid one; in zoology, this sequence (where present) is reversed).

==Examples==

The following forms of citation are all equally correct:

* ''Rubus ursinus'' Cham. &amp; Schldl.
* ''Rubus ursinus'' Cham. et Schldl.
* ''Rubus ursinus'' von Chamisso &amp; von Schlechtendal
* ''Rubus ursinus'' von Chamisso et von Schlechtendal

As indicated above, either the original or the revising author may involve multiple words, as per the following examples from the same genus:

* ''[[Helianthemum]]'' sect. ''Atlanthemum'' (Raynaud) G.López, Ortega Oliv. &amp; Romero García
* ''[[Helianthemum apenninum]]'' Mill. subsp. ''rothmaleri'' (Villar ex Rothm.) M.Mayor &amp; Fern.Benito
* ''Helianthemum conquense'' (Borja &amp; Rivas Goday ex G.López) Mateo &amp; V.J.Arán Resó

==Usage of the ancillary term "in"==
The ancillary term "in" is sometimes employed to indicate that the authorship of the published work is different from that of the name itself, for example:

* ''Verrucaria aethiobola'' [[Göran Wahlenberg|Wahlenb.]] in Acharius, Methodus, Suppl.: 17. 1803

Article 46.2 Note 1 of the Botanical Code indicates that in such cases, the portion commencing "in" is in fact a bibliographic citation and should not be used without the place of publication being included, thus the preferred form of the name+author alone in this example would be ''Verrucaria aethiobola'' Wahlenb., not ''Verrucaria aethiobola'' Wahlenb. in Acharius. (This is in contrast to the situation in zoology, where either form is permissible, and in addition a date would normally be appended.)

==Authorship of subsidiary ranks==
According to the botanical Code it is only necessary to cite the author for the lowest rank of the taxon in question, i.e. for the example subspecies given above (''Helianthemum apenninum'' subsp. ''rothmaleri'') it is not necessary (or even recommended) to cite the authority of the species ("Mill.") as well as that of the subspecies,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} though this is found in some sources. The only exception to this rule is where the nominate variety or subspecies of a species is cited, which automatically will inherit the same authorship of its parent taxon,&lt;ref name="icn"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Article 26.1&lt;/sup&gt; thus:

* ''[[Rosa gallica]]'' L. var. ''gallica'', not "''Rosa gallica'' var. ''gallica'' L."

==Emending authors==
As described in Article 47 of the botanical code, on occasion either the diagnostic characters or the circumscription of a taxon may be altered ("emended") sufficiently that the attribution of the name to the original taxonomic concept as named is insufficient. The original authorship attribution is not altered in these cases, but a ''taxonomic'' statement can be appended to the original authorship using the abbreviation "emend." (for ''emendavit''), as per these examples given in the Code:

* ''[[Phyllanthus]]'' L. emend. Müll. Arg
* ''Globularia cordifolia'' L. excl. var. (emend. [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lam.]]).

(In the second example, "excl. var.", abbr. for ''exclusis varietatibus'', indicates that this taxonomic concept excludes varieties which other workers have subsequently included).

==Other indications==
Other indications which may be encountered appended to scientific name authorship include indications of nomenclatural or taxonomic status (e.g. "[[Illegitimate name|nom. illeg.]]", "[[sensu]] Smith", etc.), prior taxonomic status for taxa transferred between hybrid and non-hybrid status ("(pro sp.)" and "(pro hybr.)", see Article 50 of the botanical Code), and more. Technically these do not form part of the author citation but represent supplementary text, however they are sometimes included in "authority" fields in less well constructed [[taxonomic database]]s. Some specific examples given in Recommendations 50A–F of the botanical Code include:

* ''Carex bebbii'' Olney, nomen nudum (alternatively: nom. nud.)
for a taxon name published without an acceptable description or diagnosis

* ''[[Lindera]]'' Thunb., Nov. Gen. Pl.: 64. 1783, non Adans. 1763
for a [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]—indicating in this instance that [[Carl Peter Thunberg]]'s "''Lindera''" is not the same taxon as that named previously by [[Michel Adanson]], the correspondence of the two names being coincidental

*  ''Bartlingia'' [[Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart|Brongn.]] in Ann. Sci. Nat. (Paris) 10: 373. 1827, non Rchb. 1824 nec F.Muell. 1882
as above, but two prior (and quite possibly unrelated) homonyms noted, the first by [[Ludwig Reichenbach]], the second by [[Ferdinand von Mueller]]

* ''Betula alba'' L. 1753, nom. rej.
for a taxon name rejected (normally in favour of a later usage) and placed on the list of rejected names forming an appendix to the botanical Code (the alternative name conserved over the rejected name would be cited as "nom. cons.")

* ''Ficus exasperata'' auct. non Vahl
this is the preferred syntax for a name that has been misapplied by a subsequent author or authors ("auct." or "auctt.") such that it actually represents a different taxon from the one to which Vahl's name correctly applies

* ''Spathiphyllum solomonense'' Nicolson in Am. J. Bot. 54: 496. 1967, "''solomonensis''"
indicating that the epithet as originally published was spelled ''solomonensis'', but the spelling here is in an altered form, presumably for Code compliance or some other legitimate reason.

The '''bald eagle''' (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'', from Greek ἅλς, ''hals'' "sea", αἰετός ''aietos'' "[[eagle]]", λευκός, ''leukos'' "white", κεφαλή, ''kephalē'' "head") is a [[bird of prey]] found in [[North America]]. A [[sea eagle]], it has two known subspecies and forms a [[Species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''). Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight. [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is both the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and [[List of national animals|national animal]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The bald eagle appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Continental United States|Lower 48]] States on June 28, 2007.

==Description==
The [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''H. vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Head details]]
The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its [[nape]] and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.&lt;ref name="sibley"/&gt; Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black,  yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak.

The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the [[California condor]] (''Gymnogyps californianus''), a [[New World vulture]] which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; However, the [[golden eagle]], averaging {{convert|4.18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord length]] in its American race (''A. c. canadensis''), is merely {{convert|455|g|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed [[white-tailed eagle]] and the overall larger [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''H. pelagicus''), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

[[File:Bald Eagle, wings and tail feathers.jpg|thumb|This eagle has a sizeable wingspan]]
The bald eagle has a body length of {{convert|70|–|102|cm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}. Typical wingspan is between {{convert|1.8|and|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and mass is normally between {{convert|3|and|6.3|kg|lb|sp=us|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt; Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging {{convert|5.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and against the males' average weight of {{convert|4.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;

The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with [[Bergmann's rule]], since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from [[South Carolina]] average {{convert|3.27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in mass and {{convert|1.88|m|ft|abbr=on}} in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; One field guide in [[Florida]] listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about {{convert|4.13|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Maehr, D.

The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, ''kleek kik ik ik ik'', somewhat similar in cadence to a [[gull]]'s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name="sibley"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The bald eagle placed in the genus ''Haliaeetus'' ([[sea eagle]]s) which gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. ''Bald'' in the [[English language|English]] name is derived from the word ''[[piebald]]'', and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body.&lt;ref name=b7/&gt; The genus name is [[New Latin]]: ''Haliaeetus'' (from the {{lang-grc|ἁλιάετος|haliaetos|sea eagle}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(lia/etos|ἁλιάετος|longref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the specific name, ''leucocephalus'', is Latinized ({{lang-grc|λευκός|leukos|white}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|leuko/s2|λευκός|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ({{lang-grc|κεφαλή|kephalḗ|head|label=none}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kefalh/|κεφαλή|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia"/&gt;
[[File:Bald Eagle flying over ice (Southern Ontario, Canada).jpg|thumb|Bald eagle anatomy]]
The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', under the name ''Falco leucocephalus''.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

There are two recognized [[subspecies]] of bald eagle:&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITIS"/&gt;
* ''H. l. leucocephalus'' &lt;small&gt;(Linnaeus, 1766)&lt;/small&gt; is the nominate subspecies. It is found in the southern United States and [[Baja California Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="ESRP"/&gt;
* ''H. l. washingtoniensis'' &lt;small&gt;(Audubon, 1827)&lt;/small&gt;, synonym ''H. l. alascanus'' Townsend, 1897, the northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate ''leucocephalus ''. It is found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESRP"/&gt;

The bald eagle forms a [[species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] of [[Eurasia]]. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early [[Miocene]] (c. 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ma (unit)|Ma BP]]) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle [[Oligocene]], 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this [[genus]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Range==
[[File:Bald-Eagle-9114-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bald eagle in flight at [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wyoming]]]]
The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of [[Canada]], all of the [[continental United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is the only sea eagle [[endemism|endemic]] to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] to the [[Sonoran Desert]] and the eastern deciduous forests of [[Quebec]] and [[New England]], northern birds are [[bird migration|migratory]], while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], northern and eastern Canada, and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Bull87"/&gt; Today, they are much more common, and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; 

The majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the [[British Columbia]] coast while large populations are found in the forests of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/animal-facts-bald-eagle |title=Animal Facts: Bald Eagle |date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in [[Squamish, British Columbia]], about halfway between [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. The birds primarily gather along the [[Squamish River|Squamish]] and [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] Rivers, attracted by the [[salmon]] spawning in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle1.html |title=Bald Eagle Viewing Directory |accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has occurred as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in [[Fermanagh]] on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a [[white-tailed eagle]]), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] on November 15, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Bald-Eagle-Lands-Exhausted-in-Ireland/id-fd7744016cc242f2c23ec570762c136a Bald Eagle Lands Exhausted in Ireland], Associated Press, 15 December 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Bald Eagle, Ontario forest.jpg|thumb|In flight during a licensed performance in Ontario, Canada]]
[[File:Bald Eagle, training for falconry.jpg|thumb|During training at the Canadian Raptor Conservancy, a facility license by the province of [[Ontario]]]]
The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American [[wetland]] habitat such as [[Coast|seacoasts]], [[river]]s, large [[lake]]s or [[marsh]]es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.&lt;ref name="Gov"/&gt;

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.&lt;ref name="Suring"/&gt; Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;&lt;ref name=j4/&gt; Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="Swenson, J. E. 1986"/&gt; Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water.&lt;ref name="Gov"/&gt; Most nests have been found within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove|mangrove swamps]], the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.&lt;ref name="Suring"/&gt; Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt;

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.&lt;ref name="Gov"/&gt; However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in [[New York City]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suring"/&gt;

==Behavior==
The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|–|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.&lt;ref name="Terres"/&gt; Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; Regarding their flying abilities, the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.&lt;ref name= Palmer/&gt; It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;

===Diet and feeding===
[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]
The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Throughout their range, [[fish]] often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet.&lt;ref name="LPZBaldEagle"&gt;[http://www.lpzoo.org/animals/factsheet/bald-eagle "Bald Eagle Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo"]. Lpzoo.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%.&lt;ref name="Stalmaster"&gt;Stalmaster, M.V. (1987). ''The Bald Eagle''. Universe Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Southeast Alaska]], fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; Eagles living in the [[Columbia River Estuary]] in [[Oregon]] were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake.&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt; In the [[Pacific Northwest]], spawning [[trout]] and [[salmon]] provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall.&lt;ref name="Alaska"/&gt; Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on [[pink salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus gorbuscha''), [[coho salmon]] (''O. kisutch'') and, more locally, [[sockeye salmon]] (''O. nerka''), with [[chinook salmon]] (''O. tshawytscha''), due to their large size ({{convert|12|to|18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are [[Pacific herring]] (''Clupea pallasii''), [[sand lance|Pacific sand lance]] (''Ammodytes hexapterus'') and [[eulachon]] (''Thaleichthys pacificus'').&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;
[[File:31 White-headed Eagle.jpg|thumb|left|Feeding on catfish and other various fishes. Painted by [[John James Audubon]]]]
In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were [[largescale sucker]]s (''Catostomus macrocheilus'') (17.3% of the prey selected there), [[American shad]] (''Alosa sapidissima''; 13%) and [[common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''; 10.8%).&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt; Eagles living in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Maryland]] were found to subsist largely on [[American gizzard shad]] (''Dorosoma cepedianum''), [[threadfin shad]] (''D. petenense'') and [[white bass]] (''Morone chrysops'').&lt;ref name="Mersmann"/&gt; Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on [[catfish]], most prevalently the [[brown bullhead]] (''Ameiurus nebulosus'') and any species in the genus ''[[Ictalurus]]'' as well as [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[trout]], [[needlefish]], and [[eel]]s.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; Wintering eagles on the [[Platte River]] in [[Nebraska]] preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp.&lt;ref name=j15/&gt; From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt;

Even eagles living in relatively arid regions still typically rely primarily on fish as prey. In [[Sonora]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Arizona]], 77% and over 73%, respectively, of prey remains at the nests were from fish, largely various catfish and [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''). Prey fish targeted by bald eagles are often quite large. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around [[Lake Britton]] in [[California]], fish measuring {{convert|34|to|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring {{convert|23|to|27.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} were chosen only 25% of the time.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; At nests around [[Lake Superior]], the remains of fish (mostly [[Catostomus|suckers]]) were found to average {{convert|35.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length.&lt;ref name="Kozie"/&gt; In the Columbia River estuary, most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure between {{convert|30|and|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and carp flown with (laboriously) were up to {{convert|86|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt;

[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus-whale-USFWS.jpg|thumb|left|A bald eagle on a whale carcass.]]
[[Benthic zone|Benthic fishes]] such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards.&lt;ref name="Mersmann"/&gt; Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delong |first=D. C. Jr. |year=1990 |title=Effects of food on Bald Eagle distribution and abundance on the northern Chesapeake Bay: an experimental approach |journal=Master's Thesis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as [[brown bear]]s (''Ursus arctos''), [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') and [[red fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes''), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] need to consume {{convert|489|g|lb|abbr=on}} of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.&lt;ref name=Stalmaster1/&gt;

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other [[Water bird|waterbirds]]. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities.&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brisbin, Jr.Mowbray2002"/&gt; Exceptionally, in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]], birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake.&lt;ref name="Swenson, J. E. 1986"/&gt; Preferred avian prey includes [[grebe]]s, [[alcid]]s, [[duck]]s, [[gull]]s, [[coot]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, and [[geese]].&lt;ref name=RaptorsWorld/&gt; Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as [[western grebe]]s (''Aechmophorus occidentalis''), [[mallard]]s (''Anas platyrhynchos'') and [[American coot]]s (''Fulica americana'') as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt; [[American herring gull]] (''Larus smithsonianus'') are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior.&lt;ref name="Kozie"/&gt; Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering [[Emperor goose|emperor geese]] (''Chen canagica'') and [[snow goose|snow geese]] (''C. caerulescens''), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included [[common loon]]s (''Gavis immer''),&lt;ref name=j6/&gt; [[great black-backed gull]]s (''Larus marinus''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/330/articles/behavior |title=Great Black-backed Gull- Behavior- Birds of North America Online |author=Good, T.P. |publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sandhill crane]]s (''Grus canadensis''),&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; [[great blue heron]]s (''Ardea herodias''),&lt;ref name="Stalmaster"/&gt; [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] (''Branta canadensis''),&lt;ref name="Mersmann"/&gt; [[brown pelican]]s (''Pelecanus occidentalis''),&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; and fledging [[American white pelican]]s (''P. erythrorhynchos'').&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; Colony nesting [[seabird]]s, such as [[Alcidae|alcids]], [[storm petrel]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[northern gannet]]s (''Morus bassanus''), [[tern]]s and [[gull]]s, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;

Along some portions of the [[North Pacific]] coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly [[kelp]]-dwelling fish and supplementally [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that [[murre]]s are heading for a "conservation collision" due to heavy eagle predation.&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt; Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as [[storm petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside.&lt;ref name="Nocturnal"/&gt; If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. If the said birds are on a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as [[gull]]s.&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt; Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] attacked and killed in mid-air.&lt;ref name=RaptorsWorld/&gt; Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') in mid-flight were taken recently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utahbirds.org/featarts/2008/EagleAndSwan.htm Bald Eagle attacking a Trumpter Swan].

[[Mammal]]ian prey includes [[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s (''Procyon lotor''), [[muskrat]]s (''Ondatra zibethicus''), [[North American beaver|beavers]] (''Castor canadensis''), and [[deer]] fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/506/articles/foodhabits |title=Birds of North America Online |publisher=Bna.birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaver"/&gt; Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On [[Protection Island (Washington state)|Protection Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], they commonly feed on [[harbor seal]] (''Phoca vitulina'') afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups.&lt;ref name="Hayward"/&gt; On [[San Juan Island]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], introduced [[European rabbit]]s (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles.&lt;ref name=j12/&gt; In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations, such as [[prairie dog]]s (''Cynomys'') and [[jackrabbit]]s (''Lepus'').&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially [[sheep]] (''Ovis aries''). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to {{convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.&lt;ref name="ICWDM"/&gt; There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.&lt;ref name="McEneaney"/&gt;

Supplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas [[reptile]]s may become regular prey, especially warm areas such as [[Florida]] where reptile diversity is high. [[Turtle]]s are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; In coastal [[New Jersey]], 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were [[Sternotherus odoratus|common musk turtles]] (''Sternotherus odoratus''), [[diamondback terrapin]] (''Malaclemys terrapin'') and juvenile [[common snapping turtle]]s (''Chelydra serpentina''). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from {{convert|9.2|to|17.1|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wetlands"/&gt; [[Snake]]s are also taken occasionally, especially partially aquatic ones, as are [[amphibian]]s and [[crustacean]]s (largely [[crayfish]] and [[crab]]s).&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2"/&gt;

To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its [[talons]]. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. [[Osprey]] also have this adaptation.&lt;ref name="Terres"/&gt; Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a {{convert|6.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'') fawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/raptors/diet.htm |title=Birds of prey&amp;nbsp;— Diet &amp; Eating Habits |publisher=Seaworld.org |accessdate=2009-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207075952/http://seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/raptors/diet.htm |archivedate=7 February 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazing Bird Records|publisher=Trails.com|accessdate=2012-07-20|url=http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gripping Strength of an Eagle – Understanding psi 101|publisher=Hawkquest|accessdate=2012-07-20|url=http://www.hawkquest.org/TA/XL/Gripping.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water.

Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt; When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C.C. (1969). ''Winter behavior and population dynamics of American eagles in Utah''. PhD Thesis. Brigham Young University. Provo, UT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j25/&gt; While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt;

Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing {{convert|1|to|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and most waterbirds preyed weighing {{convert|0.2|to|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsome"/&gt; They obtain much of their food as [[carrion]] or via a practice known as [[kleptoparasitism]], by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging.&lt;ref name="Todd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmata, A. R. 1984. ''Bald Eagles of the San Luis valley, Colorado: their winter ecology and spring migration''. Phd Thesis. Montana State University. Bozeman.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of [[whale]]s, though carcasses of [[ungulate]]s and large [[fish]] are seemingly preferred.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt; Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).&lt;ref name="Sherrod"/&gt;

When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') and [[fox]]es, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, [[vulture]]s and other [[Bird of prey|raptors]].&lt;ref name="Sherrod"/&gt; Occasionally, coyotes, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus'') and [[Dog|domestic dogs]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine.&lt;ref name=j14/&gt; Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed).&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt; The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in [[New Jersey]] during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt [[snow geese]] alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'') in remote forest clearings in the eastern [[Appalachian Mountains]] without apparent conflict.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s and even [[otter]]s.&lt;ref name="BNA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=j13/&gt; They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from [[peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), prairie dogs from [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis'') and even jackrabbits from [[golden eagle]]s.&lt;ref name=j7/&gt;&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered [[apex predator]]s.&lt;ref name=r6/&gt;

===Reproduction===
Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles [[mate for life]]. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.&lt;ref name="Hinterland"/&gt; Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground.&lt;ref name="Stalmaster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterside habitat.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;

Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} across and weigh {{convert|1|t|ST|lk=on|sp=us}};&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; one nest in Florida was found to be {{convert|6.1|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.9|m|ft|sp=us}} across, and to weigh {{convert|3|ST|t|1|sp=us|abbr = off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erickson, L. |year=2007 |publisher=Journey North |url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html |title=Bald Eagle, About Bald Eagle Nests}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx Amazing Bird Records].

Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually nests are used for under five years or so, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the [[Midwest]] was occupied continuously for at least 34 years.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.&lt;ref name="Sherrod"/&gt;

In [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], eagles have been observed nesting on top of [[Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum|Hecho catcuses]] (''Pachycereus pectinaboriginum'').&lt;ref name=j9/&gt; Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in [[California]], [[Kansas]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]], but currently are only verified to occur only in [[Alaska]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; The eggs average about {{convert|73|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}} long, ranging from {{convert|58|to|85|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and have a breadth of {{convert|54|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}, ranging from {{convert|47|to|63|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Terres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stalmaster"/&gt; Eggs in Alaska averaged {{convert|130|g|oz|abbr=on}} in mass, while in [[Saskatchewan]] they averaged {{convert|114.4|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Hensel, R. J 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bortolotti"/&gt; As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator.&lt;ref name="Stalmaster"/&gt; Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of [[polygyny]].&lt;ref name=bent/&gt; Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs.&lt;ref name=j10/&gt; It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt; However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other "eagle" species such as some in the genus ''Aquila'', in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).&lt;ref name="Travsky"/&gt;

A young eaglet can gain up to {{convert|170|g|oz|abbr=on}} a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air.&lt;ref name="FPL"/&gt; The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development.&lt;ref name="Bortolotti"/&gt; For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Drexel"/&gt; Additionally, as shown by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia on June 9, 2017, bald eagles have been recently recorded to occasionally adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests. The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile [[red-tailed hawk]] back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as young bald eagles are known for [[fratricide|killing their siblings]]. However, the aggression of the red-tailed hawk may ensure its survival, as the hawks are well known for their ability to successfully defend against an eagle attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40224776|title=Bald eagle adopts 'mortal enemy' baby hawk|author=|date=9 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks after however, it was discovered that the hawk, nicknamed "Spunky" by biologists monitoring the nest, had grown to fledgeling size and was learning how to hunt, indicating that it successfully survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/red-tailed-hawk-adopted-by-bald-eagles-video-spd/|title=Why This Young Hawk Thinks It's an Eagle|author=|date=25 July 2017|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and mortality===
[[File:Fledging Bald Eagle.jpg|thumb|Newly fledged juvenile]]
The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/bald-eagle-believed-oldest-banded-of-its-species-f/ |title=Bald eagle believed oldest banded of its species found dead |publisher=Washington Times (Associated Press) |date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey.&lt;ref name=sop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html |title=Bald Eagle Fact Sheet |publisher=Southern Ontario Bald Eagle Monitoring Project |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511232457/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; In [[Prince William Sound]] in [[Alaska]], adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] adversely affected eagles in the area.&lt;ref name=j16/&gt; Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases.&lt;ref name="Buehler"/&gt; In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused.&lt;ref name="Buehler" /&gt; Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status.&lt;ref name=b6/&gt; In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/behavior |title=Cornell University |publisher=Bna.birds.cornell.edu|accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early natural history video depicting a [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Yx1KXQMCM |title=Cougar vs Eagle |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year.&lt;ref name="Drexel"/&gt; However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year.&lt;ref name=j24/&gt; Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large [[gull]]s, [[corvid]]s (including [[raven]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crows]] and [[magpie]]s), [[wolverine]]s (''Gulo gulo''), [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus''), [[American black bear]]s (''Ursus americanus'') and [[raccoon]]s.&lt;ref name="Hensel, R. J 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name=j17/&gt;&lt;ref name=j18a/&gt;&lt;ref name=j19/&gt;&lt;ref name=j20/&gt;&lt;ref name=j21/&gt;&lt;ref name=j22/&gt; If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but [[Arctic fox]]es (''Vulpes lagopus'') occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island.&lt;ref name="Sherrod"/&gt; The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.&lt;ref name="Redoubt"&gt;{{YouTube|OTr0qkC5sZw|Bald Eagle attacks Black bear again at Redoubt Bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==

===Population decline and recovery===
Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide [[DDT]].&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to [[biomagnification]]. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.&lt;ref name="Bull87"/&gt; It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000,&lt;ref name=r16/&gt; but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/support/adopt/adopt-bald-eagle|title=Adopt a Bald Eagle|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo &amp; Conservation Biology Institute|access-date=2018-08-04|date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/baldeagle/pastsurveys.html|title=South Carolina's Bald Eagles – Past Surveys|publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 "American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction."] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1930, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Later illegal shooting was described as "the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.&lt;ref name=r15/&gt;

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds.&lt;ref name=r13/&gt; DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt;
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year]]

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992;&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000–30,000 in 1992.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported.&lt;ref name="USFWS2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/population/chtofprs.html |title=Bald Eagle Breeding Pairs 1963 to 2006 |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in [[Florida]], where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous state]] with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is [[Minnesota]] with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980.  That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/bald_eagle.pdf|title=Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in Washington, 2012 Annual Report|date=|website=|publisher=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife|access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]], when it was reclassified from "Endangered" to "Threatened." On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated "To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife." It was de-listed on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bald Eagle Soars Off Endangered Species List |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713141429/http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been assigned a risk level of [[Least Concern]] category on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In the [[Exxon Valdez Oil Spill]] of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in [[Prince William Sound]], though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt; In some areas, the population has increased such that the eagles are a pest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Wyatt|title=When the National Bird Is a Burden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/magazine/bald-eagle-national-burden.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killing permits===
In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed quadrupling to 4,200 per year the amount of bald eagles that can be killed by the wind electric generation industry without paying a penalty.  If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the current 5-year permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wind-energy-permits-raise-kill-limit-bald-eagles/story?id=38881089 |title=New Wind Energy Permits Would Raise Kill Limit of Bald Eagles But Still Boost Conservation, Officials Say - ABC News |website=Abcnews.go.com |date=2016-05-04 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly |first=Matthew |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9a2796aa1e7542348629ea4108fe7695/apnewsbreak-new-rule-would-permit-thousands-eagle-deaths |title=New federal rule would permit thousands of eagle deaths |website=Bigstory.ap.org |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[License|Permits]] are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles.

As a rule, the bald eagle is not the ideal choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American tribes can obtain a "Native American Religious Use" permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.&lt;ref name=j11/&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The bald eagle is important in various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, as the [[national symbol|national bird]] of the [[United States]], is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].

===Role in Native American culture===
The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the [[golden eagle]], are central to many religious and [[Native American mythology|spiritual]] customs among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures.&lt;ref name="Pequot"/&gt; Many [[pow wow]] dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle-myths.html|title=Eagle Myths and Legends - American Bald Eagle Information|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lakota people|Lakota]], for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college.&lt;ref name="Melmer"/&gt; The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young.&lt;ref name="northeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/newsroom/eagle.html |title=Bald Eagle Population Recovery and the Endangered Species Act |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2014-11-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UGYq5AFv?url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/newsroom/eagle.html |archivedate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Choctaw]] considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=greg_obrien_eagle/&gt;

[[File:National eagle repository 017.JPG|right|thumb|Staff at the [[National Eagle Repository]] processing a bald eagle]]
During the [[Sun Dance]], which is practiced by many [[Plains Indian]] tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a [[medicine man]] may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

Current [[eagle feather law]] stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

The [[National Eagle Repository]], a division of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|FWS]], exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and [[golden eagle]]s which are found dead, and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers, to [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]] Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/le/national-eagle-repository.html |title=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement / Native Americans and Alaskan Natives - National Eagle Repository |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National bird of the United States===
[[File:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|thumb|upright|[[Seal of the President of the United States]]]]
The bald eagle is the national bird of the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=j23/&gt; The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the [[Roman Republic]], in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the [[Continental Congress]] adopted the design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 [[arrow]]s and an [[olive branch]] with its talons.&lt;ref name="seal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seal3"/&gt;

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]], the [[Flag of the President of the United States|presidential flag]], and in the [[logo]]s of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the [[urban legend]] that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/turnhead.htm |title=A Turn of the Head|accessdate=2007-08-19|author1=Mikkelson, Barbara  |author2=Mikkelson, David P  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that [[Benjamin Franklin]] ever publicly supported the [[wild turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo''), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:&lt;ref name= Cornell1&gt;[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bald_eagle/lifehistory Bald Eagle, Life History, All About Birds – Cornell Lab of Ornithology]. AllAboutBirds.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For my own part. I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly&amp;nbsp;... besides he is a rank coward: The little [[Eastern kingbird|king bird]] not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district.}}

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a [[order (honour)|noble order]] unwelcome in the newly independent [[Republic]], contrary to the ideals of [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]], for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |title=American Heraldry Society &amp;#124; MMM / The Arms of the United States: Benjamin Franklin and the Turkey |publisher=Americanheraldry.org |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2010-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427082418/http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |archivedate=2014-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The C-Band All Sky Survey''' ('''C-BASS''') is a [[radio astronomy]] project that aims to map the entire sky in the [[C band (IEEE)|C Band]] (5&amp;nbsp;GHz). It is to be conducted on two [[radio telescope]]s, one operating in the [[Karoo]] in [[South Africa]], and the other one in [[California]].

==Project description==
[[File:C-BASS South at Klerefontein 4.jpg|thumb|The southern C-BASS telescope in the final stages of commissioning in the Karoo.]]
The survey is a collaboration between the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Manchester]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], the [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (HartRAO), and the [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. The observations are being made with two telescopes; one based at the [[Owens Valley Radio Observatory]] (OVRO) in [[California]], United States, and the other near [[Klerefontein]] in the [[Karoo desert]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="skaMedRel"&gt;[http://www.ska.ac.za/releases/20130327.php Square Kilometer Array Media Release], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an all sky survey two ground-based telescopes are required, one in the southern and one in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="skaMedRel" /&gt; C-BASS North is a 6.1m [[Gregorian telescope]], the dish was donated to the project by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and it has started performing survey observations. C-BASS South is a 7.6-m [[Cassegrain telescope]] with a dish donated by [[Telkom (South Africa)]]. It is currently in the final stages of commissioning at [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]] and is forecast to begin survey observations in 2014 when it is deployed in the Karoo. The secondary mirrors on both telescopes are supported by cones of radio-transparent foam to minimize the contamination from ground pick up and to avoid scattering the incoming polarized radiation.&lt;ref name="skaMedRel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="firstLook" /&gt;

==Scientific goals==
The survey will map not only the intensity but also the orientation of the incoming electromagnetic waves ([[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]) at every point on the sky with an [[angular resolution]] of 0.73 degrees. The angular resolution represents the smallest details that can be distinguished in the images. It is the first survey to map the sky at a frequency of 5&amp;nbsp;GHz—low enough to be [[synchrotron radiation]] dominated but high enough to be relatively unaffected by [[Faraday rotation]]. At this frequency most of the signal is coming from emissions from high-energy electrons spiraling around magnetic fields in the galaxy. This radiation is highly polarized and a major foreground distorting the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) signal.&lt;ref name="antennaDesign"&gt;{{cite journal

The primary scientific goal of the project is to aid in the subtraction of [[foreground radiation]], mainly from our own galaxy, from measurements of the CMB in order to improve the exactness of the CMB measurements. The CMB is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]], this polarization can help shed light on [[inflation theory]] and [[gravity waves]] in the [[early universe]]. Secondary goals include studying the [[magnetic field]]s within the [[Milky Way]], the WMAP Haze and [[spinning dust]].&lt;ref name="firstLook"&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1008.4082 | title=The C-Band All-Sky Survey: Instrument design status and First-look data | last1=King, | first1=O.G. | year=2010 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1117/12.858011 | journal=Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cascade Center at the Riverplex''' is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the [[Warner Bros.]], hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.

==History==
The [[Warner Bros.|Warners]], residents of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], were sons of [[Polish Jew]]s wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]]'' in Youngstown,&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.&lt;ref name="Warner54-55"&gt;Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.&lt;ref name="ohiomag-march83"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby [[Cascade Park (amusement park)|Cascade Park]]. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.

Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a [[parking lot]]. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other [[Rust Belt]] cities, saw the collapse of the [[steel]] industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general [[suburbanization]] effect that had been happening throughout the [[United States]] since the 1950s.

By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers &amp; Custom Tailors, is a men's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O Railroad]] Federal Credit Union, a [[credit union]] that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the [[Neshannock Creek]] and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.

In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a [[Occupancy|condemnation]] notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.

==Development==
The city took most of the property by [[eminent domain]] and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the [[sidewalk]] in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&amp;O Credit Union—now the First Choice Federal Credit Union—to temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring [[Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]].) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by [[screen-printing]] [[T-shirt]]s as well as serving as the area's [[J. C. Penney]] Catalog Center after [[Rite Aid]] acquired [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd Pharmacy]] in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] open in the building.

Although the downtown streets &amp; sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The [[alley]] that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a [[Esplanade|promenade]] that leads to an outdoor [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]] between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.

Much like [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the complex is an example of [[adaptive reuse]], and focuses on the early years of [[Film|motion pictures]] much like Station Square focuses on [[train]]s. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.

Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with [[Time Warner]], the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of [[Harry Warner]], did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncnewsonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_112013504?start:int=30{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.
 
It should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.

Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

'''Collapse action''' is a device behaviour that snaps a switch into place, usually using a bistable element. When flipping a light switch, strain on one spring increases until it flips position, pulling down the switch.  Collapse action allows one to remove their hand from the switch without risk of it falling to the down position, as the force needed to overcome the resistance is too great. The action also does not exert force in the lower position, avoiding a spontaneous rise to the up position.

{{linguistics}}
'''Computational linguistics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of [[natural language]] from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by [[computer scientist]]s who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a [[natural language]]. Today, computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of [[linguistics|linguists]], [[computer science|computer scientists]], experts in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematicians]], [[logic]]ians, [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguists]], [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], among others.

Computational linguistics has theoretical and applied components. Theoretical computational linguistics focuses on issues in [[theoretical linguistics]] and cognitive science, and applied computational linguistics focuses on the practical outcome of modeling human language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans |last=Uszkoreit |title=What Is Computational Linguistics? |url=http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~hansu/what_is_cl.html |publisher=Department of Computational Linguistics and Phonetics of Saarland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] defines computational linguistics as:
{{quote|...the scientific study of [[language]] from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing [[computational model]]s of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Association for Computational Linguistics |url=http://www.aclweb.org/archive/misc/what.html |title=What is Computational Linguistics? |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
Computational linguistics is often grouped within the field of artificial intelligence, but actually was present before the development of artificial intelligence. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English.&lt;ref&gt;John Hutchins: [http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/MTS-1999.pdf Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.] Proceedings of MT Summit VII, 1999, pp. 30–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Since computers can make [[arithmetic]] calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before they could also begin to process language.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold B. Barach: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bostworld/2152048032/in/set-72157603898383698/ Translating Machine] 1975: And the Changes To Come.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational and quantitative methods are also used historically in attempted reconstruction of earlier forms of modern languages and subgrouping modern languages into language families. Earlier methods such as [[lexicostatistics]] and [[glottochronology]] have been proven to be premature and inaccurate. However, recent interdisciplinary studies which borrow concepts from biological studies, especially [[gene mapping]], have proved to produce more sophisticated analytical tools and more trustworthy results.&lt;ref&gt;T. Crowley., C. Bowern. An Introduction to Historical Linguistics. Auckland, N.Z.: Oxford UP, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[machine translation]] (also known as mechanical translation) failed to yield accurate translations right away, automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing [[algorithm]]s and software for intelligently processing language data. The term "computational linguistics" itself was first coined by [[David G. Hays|David Hays]], founding member of both the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] and the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/iccl/committee.html#deceased|title=Deceased members|website=ICCL members|accessdate=15 November 2017|ref=ICCLmembers}}&lt;/ref&gt; When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [[grammar]] of both languages, including both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the grammar of word forms) and [[syntax]] (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [[semantics]] and the [[lexicon]] (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the [[pragmatics]] of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/MINDS/FINAL/NLP.web.pdf Natural Language Processing by Liz Liddy, Eduard Hovy, Jimmy Lin, John Prager, Dragomir Radev, Lucy Vanderwende, Ralph Weischedel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays research within the scope of computational linguistics is done at computational linguistics departments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de "Computational Linguistics and Phonetics"].&lt;/ref&gt; computational linguistics laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/home.html "Yatsko's Computational Linguistics Laboratory"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[computer science]] departments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page "CLIP"].&lt;/ref&gt; and linguistics departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.georgetown.edu/programs/graduate/computational/ Computational Linguistics&amp;nbsp;– Department of Linguistics&amp;nbsp;– Georgetown College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/research/computational.html "UPenn Linguistics: Computational Linguistics"].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some research in the field of computational linguistics aims to create working speech or text processing systems while others aim to create a system allowing human-machine interaction. Programs meant for human-machine communication are called [[Embodied agent|conversational agents]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurafsky, D., &amp; Martin, J. H. (2009). Speech and language processing: An introduction to natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech recognition. Upper Saddle River, N.J: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==

Just as computational linguistics can be performed by experts in a variety of fields and through a wide assortment of departments, so too can the research fields broach a diverse range of topics.  The following sections discuss some of the literature available across the entire field broken into four main area of discourse: developmental linguistics, structural linguistics, linguistic production, and linguistic comprehension.

===Developmental approaches===

Language is a cognitive skill which develops throughout the life of an individual. This developmental process has been examined using a number of techniques, and a computational approach is one of them.  Human [[language development]] does provide some constraints which make it harder to apply a computational method to understanding it. For instance, during [[language acquisition]], human children are largely only exposed to positive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowerman, M. (1988). [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:468143:4/component/escidoc:532427/bowerman_1988_The-No.pdf The "no negative evidence" problem: How do children avoid constructing an overly general grammar. Explaining language universals].&lt;/ref&gt; This means that during the linguistic development of an individual, only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and not evidence for what is not correct.  This is insufficient information for a simple hypothesis testing procedure for information as complex as language,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Braine, M.D.S. (1971). On two types of models of the internalization of grammars. In D.I. Slobin (Ed.), The ontogenesis of grammar: A theoretical perspective. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and so provides certain boundaries for a computational approach to modeling language development and acquisition in an individual.

Attempts have been made to model the developmental process of language acquisition in children from a computational angle, leading to both [[stochastic grammar|statistical grammars]] and [[connectionism|connectionist models]].&lt;ref name="powers1989"&gt;Powers, D.M.W. &amp; Turk, C.C.R. (1989). ''Machine Learning of Natural Language''. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|978-0-387-19557-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Work in this realm has also been proposed as a method to explain the [[evolution of language]] through history.  Using models, it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Elman, J. (1993). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027793900584 Learning and development in neural networks: The importance of starting small]. Cognition, 71-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was simultaneously posed as a reason for the long developmental period of human children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"/&gt; Both conclusions were drawn because of the strength of the [[artificial neural network]] which the project created.

The ability of infants to develop language has also been modeled using robots&lt;ref&gt;Salvi, G., Montesano, L., Bernardino, A., &amp; Santos-Victor, J. (2012). Language bootstrapping: learning word meanings from perception-action association. IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics. Part B, Cybernetics : a publication of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, 42(3), 660-71. {{DOI|10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2172420}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test linguistic theories.  Enabled to learn as children might, a model was created based on an [[affordance]] model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words.  Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure, vastly simplifying the learning process and shedding light on information which furthers the current understanding of linguistic development.  It is important to note that this information could only have been empirically tested using a computational approach.

As our understanding of the linguistic development of an individual within a lifetime is continually improved using neural networks and [[Robot_learning|learning robotic systems]], it is also important to keep in mind that languages themselves change and develop through time.  Computational approaches to understanding this phenomenon have unearthed very interesting information.  Using the [[Price Equation]] and [[Pólya urn]] dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution, but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gong, T.|author2=Shuai, L.|author3=Tamariz, M.|author4=Jäger, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Studying Language Change Using Price Equation and Pólya-urn Dynamics|editor=E. Scalas|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|page=e33171|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033171|pmid=22427981|pmc=3299756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modeling effort achieved, through computational linguistics, what would otherwise have been impossible.

It is clear that the understanding of linguistic development in humans as well as throughout evolutionary time has been fantastically improved because of advances in computational linguistics. The ability to model and modify systems at will affords science an ethical method of testing hypotheses that would otherwise be intractable.

===Structural approaches===

In order to create better computational models of language, an understanding of language’s structure is crucial. To this end, the [[English language]] has been meticulously studied using computational approaches to better understand how the language works on a structural level.  One of the most important pieces of being able to study linguistic structure is the availability of large linguistic corpora, or samples.  This grants computational linguists the raw data necessary to run their models and gain a better understanding of the underlying structures present in the vast amount of data which is contained in any single language.  One of the most cited English linguistic corpora is the Penn [[Treebank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marcus, M.|author2=Marcinkiewicz, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1993|url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-2004.pdf|title=Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=313–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Derived from widely-different sources, such as IBM computer manuals and transcribed telephone conversations, this corpus contains over 4.5 million words of American English. This corpus has been primarily annotated using [[part-of-speech]] tagging and syntactic bracketing and has yielded substantial empirical observations related to language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Ann|title=Treebanks|date=2003|publisher=Spring Netherlands|pages=5–22|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical approaches to the structure of languages have also been developed.  These works allow computational linguistics to have a framework within which to work out hypotheses that will further the understanding of the language in a myriad of ways.  One of the original theoretical theses on internalization of [[grammar]] and structure of language proposed two types of models.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt;  In these models, rules or patterns learned increase in strength with the frequency of their encounter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; The work also created a question for computational linguists to answer: how does an infant learn a specific and non-normal grammar ([[Chomsky Normal Form]]) without learning an overgeneralized version and getting stuck?&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; Theoretical efforts like these set the direction for research to go early in the lifetime of a field of study, and are crucial to the growth of the field.

Structural information about languages allows for the discovery and implementation of similarity recognition between pairs of text utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angus, D.|author2=Smith, A.|author3=Wiles, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Conceptual recurrence plots: revealing patterns in human discourse|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=18|issue=6|pages=988–97|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2011.100|pmid=22499664}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, it has recently been proven that based on the structural information present in patterns of human discourse, conceptual [[recurrence plots]] can be used to model and visualize trends in data and create reliable measures of similarity between natural textual utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  This technique is a strong tool for further probing the structure of human [[discourse]].  Without the computational approach to this question, the vastly complex information present in discourse data would have remained inaccessible to scientists.

Information regarding the structural data of a language is available for [[English language|English]] as well as other languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Furuhashi, S.|author2=Hayakawa, Y. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Lognormality of the Distribution of Japanese Sentence Lengths|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=81|issue=3|page=034004|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.81.034004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using computational methods, Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of [[log-normality]] was found in relation to sentence length.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Though the exact cause of this lognormality remains unknown, it is precisely this sort of intriguing information which computational linguistics is designed to uncover.  This information could lead to further important discoveries regarding the underlying structure of Japanese, and could have any number of effects on the understanding of Japanese as a language.  Computational linguistics allows for very exciting additions to the scientific knowledge base to happen quickly and with very little room for doubt.

Without a computational approach to the structure of linguistic data, much of the information that is available now would still be hidden under the vastness of data within any single language.  Computational linguistics allows scientists to parse huge amounts of data reliably and efficiently, creating the possibility for discoveries unlike any seen in most other approaches.

===Production approaches===
{{Original research section|date=October 2015}}

The production of language is equally as complex in the information it provides and the necessary skills which a fluent producer must have.  That is to say, comprehension is only half the problem of communication.  The other half is how a system produces language, and computational linguistics has made some very interesting discoveries in this area.
[[File:Alan Turing Aged 16.jpg|thumb|Alan Turing: computer scientist and namesake developer of the [[Turing test|Turing Test]] as a method of measuring the intelligence of a machine.]]
In a now famous paper published in 1950 [[Alan Turing]] proposed the possibility that machines might one day have the ability to "think". As a thought experiment for what might define the concept of thought in machines, he proposed an "imitation test" in which a human subject has two text-only conversations, one with a fellow human and another with a machine attempting to respond like a human. Turing proposes that if the subject cannot tell the difference between the human and the machine, it may be concluded that the machine is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turing, A. M.|year=1950|jstor=10.2307/2251299|title=Computing machinery and intelligence|journal=Mind|volume=59|issue=236|pages=433–460|doi=10.1093/mind/lix.236.433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this test is known as the [[Turing test]] and it remains an influential idea in the area of artificial intelligence.

[[File:Joseph Weizenbaum.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Weizenbaum]]: former MIT professor and computer scientist who developed [[ELIZA]], a primitive computer program utilizing [[natural language processing]].]] One of the earliest and best known examples of a computer program designed to converse naturally with humans is the [[ELIZA]] program developed by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] at [[MIT]] in 1966. The program emulated a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian]] [[psychotherapist]] when responding to written statements and questions posed by a user. It appeared capable of understanding what was said to it and responding intelligently, but in truth it simply followed a pattern matching routine that relied on only understanding a few keywords in each sentence. Its responses were generated by recombining the unknown parts of the sentence around properly translated versions of the known words. For example, in the phrase "It seems that you hate me" ELIZA understands "you" and "me" which matches the general pattern "you [some words] me", allowing ELIZA to update the words "you" and "me" to "I" and "you" and replying "What makes you think I hate you?". In this example ELIZA has no understanding of the word "hate", but it is not required for a logical response in the context of this type of psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weizenbaum, J.|year=1966|title=ELIZA—a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=9|issue=1|pages=36–45|doi=10.1145/365153.365168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some projects are still trying to solve the problem which first started computational linguistics off as its own field in the first place. However, the methods have become more refined and clever, and consequently the results generated by computational linguists have become more enlightening.  In an effort to improve computer translation, several models have been compared, including [[hidden Markov models]], smoothing techniques, and the specific refinements of those to apply them to verb translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Och, F. J.|author2=Ney, H.|year=2003|title=A Systematic Comparison of Various Statistical Alignment Models|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=19–51|doi=10.1162/089120103321337421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model which was found to produce the most natural translations of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] words was a refined alignment model with a first-order dependence and a fertility model[16].  They also provide efficient training algorithms for the models presented, which can give other scientists the ability to improve further on their results. This type of work is specific to computational linguistics, and has applications which could vastly improve understanding of how language is produced and comprehended by computers.

Work has also been done in making computers produce language in a more naturalistic manner.  Using linguistic input from humans, algorithms have been constructed which are able to modify a system's style of production based on a factor such as linguistic input from a human, or more abstract factors like politeness or any of the [[Big Five personality traits|five main dimensions of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mairesse, F.|year=2011|title=Controlling user perceptions of linguistic style: Trainable generation of personality traits|journal=Computational Linguistics|doi=10.1162/COLI_a_00063|volume=37|issue=3|pages=455–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work takes a computational approach via [[parameter estimation]] models to categorize the vast array of linguistic styles we see across individuals and simplify it for a computer to work in the same way, making [[human-computer interaction]] much more natural.

==== Text-based interactive approach ====

Many of the earliest and simplest models of human-computer interaction, such as ELIZA for example, involve a text-based input from the user to generate a response from the computer. By this method, words typed by a user trigger the computer to recognize specific patterns and reply accordingly, through a process known as [[keyword spotting]].

==== Speech-based interactive approach ====

Recent technologies have placed more of an emphasis on speech-based interactive systems. These systems, such as [[Siri]] of the [[iOS]] operating system, operate on a similar pattern-recognizing technique as that of text-based systems, but with the former, the user input is conducted through [[speech recognition]]. This branch of linguistics involves the processing of the user's speech as sound waves and the interpreting of the acoustics and language patterns in order for the computer to recognize the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Files|last = |first = |publisher = The Ohio State University Department of Linguistics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780814251799|location = |pages = 624–634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehension approaches===

Much of the focus of modern computational linguistics is on comprehension. With the proliferation of the internet and the abundance of easily accessible written human language, the ability to create a program capable of [[natural language understanding|understanding human language]] would have many broad and exciting possibilities, including improved search engines, automated customer service, and online education.

Early work in comprehension included applying Bayesian statistics to the task of optical character recognition, as illustrated by Bledsoe and Browing in 1959 in which a large dictionary of possible letters were generated by "learning" from example letters and then the probability that any one of those learned examples matched the new input was combined to make a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Bledsoe, W. W.|author2=Browning, I.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1959|title=Pattern recognition and reading by machine|conference=''Papers presented at the December 1–3, 1959, eastern joint IRE-AIEE-ACM computer conference on - IRE-AIEE-ACM  ’59 (Eastern)''|pages=225–232|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1460299.1460326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts at applying Bayesian statistics to language analysis included the work of Mosteller and Wallace (1963) in which an analysis of the words used in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' was used to attempt to determine their authorship (concluding that Madison most likely authored the majority of the papers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mosteller, F.|year=1963|jstor=10.2307/2283270|title=Inference in an authorship problem|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=58|issue=302|pages=275–309|doi=10.2307/2283270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[Terry Winograd]] developed an early [[natural language processing]] engine capable of interpreting naturally written commands within a simple rule governed environment. The primary language parsing program in this project was called [[SHRDLU]], which was capable of carrying out a somewhat natural conversation with the user giving it commands, but only within the scope of the toy environment designed for the task. This environment consisted of different shaped and colored blocks, and SHRDLU was capable of interpreting commands such as "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box." and asking questions such as "I don't understand which pyramid you mean." in response to the user's input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Winograd, T.|year=1971|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0721399|title=Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; While impressive, this kind of [[natural language processing]] has proven much more difficult outside the limited scope of the toy environment. Similarly a project developed by [[NASA]] called [[LUNAR]] was designed to provide answers to naturally written questions about the geological analysis of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Woods, W.|author2=Kaplan, R.|author3=Nash-Webber, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1972|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247926251|title=The lunar sciences natural language information system|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of problems are referred to as [[question answering]].

Initial attempts at understanding spoken language were based on work done in the 1960s and 1970s in signal modeling where an unknown signal is analyzed to look for patterns and to make predictions based on its history. An initial and somewhat successful approach to applying this kind of signal modeling to language was achieved with the use of hidden Markov models as detailed by Rabiner in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabiner, L.|year=1989|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=18626|title=A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=77|issue=2|pages=257–286|doi=10.1109/5.18626|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3454}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach attempts to determine probabilities for the arbitrary number of models that could be being used in generating speech as well as modeling the probabilities for various words generated from each of these possible models. Similar approaches were employed in early [[speech recognition]] attempts starting in the late 70s at IBM using word/part-of-speech pair probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahl, L.|author2=Baker, J.|author3=Cohen, P.|author4=Jelinek, F.|year=1978|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1170402|title=Recognition of continuously read natural corpus|journal=Acoustics, Speech, and Signal|volume=3|pages=422–424|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.1978.1170402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently these kinds of statistical approaches have been applied to more difficult tasks such as topic identification using Bayesian parameter estimation to infer topic probabilities in text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blei, D.|author2=Ng, A. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937|title=Latent dirichlet allocation|journal=The Journal of Machine Learning|volume=3|pages=993–1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Modern computational linguistics is often a combination of studies in computer science and programming, math, particularly statistics, language structures, and natural language processing. Combined, these fields most often lead to the development of systems that can recognize speech and perform some task based on that speech. Examples include speech recognition software, such as Apple's Siri feature, spellcheck tools, [[speech synthesis]] programs, which are often used to demonstrate pronunciation or help the disabled, and machine translation programs and websites, such as Google Translate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/linguistics/careers-computational-linguistics/|title=Careers in Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=California State University|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational linguistics can be especially helpful in situations involving [[social media]] and the [[Internet]]. For example, filters in chatrooms or on website searches require computational linguistics. Chat operators often use filters to identify certain words or phrases and deem them inappropriate so that users cannot submit them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another example of using filters is on websites. Schools use filters so that websites with certain keywords are blocked from children to view. There are also many programs in which parents use [[Parental controls]] to put content filters in place. Computational linguists can also develop programs that group and organize content through [[Social media mining]]. An example of this is Twitter, in which programs can group tweets by subject or keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Marujo, Lu&lt;math&gt;\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;s et al. "Automatic Keyword Extraction on Twitter." Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, n.d. Web. 19 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational linguistics is also used for document retrieval and clustering. When you do an online search, documents and websites are retrieved based on the frequency of unique labels related to what you typed into a search engine. For instance, if you search "red, large, four-wheeled vehicle," with the intention of finding pictures of a red truck, the search engine will still find the information desired by matching words such as "four-wheeled" with "car".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/#DocRetCluApp|title=Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=Feb 26, 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 19, 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or [[natural language generation|synthesizing language (generation)]].

[[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages. The possibility of automatic language translation, however, has yet to be realized and remains a notoriously hard branch of computational linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Oettinger, A. G. (1965). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2313322 Computational Linguistics]. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 72, No. 2, Part 2: Computers and Computing, pp. 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:
* [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] of natural language, largely modeled on [[automata theory]], with the application of [[context-sensitive grammar]] and [[Linear bounded automaton|linearly bounded]] [[Turing machine]]s.
* [[Computational semantics]] comprises defining suitable logics for [[linguistic meaning]] representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them
* Computer-aided [[corpus linguistics]], which has been used since the 1970s as a way to make detailed advances in the field of discourse analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McEnery|first=Thomas|title=Corpus Linguistics: An Introduction|year=1996|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0748611652|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nwmgdvN_akAC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22computer+aided+corpus+linguistics%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22computer%20aided%20corpus%20linguistics%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Design of [[parser]]s or [[phrase chunking|chunkers]] for [[natural language]]s
* Design of taggers like [[Part-of-speech tagging|POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)]]
* [[Machine translation]] as one of the earliest and most difficult applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields.
* Simulation and study of language evolution in [[historical linguistics]]/[[glottochronology]].

== Legacy ==
The subject of computational linguistics has had a recurring impact on popular culture:
* The 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'' features a young computer hacker who interacts with an artificially intelligent supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = WarGames|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/|date = 1983-06-03|accessdate = 2016-02-22|first = John|last = Badham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Reconstruction''' is a [[theory]] of architecture and urbanism originally developed by the Berlin architect [[Josef Paul Kleihues]]. It was first applied in Berlin's [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|International Building Exhibition]] in the 1980s, and was subsequently used in the reconstruction of the city after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] under Senate Building Director [[Hans Stimmann]]. Critical Reconstruction encouraged a return to traditional (pre-World War II) architectural styles and typologies, and sought to recreate the pedestrian-centered urban street life of the early twentieth-century European metropolis through the restoration of the inner city’s original baroque-era street plan.

Post-wall Critical Reconstruction in Berlin was closely associated with an architectural approach called "New Simplicity," theorized by [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] and championed by architect [[Hans Kollhoff]].

Hans Stimmann also used Critical Reconstruction as the basis for his ''[[Planwerk Innenstadt]]'', an inner-city development plan for Berlin that favored the demolition of mid-century buildings and the infill of empty plots with higher-density, mixed-use structures.

Major examples of Critical Reconstruction in Berlin include [[Potsdamer Platz]], the Friedrichstadt Passagen, and [[Alexanderplatz]].

In [[theoretical physics]], '''cutoff''' is an arbitrary maximal or minimal value of [[energy]], [[momentum]], or [[length]], used in order that objects with larger or smaller values than these [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] are ignored in some calculation. It is usually represented within a particular [[energy scale|energy]] or [[length scale]], such as [[Planck units]].

When used in this context, the traditional terms "[[infrared]]" and "[[ultraviolet]]" are not literal references to specific regions of the spectrum.

==Infrared and ultraviolet cutoff==
An '''infrared cutoff''' (long-distance cutoff) is the minimal value of energy – or, equivalently, the maximal [[wavelength]] (usually a very large distance) – that will be taken into account in a calculation, typically an integral.

At the opposite end of the energy scale, an '''ultraviolet cutoff''' is the maximal allowed energy or the shortest allowed distance (usually a very short [[length scale]]).

==Effect on calculation==
A typical use of cutoffs is to prevent [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] from appearing during calculation. If some quantities are computed as [[integral]]s over energy or another physical quantity, these cutoffs determine the limits of integration. The exact physics is reproduced when the appropriate cutoffs are sent to zero or infinity. However, these integrals are often divergent – see [[IR divergence]] and [[UV divergence]] – and a cutoff is needed. The dependence of physical quantities on the chosen cutoffs (especially the ultraviolet cutoffs) is the main focus of the theory of the [[renormalization group]].

'''Description''' is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Description is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fiction-writing mode==
Fiction-writing also has modes: [[Action (fiction)|action]], exposition, description, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrell |2006 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selgin |2007 |p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of [[fiction-writing mode]]s and their uses.

Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in ''Writing from A to Z'', edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Polking |1990 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.

==Purple prose==
{{Main|Purple prose}}
A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ([[Latin]]:  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 20 [[Before Christ|BC]]) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, '''purple prose''' is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, the [[Theory of descriptions|nature of description]] has been an important question since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Ludlow|first= Peter |year=2007|title= Descriptions|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Dicopper chloride trihydroxide ''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.  It is often referred to as '''tribasic copper chloride''' (TBCC), '''copper trihydroxyl chloride''' or '''copper hydroxychloride'''.  It is a greenish [[crystalline solid]] encountered in [[mineral deposit]]s, metal corrosion products, industrial products, art and archeological objects, and some living systems.  It was originally manufactured on an industrial scale as a precipitated material used as either a [[chemical intermediate]] or a [[fungicide]].  Since 1994, a purified, crystallized product has been produced at the scale of thousands of tons per year, and used extensively as a [[nutritional supplement]] for animals.

==Natural occurrence==

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl occurs as natural minerals in four [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]] [[crystal]] forms: [[atacamite]], [[paratacamite]],  [[clinoatacamite]], and [[botallackite]].  Atacamite is [[orthorhombic]], paratacamite is [[rhombohedral]], and the other two polymorphs are [[monoclinic]].  Atacamite and paratacamite are common secondary minerals in areas of [[copper]] [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]] and frequently form as [[corrosion]] products of Cu-bearing metals.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, H.

The most common Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl polymorph is atacamite.  It is an [[oxidation]] product of other copper minerals, especially under arid, saline conditions.  It was found in fumarolic deposits, and a [[weathering]] product of [[sulfide]]s in subsea [[black smoker]] deposits.  It was named for the [[Atacama Desert]] in [[Chile]].  Its color varies from blackish to emerald green.  It is the sugar-like coating of dark green glistening crystals found on many bronze objects from [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]].  It has also been found in living systems such as the jaws of the marine bloodworm ''Glycera dibranchiate''.  The stability of atacamite is evidenced by its ability to endure dynamic regimes in its natural geologic environment.&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(a)  Lichtenegger, H. C.; Schöberl, T.; Bartl, M. H.; Waite, H.; Stucky, G. D.  High Abrasion Resistance with Sparse Mineralization: Copper Biomineral in Worm Jaws.

Paratacamite is another Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl polymorph that was named for the Atacama Desert in Chile.  It has been identified in the powdery light-green corrosion product that forms on a copper or [[bronze]] surface – at times in corrosion pustules.  It can be distinguished from atacamite by the rhombohedral shape of its crystals.&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleet"/&gt;

Botallackite is the least stable of the four Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl polymorphs.  It is pale bluish-green in color.  This rare mineral was first found, and later identified, in the [[Botallack Mine]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]].  It is also a rare corrosion product on archaeological finds.  For instance, it was identified on an Egyptian statue of [[Bastet]].&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawthorne"/&gt;

The fourth polymorph of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl family is clinoatacamite.   It was found and identified around in [[Chuquicamata]], Chile in 1996.  It was named in allusion to its monoclinic [[crystal system|morphology]] and relationship to atacamite.  It too is pale green but has monoclinic crystals.  Clinoatacamite can be easily confused with the closely related paratacamite.  It is believed that clinoatacamite should replace most previously reported occurrences of paratacamite in the conservation literature.&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jambor"/&gt;

==Structure==

Atacamite is orthorhombic, [[space group]] Pnma, with two crystallographically independent Cu and hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the asymmetric unit.  Both Cu atoms display characteristically [[Jahn-Teller]] distorted octahedral (4+2) [[coordination geometry]]: each Cu is bonded to four nearest OH groups with Cu-OH distance of 2.01Å; in addition, one of Cu atoms is bonded to two Cl atoms (at 2.76Å) to form a [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] [[octahedron]], and the other Cu atom is bonded to one Cl atom (at 2.75Å) and a distant OH group (at 2.36Å) to form a [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] octahedron.  The two different types of octahedron are edge-linked to form a three-dimensional framework with the [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] octahedron cross-linking the [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedron layers parallel to (110) (Figure 1).&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

[[File:atacamiteB.png|center|thumb|400px|Figure 1.  Cu coordination and bonding in atacamite]]

Botallackite crystallizes in monoclinic with space group P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/m.  Like in atacamite, there are two different types of Cu coordination geometries: Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl].  But these octahedra assemble in different ways.  Each octahedron shares six edges with surrounding octahedra, forming a two-dimensional sheet-type structure parallel to (100).  The adjacent sheets are held together by [[hydrogen bonding]] between the [[hydroxyl]] [[oxygen]] atoms of one sheet and the opposing [[chlorine]] atoms in the other sheets.  The resulting weak bonding between the sheets accounts for the perfect (100) cleavage and the typical platy habit of botallackite (Figure 2).&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawthorne"/&gt;

[[File:botallackiteB.png|center|thumb|400px|Figure 2.  Cu coordination and bonding in botallackite]]

Paratacamite is rhombohedral, space group R&lt;u style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;3&lt;/u&gt;.  It has a well-developed substructure with a’=a/2, c’=c, apparent space group R&lt;u style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;3&lt;/u&gt;m.  There are four crystallographically independent Cu atoms in the asymmetric unit.   The Cu atoms display three different types of octahedral coordination geometries.  Three quarters of the Cu atoms are coordinated to four near OH groups and two distant Cl atoms, giving the expected (4+2) configuration [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].  Three sixteenths of the Cu atoms are bonded to two near OH groups at 1.93Å and four stretched OH groups at 2.20Å to form an axially compressed (2+4) octahedral [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], and the remaining one sixteenth of the Cu atoms are bonded to six equivalent OH groups at 2.12Å to form a regular octahedral [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;].  The Jahn-Teller distorted [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedra share the edges and form partially occupied layers parallel to (001), and the compressed and regular [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedra cross-link the adjacent [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedral layers to form a three-dimensional framework.  The existence of the regular octahedral [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is unusual, and it has been shown that partial substitution of Zn or Ni for Cu at this special site (3b) is necessary to stabilize paratacamite structure at [[ambient temperature]].  Due to the high symmetry of the special position, only about 2 wt% Zn is necessary to stabilize the rhombohedral structure.  In fact, most of paratacamite crystals studied contain significant amounts of Zn or Ni (&gt;2 wt%) (Figure 3).&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleet"/&gt;

[[File:paratacamite.png|center|thumb|400px|Figure 3.  Cu coordination and bonding in paratacamite]]

Clinoatacamite is monoclinic, space group P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/m.  The structure is very close to that of paratacamite.  But the [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedron is Jahn-Teller distorted.  The Jahn-Teller distorted [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedra share the edges to form partially occupied layers parallel to (101).  This layer is topologically the same as that in [[mica]].  Adjacent layers of octahedra are offset, such that vacant sites in one sheet align with occupied sites in the neighboring sheet.  The [Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedra link the layers to form a 3-dimensional network (Figure 4).&lt;ref name="handbookofmineralogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jambor"/&gt;

Thermodynamic data based on the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of formation indicates that the order of stability of these polymorphs is clinoatacamite&gt;atacamite&gt; botallackite.  Spectroscopic studies show that the strength of hydrogen bonding in these polymorphs is in the order paratacamite &gt;atacamite&gt; botallackite.  Studies on the formation of basic [[Copper(II) chloride|copper chloride]] indicate botallackite is a key intermediate and crystallizes first under most conditions; subsequent recrystallization of botallackite to atacamite or paratacamite depends on the nature of reaction medium.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, R.

==Properties==

Dicopper chloride trihydroxide Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl is a green crystalline solid.  It decomposes above 220&amp;nbsp;°C with elimination of [[hydrochloric acid]] to oxides of copper.  It is largely stable in neutral media, but decomposes by warming in [[alkaline]] media, yielding oxides.  It is virtually insoluble in water and organic solvents, soluble in mineral acids yielding the corresponding copper salts (eq. 1), soluble in [[ammonia]], [[amine]] and [[EDTA]] solutions under complex formation.  It can easily be converted to [[copper hydroxide]] by reacting with [[sodium hydroxide]] (eq. 2).  Its pH in water is 6.9 measured by EPA method SW846-9045.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micro.net/pdf/TBCC%20MSDS.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl +  3 HCl  →  2 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +   3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O                  (eq.1)

:Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl +  NaOH  → 2Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + NaCl                               (eq.2)

Most of the published [[scientific literature]] on the properties of the compound has focused on specimens found as natural minerals or corrosion products on copper [[alloy]]s, or prepared under laboratory conditions.

==Traditionally reported preparation routes==
===Hydrolysis of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl can be prepared by [[hydrolysis]] of a CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution at pH 4 ~7.  A variety of bases such as [[sodium carbonate]], [[ammonium]], [[calcium]], or sodium hydroxide may be used (eq. 3).&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

:2CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 NaOH  →  Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl +  3 NaCl                            (eq.3)

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl can also be prepared by the reaction of a hot CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution with freshly precipitated CuO (eq. 4).

:CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 CuO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl                   (eq.4)

If sufficient chloride [[ion]]s are present in solution, hydrolysis of CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with alkali also produces Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (eq. 5).

:2 CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 NaOH  +  NaCl →  Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  2 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;                 (eq.5)

==Industrial production==
===Air oxidation of Cu(I)Cl in brine solution===

Prior to 1994, large scale industrial production of basic copper chloride was devoted to making either a fungicide for crop protection or an intermediate in the manufacture of other copper compounds.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;  In neither of those applications was the polymorphic nature of the compound, or the size of individual particles of particular importance, so the [[manufacturing process]]es were simple precipitation schemes.

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl can be prepared by air oxidation of Cu(I)Cl in [[brine]] solution.  The Cu(I)Cl solution is usually made by reduction of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solutions over copper metal.  A CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution with concentrated brine is contacted with copper metal until the Cu(II) is completely reduced.  The resulting Cu(I)Cl is then heated to 60 ~ 90&amp;nbsp;°C and aerated to effect the oxidation and hydrolysis.  The oxidation reaction can be performed with or without the copper metal.  The precipitated product is separated and the [[mother liquor]] containing CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCl, is recycled back to the process (eq. 6 ~ 7).

:CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Cu + 2 NaCl  →  2 NaCuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                                   (eq.6)
:6 NaCuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  2 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 6 NaCl        (eq.7)

The product from this process is of fine particle with size of 1 ~ 5&amp;nbsp;µm and is usable as an agricultural fungicide.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

===Micronutrients process===

In 1994, an unusually efficient, economic, reliable and green process was developed for commercial production of a purified and crystallized form of tribasic copper chloride.&lt;ref name="Steward"&gt;(a)  Steward, F. A.  Micronutrients, Heritage Environmental Service, US.  Micronutrient supplement.  WO95024834, US5451414, US5534043, CN1147755A, CN1069181C (ZL 95192983.6)   (b)  Steward, F. A.  Micronutrients, Heritage Environmental Service, US.  Vitamin compatible micronutrient supplement.  WO00032206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steward 2000"&gt;Steward, F. A.  Development and manufacture of an innovative mineral feed ingredient produced from recycled copper.  Proceeding of The 4th Int. Symposium on Recycling of Metals and Engineered Materials, Oct. 22-25, 2000, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;  It results in a stable, free-flowing, non-dusty green powder with typical particle size of 30 ~ 100 micron.  The combination of its density and particle size distribution results in blending and handling characteristics beneficial in preparation of uniform [[Fodder|animal feed]] mixtures.

Initially, that new process was designed to utilize spent [[etching (microfabrication)|etchant]] streams from the electronic [[printed circuit board]] manufacturing industry as starting materials.

There are two types of spent etching solutions from printed circuit board manufacturing operations: an acidic [[cupric chloride]] solution (CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HCl), and an alkaline cuprammine chloride solution (Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Tribasic copper chloride is generated by neutralization of either one of these two solutions ([[acidic]] or [[alkaline]] pathway), or by combination of these two solutions, a self-neutralization reaction.

In the acidic pathway, the cupric chloride solution can be neutralized with [[caustic soda]], or ammonia, lime, or other base.

In the alkaline pathway, cuprammine chloride solution can be neutralized with HCl or other available acidic solutions (eq. 8).

:2 [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]  +  5 HCl  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +    8 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl           (eq. 8)

More efficiently, the two spent etching solutions are combined under mild acidic conditions, one neutralizing the other, to produce higher yield of basic copper chloride (eq. 9).

:3 [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]  +  5 CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  4 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +    12 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl         (eq. 9)

Seeding is introduced during crystallization.  The production is operated continuously under well-defined conditions (pH, feeding rate, concentrations, temperature, etc.).  Product with good particle size is produced and can be easily separated from background salt and other impurities in the mother liquor.  After simple rinse with water and drying, pure, free-flowing, non-dusty green crystalline solid with typical particle size of 30 ~ 100 micron is obtained.  The product from this process is predominantly atacamite and paratacamite, the stable crystal forms of basic copper chloride – and is called alpha basic copper chloride for simplicity.  Careful control of process conditions to favor the alpha polymorphs results in a product that remains free flowing over extended storage times, thus avoiding [[caking (chemical engineering)|caking]] as occurs with both copper sulfate and the botallackite crystal form - also called beta basic copper chloride.  This process has been used to manufacture thousands of tons of tribasic copper chloride every year, and has been the predominant route of commercial production since it was introduced by [[Micronutrients]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Steward 2000"/&gt;

==Applications==
===As an agriculture fungicide===

Fine Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl has been used as a fungicidal spray on tea, orange, grape, rubber, coffee, cardamom, and cotton etc., and as an aerial spray on rubber for control of [[phytophthora]] attack on leaves.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubej, A.; Koloini, T.; Pohar, C.  INDUSTRIAL PRECIPITATION OF CUPRIC HYDROXY-SALTS.  Acta Chim. Slov. 2004, 51, 751-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a pigment===

Basic copper chloride has been used as a [[pigment]] and as a colorant for glass and ceramics.  It was widely used as a coloring agent in [[wall painting]], [[manuscript illumination]], and other paintings by ancient people.  It was also used in cosmetics by ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Eastaugh, N.; Walsh, V.; Chaplin, T.; Siddall, R.  The Pigment Compendium.  A Dictionary of Historical Pigments.

===As a catalyst===

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl has been used in the preparation of [[catalyst]]s and as a catalyst in [[organic synthesis]] for [[halogenation|chlorination]] and/or [[Redox|oxidation]].

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl has been shown to be a catalyst in the chlorination of [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, C. et al.  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2002, 41, 2341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atacamite and paratacamite crystal forms of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl have been found to be active species in supported CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst systems for the [[oxidative]] [[carbonylation]] of methanol to [[dimethyl carbonate]].  A number of supported Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl catalysts have also been prepared and studied in such conversion.    Dimethyl carbonate is an environmentally benign chemical product and unique intermediate with versatile [[chemical reactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ren, J.; Li, Z.; Liu, S.; Lu, X.; Xie, K.

===As a commercial feed supplement===

Copper is one of the most critically important of the [[trace mineral]]s that are essential elements in numerous [[enzyme]]s that support [[metabolic]] [[Function (biology)|functions]] in most organisms.  Since the early 1900s, copper has routinely been added to animal feedstuffs to support good health and normal development.  Starting in the 1950s, there was increasing focus on the issue of [[bioavailability]] of trace mineral supplements which led to copper sulfate pentahydrate becoming the predominant source.  Because of its high [[water solubility]], and thus [[hygroscopicity]], CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; leads to destructive reactions in feed mixtures.  These are notoriously destructive in hot, humid climates.  Recognition that basic copper chloride would reduce feed stability problems led to issuance of patents on the use of the compound as a nutritional source.&lt;ref name="Steward"/&gt;

Subsequently, animal feeding studies revealed that the alpha crystal form of basic copper chloride has a rate of chemical reactivity that is well matched to biological processes.  The strength of the bonds holding copper in the alpha crystal polymorphs could prevent undesirable, anti-nutritive interactions with other feed ingredients while delivering controlled amounts of copper throughout the active zones in the [[digestive tract]] of an animal.  

Success in producing alpha basic copper chloride on a large scale allowed for the widespread application of basic copper chloride in the feed thereby supplying the copper requirements of all major [[livestock]] groups.  This form of the compound has proven to be particularly suitable as a commercial feed supplement for use in livestock and [[aquaculture]] due to its inherent chemical and physical characteristics. Compared to copper sulfate, the alpha crystal form of basic copper chloride provides many benefits including improved feed stability, less oxidative destruction of vitamins and other essential feed ingredients; superior blending in feed mixtures, and reduced handing costs.  It has been widely used in feed formulations for most species, including chickens, turkeys, pigs, beef and dairy cattle, horses, pets, aquaculture and exotic [[zoo]] [[animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammerman, C.

== History ==
The main campus of Duke University is not in close proximity to the ocean, but with the Marine Laboratory campus, the University is able to conduct hands-own oceanographic studies.

The site for the laboratory was selected  in the early 1930s, with the first building completed by 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://today.duke.edu/2013/10/archivesmarinelab|title=From the Archives: Marine Lab 'Then and Now'|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original intention of the facility was to be a summer training facility and research facility for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uansoe/|title=Guide to the Nicholas School of the Environment Records, 1916-ongoing|website=David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963, the facility had reached national recognition for its resources. At the time 75% of students and 40% of researchers came from other universities than Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bookhout|first=C.G.|date=1963|title=DUKE UNIVERSITY MARINE LABORATORY|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article-pdf/3/3/270/5936741/3-3-270.pdf|journal=Marine Laboratories|volume=|pages=270-272|via=OUP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sylvia Earle]], a renowned oceanographer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/last-dive-funding-human-expeditions-ocean-may-have-run-aground-63201|title=The Last Dive?|date=2013-01-14|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneer of [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s AquaLung [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] device, received her M.S. and Ph.D. from [[Duke University|Duke]] in 1956 and 1966, and has a connection to the Marine Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/sylvia-earle-face-marine-biology-receives-distinguished-alumni-award|title=Sylvia Earle, “Face of Marine Biology,” Receives Distinguished Alumni Award {{!}} Duke Graduate School|website=gradschool.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the laboratory assumed much of the research of [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s West Indies Laboratory for Underwater Research in [[Saint Croix|St. Croix]], [[Virgin Islands]] after [[Hurricane Hugo]] damaged the St. Croix facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/02/us/education-year-of-classes-canceled-at-marine-lab.html|title=EDUCATION;   Year of Classes Canceled at Marine Lab|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/us/education-fairleigh-dickinson-closing-laboratory-on-virgin-islands.html|title=EDUCATION;   Fairleigh Dickinson Closing Laboratory On Virgin Islands|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cindy Lee Van Dover]] was named the first female-director of the center in 2007. She has initially worked at the laboratory in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/science/16conv.html|title=Deep in the Sea, Imagining the Cradle of Life on Earth|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2017, the Marine Laboratory participated in a green-illumination protest with other buildings at [[Duke University|Duke]] in support of the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Accords]] along with similar actions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article154448114.html|title=Duke’s environment school joins list of buildings being lit green|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities and Ships ==

Since its inception in 1938, the campus has expanded significantly to include [[Wet laboratory|wet]] and [[dry lab]]oratories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nicholas.duke.edu/sites/default/files/dumlmap.pdf|title=Duke Marine Lab Campus Map|last=|first=|date=|website=Duke University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a fleet of research ships.

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''', Its Origins and Character'', is a 1953 book on [[art history]] by [[Erwin Panofsky]], derived from the 1947–48 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]. The book had a wide impact&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 7. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on studies of [[Renaissance art]] and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in particular, but also studies in [[iconography]], art history, and [[intellectual history]] in general. The book is particularly well-known for its iconographic treatment of [[Jan Van Eyck|Van Eyck's]] ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' as a kind of marriage contract, a hypothesis advanced by Panofsky as early as 1934. The book remains influential despite its reliance on black-and-white reproductions of paintings, which led to some errors of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Books That Shaped Art History'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

''Early Netherlandish Painting'' shares its title with the [[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|comprehensive, 14-volume survey]] by [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max J. Friedländer]], a fact obliquely acknowledged at the beginning of the preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Netherlandish Painting'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The recurrence may be in the form of a varying voltage or a varying current.  The waveform may be [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] or some other shape when its magnitude is plotted against time.  Electronic oscillation may be intentionally caused, as in devices designed as [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]], or it may be the result of unintentional [[positive feedback]] from the output of an electronic device to its input.  The latter appears often in feedback [[amplifiers]] (such as [[operational amplifier]]s) that do not have sufficient [[Bode_plot#Gain_margin_and_phase_margin|gain or phase margins]]. In this case, the oscillation often interferes with or compromises the amplifier's intended function, and is known as [[parasitic oscillation]].

== How it works ==

FASTpp measures the quantity of protein that resists digestion under various conditions. To this end, a thermostable protease is used, which cleaves specifically at exposed [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobic]] residues. The FASTpp assay combines the thermal unfolding, specificity of a thermostable protease for the unfolded fraction with the separation power of [[SDS-PAGE]].&lt;ref name="pmid5432063"&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 5259 
| pages = 680–685 
| year = 1970

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this combination, FASTpp can detect changes in the fraction folded over a large physico-chemical range of conditions including temperatures up to 85&amp;nbsp;°C, [[pH]] 6-9, presence or absence of the whole [[proteome]]. Applications range from [[biotechnology]] to study of [[point mutations]] and [[ligand binding assay]]s.

== Technology ==

First, a cell lysate is generated by glass beads beating, pressure homogenisation or chemical or physical lysis methods that do not denature the protein(s) of interest. (Optionally for targeted analysis) a protein of interest is purified out of this lysate by affinity methods based on intrinsically disordered tags &lt;ref name="Designing disorder"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28516025|year=2013|last1=Minde|first1=DP|last2=Halff|first2=EF|last3=Tans|first3=SJ|
title=Designing disorder: Tales of the unexpected tails.|doi=10.4161/idp.26790|journal=Intrinsically Disordered Proteins|volume=1|pmc=5424805|page=e26790}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other suitable purification strategies, often involving several orthogonal chromatographic steps.

This (total or purified) protein solution is aliquoted into several tubes of a PCR strip. All aliquots are exposed in parallel in a thermal gradient PCR cycler to different maximal temperatures in presence of the thermostable protease thermolysin (see figure). 
Automated temperature control is achieved in a thermal gradient cycler (commonly used for [[PCR]]s). Reaction products can be separated by [[SDS-PAGE]] or [[western blot]].&lt;ref name="pmid5432063"/&gt;  The protease thermolysin can be fully inactivated by [[EDTA]]. This feature of [[thermolysin]] makes FASTpp compatible with subsequent [[trypsin]] digestion e.g. for [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=Proteomics&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22733688|year=2012|last1=Chang|first1=Y|last2=Schlebach|first2=JP|last3=Verheul|first3=RA|last4=Park|first4=C|title=Simplified proteomics approach to discover protein-ligand interactions|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1280–7|doi=10.1002/pro.2112|journal=Protein Science|pmc=3631357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulse Proteolysis NM"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15782190|year=2005|last1=Park|first1=C|last2=Marqusee|first2=S|title=Pulse proteolysis: A simple method for quantitative determination of protein stability and ligand binding|volume=2|issue=3|pages=207–12|doi=10.1038/nmeth740|journal=Nature Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feast of the Gods''' or '''Banquet of the Gods''' as a subject in art showing a group of deities at table has a long history going back into [[Ancient history|antiquity]].  Showing [[Ancient Greek religion|Greco-Roman deities]], it enjoyed a revival in popularity in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and then in the [[Low Countries]] during the 16th century, when it was popular with [[Northern Mannerist]] painters, at least partly as an opportunity to show copious amounts of nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 342–343; Woolett, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the occasion shown was specifically either the wedding of [[Cupid and Psyche]] or that of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], but other works show other occasions, especially the ''Feast of Bacchus'', or a generalized feast. While the wedding of Cupid and Psyche is just the happy ending of Psyche's story, the wedding of Peleus and Thetis is part of the grand narrative of Greek mythology.  The feast was interrupted by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, who threw the golden [[Apple of Discord]] inscribed "for the most beautiful" into the company, provoking the argument that led to the [[Judgement of Paris]], and ultimately to the [[Trojan War]].  Eris is sometimes shown in the air with the apple, or the apple with the diners, and sometimes the feast forms a background scene to a painting of the Judgement, or ''vice versa''.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 343&lt;/ref&gt;  This wedding was also used as a political symbol around the time of the marriage of the Dutch leader [[William the Silent]] to [[Charlotte of Bourbon]] in 1575.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 343, citing P. Grootkerk's PhD, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, despite Thetis being a sea-nymph, depictions of her wedding have the same inland setting as other scenes. A depiction by [[Hans Rottenhammer]] (1600, [[Hermitage Museum]]) probably of the wedding of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Amphitrite]] is set in a beach-side pavilion, with the sea full of an unruly crowd of marine mythological creatures.  The ''Feast of [[Achelous]]'' is derived from [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', who describes  how [[Theseus]] is entertained by the river god in a damp grotto, while waiting for the river's raging flood to subside: "He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject was painted a number of times, with Rubens producing an early version with [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]],&lt;ref&gt;Woollett, 60-63&lt;/ref&gt; and a later picture attributed to his "school", and Hendrick van Balen collaborating with [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]. All show much smaller and more decorously behaved groups than the wedding parties.

==Italian Renaissance== 
[[File:Feastofthegods.jpg|thumb|''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] and Titian (1514–29), also with [[Priapus]] and [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]], also bottom right]]

One of the earliest depictions is a ''[[cassone]]'' panel  by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] from the 1490s (Louvre, ''illustrated''); this is paired with a panel of the ''Procession of Thetis'', another common way of depicting a wedding; artists were unsure what form an actual Olympian wedding ceremony might have taken.  A more sophisticated but similar depiction of a rustic picnic eaten on the ground, is ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' by [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1514), later changed by [[Titian]] (to 1529), a large and important painting; both show the story of [[Priapus]] and [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]].&lt;ref name="Bull"&gt;Bull, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major [[fresco]]s from the end of the [[High Renaissance]] showed the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche: [[Raphael]]'s central panel in the "[[Loggia]] of Psyche" at the [[Villa Farnesina]] in Rome, and [[Giulio Romano]]'s wall panel in the [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]].  Both of these became very well-known through [[old master print|print versions]], often freely adapting the compositions, and inspired a wide range of versions in drawings and media of the decorative arts such as [[Maiolica|majolica]], painted [[Limoges enamel]] and [[pastiglia]].  Giulio's version seems to show the preparations rather than the feast itself, and only a few of the invited gods have so far arrived. But it is highly atmospheric and its dispersal of the figures across a large setting was to recur in many later depictions.&lt;ref name="Bull" /&gt;  Both frescos showed a good proportion of the participants nude, or almost so, reflecting the practice of recent decades in mythological paintings. The ''[[Pastoral Concert|Fête champêtre]]'' of [[Titian]] (or [[Giorgione]]) may represent a mythological subject, if not a feast then at least a picnic of the gods.

Around the mid-century [[Taddeo Zuccari]] did the ''Wedding of Bacchus and Ariadne'' in fresco in the [[Villa Giulia]], Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 105&lt;/ref&gt; and in northern Europe [[Francesco Primaticcio]] painted that of Peleus and Thetis in a mythological series in the ballroom of the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/340554 Drawing of ''Apple of Discord Thrown by Eris at the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis'']: Study for Fresco in the Hall of Henri II at Fountainebleau, Francesco Primaticcio, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frans Floris]] painted a monumental feast in oil (c. 1550, [[Antwerp]]),&lt;ref&gt;Woolett, 60&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two metres across, as well as a ''Feast of the Seagods'' (1561, [[Stockholm]]).

==Northern Mannerism==

The revival of interest in the subject some decades later in [[Northern Mannerism]] seems to spring from a large [[engraving]] of 1587 by [[Hendrik Goltzius]] in [[Haarlem]] of a drawing by [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] (now [[Rijksmuseum]]) that [[Karel van Mander]] had brought back from [[Prague]], where Spranger was court painter to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].  ''The Feast of the Gods at the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche'' was so large, at 16 7/8 &amp;times; 33 5/8 in. (43 &amp;times; 85.4&amp;nbsp;cm), that it was printed from three different plates. Over 80 figures are shown, placed up in the clouds over a [[world landscape]] that can be glimpsed below.  The composition borrows from both Raphael and Giulio Romano's versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.113 The engraving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1477730&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=1852,1211.63&amp;page=1 at the British Museum, in sections]; Bull, 342–343&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next thirty years or so a number of Netherlandish artists painted the subject, usually in small [[cabinet painting]]s, often on copper, although ''The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis'' by [[Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem]] was enormous at over four metres wide, a commission in 1593 from the [[Stadtholder]] [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] for his palace, and [[Jacob Jordaens]]' ''The Golden Apple of Discord'' (1633, from an [[oil sketch]] by [[Rubens]]) is also a monumental treatment.  Painters who returned to the subject several times include in particular [[Hendrick van Balen]], who was known above all for these subjects, and also [[Joachim Wtewael]], Cornelis van Haarlem, [[Cornelis van Poelenburch]], and [[Abraham Bloemaert]].&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 342–343; Slive, 13–14; Vlieghe, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the same period these same painters, later followed by Rubens, produced many depictions of ''[[Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' ("Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes", meaning that love needs food and wine to thrive), a proverb derived from the [[emblem book]]s, which showed just [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Cupid]] picnicking on the ground in most early versions, or seated at a table in some later ones.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the [[Haarlem Mannerists]] reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Both the weddings of Cupid and Psyche and that of Peleus and Thetis were common subjects in antiquity, going back to Greek [[black-figure vase painting]].  The latter was perhaps shown in the Roman [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]].  However such depictions rarely show the wedding feast, preferring the ceremony or processions to it.

The earlier paintings may owe something to entertainments ''alla antica'' such as those of the Compagnia della Cassuola ("Company of the Shovel") mentioned by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], where a social confraternity in [[Florence]] including artists such as [[Giovanni Francesco Rustici]] and [[Andrea del Sarto]] held elaborate dinners which might include the attendees dressing as classical gods and re-enacting episodes from mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Raphael and Giulio's frescos decorated spaces used for lavish entertaining that might bear comparison with Olympian hospitality; the previous century [[Marsilio Ficino]] had written a thank-you letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] that made just that comparison.&lt;ref name="Bull" /&gt;

The later paintings can also be seen in the context of the wider interest in "company scenes" of social occasions in Netherlandish art at the start of the 17th century, expressed in the new genre subject of the [[merry company]], and its "gallant" and "elegant" variations,&lt;ref&gt;Liedke, 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the continuation of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s scenes of peasant life by his son [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan]] and others.  The feasts formed a division of the class of small-scale mythological paintings, in which the interest of the figures is very often shared with landscape or [[still life]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 105–106, and ''passim'' for the rest of chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these figure in many feasts, but the emphasis is on a generous range of nude figures, displaying a variety of complicated poses that display the artist's virtuosity.&lt;ref&gt;Woollett, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Small groups of non-divine revellers in similar [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] landscape settings are called [[bacchanal]]s, and are even more common in art.  Other subjects that were popular at the same period showed the entertainment of classical gods by humans, in the story of [[Baucis and Philemon]] and other tales. ''[[The Triumph of Bacchus]]'' (''Los Baracchos'', 1628) by [[Diego Velázquez]], in the [[Museo del Prado]], is a famous example of the subject of Bacchus drinking with humans.

==Later works==
The [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace at Potsdam]] in [[Berlin]] has a ceiling painting in the Marmorsaal ("Marble Hall") depicting the ''Feast of the Gods on Olympus'' (1769) by the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical painter]] [[Amédée van Loo]]. [[Romanticism|Romantic Nationalism]] extended the range of gods that might be depicted to the [[Norse gods]].  In 1863 the [[Peredvizhniki]] ("Wanderers") group of progressive artists was founded after several left the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in disgust after the subject set for the annual Gold Medal contest (the Russian equivalent of the ''[[Prix de Rome]]'') was "The Feast of [[Odin]] in [[Valhalla]]", which they thought both un-Russian and of no social relevance.&lt;ref&gt;"Wanderers" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', Ed. Ian Chilvers, 2004, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198604769}}, 9780198604761, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA747 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later painting, particularly in England, sometimes depicted [[fairy]] scenes of a somewhat similar types, such as ''[[The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania]]'' (1849) and its matching ''Reconciliation'', by Sir [[Joseph Noel Paton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''File integrity monitoring (FIM)''' is an [[internal control]] or [[process (computing)|process]] that performs the act of validating the [[integrity]] of [[operating system]] and [[application software]] [[Computer file|files]] using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good [[baseline (configuration management)|baseline]].  This comparison method often involves calculating a known cryptographic [[checksum]] of the file's original baseline and comparing with the calculated checksum of the current state of the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ionx.co.uk/products/verisys/how-it-works |title=  Verisys - How it Works |publisher= Ionx|accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other file attributes can also be used to monitor integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncircle.com/index.php?s=products_ccm_file-integrity-monitoring|title=File Integrity Monitoring|publisher=nCircle|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the act of performing file integrity monitoring is automated using internal controls such as an application or [[process (computing)|process]]. Such monitoring can be performed [[Randomness|randomly]], at a defined [[polling (computer science)|polling]] interval, or in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].

==Security objectives==
Changes to configurations, files and file attributes across the IT infrastructure are common, but hidden within a large volume of daily changes can be the few that impact file or configuration integrity. These changes can also reduce security posture and in some cases may be leading indicators of a breach in progress. Values monitored for unexpected changes to files or configuration items include: 
* Credentials
* Privileges and Security Settings
* Content
* Core attributes and size
* Hash values
* Configuration values

==Compliance objectives==
Multiple [[Regulatory compliance|compliance objectives]] indicate file integrity monitoring as a [[requirement]].  Several examples of compliance objectives with the requirement for file integrity monitoring include:

The '''''fruitless'' gene''' (''fru'') is a ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' [[gene]] that encodes several variants of a putative [[transcription factor]] [[protein]]. Normal ''fruitless'' function is required for proper development of several anatomical structures necessary for courtship, including [[motor neurons]] which innervate [[muscles]] needed for fly sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; The gene does not have an obvious mammalian homolog, but appears to function in sex determination in species as distant as the mosquito ''Anopheles gambiae''.&lt;ref name="pmid16319090"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Billeter JC, Liu JH, Bauzon F, Allendorfer JB, Goodwin SF | title = Functional conservation of the fruitless male sex-determination gene across 250 Myr of insect evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–43 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16319090 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msj070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''fruitless'' serves as an example of how a gene or a group of genes may regulate the development and/or function of neurons involved in innate behavior.  Research on ''fruitless'' has received attention in the popular press, since it provokes discussion on [[Biology and sexual orientation|genetics of human sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Atlantic  | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 | title = Homosexuality and Biology, The Genetic Quest | date = June 1997 | first = Chandler | last = Burr | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1D9173EF930A25751C1A960958260 | title = Mating Game of Fruit Fly Is Traced to a Single Gene | date = December 13, 1996 | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behaviors such as gender-specific [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1952198,00.html | title = Flies reveal gene that makes girls fight like boys | date = November 20, 2006 | first = Ian | last = Sample }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
[[Male]] flies with mutations in the ''fruitless'' gene display altered sexual behavior. Fruitfly courtship, which involves a complex male-initiated [[ritual]], may be disrupted in many ways by mutated ''fru'' [[alleles]]; ''fru'' is necessary for every step in the ritual. Some alleles prevent courting entirely, while others disrupt individual components. Notably, some [[loss-of-function]] alleles change or remove [[sexual orientation|sexual preference]].&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demir E, Dickson BJ | title = fruitless splicing specifies male courtship behavior in Drosophila | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 785–94 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15935764 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many genes are known to be involved in male courtship behavior, the ''fruitless'' gene has been considered noteworthy because it exhibits sex-specific [[alternative splicing]]. When females produce the male-spliced gene product, they behave as males. Males that do not produce the male-specific product do not court females and are infertile.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; In the brain, a subset (ca. 2,000) of neurons express ''fruitless''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cachero S, Ostrovsky AD, Yu JY, Dickson BJ, Jefferis GS | title = Sexual dimorphism in the fly brain | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 18 | pages = 1589–601 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20832311 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fruitless'' expression is sufficient to instruct sexually dimorphic connectivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohl J, Ostrovsky AD, Frechter S, Jefferis GS | title = A bidirectional circuit switch reroutes pheromone signals in male and female brains | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 7 | pages = 1610–23 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24360281 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruta V, Datta SR, Vasconcelos ML, Freeland J, Looger LL, Axel R | title = A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7324 | pages = 686–90 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21124455 | doi = 10.1038/nature09554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Early work refers to the gene as ''fruity'', an apparent pun on both the common name of ''D. melanogaster'', the ''fruit fly'', as well as a [[slang]] word for [[homosexual]]. As [[social]] attitudes towards homosexuality changed, ''fruity'' came to be regarded as offensive, or at best, not [[politically correct]]. Thus, the gene was re-dubbed ''fruitless'', alluding to the lack of offspring produced by flies with the mutation.&lt;ref name="pmid2542123"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Hall JC | title = Behavior and cytogenetics of fruitless in Drosophila melanogaster: different courtship defects caused by separate, closely linked lesions | journal = Genetics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–85 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2542123 | pmc = 1203660 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite the original name and a continuing history of misleading inferences by the popular media, fruitless mutants primarily show defects in male-female courtship, though certain mutants cause male-male or female-female courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GeneBrief - fruitless | work = InteractiveFly | publisher = Society for Developmental Biology | url = http://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/dbzhnsky/frutles1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generative anthropology''' is a field of study based on the [[theory]] that the origin of human language was a singular event and that the history of human [[culture]] is a [[genetics|genetic]] or "generative" development stemming from the [[Origin of language|development of language]].

In contrast to more common theories that examine human culture in terms of a multiplicity of complex [[culture|cultural]] differences, generative anthropology attempts to understand cultural phenomena in the simplest terms possible: all things human are traced back to a hypothetical single origin point at which human beings first used signs to communicate.

==Eric Gans and the origin of generative anthropology==

Generative Anthropology  originated with Professor [[Eric Gans]] of [[UCLA]] who developed his ideas in a series of books and articles beginning with ''The Origin of Language: A Formal Theory of Representation'' (1981), which builds on the ideas of [[René Girard]], notably that of [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|mimetic desire]]. However, in establishing the theory of Generative Anthropology, Gans departs from and goes beyond Girard's work in many ways. Generative Anthropology is therefore an independent and original way of understanding the human species, its origin, [[culture]], history, and development.

===Anthropoetics===

Gans founded (and edits) the web-based journal ''Anthropoetics: The Journal of Generative Anthropology'' as a scholarly forum for research into human culture and origins based on his theories of Generative Anthropology and the closely related theories of [[fundamental anthropology]] developed by [[René Girard]]. In his online ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment'' Gans applies the principles of Generative Anthropology to a wide variety of fields including popular culture, film, [[post-modernism]], economics, contemporary politics, the Holocaust, philosophy, religion, and paleo-anthropology.

==The originary hypothesis of human language==
The central hypothesis of generative anthropology is that the [[origin of language]] was a singular event. Human language is radically different from animal communication systems. It possesses [[syntax]], allowing for unlimited new combinations and content; it is symbolic, and it possesses a capacity for history. Thus it is hypothesized that the origin of language must have been a singular event, and the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] requires that it originated only once.

Language makes possible new forms of social organization radically different from animal "pecking order" hierarchies dominated by an [[alpha male]]. Thus, the development of language allowed for a new stage in human [[evolution]] –  the beginning of culture, including religion, art, desire, and the sacred. As language provides memory and history via a record of its own history, language itself can be defined via a hypothesis of its origin based on our knowledge of human culture. As with any scientific hypothesis, its value is in its ability to account for the known facts of human history and culture.

===Mimetic behaviour===

Mimetic (imitatory) behaviour connects proto-hominid species with humans. Imitation is an adaptive learning behavior, a form of intelligence favored by natural selection. Imitation, however, as René Girard observes, leads to conflict when two individuals imitate each other in their attempt to appropriate a desired object. The problem is to explain the transition from one form of [[mimesis]], imitation, to another, representation. Although many anthropologists have hypothesized that language evolved to help humans describe their world, this ignores the fact that intra-species violence, not the environment, poses the greatest threat to human existence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Human representation, according to Gans, is not merely a "natural" evolutionary development of animal communication systems, but is a radical departure from it. The signifier implies a symbolic dimension that is not reducible to empirical referents.

===The originary event===
At the event of the origin of language, there was a proto-human [[hominid]] species which had gradually become more mimetic, presumably in response to environmental pressures including climate changes and competition for limited resources. Higher primates have dominance hierarchies which serve to limit and prevent destructive conflict within the social group. However, as individuals within the proto-human group became more mimetic, the dominance system broke down and became inadequate to control the threat of violence posed by conflictual mimesis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Gans asks us to imagine an "originary event" along the following lines: A group of hominids have surrounded a food object, e.g. the body of a large mammal following a hunt. The attraction of the object, however, exceeds the limits of simple appetite due to the operation of group mimesis, essentially an expression of competition or rivalry. The object becomes more attractive simply because each member of the group finds it attractive: each individual in the group observes the attention that his rivals give the object. Actual appetite is artificially inflated through this mutual reinforcement. The power of appetitive mimesis in conjunction with the threat of violence is such that the central object begins to assume a sacred aura – infinitely desirable and infinitely dangerous.

Mimesis thus gives rise to a pragmatic paradox: the double imperative to take the desired object for personal gain, and to refrain from taking it to avoid conflict. In other words, imitating the rival means not imitating the rival, because imitation leads to conflict, the attempt to destroy rather than imitate (Gans, ''Signs of Paradox'' 18).  Generative Anthropology theorizes that when this mimetic instinct becomes so powerful that it seems to possess a sacred force endangering the survival of the group, the resultant intra-species pressure favours the emergence of the sign. 
	
No member of the group is able to take the sacred object, and at least one member of the group intends this aborted gesture as a sign designating the central object. This meaning is successfully communicated to the group, who  follow suit by reading their aborted gestures as signs also. The sign focuses attention on the sacred power of the central object, which is conceived as the source of its own power. The object which compels attention yet prohibits consumption can only be represented. The basic advantage of the sign over the object is that "The sign is an economical substitute for its inaccessible referent. Things are scarce and consequently objects of potential contention; signs are abundant because they can be reproduced at will" (Gans, ''Originary Thinking'' 9). The desire for the object is mediated by the sign, which paradoxically both creates desire, by attributing significance to the object, yet also defers desire, by designating the object as sacred or [[taboo]]. The mimetic impulse is sublimated, expressed in a different form, as the act of representation. Individual self-consciousness is also born at this moment, in the recognition of alienation from the sacred center. The primary value/function of the sign in this scenario is ethical, as the deferral of violence, but the sign is also referential. What the sign refers to, strictly speaking, is not the physical object, but rather the mediated object of desire as realized in the imagination of each individual.
	
The emergence of the sign is only a temporary deferral of violence. It is immediately followed by the ''[[sparagmos]]'', the discharge of the mimetic tension created by the sign in the violent dismemberment and consumption of the worldly incarnation of the sign, the central appetitive object. The violence of the sparagmos is mediated by the sign and thus directed towards the central object rather than the other members of the group. By including the sparagmos in the originary hypothesis, Gans intends to incorporate Girard's insights into [[scapegoat]]ing and the sacrificial (see ''Signs of Paradox'' 131–151).

The "scene of representation" is fundamentally social or interpersonal. The act of representation always implies the presence of another or others. The use of a sign evokes the communal scene of representation, structured by a sacred center and a human periphery. The significance of the sign seems to emerge from the sacred center (in its resistance to appropriation), but the pragmatic significance of the sign is realized in the peace brokered amongst the humans on the periphery.

All signs point to the sacred, that which is significant to the community. The sacred cannot be signified directly, since it is essentially an imaginary or ideal construction of mimetic desire. The significance is realized in the human relationships as mediated by the sign. When an individual refers to an object or idea, the reference is fundamentally to the significance of that object or idea for the human community. Language attempts to reproduce the non-violent presence of the community to itself, even though it may attempt to do so sacrificially, by designating a [[scapegoat]] victim.

Generative Anthropology is so called because human culture is understood as a "genetic" development of the originary event. The scene of representation is a true cultural universal, but it must be analyzed in terms of its dialectical development. The conditions for the generation of significance are subject to historical evolution, so that the formal articulation of the sign always includes a dialogical relationship to past forms.

==Generative Anthropology Society and Conference==
The [http://artsites.uottawa.ca/gasc/ Generative Anthropology Society &amp; Conference] (GASC) is a scholarly association formed for the purpose of facilitating intellectual exchange amongst those interested in fundamental reflection on the human, originary thinking, and [[Generative Anthropology]], including support for regular conferences. GASC was formally organized on June 24, 2010 at [[Westminster College, Salt Lake City]] during the 4th Annual Generative Anthropology Summer Conference. Further information, including how to join, can be found at the [http://artsites.uottawa.ca/gasc/ Generative Anthropology Society &amp; Conference] Website.

Since 2007, Generative Anthropology Society &amp; Conference (GASC) has held an annual summer conference on [[Generative Anthropology]].

The '''IBM System/360 architecture''' is the model independent [[Computer architecture|architecture]] for the entire [[S/360]] line of [[mainframe computer]]s, including but not limited to the [[instruction set architecture]]. The elements of the architecture are documented in the ''IBM System/360 Principles of Operation''&lt;ref name=A22-6821/&gt;&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt; and the ''IBM System/360 I/O Interface Channel to Control Unit Original Equipment Manufacturers' Information'' manuals.&lt;ref name=A22-6843/&gt;
&lt;!--
Some deviations from the architecture were notable because they served as prototypes for features of the [[IBM System/370|S/370]] architecture or because of their importance in scientific computing; these are included in some of the reference charts with footnotes that they are not part of the architecture. Any more detailed explanations should go in the articles on the respective models or on the S/370, not here.

The System/360 architecture provides the following features:

* 16 [[32-bit]] general-purpose registers
* 4 64-bit [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|floating-point]] registers
* 64-bit processor status register (PSW), which includes a 24-bit [[Program counter|instruction address]]
* 24-bit (16&amp;nbsp;MB) byte-addressable memory space
* [[Big-endian]] byte/word order
* A ''standard instruction set'', including fixed-point binary arithmetic and logical instructions, present on all System/360 models (except the model 20, see below). 
** A ''commercial instruction set'', adding decimal arithmetic instructions, is optional on some models, as is a ''scientific instruction set'', which adds floating-point instructions. The ''universal instruction set'' includes all of the above plus the storage protection instructions and is standard for some models.
** The Model 44 provides a few unique instructions for data acquisition and real-time processing and is missing the storage-to-storage instructions. However, IBM offered a '''Commercial Instruction Set"'' feature that ran in bump storage and simulated the missing instructions.
** The Model 20 offers a stripped-down version of the standard instruction set limited to eight general registers with halfword (16-bit) instructions only plus the commercial instruction set and unique instructions for input/output.
** The Model 67 includes some instructions to handle 32-bit addresses and "dynamic address translation" with additional privileged instructions to provide virtual memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IBM Corporation|title=IBM System/360 System Summary|date=1974|page=3-3|url=http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/ibm/360/GA22-6810-12_360sysSumJan74.pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
Memory (''storage'') in System/360 is addressed in terms of [[8-bit]] bytes. Various instructions operate on larger units called ''halfword'' (2 bytes), ''fullword'' (4 bytes), ''doubleword'' (8 bytes), ''quad word'' (16 bytes) and 2048 byte storage block, specifying the leftmost (lowest address) of the unit. Within a halfword, fullword, doubleword or quadword, low numbered bytes are more significant than high numbered bytes; this is sometimes referred to as [[Endianness#Big-endian#with 8-bit atomic element size and 1-byte (octet) address increment|big-endian]]. Many uses for these units require aligning them on the corresponding boundaries. Within this article the unqualified term ''word'' refers to a ''fullword''.

The original architecture of System/360 provided for up to 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 16,777,216 bytes of memory. The later Model 67 extended the architecture to allow up to 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4,294,967,296&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Twice the size of the later System/370&lt;/ref&gt; bytes of virtual memory.

==Addressing==
System/360 uses truncated addressing. That means that instructions do not contain complete addresses, but rather specify a base register and a positive offset from the addresses in the base registers. In the case of System/360 the base address is contained in one of 15&lt;ref group=NB&gt;A specification of general register 0 yield a base address of zero rather than the register content.&lt;/ref&gt; general registers. In some instructions, for example shifts, the same computations are performed for 32-bit quantities that are not addresses.

==Data formats==
The S/360 architecture defines formats for characters, integers, decimal integers and hexadecimal floating point numbers. Character and integer instructions are mandatory, but decimal and floating point instructions are part of the Decimal arithmetic and Floating-point arithmetic features.

* '''Characters''' are stored as 8-bit bytes.
* '''Integers''' are stored as two's complement binary halfword or fullword values.
* '''[[Packed decimal]]''' numbers are stored as 1-16 8-bit bytes containing an odd number of decimal digits followed by a 4-bit sign. Sign values of hexadecimal A, C, E and F are positive and sign values of hexadecimal B and D are negative. Digit values of hexadecimal A-F and sign values of 0-9 are invalid, but the PACK and UNPK instructions do not test for validity.
* '''[[Zoned decimal]]''' numbers are stored as 1-16 8-bit bytes, each containing a zone in bits 0-3 and a digit in bits 4-7. The zone of the rightmost byte is interpreted as a sign.
* '''Floating point''' numbers are only stored as fullword or doubleword values on older models. On the 360/85&lt;ref name=A22-6916/&gt; and 360/195&lt;ref name=A22-6943/&gt; there are also extended precision floating point numbers stored as quadwords. For all three formats, bit 0 is a sign and bits 0-7 are a characteristic (exponent, biased by 64). Bits 8-31 (8-63) are a hexadecimal fraction. For extended precision, the low order doubleword has its own sign and characteristic, which are ignored on input and generated on output.

==Instruction formats==
Instructions in the S/360 are two, four or six bytes in length, with the opcode in byte 0.  Instructions have one of the following formats:
*'''RR''' (two bytes). Generally byte 1 specifies two 4-bit register numbers, but in some cases, e.g., SVC, byte 1 is a single 8-bit immediate field.
*'''RS''' (four bytes). Byte 1 specifies two register numbers; bytes 2-3 specify a base and displacement.
*'''RX''' (four bytes). Byte 1 bits 0-3 specifies either a register number or a modifier; byte 1 bits 4-7 specifies the number of the general register to be used as an index; bytes 2-3 specify a base and displacement.
*'''SI''' (four bytes). Byte 1 specifies an immediate field; bytes 2-3 specify a base and displacement.
*'''SS''' (six bytes). Byte 1 specifies two 4-bit length fields or one 8-bit length field; bytes 2-3 and 4-5 each specify a base and displacement. The encoding of the length fields is length-1.

Instructions must be on a two-byte boundary in memory; hence the low-order bit of the instruction address is always 0.

The '''Program Status Word''' ('''PSW''')&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|pages=71–72}} contains a variety of controls for the currently operating program. The 64 bit PSW describes (among other things) the address of the current instruction being executed, condition code and interrupt masks.

&lt;!--The following text was merged from the article "Load Program Status Word instruction" and then further edited on 14 June 2011. --&gt;
{{Anchor |LPSW}}'''Load Program Status Word''' ('''LPSW''') is a privileged [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] that loads the Program Status Word (PSW), including the program mode, protection key, and the address of the next instruction to be executed. LPSW is most often used to "return" from an interruption by loading the "old" PSW which is associated with the interruption class. Other privileged instructions (e.g., SSM, STNSM, STOSM, SPKA, etcetera) are available for manipulating subsets of the PSW without causing an interruption or loading a PSW; and one non-privileged instruction (SPM) is available for manipulating the program mask.

==Interruption system==
The architecture&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|pages=77–83}} defines 5 classes of [[interrupt]]ion. An interruption is a mechanism for automatically changing the program state; it is used for both synchronous&lt;ref group=NB&gt;The S/360 literature does not use the terms fault or [[Trap (computing)|trap]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronous]] events.

There are two storage fields assigned to each class of interruption on the S/360; an old PSW double-word and a new PSW double-word. The processor stores the PSW, with an interruption code inserted, into the old PSW location and then loads the PSW from the new PSW location.  This generally replaces the instruction address, thereby effecting a branch, and (optionally) sets and/or resets other fields within the PSW, thereby effecting a mode change.

The S/360 architecture defines a priority to each interruption class, but it is only relevant when two interruptions occur simultaneously; an interruption routine can be interrupted by any other enabled interruption, including another occurrence of the initial interruption. For this reason, it is normal practice to specify all of the mask bits, with the exception of machine-check mask bit, as 0 for the "first-level" interruption handlers. "Second-level" interruption handlers are generally designed for stacked interruptions (multiple occurrences of interruptions of the same interruption class).

===Input/Output interruption===
An I/O interruption&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=78–79}} occurs at the completion of a channel program, after fetching a CCW with the PCI bit set and also for [[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronous]] events detected by the device, control unit or channel, e.g., completion of a mechanical movement. The system stores the device address into the interruption code and stores channel status into the [[#Channel Status Word|CSW]] at location 64 ('40'X).

===Program interruption===
A Program interruption&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|pages=16,79–80.1}} occurs when an instruction encounters one{{#tag:ref|On the 360/91,&lt;ref name=A22-6907/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} 360/95 and 360/195&lt;ref name=A22-6943/&gt;{{rp|page=14}} a Program interruption may occur for multiple imprecise exceptions. The ILC in the Program Old PSW is 0, bits 26-31 are 0 and bits 16-27 are a mask indicating which exceptions occurred; there is no provision for reporting multiple occurrences of the same exception. Reporting of multiple imprecise exceptions is not part of the S/360 architecture.|group=NB|name=multimpr}} of 15{{#tag:ref|There are 17 possible exceptions on the 360/67,&lt;ref name=GA27-2719/&gt;{{rp|page=17}} but page exception and segment exception are not part of the S/360 architecture; similarly, interruption code 18 ('0012'X) on a 360/65 multiprocessor is not part of the S/360 architecture.|group=NB|name=NotArchExc}} exceptions; however, if the [[#Program Mask|Program Mask]] bit corresponding to an exception is 0 then there is no interruption for that exception.

===Machine Check interruption===
A Machine Check interruption&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=82–83}} occurs to report unusual conditions associated with the channel or CPU that cannot be reported by another class of interruption. The most important class of conditions causing a Machine Check is a hardware error such as a parity error found in registers or storage, but some models may use it to report less serious conditions. Both the interruption code and the data stored in the scanout area at '80'x (128 decimal) are model dependent.

==Input/Output==
This article describes I/O from the CPU perspective. It does not discuss the channel cable or connectors, but there is a summary [[IBM System/360#Channels|elsewhere]] and details can be found in the IBM literature.&lt;ref name=A22-6843/&gt;

I/O is carried out by a conceptually separate processor called a channel.  Channels have their own instruction set, and access memory independently of the program running on the CPU.  On the smaller models (through [[IBM System/360 Model 50|360/50]]) a single microcode engine runs both the CPU program and the channel program.  On the larger models the channels are in separate cabinets and have their own interfaces to memory. A channel may contain multiple '''subchannel'''s, each containing the status of an individual channel program. A subchannel associated with multiple devices that cannot concurrently have channel programs is referred to as '''shared'''; a subchannel representing a single device is referred to as '''unshared'''.

There are three types of channels on the S/360:
&lt;!-- added anchors for external articles --&gt;
* {{anchor|IBM_Byte_Mux}}A '''byte multiplexer channel''' is capable of executing multiple '''CCW'''s concurrently; it is normally used to attach slow devices such as card readers and telecommunications lines.  A byte multiplexer channel could have a number of selector subchannels, each with only a single subchannel, which behave like low-speed selector channels.
* {{anchor|IBM_Sel}}A '''selector channel''' has only a single subchannel, and hence is only capable of executing one channel command at a time. It is normally used to attach fast devices that are not capable of exploiting a block multiplexer channel to suspend the connection, such as magnetic tape drives.
* {{anchor|IBM_Blk_Mux}}A '''block multiplexer channel''' is capable of concurrently running multiple channel programs, but only one at a time can be active. The control unit can request suspension at the end of a channel command and can later request resumption. This is intended for devices in which there is a mechanical delay after completion of data transfer, e.g., for seeks on moving-head DASD.  The block multiplexer channel was a late addition to the System/360 architecture; early machines had only byte multiplexer channels and selector channels.  The block multiplexer channel was an optional feature only on the models 85 and 195.  The block multiplexor channel was also available on the later [[IBM System/370|System/370]] computers.

Conceptually peripheral equipment is attached to a S/360 through ''control units'', which in turn are attached through channels. However, the architecture does not require that control units be physically distinct, and in practice they are sometimes integrated with the devices that they control. Similarly, the architecture does not require the channels to be physically distinct from the processor, and the smaller S/360 models (through 360/50) have integrated channels that steal cycles from the processor.

Peripheral devices are addressed with 16-bit&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Because of the limits on the channel number, S/360 and early S/370 software only used 12 bits to store device addresses.&lt;/ref&gt; addresses.,&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|page=89}} referred to as ''cua'' or ''cuu''; this article will use the term ''cuu''. The high 8 bits identify a channel, numbered from 0 to 6,&lt;ref group=NB name=ChanNum/&gt; while the low 8 bits identify a device on that channel. A device may have multiple ''cuu'' addresses.

Control units are assigned an address "capture" range. For example, a CU might be assigned range 20-2F or 40-7F. The purpose of this is to assist with the connection and prioritization of multiple control units to a channel. For example, a channel might have three disk control units at 20-2F, 50-5F, and 80-8F. Not all of the captured addresses need to have an assigned physical device. Each control unit is also marked as High or Low priority on the channel.

Device selection progresses from the channel to each control unit in the order they are physically attached to their channel. At the end of the chain the selection process continues in reverse back towards the channel. If the selection returns to the channel then no control unit accepted the command and SIO returns Condition Code 3. Control units marked as High Priority check the outbound CUU to be within their range. If so, then the I/O was processed. If not, then the selection was passed to the next outbound CU. Control units marked as Low Priority check for inbound (returning) CUU to be within their range. If so, then the I/O is processed. If not, then the selection is passed to the next inbound CU (or the channel). The connection of three controls unit to a channel might be physically -A-B-C and, if all are marked as High then the priority would be ABC. If all are marked low then the priority would be CBA.  If B was marked High and AC low then the order would be BCA.  Extending this line of reasoning then the first of N controllers would be priority 1 (High) or 2N-1 (Low), the second priority 2 or 2N-2, the third priority 3 or 2N-3, etc.  The last physically attached would always be priority N.

There are three storage fields reserved for I/O; a double word I/O old PSW, a doubleword I/O new PSW and a fullword ''Channel Address Word'' ('''CAW'''). Performing an I/O normally requires the following:

* initializing the '''CAW''' with the storage key and the address of the first CCW
* issuing a ''Start I/O'' ('''SIO''') instruction that specifies the ''cuu'' for the operation
* waiting&lt;ref group=NB&gt;But continuing with unrelated work.&lt;/ref&gt; for an I/O interruption
* handling any unusual conditions indicated in the ''Channel Status Word'' ('''CSW''')

A channel program consists of a sequence of ''Channel Control Words'' ('''CCW'''s) chained together (see below.) Normally the channel fetches '''CCW'''s from consecutive doublewords, but a control unit can direct the channel to skip a CCW and a ''Transfer In Channel'' ('''TIC''') '''CCW''' can direct the channel to start fetching '''CCW'''s from a new location.

There are several defined ways for a channel command to complete. Some of these allow the channel to continue fetching CCWs, while others terminate the channel program. In general, if the CCW does not have the chain-command bit set and is not a TIC, then the channel will terminate the I/O operation and cause an I/O interruption when the command completes. Certain status bits from the control unit suppress chaining.

The most common ways for a command to complete are for the count to be exhausted when chain-data is not set and for the control unit to signal that no more data transfers should be made. If Suppress-Length-Indication (SLI) is not set and one of those occurs without the other, chaining is not allowed. The most common situations that suppress chaining are unit-exception and unit-check. However, the combination of unit-check and status-modifier does not suppress chaining; rather, it causes the channel to do a command retry, reprocessing the same CCW.

In addition to the interruption signal sent to the CPU when an I/O operation is complete, a channel can also send a Program-Controlled interruption (PCI) to the CPU while the channel program is running, without terminating the operation, and a delayed device-end interruption after the I/O completion interruption.

===Channel status===
These conditions are detected by the channel and indicated in the [[#Channel Status Word|CSW]].&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=116–118}}

* {{Anchor|Program-controlled_interruption status|PCI status}}'''[[#CSW_Program-controlled_interruption status|Program-controlled interruption]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=116–117}} indicates that the channel has fetched a CCW with the PCI bit set.  The channel continues processing; this interruption simply informs the CPU of the channel's progress. An example of the use of Program-controlled interruption is in the "Program Fetch" function of Contents Supervision, whereby the control program is notified that a Control/Relocation Record has been read. To ensure that this record has been completely read into main storage, a "disabled bit spin", one of the few which remains in the control program, is initiated. Satisfaction of the spin indicates that the Control/Relocation Record is completely in main storage and the immediately preceding Text Record may be relocated. After relocation, a NOP CCW is changed to a TIC and the channel program continues. In this way, an entire load module may be read and relocated while utilizing only one [[EXCP]], and possibly only one revolution of the disk drive. PCI also has applications in teleprocessing access method buffer management.
* {{Anchor|Incorrect length|IL}}'''[[#CSW_Incorrect_length|Incorrect length]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=117}} indicates that the data transfer for a command completed before the Count was exhausted. This indication is suppressed if the [[#CCW-SuppressLengthIndication|Suppress-Length-Indication]] bit in the CCW is set.
* '''[[#CSW_Program_check|Program check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=117}} indicates one of the following errors
** Nonzero bits where zeros are required
** An invalid data or CCW address
** The CAW or a TIC refers to a TIC
* {{Anchor|Protection check}}'''[[#CSW_Protection_check|Protection check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=117–118}} indicates that the protection key in the CAW is non-zero and does not match the storage protection key.
* {{Anchor|Channel data check|CDC}}'''[[#CSW_Channel_data_check|Channel data check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=118}} indicates a parity error during a data transfer.
* {{Anchor|Channel control check|CCC}}'''[[#CSW_Channel_control_check|Channel control check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=118}} indicates a channel malfunction other than [[#Channel data check|Channel data check]] or [[#Interface control check|Interface control check]].
* {{Anchor|Interface control check|ICC}}'''[[#CSW_Interface_control_check|Interface control check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=118}} indicates an invalid signal in the channel to control unit interface.
* {{Anchor|Chaining check}}'''[[#CSW_Chaining_check|Chaining check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=118}} indicates lost data during data chaining.

===Unit status===
These conditions are presented to the channel by the control unit or device.&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=113–116}} In some cases they are handled by the channel and in other cases they are indicated in the [[#Channel Status Word|CSW]]. There is no distinction between conditions detected by the control unit and conditions detected by the device.
* {{Anchor|Attention}}'''[[#CSW_Attention|Attention]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=113}} indicates an unusual condition not associated with an ongoing channel program.  It often indicates some sort of operator action like requesting input, in which case the CPU would respond by issuing a read-type command, most often a sense command (04h) from which additional information could be deduced. Attention is a special condition, and requires specific operating support, and for which the operating system has a special "attention index" table with a necessarily limited number of entries.
* {{Anchor|Status modifier|SM}}'''[[#CSW_Status_modifier|Status modifier]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=113–114}} (SM) indicates one of three unusual conditions
** A Test I/O instruction was issued to a device that does not support it.
** A [[#Busy|Busy]] status refers to the control unit rather than to the device.
** A device has detected a condition that requires skipping a CCW. A CCW with a command for which Status Modifier is possible will normally specify command chaining, in which case the SM is processed by the channel and does not cause an interruption.

:: A typical channel program where SM occurs is

     ...
     Search Id Equal
     TIC           *-8
     Read Data

:: where the TIC causes the channel to refetch the search until the device indicates a successful search by raising SM.

* {{Anchor|Control unit end}}'''[[#CSW_Control_unit_end|Control unit end]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=114}} indicates that a previous control unit busy status has been cleared.
* {{Anchor|Busy}}'''[[#CSW_Busy|Busy]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=114–115}} indicates that a device ([[#Status modifier|SM]]=0) or a control unit ([[#Status modifier|SM]]=1) is busy.
* {{Anchor|Channel end|CE}}'''[[#CSW_Channel_end|Channel end]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=115}} indicates that the device has completed the data transfer for a channel command. There may also be an [[#Incorrect length|Incorrect length]] indication if the Count field of the CCW is exhausted, depending on the value of the [[#CCW-SuppressLengthIndication|Suppress-Length-Indication]] bit.
* {{Anchor|Device end|DE}}'''[[#CSW_Device_end|Device end]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=115}} indicates that the device has completed an operation and is ready to accept another. DE may be signalled concurrently with [[#Channel en|CE]] or may be delayed.
* {{Anchor|Unit check|UC}}'''[[#CSW_Unit_check|Unit check]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=115–116}} indicates that the device or control unit has detected an unusual conditions and that details may be obtained by issuing a Sense command.
* {{Anchor|Unit exception|UE}}'''[[#CSW_Unit_exception|Unit exception]]'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=116}} indicates that the device has detected an unusual condition, e.g., end of file.

===Channel Address Word===
The fullword ''Channel Address Word''&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|page=99}} (CAW) contains a 4-bit storage protection key and a 24-bit address of the channel program to be started.

===Channel Command Word===
A ''Channel Command Word'' is a doubleword containing the following:

* an 8-bit channel [[#CCW Command codes|Command Code]]&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=100}}
* a 24-bit address&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=100–101}}
* a 5-bit flag field&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=99–100,101–105}}
* an unsigned halfword Count field&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=100–101}}

====CCW Command codes====
The low order 2 or 4 bits determine the six types of operations that the channel performs;.&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|pages=100,105}} The encoding is

The meaning of the high order six or four bits, the modifier bits, '''M''' in the table above, depends upon the type of I/O device attached, see e.g., [[Direct-access storage device|DASD]] [[Count key data|CKD CCWs]].  All eight bits are sent to and interpreted in the associated control unit (or its functional equivalent).

Control is used to cause a state change in a device or control unit, often associated with mechanical motion, e.g., rewind, seek.

Sense is used to read data describing the status of the device. The most important case is that when a command terminates with unit check, the specific cause can only be determined by doing a Sense and examining the data returned. A Sense command with the modifier bits all zero is always valid.

A noteworthy deviation from the architecture is that DASD use Sense command codes for Reserve and Release, instead of using Control.

====CCW flags====

==Operator controls==
[[Image:IBM System 360 operator controls.png|200px|thumb|right|operator controls]]
The architecture of System/360 specified the existence of several common functions, but did not specify their means of implementation. This allowed IBM to use different physical means, e.g., dial, keyboard, pushbutton, roller, image or text on a CRT, for selecting the functions and values on different processors. Any reference to ''key'' or ''switch'' should be read as applying to, e.g., a light-pen selection, an equivalent keyboard sequence.

* '''System Reset''' sends a reset signal on every I/O channel and clears the processor state; all pending interruptions are cancelled. System Reset is not guaranteed to correct parity errors in general registers, floating point registers or storage. System Reset does not reset the state of shared I/O devices.
* '''{{anchor|Initial_Program_Load}}Initial Program Load''' (IPL)&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=123}} is a process for loading a program when there isn't a loader available in storage, usually because the machine was just powered on or to load an alternative operating system.&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|page=123}} This process is sometimes known as [[Booting]].

:: As part of the IPL facility the operator has a means of specifying a 12-bit&lt;ref group=NB name=ChanNum/&gt; device address, typically with three dials as shown in the operator controls drawing. When the operator&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Or an equivalent automated facility.&lt;/ref&gt; selects the ''Load'' function, the system performs a ''System Reset'', sends a Read IPL&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Read with all modifier bits zero&lt;/ref&gt; channel command to the selected device in order to read 24 bytes into locations 0-23 and causes the channel to begin fetching ''CCW''s at location 8; the effect is as if the channel had fetched a CCW with a length of 24, and address of 0 and the flags containing Command Chaining + Suppress Length Indication. At the completion of the operation, the system stores the I/O address in the halfword at location 2 and loads the PSW from location 0.

:: Initial program loading is typically done from a tape, a card reader, or a disk drive.  Generally, the operating system was loaded from a disk drive; IPL from tape or cards was used only for diagnostics or for installing an operating system on a new computer.
* '''Emergency pull switch'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} (Emergency power off, EPO) sends an EPO signal to every I/O channel, then turns off power to the processor complex. Because EPO bypasses the normal sequencing of power down, damage can result, and the EPO control has a mechanical latch to ensure that a customer engineer inspects the equipment before attempting to power it back on.
* '''Power on'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} powers up all components of the processor complex and performs a system reset.
* '''Power off'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} initiates an orderly power-off sequence. Although the contents of storage are preserved, the associated storage keys may be lost.
* The '''Interrupt''' key&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} causes an [[#External interruption|external interruption]] with bit 25 set in the External Old PSW.

* The '''Manual light'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} indicates that the CPU is in a stopped state.
* The '''System light'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} indicates that a meter is running, either due to CPU activity or due to I/O channel activity.

The details are model dependent.
* The '''Load light'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=124}} is turned on by IPL and external start. It is turned off by loading the PSW from location 0 at the completion of the load process.

* The '''Stop Key'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=125}} puts the CPU in a stopped state; channel programs continue running and interruption conditions remain pending.
* The '''Rate Switch'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=125}} determines the mode in which the processor fetches instructions. Two modes are defined by the architecture:
** PROCESS

* The '''Start Key'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=125}} initiates instruction fetching in accordance with the setting of the [[#Rate Switch|Rate Switch]].
* The '''Storage-Select Switch'''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=126}} determines the type of resource accessed by the [[#Store Key|Store Key]] and [[#Display Key|Display Key]]. Three selections are defined by the architecture:

==Optional features==

===Byte-aligned operands===
On some models the alignment requirements for some problem-state instructions were relaxed. There is no mechanism to turn off this feature, and programs depending on receiving a program check type 6 (alignment) on those instructions must be modified.

===Decimal arithmetic===
The decimal arithmetic feature provides instructions that operate on packed decimal data. A packed decimal number has 1-31 decimal digits followed by a 4-bit sign. All of the decimal arithmetic instructions except PACK and UNPACK generate a Data exception if a digit is not in the range 0-9 or a sign is not in the range A-F.

===Direct Control===
The ''Direct Control''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|page=17.1}} feature provides six external signal lines and an 8-bit data path to/from storage.&lt;ref name=A22-6845/&gt;

===Floating-point arithmetic===
The floating-point arithmetic feature provides 4 64-bit floating point registers and instructions to operate on 32 and 64 bit hexadecimal floating point numbers. The 360/85 and 360/195 also support 128 bit extended precision floating point numbers.

===Interval timer===
If the interval timer feature&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|page=17.1}} is installed, the processor decrements the word at location 80 ('50'X) at regular intervals; the architecture does not specify the interval but does require that value subtracted make it appear as though 1 were subtracted from bit 23 300 times per second. The smaller models decremented at the same frequency (50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) as the AC power supply, but larger models had a high resolution timer feature. The processor causes an External interruption when the timer goes to zero.

===Multi-system operation===
''Multi-system operation''&lt;sup class=reference&gt;[[#PoOps|PoOps]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{rp|pages=17.1–18}} is a set of features to support multi-processor systems, e.g., [[#Direct Control|Direct Control]], direct address relocation (prefixing).

===Storage protection===
If the storage protection feature&lt;ref name=A22-6821-7/&gt;{{rp|pages=17-17.1}} is installed, then there is a 4-bit storage key associated with every 2,048-byte block of storage and that key is checked when storing into any address in that block by either a CPU or an I/O channel. A CPU or channel key of 0 disables the check; a nonzero CPU or channel key allows data to be stored only in a block with the matching key.

Storage Protection was used to prevent a defective application from writing over storage belonging to the operating system or another application.  This permitted testing to be performed along with production.  Because the key was only four bits in length, the maximum number of different applications that could be run simultaneously was 15.

An additional option available on some models was fetch protection.  It allowed the operating system to specify that blocks were protected from fetching as well as from storing.

==Deviations and extensions==
The [[IBM System/360 Model 20|System/360 Model 20]] is radically different and should not be considered to be a S/360.

The [[IBM System/360 Model 44|System/360 Model 44]] is missing certain instructions, but a feature allowed the missing instructions to be simulated in hidden memory thus allowing the use of standard S/360 operating systems and applications.

Some models have features that extended the architecture, e.g., emulation instructions, paging, and some models make minor deviations from the architecture. Examples include:

* The multisystem feature on the S/360-65 which modifies the behavior of the direct control feature and of the Set System Mask (SSM) instruction.&lt;ref name=A22-6884/&gt;
* The [[IBM System/360 Model 67|System/360 Model 67]]-2 had similar, but incompatible, changes.&lt;ref name=GA27-2719/&gt;

Some deviations served as prototypes for features of the [[IBM System/370|S/370]] architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5869">'''IEEE 1451''' is a set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Instrumentation and Measurement Society’s Sensor Technology Technical Committee describing a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers (sensors or actuators) to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.  One of the key elements of these standards is the definition of [[Transducer electronic data sheet]]s (TEDS) for each transducer. The TEDS is a memory device attached to the transducer, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.  The goal of the IEEE 1451 family of standards is to allow the access of transducer data through a common set of interfaces whether the transducers are connected to systems or networks via a wired or wireless means.

== Transducer electronic data sheet ==

A '''transducer electronic data sheet''' (TEDS) is a standardized method of storing [[transducer]] ([[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s) identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.&lt;ref&gt;

|url=http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/1451/IEEE_1451d4_Templates_Tutorial_061804.doc 
|title= An Overview of IEEE 1451.4 Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS) 
|publisher=ieee.org
|accessdate=2005-11-28
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  TEDS formats are defined in the IEEE 1451 set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society]]'s Sensor Technology Technical Committee that describe a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers  to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.

One of the key elements of the IEEE 1451 standards is the definition of TEDS for each transducer. The TEDS can be implemented as a memory device attached to the transducer and containing information needed by a measurement instrument or control system to interface with a transducer. TEDS can, however, be implemented in two ways.  First, the TEDS can reside in embedded memory, typically an [[EEPROM]], within the transducer itself which is connected to the measurement instrument or control system.  Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a data file accessible by the measurement instrument or control system. A virtual TEDS extends the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where embedded memory may not be available.

[[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (Government of the Autonomous Community of [[Catalonia]]) and the
[[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]] (UAB). It was formally created on July 16, 1991,
by Act number 159/1991 of the Generalitat. As an organization it is independent from both the
UAB and the Generalitat, ruled by its own Statutes, and governed by a Governing Board.
It is located on the campus of UAB in Bellaterra, Barcelona.

The IFAE has its own Titular Personnel as well as Associated Personnel consisting on members
of the Physics Department of UAB working on Particle Physics. It has also an agreement with
Universitat de Barcelona (dated 8/7/1992) which also allows the faculty of that university
working on Particle Physics to be Associated Personnel of IFAE.

The IFAE is also adscribed to the UAB as a University Institute (Act number 231/1995 of the
Generalitat) which allows its members to teach in its Doctoral Programme in Physics, and thus
benefits from a productive symbiotic relationship with this major education and research institution.

The institute is dedicated to forefront experimental and theoretical research in the fields of
high energy physics and high energy astrophysics as well as in related technologies.

==Current projects==
*Detector construction, algorithm development and Monte Carlo simulation for the ATLAS experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) under construction at the [[CERN]];
*Experiment design and construction of the [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] high energy gamma-ray telescope, under operation since 2004 in the [[Canary Islands]], Spain;
*Design of the [[Cherenkov Telescope Array]], a matrix of [[IACT|Cherenkov Telescopes]] ten times more sensitive than MAGIC.
*Development of a novel X-ray detector technique for use in medical imaging;
*Analysis of data from the [[T2K experiment]] in [[Japan]].
*Development of an Information Data Grid in connection with the LHC computing;

== History ==

The origins of the institute can be traced to the editorial commission [[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]], founded by Professor [[Juozas Balčikonis]] in 1930. As an outgrowth of this commission, the Antanas Smetona Institute for Lithuanian Studies was founded in 1939. This institute's goal was to research the Lithuanian language. 

After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of Lithuania in 1941, the Antanas Smetona Institute for Lithuanian Studies and the Lithuanian Society of Science were merged into the Institute of the Lithuanian Language, within the greater framework of the Academy of Sciences. The Institute experienced difficulties during this period; a number of prominent linguists had emigrated, there was ideological pressure to employ [[Marxist]] language theory, and contacts with the international scholarly community were curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_2_05.htm The Lithuanian Language — Hostage Of Foreign Powers : 1940-1991&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 it was merged with the Institute of Lithuanian Literature. In April 1990 the Institute regained its status as an independent institution.

==Structure and activities ==

The Institute consists of four departments (Language History and Dialectology, Onomastics, Grammar, and Language Culture), two centers (Terminology and Lexicography), and a publishing house. Institute is active in academic fields of [[linguistics]], [[lexicology]], [[lexicography]], [[grammar]], and [[onomastics]]. As of January 2007, the staff of the Institute numbered 92, including 5 Doctors of Letters, 35 Doctors of Philosophy, and 11 doctoral students, directed by Jolanta Zabarskaitė.

Ongoing projects include:

*Compilation of a 20-volume dictionary of the Lithuanian language, including a computerised version
*The compilation of an academic grammar of the Lithuanian language
*Research into the evolution of Lithuanian syntax
*Research into Lithuanian dialects, as part of an atlas of European languages
*Study of the evolution and development of the written Lithuanian language, and creating a database of old Lithuanian writings
*Analysis of the development of the norms and terminology of the Lithuanian language in current usage, and the compilation of a database of linguistic phenomena and their assessment
*The preparation of an etymological dictionary of Lithuanian [[toponyms]] 
*Study of the origins of place names, personal names, and animal names in Lithuania
*Partnership in the EuroTermBank project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurotermbank.com The EuroTermBank Project&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on harmonisation and consolidation of terminology in new [[European Union]] member states

In October 2006, the Institute hosted an international conference entitled ''Terminology of National Languages and Globalization'', sponsored by the European Association for Terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eaft-aet.net/2905?set_lang_id=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501130718/http://www.eaft-aet.net/2905?set_lang_id=2 |archivedate=2007-05-01 |df= }} European Association for Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iron Ring''' is a ring worn by many [[Canadians|Canadian]]-trained [[engineer]]s, as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and [[engineering ethics|ethics]] associated with their profession. From a concept originated in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt; the ring is presented to graduates in a closed ceremony known as [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]],&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;"[http://www.ironring.ca/background.php The Calling of an Engineer]", ''[[The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]'', Retrieved November 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPa&gt;Petroski 2012, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;  developed with the assistance of English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. It is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer – this is determined by the provincial and territorial licensing bodies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.camp1.ca/wordpress/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and design ==

The Iron Ring is made from either [[iron]] or [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; The first ceremony awarding the ring was held in 1925, under the supervision of [[Herbert E. T. Haultain]], professor of mining engineering  at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;

The rings are given in ceremonies held at individual universities, each assigned one of 26 camps of the [[Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except [[Toronto]] have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings.  At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]] and the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]], continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.

Many incorrectly believe that the rings are made from the steel of a beam from the first [[Quebec Bridge]], which collapsed during construction in 1907. Seventy-five construction workers died in the collapse which was attributed to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers.&lt;ref name="iron_ring"&gt;"[http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 The Iron Ring ]", Engineer-in-Residence, ''[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudyard Kipling]], who wrote the ritual obligation,&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt; indicated that the Ring as an allegory in itself be rough, not smoothed, and hammered, and as a ring have no beginning nor end.  There is no evidence that there is any particular history in the source of "Cold Iron" (from the Calling of the Engineer ceremony) for the Ring, nor any intention that there should have been. Remnants of the Quebec Bridge legend still exist in Canada.&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;&lt;ref name="ringceremony"&gt;J. Jeswiet, "[http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm Information Relevant to the Iron Ring Ceremony]", November 22, 2001; Retrieved November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iron Ring is worn on the [[little finger]] ("[[pinky ring|pinky]]") of the working (dominant) hand.&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one's obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers.  Some camps offer previously obligated or "experienced" rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.

The Ring itself is small and understated, designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface.  The modern machined ring design is unique, a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.

The [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] is the ceremony where Iron Rings are given to graduating engineers who choose to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility of their profession. It is a symbol that reflects the moral, ethical and professional commitment made by the engineer who wears the ring.  The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. For some schools, the invitation to witness the ceremony is open to anyone in the engineering profession, and non-obligated engineers may not participate in the ritual.  Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.

== Adoption in the United States ==
[[File:Order of the Engineer Ring (Macro).jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|An example of a plain stainless steel band issued by the [[Order of the Engineer]] in the United States]]

Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the [[United States]], where the [[Order of the Engineer]]&lt;ref name="order"&gt;"[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/ About The Order]", ''[[Order of the Engineer]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an "Obligation of the Engineer"&lt;ref name="oblige"&gt;"[http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Leadership_Training_-_New/OBLIGATION.pdf Obligation of the Engineer]", ''[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]''; Retrieved November 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and receives a stainless steel [[Engineer's Ring]] (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the [[Cleveland State University]] under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.&lt;ref name=HPb&gt;Petroski 2012, p.175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Istishab''' ({{lang-ar|استصحاب}} {{lang-en|'''continuity'''|italic=yes}}) is an [[Islamic term]] used in the [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] to denote the principle of the presumption of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1138 |title=Istishab - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com |language=en |quote=Islamic legal term for the presumption of continuity, where a situation existing previously is presumed to be continuing at present until the contrary is proven. |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from an [[Arabic]] word ''suhbah'' meaning accompany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-en/%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B5%25D8%25AD%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A8/ |title= ترجمة و معنى استصحاب في قاموس عربي انجليزي|trans-title = Meaning of Istishab in English Arabic Almaany Dictionary |last=Team |first=Almaany |website=www.almaany.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the fundamental principles of the [[Ijtihad|legal deduction]] that presumes the continuation of a fact. It is based on [[probability]] and can be applied in the absence of other proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=wRlI0nJp5mEC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t_ecLTachv&amp;sig=OjAdj3A7UPGaO9xEYoZbe136ggs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC_f734eXXAhWDWBQKHXYoCz84ChDoAQheMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab&amp;f=false |title=Theory and Practice of Modern Islamic Finance: The Case Analysis from Australia |last=Ahmad |first=Abu Umar Faruq |date=2010 |publisher=Universal-Publishers |isbn=9781599425177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istishab, an initiative of [[ash-Shafii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=WZ5WDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=shafii+employed+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-zl6bHuU4I&amp;sig=A7h3bkME4UOx9COKq8xwvNBn31k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjogpuhg-bXAhVKQBQKHXewD7kQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=shafii%2520employed%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Understanding Islamic Theology |last=Sookhdeo |first=Patrick |date=2014-06-30 |publisher=BookBaby |isbn=9780989290548 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the rationalistic principle of extracting a [[Hukm|legal solution]] according to which changes are not considered to occur until clear signs of these changes are apparent. It serves as the basis for many legal rulings such as the presumption of innocence—the person is regarded as innocent unless proven guilty. [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[ash-Shafii]] regarded it to be a proof until it is contradicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=bKveCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=Presumption+of+existence+before+evidence+is+available+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dJv1PM-kVR&amp;sig=oQCji2_JvXa0FmiDsklBrgrtAeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY58uTh-bXAhXKuRQKHeoxAtsQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520existence%2520before%2520evidence%2520is%2520available%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Shari’a Law in Commercial and Banking Arbitration: Law and Practice in Saudi Arabia |last=Baamir |first=Abdulrahman Yahya |date=2016-04-01 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317055624 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several classical jurists differed over this principle with some [[Hanafi]] jurists refusing to regard it as an evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54049210 |title=Mabānī-i istinbāṭ-i ḥuqūq-i Islāmī, yā, Uṣūl-i fiqh |last=al-Ḥasan. |first=Muḥammadī, Abū |date=2002 |publisher=Muʼassasah-ʼi Intishārāt va Chāp-i Dānishgāh-i Tihrān |isbn=9640340766 |edition=Chāp-i 14 |location=Tihrān |oclc=54049210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Istishab+abu+hanifa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8eqMGV&amp;sig=DKwHLoPW9esAFbjQ3PWfHclrRQI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT5YOetubXAhVGSBQKHddgBh4Q6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab%2520abu%2520hanifa&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely employed by the contemporaries scholars with the exception of  [[Hanbali]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=tyHaHZcRLWEC&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=istishab+hanafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3dqGgUcezs&amp;sig=mCSaE4cD1GKWtI3yPf1Cv5mtQX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW96KG6eXXAhUKbxQKHUUeD70Q6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=istishab%2520hanafi&amp;f=false |title=Shari'ah Law: An Introduction |last=Kamali |first=Mohammad Hashim |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |isbn=9781780740379 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smahate.com/islamic-classes/2013-winter/al-qawaaid-al-fiqhiyyah |title=Al Qawaaid al Fiqhiyyah - Shakeel Mahate |website=www.smahate.com |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

[[Ibn al-Qayyim]] defined it as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/maliki_fiqh/usul9.html |title=The Eighth Principle: The Principle of Istishab (Presumption of Continuity) |website=www.iium.edu.my |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The continuation of what is established or the negation of what does not exist, i.e. it is the judgement, negative or positive, continues until there is evidence of a change of state. This continuance is not proved by positive evidence, but by the absence of the existence of new evidence.}}

[[Al-Qarafi]] expressed it as the validity of the former state in the following words. {{quote|Istishab means the belief that the past or present matter must be assumed to remain as it is in the present or future.}}

== Types ==
Istishab is divided into several types. The majority of the scholars agree upon three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=2zZVZN7AOG0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=types+of+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2OAoLnwWkl&amp;sig=6N9mEUh9jDANkaq1f-n8oFZmRoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB2K-n9uXXAhVIshQKHX2zAuMQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=types%2520of%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Inevitable Doubt: Two Theories of Shīʻī Jurisprudence |last=Gleave |first=Robert |date=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004115951 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presumption of the original absence ===
It is the absence of any [[Shariah]] norms on an adult Muslim, until their legitimacy is established. An example is the absence of the mandatory sixth [[Salah|prayer]] for a Muslim, the resumption of the person's innocence in a crime, etc. Islamic theologians are [[Ijma|unanimous]] regarding the validity of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=Presumption+of+the+original+absence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8dnNLV&amp;sig=8MtdQRW2nRXD28cwd9NJ0oz424A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCouiuhubXAhWBbRQKHa5fBx4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520the%2520original%2520absence&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basis in everyday life is permissiveness ===
The overwhelming majority of jurists believe that the basis in useful everyday things is [[halal|permissiveness]] and in harmful things is [[Haram|prohibition]]. For example, a certain type of food is allowed until a Sharia argument is established, proving its prohibition.

=== Presumption of existence before evidence is available ===
If there are Sharia texts with respect to any norm, backed up by the Istishab, then statements about the abolition of this rule will not be accepted until they are backed up by evidence. An example is the continued ownership of property rights. The application to terminate property will not be accepted until evidence is submitted supporting these statements. Another example is the validity of the [[Wudu|ablution]], which will not invalidated on the mere basis of doubt.

[[Image:Johannes Buxtorf.gif|thumb|right|200px|Johannes Buxtorf]]
'''Johannes Buxtorf'''&lt;ref&gt;also spelled as '''Buxtorff''' in the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement for 1894&lt;/ref&gt; (December 25, 1564{{snd}}September 13, 1629) was a celebrated [[Hebraist]], member of a family of [[oriental studies|Orientalist]]s; professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for thirty-nine years at [[Basel]] and was known by the title, "Master of the [[Rabbi]]s".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} His massive tome, ''De Synagoga Judaica'' (1st. ed. 1603), scrupulously documents the customs and society of [[German Jewry]] in the early modern period.

Buxtorf was the father of [[Johannes Buxtorf II|Johannes Buxtorf the Younger]].

==Life==

Buxtorf was born at [[Kamen]] in [[Westphalia]]. The original form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family crest, which bore the figure of a goat (Ger. Bock, he-goat). After the death of his father, who was minister of Kamen, Buxtorf studied at Marburg and the newly founded [[Herborn Academy]], at the latter of which [[Caspar Olevian]] (1536–1587) and [[Johannes Piscator]] (1546–1625) had been appointed professors of theology. At a later date Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin translation of the Old Testament, published at Herborn in 1602-1603. From Herborn Buxtorf went to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, attracted by the reputation of [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus]] and [[J. G. Hospinian]] (1515–1575).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Buxtorf, Johannes (1564-1629)|display=Buxtorf, Johannes|volume=4|pages=893-894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short residence at Basel, he studied successively under [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504–1575) at Zürich and [[Theodore Beza]] at Geneva. On his return to Basel, Grynaeus, desirous that the services of so promising a scholar should be secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of Leo Curio, son of [[Celio Secondo Curione]], well known for his sufferings on account of the Reformed faith. At the insistence of Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university, and discharged them for two years with such ability that at the end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this date (1591) to his death in 1629 he remained in Basel, and devoted himself with remarkable zeal to the study of Hebrew and rabbinic literature. He received into his house many learned Jews, that he might discuss his difficulties with them, and he was frequently consulted by Jews themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. He seems to have well deserved the title which was conferred upon him of "Master of the Rabbins." His partiality for Jewish society brought him, indeed, on one occasion into trouble with the authorities of the city, the laws against the Jews being very strict. Nevertheless, on the whole, his relations with the city of Basel were friendly. He remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits, and declined two invitations from the [[University of Leiden]] and [[Academy of Saumur]] successively. His correspondence with the most distinguished scholars of the day was very extensive; the library of the university of Basel contains a rich collection of letters, which are valuable for a literary history of the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

* '''Tiberias, sive Commentarius Masoreticus''' (1620; quarto edition, improved and enlarged by J. Buxtorf the younger, 1665), so named from the great school of Jewish criticism which had its seat in the town of [[Tiberias]]. It was in this work that Buxtorf controverted the views of [[Elia Levita|Elias Levita]] regarding the late origin of the Hebrew vowel points, a subject which gave rise to the controversy between [[Louis Cappel]] and his son [[Johannes Buxtorf II]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Buxtorf did not live to complete the two works on which his reputation chiefly rests, his ''Lexicon Chaldaicum, Talmudicum, et Rabbinicum'', and the ''Concordantiae Bibliorum Hebraicorum'', both of which were edited by his son. The lexicon was republished at Leipzig in 1869 with some additions by [[Bernard Fischer]], and the concordance was assumed by [[Julius Fürst]] as the basis of his own Hebrew concordance, which appeared in 1840.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; [[File:Buxtorf_Concordance_Basel_1632.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of Buxtorf's concordance, Basel, 1632]]

The '''''Journal of Contemporary Religion''''' is a triannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, and philosophical aspects of religion.

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 1985 as ''Religion Today'' by the Centre for New Religions at [[King's College London]]. Its founding [[editor-in-chief|editor]] was [[Peter B. Clarke]] (later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, Elisabeth. ''Researching new religious movements: responses and redefinitions'', p. ix, Routledge 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-27755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Finke, Roger. ''Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion''. University of California Press 2000, p. 16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard. ''New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World'', Routledge 2006, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal, which changed its name to the current title in 1995,&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew /&gt; is published by [[Routledge]]. Its current editor is [[Elisabeth Arweck]] ([[University of Warwick]]); Peter B. Clarke, who died in June 2011, will remain listed as co-editor until the end of the year out of respect for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peter B. Clarke (1940–2011) |first= Elisabeth |last=Arweck |journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion |volume=26|issue=3 |pages = 353|year=2011 |doi=10.1080/13537903.2011.620796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=cjcr20 Editorial Board], Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THE&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Lipner, Julius]] (1997-10-17). [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159825&amp;sectioncode=26 "Social science &amp; humanities journals: Prayers for today"], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue of the triannual journal typically features five or six major articles.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; Other content includes conference reports, research notes, book reviews and review articles, and articles are sometimes illustrated with graphics or photographs.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' stated in a 1997 review of the journal that "The contributors are invariably academics, mainly from North America and Europe. The style ranges from the homely, almost chatty at times, to the more formal. The articles, however, are on the whole scholarly and, as advertised, treat of a wide range of subjects, from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]] to [[Sahaja Yoga]], from the '[[Toronto Blessing]]' to the nature of [[fundamentalism]], from 'The Protestant eruption into modern Brazilian politics' to 'Deconfessionalisation in the Netherlands' (in the last three decades or so). There are fieldwork reports, ethnographic accounts, and historical and conceptual studies. The standard of research and analysis is what one would expect from a good academic journal."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; The review criticised the small number and seemingly arbitrary selection of book reviews, but concluded by stating that "On the whole, then, the journal is a valuable research tool and source of new knowledge for scholars, teachers and others interested in studying the phenomenon of contemporary religion. With nothing really comparable available in the field, it is highly recommended."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts]], [[British Humanities Index]], [[CSA (database company)|Worldwide Political Science Abstracts]], [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCOhost]], [[Educational Research Abstracts Online]], [[Multicultural Education Abstracts]], [[New Testament Abstracts]], [[Religious &amp; Theological Abstracts]], [[CSA (database company)#CSA Sociological Abstracts|Sociological Abstracts]], and [[Studies on Women and Gender Abstracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=abstractingIndexing&amp;journalCode=cjcr20|title=Journal of Contemporary Religion|work=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online. Retrieved September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed under ''Best of the Web'' by [[New York Public Library]] and had previously been rewarded ''Site of the Month'' by ''LibrarySpot''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/2166 Best of the Web]'', [[New York Public Library]], USA. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.libraryspot.com/lsom/1999/libsiteofmonth0799.htm Congratulations to Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]'', [http://www.libraryspot.com/ Library Spot].

The '''''Linguistic Bibliography''''' / '''''Bibliographie Linguistique''''' is an annual publication which first appeared in 1949. The publication provides comprehensive bibliographical descriptions of publications in [[theoretical linguistics]], with about 20,000 items added per year. Since 2002, the database has also been available online, as Linguistic Bibliography Online, and contains data from 1993 onward.

==Overview==
The ''Linguistic Bibliography'' covers all disciplines of [[theoretical linguistics]], both general and [[language]] specific, from all geographical areas, with the emphasis on lesser-known [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[non-Indo-European]] [[languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography Online|url=https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Catalogue/FullDescription/Index/944|publisher=JISC Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'' and ''Linguistic Bibliography Online'' are published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] Leiden, Netherlands, on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguists and under the auspices of the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]].&lt;ref name=brill&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography|url=http://bibliographies.brillonline.com/browse/linguistic-bibliography|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1993, the online edition contained all entries of the printed volumes, with new records added on a monthly basis. Annual volumes of the ''Linguistic Bibliography'' are still published in print.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

==Organization and features==
Linguistic Bibliography's Online [[database]] contains over 360,000 records and is cross-searchable. It is updated 10 times per year with around 20,000 new records added per year. The database contains over 114,000 person's names, 2,400 journals and 10,000 publishers with records classified according to language and subject descriptors. Titles are given in their original language, with English translations provided of titles in lesser-known languages. Only scientific publications are included, and applied linguistic publications are listed only if they have theoretical implications.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The Bibliography is published on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguistics (CIPL) and is in accordance with the rules of the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD) and the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). Contributors include a network of international specialists, with some of these experts responsible for a specific field of linguistics, while others cover the production of their home country.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The languages of the world are grouped under large categories, e.g. "Semitic". A separate section for [[Pidgin]] and [[Creole language]]s was added in 1952. Though linguists today study [[Sign language|sign languages]] as true languages, the category "Sign languages" was not added until the 1988 volume, when it appeared with 39 entries.

The '''Livescribe''' paper-based computing platform consists of a [[digital pen]], [[digital paper]], software applications, and developer tools.

Central to the Livescribe platform is the ''smartpen,'' a ballpoint pen with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder. When used with [[Anoto|Anoto digital paper]], it records what it writes for later uploading to a computer, and synchronizes those notes with any audio it has recorded. This allows users to replay portions of a recording by tapping on the notes they were taking at the time the recording was made. It is also possible to select which portion of a recording to replay by clicking on the relevant portion of a page on-screen, once it has been synced to the Livescribe Desktop software.

Jim Marggraff, inventor of the [[LeapFrog]] [[Fly (pentop computer)|FLY]] Pentop computer and creator of the LeapPad Learning System, left Leapfrog in 2005 to form Livescribe.

In November 2015, Livescribe announced its acquisition by Anoto for $15m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sweden’s Anoto Buys Digital Pen Maker Livescribe For $15M|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/06/swedens-anoto-buys-digital-pen-maker-livescribe-for-15m/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-11-06|first = Ingrid|last = Lunden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The smartpen==
[[Image:livescribeecho.png|thumb|The Livescribe Echo Pen]]
A Livescribe smartpen is about the size and weight of a large pen (5/8" x 6 1/8"), and is equipped with a removable ball-point ink cartridge, a microphone to record audio, a speaker for playback, a small [[Organic LED|OLED]] display, an infra-red camera, and internal flash memory that captures handwritten notes, audio and drawings.

The user can choose to record audio in addition to the handwritten text. Recorded audio is kept indexed with the handwritten text—tapping on a written word starts playback of the recorded audio from that part of the recording.

The smartpen allows the installation of as many applications as there is memory, and ships with several applications. If tapped on the correct images, it can function as a calculator, for example, or can translate words (the translator software as shipped includes only 21 words in a small selection of languages - as of September 2010 there are no public plans to make a full version of this translator available &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/showpost.php?p=24665&amp;postcount=7 |title=Livescribe Forums - Translator App thread |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Livescribe has made four versions of its smartpen: Pulse, Echo, Sky Wi-Fi (or Livescribe Wi-Fi), and Livescribe 3. The pens can store about 100 hours of audio per gigabyte. 
* The Pulse smartpen, released in March 2008, is available with either 1, 2 or 4 Gigabytes of flash storage. It requires a special USB cradle and uses a 2.5mm headphone jack.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20010876-56.html |title=Livescribe writes digital pen's next chapter |first=Ina |last=Fried |authorlink=Ina Fried |date=July 18, 2010 |work=Beyond Binary - CNET News |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Echo smartpen, released in July 2010, comes with either 2GB, 4GB or 8 GB of memory. Compared to the Pulse smartpen, it is less round in shape and uses more standardized connection ports. The Echo integrates with the Desktop software via a standard [[Universal Serial Bus#Connector types|micro USB]] cable and can connect to headphones with a more common 3.5-millimeter [[audio jack|jack]].&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt; 
* In October 2012, Livescribe announced the Sky Wi-Fi smartpen, which uses [[Wi-Fi]] to transfer the notes and audio to [[Evernote]] without using the proprietary Livescribe Desktop software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/10/29/livescribe-sky-smartpen-review/ |title=Review: Livescribe’s Smartpen Gets Wi-Fi, Embraces Evernote |first=Harry |last=McCracken |authorlink=Harry McCracken |date=October 29, 2012 |work=Technologizer |publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, this product is sold as the "Livescribe Wi-Fi smartpen" due to a trademark dispute with [[BSkyB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/bskyb-livescribe-sky-wi-fi-smartpen|title = BSkyB reaches settlement with Livescribe over Sky Wi-Fi Smartpen|last = Halliday|first = Josh|date = 2013-02-08|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 2013, the Livescribe 3 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/blog/noteworthy/2013/11/13/livescribe-3-%e2%80%93-inquiring-minds-want-to-know/ |title=Livescribe 3 – Inquiring Minds Want to Know! |date=November 13, 2013 |publisher=Livescribe, Inc. |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BT 4.0) to store the page content and audio on a smart phone. The physical design made key changes. The OLED screen and the microphone were omitted and the smart phone's display and microphone were used instead. The pen's battery life improved and also still holds the written page content.

The product was initially available only for use with Microsoft Windows-based computers, but version 1.0 of Livescribe Desktop for the Mac was made available via download in March 2009.&lt;ref name="Mac Ver 1.0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090303.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305190757/http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090303.html |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires OS X 10.5.5 or higher, and was one of nine products designated as "Best of Show" at Macworld Expo 2009.&lt;ref name="Best of Show Macworld 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/138002/2009/01/bos2009.html |title=Expo Best of Show 2009 |website=Macworld.com |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2016-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116152135/http://www.macworld.com/article/138002/2009/01/bos2009.html |archivedate=2012-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no official Linux version at this time, however, there have been efforts to make the product work with Linux, such as LibreScribe and Smartpen-Browser. Livescribe has provided a user forum at the request of Linux users.&lt;ref name="Linux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7 |title=Support Home Page |website=Livescribe.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's release of [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]] caused functionality and compatibility issues with Livescribe's driver installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3762 |title=Snow Leopard Issue

Handwriting recognition functionality is provided by a third-party application, MyScript by [[Vision Objects]] Inc., which sells separately for $29.95. As of August 2009, this is available on both Microsoft Windows and Mac (Intel-processor) systems.

The Livescribe 3 currently has support on iOS and Android. It does not have support on Windows or Windows Phone.

==Paper, applications, and sharing==
[[File:LiveScribe Dot Paper - Mar 2013 01.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|LiveScribe Dot Paper]]
Livescribe's special paper that allows the recording of notes uses a patented dot-positioning system licensed from [[Anoto]].

===The pattern===
As with all Anoto pattern-based pens, the smartpen can only determine its position on the page when used with paper pre-printed with the dot pattern. Livescribe sells notebooks in several styles, and users can also print their own dot paper with a laser printer capable of at least 600 dpi.  (A color or monochrome laser printer works.)&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

The Anoto pattern consists of numerous small black dots in patterns that are essentially invisible to the human eye, but can be detected by the pen's infrared camera. The pattern indicates the exact position of the digital pen on the page, and each page has a unique identity so that they can be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name="Anoto Digital Paper Presskit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anoto.com/?id%3D906 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721235654/http://www.anoto.com/?id=906 |archivedate=July 21, 2010 }}R&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sharing===
Notes and audio can be sent to other users as a "pencast" through the Livescribe Desktop software. The Livescribe Connect service, launched in May 2011, allows pencasts to be sent through e-mail, [[Evernote]], Facebook, Google Docs, and other methods. These can also be saved as an interactive Pencast PDF that can be viewed with versions 10 and higher of Adobe Reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/livescribe-connect/ |title=Livescribe Connect Shares Smartpen Notes to Facebook, E-Mail |journal=Wired |author=Bonnington, Christina |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While compatibility with OneNote 2010 was initially available, LiveScribe has not provided connectivity support for OneNote 2013.

==Developer tools==
Livescribe developed a Penlet SDK to allow application development for the smartpen. The SDK was based on Java, and applications ran directly on the pen itself. Applications could display text and menus, as well as produce audio feedback. A Desktop SDK for Microsoft and Macintosh operating systems was also promised, to allow developers to access files stored on the pen.

On June 2, 2009, Livescribe announced the pre-release version of the SDK 1.0 for Windows at the 2009 JavaOne Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090602.html |title=Livescribe Pre–Releases Platform SDK 1.0 for Its Smartpen Computing Platform |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in December 2009, with the announcement of the global developer challenge to "...encourage the creation of compelling applications for the Pulse smartpen in 2010 and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press release |url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_091207.html |publisher=LiveScribe |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Livescribe announced the closure of its third-party developer program. Livescribe’s official reason for shutting the development program  was to concentrate on "cloud access, storage and services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020817/http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage |archivedate=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure of the developer program upset the developer community who had invested in the program, many of whom maintain an active campaign to convince Livescribe to bring back the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/tommy-1l7gjj |title=Bring back the Developer Program!!!|website=Getsatisfaction.com |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hackaday.com/2011/07/01/livescribe-shuts-down-developer-program/ |title=Livescribe shuts down developer program |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.livescribe.com/entries/21042243-user-petition-to-bring-back-the-sdk-c-mon |title=User Petition To Bring Back The SDK...

Some users have noted that ambient noise can be a problem. The built-in microphone on the pen can pick up small amounts of noise from writing on paper, and adjacent ambient noise is often louder than a far away speaker. However, the included headphones have embedded microphones that reduce this ambient noise. (Headphones for the Echo must be purchased separately).

The smartpen's portable size and audio recording capabilities have led some people to question the ethics and legality of using the device. For example, in 2009, Delta Air Lines accused the manager of [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta's airport]] of using a Livescribe pen to illegally record a meeting of city and airline officials without their consent. The City of Atlanta concluded an investigation of this matter the following year and failed to find sufficient evidence that the airport manager intentionally sought to record the airline's private conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/spy-pen-jolts-talks-319303.html |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |title=Spy pen jolts talks between airport, Delta |last1=Stirgus |first1=Eric |last2=Yamanouchi |first2=Kelly |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livescribe urges its customers to "behave ethically and demonstrate common courtesy when it comes to personal privacy" as they would with common devices such as cameras and cellular telephones.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Some users have expressed frustration with the perceived lack of responsiveness to requests for functionality improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/listen_to_the_responses_complaints_of_your_customers |title=Listen to the Responses/Complaints of your Customers |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most requested improvements are the ability to print forms onto dot pattern paper and a day planner for use with the pen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/ideas/popular |title=Popular ideas |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requests began to surface soon after release of the pen 
system, however responses from the company are infrequent and tend to be perfunctory.&lt;ref&gt;Note low ratio of participation by company personnel in previously cited forum threads.&lt;/ref&gt;

==OLED problems==
There appear to be design flaws with the OLED display or possibly with the firmware on the Pulse, Echo and Sky (WiFi) models. The OLED fades after one to three years, making the pen significantly more difficult to use because it is no longer possible to see if the pen is on or not and customers need to rely on the audio feedback alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/display_went_dark |title=Display went dark |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fading issue is a known disadvantage of OLEDs and results in a limited lifespan. Users have complained to Livescribe, and the company's official response is to point users to tips on pen maintenance and then suggest that users buy a new pen at a deep discount as a replacement. Some users who received a replacement saw it plagued by the same problem. However, the company has taken advantage of ongoing improvements in OLED technology and, as of January 1, 2015, now offers a 3-year warranty on new smartpens (including the discounted replacements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livescribe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/735/kw/oled%20warranty |title=20109 - ECHO/WIFI - Smartpen OLED Screen Warranty Extension to 3-Years |website=Livescribe.custhelp.com |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The OLED issue has alienated some Livescribe users, especially with the high price tags of the accessories and of the smartpen itself.
Once the OLED display fails:
Many cellphone cameras can see the IR light emitted when the pen is on so using the camera to look at the front of the pen and depressing the ink cartridge is one way of determining the operating status. Additionally, using the Volume Up/Down icons will cause a beep when the pen is on. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if the pen is actually recording audio without the OLED indications thus rendering useless one of its primary functions. Livescribe offers free, fully warrantied replacements to customers who experience an issue with their OLED displays when their pen is in warranty. For US customers whose smartpens are out-of-warranty, the company offers replacement options that allow customers to purchase a fully warrantied replacement pen for a discounted price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livescribe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/731/kw/oled%20warranty/related/1] {{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">'''[[Markov chain]] [[geostatistics]]''' uses [[Markov chain]] spatial models, [[simulation]] [[algorithm]]s and associated spatial [[correlation]] measures (e.g., [[transiogram]]) based on the Markov chain random field theory, which extends a single [[Markov chain]] into a multi-dimensional random field for geostatistical modeling. A Markov chain random field is still a single spatial Markov chain. The spatial Markov chain moves or jumps in a space and decides its state at any unobserved location through interactions with its nearest known neighbors in different directions. The data interaction process can be well explained as a local sequential Bayesian updating process within a neighborhood. Because single-step transition probability [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] are difficult to estimate from sparse [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] data and are impractical in representing the complex spatial [[heterogeneity]] of states, the '''[[transiogram]]''', which is defined as a [[transition probability]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] over the distance [[lag]], is proposed as the accompanying spatial measure of Markov chain random fields.

A '''microapartment''', also known as a '''microflat''', is a one-room, self-contained living space, usually purpose built, designed to accommodate a sitting space, sleeping space, bathroom and [[kitchenette]] with 14–32 square metres (50–350 sq ft) Unlike a traditional [[studio flat]], residents may also have access to a communal kitchen, communal bathroom/shower, [[patio]] and [[roof garden]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Small_room_-_interior.JPG|thumb|250px|Bedrooms in microapartments need to be tiny and may also serve as a living room.]]
The microapartments are often designed for [[futons]], or with [[Murphy bed|pull-down beds]], folding desks and tables, and extra-small or hidden appliances. They differ from [[bedsit]]s, the traditional British bed-sitting room, in that they are self-contained, with their own bathroom, toilet, and kitchenette.

Microapartments are becoming popular in urban centres in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and North America, maximizing profits for developers and landlords and providing relatively low-priced accommodation.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite news |first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/21/real_estate/micro-apartments/index.html |title=Micro-apartments: The anti-McMansions |work=CNN Money |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/11/san-francisco-approves-220-square-foot-micro-apartments.html |title=Would you live in a 220-square-foot 'micro apartment?' |work=CBC News |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rome]], where the average price of property in 2010 was $7,800 per square metre (10.7 square feet), microapartments as small as 4 square metres (45 square feet) have been advertised.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Day |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/tight-fit-for-romes-microapartments-7447396.html |title=Tight fit for Rome's 'micro-apartments' |work=The Independent |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Hong Kong===
[[Gary Chang (architect)|Gary Chang]], an architect in [[Hong Kong]], has designed a large 32-square-metre (344 sq ft) microapartment with sliding walls attached to tracks on the ceiling. By moving the walls around, and using built-in folding furniture and worktops, he can convert the space into 24 different rooms, including a kitchen, library, laundry room, dining room, bar and video-game room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Virginia |last=Gardiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html |title=24 Rooms Tucked Into One |work=The New York Times |date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, developers are embracing the micro-living trend, renting microapartments at sky-high prices. The ''Wall Street Journal'' compares the 180-square-feet flat in High Place, [[Sai Ying Pun]] to the size of a U.S. parking spot (160 square feet) in a video, highlighting the soaring property prices in Hong Kong (one of the apartments in High Place was sold for more than US$500,000 in June 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=2 June 2015 |title=In Hong Kong, the Apartments Are Fit for a Mosquito |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York City |access-date=21 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston's first microapartment building opened in August 2016, at 1047 Commonwealth Avenue in [[Packard's Corner]].  As the largest microapartment building in the United States, the building is currently being leased by Boston University to house 341 students during the renovation of another university residence.  The building contains 180 units that each contain a bathroom with stand-up shower; a kitchen with all stainless-steel appliances that include an oven, a microwave, a dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Each unit also includes a stand up washer-dryer unit. Other amenities include an optional parking garage and indoor bike room in the basement, currently unused retail space, a lounge space, a rooftop penthouse, a deck overlooking the [[Allston]] neighbors, and an entertainment room that will be converted to a fitness center at the end of the University's tenure at the property, which is anticipated to be in 2018.

In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit. &lt;ref name=Bring_back_boarding_house&gt;{{cite news | last=Badger | first=Emily | title=Is It Time to Bring Back the Boarding House? | url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | access-date=2017-11-13 | publisher=CityLab - The Atlantic Monthly Group | date=2013-07-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114022002/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | archive-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a backlash in some cities against the increasing number of microapartments. In [[Seattle]], some residents have complained that [[Urban density|high-density]] microhousing changes the character of neighbourhoods, suddenly increasing demand for parking spaces and other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hickman |first=Matt |url=http://www.mnn.com/your-home/remodeling-design/blogs/micro-apartments-met-with-nimbyist-sentiment-in-seattle |title=Micro-apartments met with NIMBYist sentiment in Seattle |work=Mother Nature Network |date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Thompson |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020845443_apodmentscitycouncilxml.html  |title=Critics of micro-apartments calling for a moratorium |work=Seattle Times |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, property developers are using office-to-residential permitted development rights, a policy introduced in 2013, to transform old office buildings into microapartment developments. The nationally described space standard stipulates that new homes in the UK cannot be smaller than 37sqm; however, this does not apply to conversions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Jones |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |date=11 February 2017 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based developer Inspired Homes has taken advantage of office-to-residential permitted development rights to deliver over 400 microapartments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Gordon |url=https://www.metro.news/the-micro-apartment-may-be-a-trend-thats-here-to-stay/558705/ |title=The micro apartment may be a trend that’s here to stay |date=4 April 2017 |work=Metro News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-property in the UK has no strict definition but typically refers to properties with a floor area below 37sqm. ''Which?'' magazine reported that almost 8,000 new micro-homes were built in 2016, the highest number on record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/08/the-30-sqm-squeeze-would-you-buy-a-micro-home/ |title=The 30 sqm squeeze: would you buy a ‘micro-home’? |date=19 August 2017 |last=Calver |first=Tom |work=[[Which?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, the largest microapartment building in the world is The Collective Old Oak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mairs |first1=Jessica |title=World's largest co-living complex promises residents "everything at their fingertips" |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/28/collective-old-oak-common-co-living-plp-architecture-willesden-junction-london-housing/ |website=Dezeen |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in London on May 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside London’s Largest Co-Living Development |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-londons-largest-co-living-development-1478794347 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[PLP Architecture]], the development has 546 rooms with most units grouped into "twodios" – two en-suite bedrooms that share a small kitchenette. There are also some private suites. The units sizes range from {{convert|9.2|sqm}} for an ensuite rooms with a {{convert|5.8|sqm}} shared kitchenette, to {{convert|12|sqm}} for a shared ensuite and {{convert|16.5|sqm}} shared ensuite with kitchenette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Co-Living FAQ|url=https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving/faq|website=The Collective|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each floor features one larger kitchen with a dining table, which is shared between 30 and 70 residents, and themed communal living spaces such as a games room, a cinema, a 'disco-launderette', a hidden garden and a spa. A restaurant, gym and co-working spaces are located in the lower floors of the building.

===Germany===
In 2017, the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' reported there are about 25,000 micro-apartments in the country, and several thousand more are set to be built by the end of 2018. The projects will receive state support: the federal government plans to invest €120M in the micro-apartment market expansion. The market of micro-apartment targets over 30 million people, including students, singles and tenants whose primary places of residence are far from the big cities they work in. In Germany, tenants traditionally face considerable obstacles when trying to rent for anything less than the long-term — such as the obligation to pay a security deposit equal to three months’ rent and heightened credit history scrutiny. To the contrary, micro-apartments tend to cater to short- to medium-term renters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro-apartments:the hottest new trend sweeping the German real estate market|url=https://tranio.com/germany/analytics/micro-apartments-the-hottest-new-trend-sweeping-the-german-real-estate-market_5245/|website=Tranio|date=21 December 2016 |first1=Elena |last1=Milishenkova |first2=George |last2=Kachmazov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
Although some prefer to live in microapartments, others only temporarily live in microapartments due to economic reasons, and would move to a larger house or apartment if they could afford to do so.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Susan Saegert, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center was quoted with her opinion on microapartments, “I’ve studied children in crowded apartments and low-income housing a lot,” Saegert said, “and they can end up becoming withdrawn, and have trouble studying and concentrating.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-health-risks-of-small-apartments/282150/ |title=The Health Risks of Small Apartments |first=Jacoba |last=Urist |date=19 December 2013 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size of a microapartment can be an issue, as its confined nature may permit strong odors to linger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tempest |first=Jean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/realestate/what-no-one-ever-tells-you-about-tiny-homes.html |title=What no one ever tells you about tiny homes |work=New York Times |date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIDAC''' is an acronym created in 1981 by a [[Sydney]]-based business, Combined Resources Computing (CRC). It stands for Microprocessor Intelligent Data Acquisition and Control. CRC was established in order to complete several building automation projects commenced by R-Tec.

R-Tec was an Australian development company based in Sydney that focussed on designing innovative computerised building automation products. The proprietors formed R-Tec in the late 1970s after leaving Johnson Controls. The early R-Tec automation systems used TTL logic with control parameters stored in dynamic memory. 
The early computerised [[building automation]] systems or BAS monitored alarms and conditions relating to building services including air conditioning, water and power, etc. They also controlled plant by starting and stopping pumps and fans according to time and other interlock conditions.

The systems of the 1970s and early 1980s used parallel or multiple conductor communications data busses to communication with Data Gathering Panels (DGPs) located throughout the building. The DGPs would communicate monitored conditions using multiplex techniques back to a central location and "front end" system through the parallel data trunk.  In the same way commands to start and stop plant would be sent from the front end to the DGP and then to the machine. All decisions or "intelligence" was centrally located, and the DGPs simply relayed information.

Combined Resources Computing was established by Kevin Johnson-Bade, an ex R-Tec software engineer, with the prime goal of completing the building automation system contracted to R-Tec by the [[University of Melbourne]]. This occurred when R-Tec closed down, being unable to complete its contractual commitments.

The University of Melbourne building automation system was ambitious. In 1982 it was possibly the first successful implementation of a distributed intelligence building automation or [[Direct Digital Control]] or DDC system using [[Z80]] microprocessors. Remote units called Satellite Intelligence Units (SIUs) were located in buildings around the campus and were connected to the front end using a serial communications. See: [[Distributed control system]]

CRC developed a unique [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] control algorithm building approach. Even though the Z80 microprocessor of the time ran at only 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, and had a memory addressing range of 64 Kbytes, the University of Melbourne system out-performed other automations systems of the time significantly. CRC created a front-end computer that used ten processors to share the task, having access to up to 256 pages of shared memory. Each SIU used two Z80 processors. This allowed the intelligence to be shared, and many decisions to be made locally thus further reducing the load on the front end and reducing communications.
The University of Melbourne system was a leader in the development of distributed intelligence DDC system. 
Out of CRC Midac System Pty Limited was formed in 1982, and went on to develop and implement more leading DDC technology included systems where the front-end computer was a CPM operating system MZ3500 Sharp personal computer. The Sharp was chosen because of its much superior graphics compared with the early IBM PC of the early 1980s.

Over the following years the major players like Johnson and Honeywell would follow, replacing their mini-computer front-end terminals with PCs as they implemented microprocessor-based distributed intelligence systems using serial communications networks. Toward the end of the 1980s and early 1990s most DDC systems included an object-oriented control algorithm building tool. They compiled the object-oriented instructions into the system's native proprietary linear language, whereas in the Midac approach the control system's native language or operating environment was itself object-oriented.

Midac went on to develop three new generations of  microprocessor-based DDC systems, the last version being Nexus, developed for DKS that was taken over by James Hardie's Building Automation division. That business and its assets including Nexus were purchased by Chubb International in the late 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">The '''National Children’s Study''' (NCS) was a longitudinal [[cohort study]] that planned to recruit participants from across the United States of America. It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to [[health]] and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014.&lt;ref name=Science121214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jocelyn Kaiser|title=NIH cancels massive U.S. children’s study|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/12/nih-cancels-massive-u-s-children-s-study|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Science|date=December 12, 2014|quote=has too many flaws to be carried out in a tight budget environment, advisers today told National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins.

==Organization==
The NCS was led by the [[National Institutes of Health]], with the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) serving as the scientific lead. Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD.

For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety.

In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/organization/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Mandate==
The "President’s Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children" recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to:

# plan, develop, and implement a [[prospective cohort study]], from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and
# investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes.

The Act required this NCS to:
# incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children’s well-being;
# gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and
# consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/html/2011-10500.htm New Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Neuropsychosocial Measures Formative Research Methodology Studies for the National Children's Study] Federal Register, vol 76, No. 84, May 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment—broadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences— and [[genetics]] on the growth, [[child development|development]], and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to:
# contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children
# deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes
# understand factors that lead to health disparities.

With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/overview/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinued==
The NCS was in its Vanguard, or [[pilot study|pilot]] phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013.

On December 12, 2014, the National Children’s Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.&lt;ref&gt;National Children’s Study (NCS) Working Group [http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/NCS_WG_FINAL_REPORT.pdf FINAL REPORT – DECEMBER 12, 2014]  National Institutes of Health, Advisory Committee to the Director, 19 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCS will not collect any new information from participants.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The NIH plans to make data already collected available to researchers in late 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:Lennuliiklust uurimas.jpg|thumbnail|An observer is someone who gathers information about a phenomenon, but does not intervene. (Observing the air traffic in [[Rõuge]], [[Estonia]])]]

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

==Observation in science==
The [[scientific method]] requires observations of [[list of natural phenomena|natural phenomena]] to formulate and test [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].&lt;ref name="Kosso"&gt;{{cite book

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H. Freedman |title=The Streetlight Effect |url= |quote= |work=[[Discover magazine]] |date=August 1, 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-08-24 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

'''Orgueil''' is a scientifically important [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]] that fell in southwestern France in 1864.

==History==
It fell on May 14, 1864, a few minutes after 20:00 local time, near [[Orgueil]] in southern France. About 20 stones fell over an area of several square miles. A specimen of the meteorite was analyzed that same year by François Stanislaus Clöez, professor of chemistry at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle, who focused on the organic matter found in this meteorite. He wrote that it contained carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and its composition was very similar to peat from the Somme valley or to the lignite of Ringkohl near Kassel. An intense scientific discussion ensued, continuing into the 1870s, as to whether the organic matter might have a biological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmic Debris: Meteorites in History |last=Burke |first=John G. |year=1986 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=0-520-05651-5 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and classification==
Orgueil is one of five known meteorites belonging to the CI chondrite group (see [[meteorites classification]]), this being the largest ({{convert|14|kg}}). This group is remarkable for having a composition that is essentially identical to that of the sun, excluding gaseous elements like [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].

Because of its extraordinarily primitive composition and relatively large mass, Orgueil is one of the most-studied meteorites.  One notable discovery in Orgueil was a high concentration of [[isotope|isotopically]] anomalous [[xenon]] called "xenon-HL".  The carrier of this gas is extremely fine-grained [[diamond]] dust that is older than the [[solar system]] itself, known as [[presolar grains]].

In 1962, Nagy et al. announced the discovery of 'organised elements' embedded in the Orgueil meteorite that were purportedly biological structures of extraterrestrial origin. These elements were subsequently shown to be either [[pollen]] (including that of ragwort) and fungal [[spore]]s (Fitch &amp; Anders, 1963) that had contaminated the sample, or crystals of the mineral [[olivine]].

==The hoax==
In 1965, a fragment of the Orgueil meteorite, kept in a sealed glass jar in Montauban since its discovery, was found to have a [[seed]] capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained apparently undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_orgueil_meteorite|title=The Orgueil Meteorite, 1864|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite great initial excitement, the seed capsule was shown to be that of a European [[Juncaceae|rush]], glued into the fragment and camouflaged using [[coal dust]]. The outer "fusion layer" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator is unknown, it is thought that the hoax was aimed at influencing 19th century debate on [[Abiogenesis#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.

==Claim of fossils==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
[[Richard B. Hoover]] of [[NASA]] has claimed that the Orgueil meteorite contains fossils, some of which are similar to known terrestrial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/Leiden2010/Hoover_JOC_MS.pdf | format = PDF | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year= 2011 | volume=  13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites:  Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. |last=Hoover| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoover [[1997 in paleontology|has previously claimed]] the existence of fossils in the [[Murchison meteorite]]. However, NASA has formally distanced itself from Hoover's claims and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|PROUT||Prout (disambiguation)}}
[[File:PROUTlogo.gif|thumb|180px|Progressive Utilization Theory logo]]
'''Progressive Utilization Theory''' (Prout), also known by the acronym '''PROUT''', is a [[socioeconomic]] and political theory developed by philosopher and spiritual leader [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="Crovetto2008" /&gt;{{r|"Crovetto2011"}} The theory is based on his holistic outlook of life.{{r|:7|:0}} It is a system of governance&lt;ref name="Skrbina" /&gt; that is inspired by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as well as Sarkar's own ideas. It aims to be [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] and improve [[Social change|social development]].{{r|:7|p=1}} The theory is in line with Sarkar's [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] values which aim to provide "proper care" to every being on the planet, including  humans, animals and plants.{{r|:1}}

== History ==
By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book ''Ananda Sutram'', published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.{{r|Irving}}

In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{r|fukui|p=357}} The PBI was soon superseded by "Proutist Universal" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).{{When|date=May 2018}} 

The theory has not achieved widespread implementation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}} Cooperative communities have been established by [[Ananda Marga]] in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.&lt;ref name=Ellwood/&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}}

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes an [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] system as an alternative to [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], taking ideas from both.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; Under the system [[Tangible property|material goods]] would be [[common ownership|common property]] and [[Distribution (economics)|distributed]] in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onwuka /&gt; The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to [[industrial organization]]. Key industries and [[public utilities]] would be [[nonprofit organization]]s. Decentralized industry run by [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

At the political level, Prout rejects [[nationalism]]. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a [[world government]].&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inayatullah/&gt; There would be a world [[constitution]] and a [[bill of rights]] for animals and plants, as well as humans.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
{{main|Law of social cycle}}
Prout takes account of Sarkat's [[law of social cycle]]. It sees the [[social order]] as consisting of four [[Social class|classes of people]] that cyclically dominate society: ''shudras'' (workers), ''kshatriyas'' (warriors), ''vipras'' (intellectuals) and ''vaishyas'' (acquisitors).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as "... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell, volume 4|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, these different class or psychologies, are not seen as static or mutually exclusive. The theory sees them as evolving over an individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory then see the newly powerful class becoming corrupt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a "spiritual elite" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; 

Sadvipras would be organized into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; They would be responsible for the application of force necessary to change the order of dominance within the social order. It is envisioned that large amounts of force, akin to [[revolution]], may be necessary.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Neohumanism ===
{{main|Neohumanism}}
The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of [[humanism]]{{r|bio|:0}} integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.{{r|:1}}



=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen [[aphorism]]s (see Chapter 5 of ''Ananda Sutram''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ananda Sutram|last=Anandamurti|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1962|isbn=8172520271|location=Jamalpur|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles for a Balanced Economy: An Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|publisher=PROUT Research institute|year=2012|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, ''Idea and Ideology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea and Ideology|last=Anandamurtii|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The market ===
As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of [[capitalism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/HOH/HOH-8.pdf|title=Panimatzalam’s Voice of Transformation: An Indigenous Mayan Writing Project for Youth Activism|last=Oppenheim|first=Matt|date=|website=North Arizona University|page=144|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in Power|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|publisher=Proutist Bloc India|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so does its [[Economic system|economic structure]]. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout’s propounder argues that these philosophies are "anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. 

Another criticism of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the denegeration of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in a Nutshell part 12|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees ([[Gosplan]]) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see [[Marxism–Leninism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf|title=An analysis of the Soviet economic growth from the 1950’s to the collapse of USSR|last=Serrano|first=Franklin|last2=Mazat|first2=Numa|date=|website=Centros Raffa|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/inactive/command.pdf|title=Are Command Economies Unstable? Why did the Soviet Economy Collapse?|last=Harrison|first=Mark|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of [[Economic planning|market planning]] that help to create and sustain a healthy economy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing a new economy|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|last2=Sevaergrah|first2=Caroline|publisher=Inner World Books|year=2016|isbn=9781881717539|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economics]] where profit-motive speaks highest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf|title=Self-Reliant Regional proutist development|last=Ghista|first=Dhanjoo|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|date=|website=Prout.org|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/block-level-planning/|title=Block-level planning|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[diseconomies of scale]]). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Prout also claims that the [[nationalization]] of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Society part 1|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-1|title=Why nationalisation has fallen out of favour in Britain|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a "no-profit, no-loss" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell volume 4 part 21|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries vital for the prosperity of society (such as transportation, energy or hospitals), claims Sarkar, should be run by the immediate government as they are too large of operations to be run conveniently by private business men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an "optimal inequality" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Richard B. Freeman|Richard Freeman]], a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with "negative consequences" in terms of social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/edsall-just-right-inequality.html|title=Just Right Inequality|last=Thomas|first=Edsall|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]] cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] or [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]], where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online.southcentral.edu/students/instructors/MFMyROSEarticle.pdf|title=Living Wage and Optimal Inequality in a Sarkarian Framework|last=Friedman|first=Mark|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roar Bjonnes]], a known Proutist, states, "Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout, therefore, advocates an [[economic democracy]] where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proutist Economics: Discourses on Economic Liberation|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1992|isbn=9788172520038|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike [[capitalism]], where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The third requirement of economic democracy is the [[decentralization]] of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worker and Community: Response to Industrialization in a Nineteenth Century American City, Albany, New York, 1850-1884|last=Greenberg|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88706-046-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Small Is Beautiful|last=Schumacher|first=E.F.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1973|isbn=978-0-06-091630-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

Prout rests upon the concept of a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large-scale key industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A few problems solved part 9|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga publications|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, key industries vital to the development of the country and of strategic importance&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/prouts-3-tiered-economic-system/?wpdmdl=1652|title=PROUT’s Three-Tiered Enterprise System|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=2015|website=PROUT institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are too complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourses on PROUT|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.

In a Prout system there would be no privately owned corporations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in [[Sanskrit]], is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local [[community]], built on strong feelings of [[solidarity]] and [[Self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In sum, a unit should have common social and economic conditions, geographical potentialities, cultural legacy and language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similar to [[Bioregionalism|bioregions]], their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Self Reliant Regional Proutistic Development|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|last1=Ghista|first1=Dhanjoo|publisher=Prout Research Institute|year=1991|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Prout these socio-economic units would also create the necessary balance in the world's trade in so much as independently run and self-reliant communities would not need the resources from more developed economic powers seeking to exploit them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;


=== Progress ===
From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or it’s GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT - A New Paradigm for Development|last=Logan|first=Ronald|publisher=Ananda Seva Publications|year=2005|isbn=1892345048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of ''A new Paradigm of Development,'' reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moving along the lines of the [[triple bottom line]] that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a "fourth bottom line",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the [[summum bonum]] of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2011/11/what-is-progress/|title=What is Progress|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multifarious [[disease]]s that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the "supra-emotional values" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2012/10/a-new-definition-of-social-progress|title=A new definition of social progress|last=|first=|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Abraham Maslow|Maslownian]] perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Criticism==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  [[Johan Galtung]] claimed Prout is unlikely to make it into the western education system: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"P. R. Sarkar was a great thinker and a great practitioner. I have chosen to honor him as a great macrohistorian, focusing on his theory of Social Cycles and their implications for world unity and peace… But, given the ethnocentrism of the USA and Europe, Sarkar will not easily make it into textbooks or courses about civilization"'' ''–'' Johan Galtung &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Paul Erdman]], in the [[Los Angeles Times]] , described Prout as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis"''&lt;ref name="Erdman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]] was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]''. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like [[Johan Galtung]], founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that ''"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith’s]] or that of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]."'' &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some thinkers have proclaimed the pertinence that this theory has in the context of our modern world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Who|date=May 2018}} In the foreword of ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'' political philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote, ''"Alternative visions are crucial at this moment in history. Prout’s cooperative model of economic democracy, based on cardinal human values and sharing the resources of the planet for the welfare of everyone, deserves our serious consideration."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the same book historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote, ''"After Capitalism is refreshingly original. It is spiritual and utopian while remaining grounded in reality. Its analysis is intelligent and its vision inspiring."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Leonardo Boff]], Brazilian theologian and writer, has summed up what he considers to be the importance of Prout: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The exceptional importance of the Prout system resides in two fundamental points: its completeness and its viability. The entire system comes from a correct understanding of the human being, personal and collective, and authentic human development…" ''&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

According to a description by Terry Irving and [[Rowan Cahill]], Prout "envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth."&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; [[Sohail Inayatullah]] stated that the philosophy "attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution."&lt;ref name=Inayatullah /&gt; [[David Skrbina]] characterized Prout as a "model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society."&lt;ref name=Skrbina /&gt;  Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor [[John A. Ryan]], [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Herman Daly]] in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

It has been characterized as a form of "progressive socialism"&lt;ref name=Ellwood /&gt; as well as a "socialist theory".&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt; 

Hans Despain noted, in [[Monthly Review]], that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of [[David Schweickart]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]]. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/its-the-system-stupid/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamma radiation facility==
Three [[gamma radiation]] units are in service for sterilization of disposable medical supplies and food irradiation.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

==Electron accelerator facility==
The electron accelerator is the only one in the country. It has 500&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] energy and 20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] current.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

==Proton accelerator facility==
The country's first proton accelerator facility ({{lang-tr|Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi}}, TAEK-PHT) is housed in a separate building of two stories built on a ground area of {{convert|3100|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. The building consists of a [[cyclotron]] room, four target rooms, six production laboratories, three quality control laboratories, a R&amp;D laboratory and storage rooms for material and waste.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

Facility's groundbreaking was held on February 24, 2010. The building was constructed by the Turkish Housing Development Administration (TOKİ), and it was completed on December 12, 2010. The installation of the [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] and all the equipment needed concluded in 2011.&lt;ref name="taek2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem/30-arastirma-ve-gelistirme-bolumu/855-proton-hizlandirici-tesisi.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was officially opened on May 30, 2012 by Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-opens-first-particle-accelerator.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=22014&amp;NewsCatID=341 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |title=Turkey opens first particle accelerator |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=TAEK Proton Hızlandırıcısı Tesisi Açıldı |date=2012-05-31 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cyclotron]] type proton accelerator "CYCLONE-30" has a variable beam energy between 15 and 30 MeV and variable beam current up to 1.2 mA. It was designed, manufactured and installed by Belgian Ion Beam Applications S.A. (IBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iba-cyclotron-solutions.com/sites/default/files/ressources/CBR_Cyclone30_R01.pdf |publisher=IBA Cyclotron Solutions |title=Cyclone 30 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclotron cost 11.6 million EUR.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=67826 |publisher=[[CERN]] |title=TAEK Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi Kapsamı ve Hedefleri |author=Yüksel, Alper Nazmi |date=2009--09-10 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cyclotron, four [[beamline]]s can be generated, three beamlines for radiositope production and one for research and development works.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; With the proton bombardment following radioisotopes are produced in three separate target rooms:
* [[Indium-111]], [[gallium-67]], [[thallium-201]] on solid target material,
* [[Fluorine-18]] on liquid target material,
* [[Iodine-123]] on evaporated target material.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

These radioisotopes and [[radiopharmaceutical]]s produced from those radioisotopes are used for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases like [[cancer]], [[neurological disorder]], brain physiology and pathology as well as [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref name="taek2"/&gt;

By producing radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, the facility conducts research work in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, food, [[biotechnology]], animal husbandry and heath physics.&lt;ref name="taek1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Sarayköy Nükleer Araştırma ve Eğitim Merkezi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10175">Many types of '''sense loss''' occur due to a dysfunctional sensation process, whether it be ineffective [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], [[nerve damage]], or cerebral impairment. Unlike [[agnosia]], these impairments are due to damages prior to the [[perception]] process.

==Vision loss==
{{Main|Vision loss}}

Degrees of vision loss vary dramatically, although the [[ICD-9]] released in 1979 categorized them into three tiers: [[normal vision]], [[low vision]], and [[blindness]].  Two significant causes of vision loss due to sensory failures include media opacity and [[optic nerve]] diseases, although [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[retinal disease]] can also lead to blindness.  Most causes of vision loss can cause varying degrees of damage, from total blindness to a negligible effect. Media opacity occurs in the presence of [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the eye tissues or fluid, distorting and/or blocking the [[image]] prior to contact with the [[photoreceptor cells]].  Vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors. Optic nerve diseases such as [[optic neuritis]] or [[retrobulbar neuritis]] lead to dysfunction in the afferent nerve pathway once the signal has been correctly transmitted from retinal photoreceptors.

Partial or total vision loss may affect every single area of a person's life. Though loss of eyesight may occur naturally as we age, trauma to the eye or exposure to hazardous conditions may also cause this serious condition. Workers in virtually any field may be at risk of sustaining eye injuries through trauma or exposure. A traumatic eye injury occurs when the eye itself sustains some form of trauma, whether a [[penetrating injury]] such as a laceration or a non-penetrating injury such as an impact. Because the eye is a delicate and complex organ, even a slight injury may have a temporary or permanent effect on eyesight.

==Hearing loss==
{{Main|Hearing loss}}
Similarly to vision loss, [[hearing loss]] can vary from full or partial inability to detect some or all [[frequency|frequencies]] of sound which can typically be heard by members of their [[species]].  For [[humans]], this range is approximately 20 [[hertz|Hz]] to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz at ~6.5 [[decibel|dB]], although a 10&amp;nbsp;dB correction is often allowed for the [[elderly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Phonological features, auditory objects, and illusions | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 60–89 | doi = 10.1016/j.wocn.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary causes of hearing loss due to an impaired sensory system include long-term exposure to [[environmental noise]], which can damage the [[mechanoreceptors]] responsible for receiving [[sound|sound vibrations]], as well as multiple diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[meningitis]], which damage the [[cochlea]] and [[auditory nerve]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bizley | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Walker | first2 = K. M. M. | year = 2010 | title = Sensitivity and Selectivity of Neurons in Auditory Cortex to the Pitch, Timbre, and Location of Sounds | url = | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 453–469 | doi = 10.1177/1073858410371009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss may be gradual or sudden. Hearing loss may be very mild, resulting in minor difficulties with conversation, or as severe as complete deafness. The speed with which hearing loss occurs may give clues as to the cause. If hearing loss is sudden, it may be from [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or a problem with [[blood circulation]]. A gradual onset is suggestive of other causes such as [[aging]] or a [[tumor]]. If you also have other associated neurological problems, such as [[tinnitus]] or [[vertigo]], it may indicate a problem with the nerves in the ear or brain. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral hearing loss is most often associated with conductive causes, trauma, and acoustic neuromas. Pain in the ear is associated with ear infections, trauma, and obstruction in the canal.

==Anosmia==
{{Main|Anosmia}}
Anosmia  is the inability to perceive [[odor]], or in other words a lack of functioning [[olfaction]]. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral anosmia.

A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell. The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital anosmia.

The diagnosis of anosmia as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to "smell testing kits" that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig JC |title=Grating orientation as a measure of tactile spatial acuity |journal=[[Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–206 |year=1999 |pmid=10527368 |doi= 10.1080/08990229970456|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence are unaware of the deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220310001622997 |title=Decline of tactile acuity in aging: a study of body site, blood flow, and lifetime habits of smoking and physical activity, Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research, Informa Healthcare |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory loss==
The [[somatosensory system]] is a complex sensory system made up of a number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. It also comprises essential processing centres, or sensory modalities, such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception. The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.

While touch (also called tactile or tactual perception) is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "somatic senses" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Insensitivity to [[somatosensory]] stimuli, such as [[heat]], [[cold]], [[touch]], and [[pain]], are most commonly a result of a more general physical impairment associated with [[paralysis]]. Damage to the [[spinal cord]] or other major [[nerve fiber]] may lead to a termination of both [[afferent nerve|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve|efferent]] signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of [[motor coordination]]. Other types of somatosensory loss include [[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]], which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | year = 1976 | title = Acute Central Cord Syndrome Injury Mechanisms and Stress Features | doi = 10.1097/brs.0b013e3181c94cb8 | journal = Spine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = E955–E964 | pmid=20543769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light finger tap feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies{{such as?}} that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation.

==Ageusia==
{{main|Ageusia}}

Ageusia is the loss of taste, particularly the inability to detect [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]], [[saltiness]], and [[umami]] (meaning "pleasant/savory taste"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True ageusia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia (a partial loss of taste) and dysgeusia (a distortion or alteration of taste).

Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the [[lingual nerve]] and the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]. The lingual nerve passes taste for the front two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste for the back third of the tongue. The lingual nerve can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.

Taste loss can vary from true [[ageusia]], a complete loss of taste, to [[hypogeusia]], a partial loss of taste, to [[dysgeusia]], a distortion or alteration of taste.  The primary cause of ageusia involves damage to the [[lingual nerve]], which receives the stimuli from [[taste buds]] for the front two-thirds of the [[tongue]], or the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], which acts similarly for the back third. Damage may be due to neurological disorders, such as [[Bell’s palsy]] or [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as [[infectious diseases]] such as meningoencephalopathy.  Other causes include a [[vitamin B]] deficiency, as well as taste bud death due to acidic/spicy foods, [[radiation]], and/or [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macaluso | first1 = E. | year = 2010 | title = Orienting of spatial attention and the interplay between the senses.

==History==
Synap was developed by James Gupta and Omair Vaiyani, two medical students at [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds Medical School]], with an interest in neuroscience and memory. Having used [[spaced repetition]] software such as [[anki (software)|Anki]] in the past, they created a website that allowed students to write [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] quizzes in a [[multiple choice|Multiple Choice Question]] (MCQ) format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Synap had no revenues, but the founders were exploring adding a premium version for paying users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/synaps-app-students-edtech-oxford-lse-1st-quiz-exams-2015-10 "Here's the new app Oxford medics and LSE business students are using to help them get a 1st"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===MyCQs===

The first incarnation of Synap operated under the name 'MyCQs', which was released as a native iOS application and website in 2012, and initially gained popularity amongst UK medical students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/university-of-leeds-students-aiming-to-get-top-marks-for-smartphone-app-1-5058922 "University of Leeds students aiming to get top marks for smartphone app"], Yorkshire Evening Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://time.leeds.ac.uk/time/time_osce.php "Student Generated Resources"], Technology in Medical Education (University of Leeds), retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, CEO James Gupta was recruited as the Chief Technology Officer for [[JumpIn]], a student-focused taxi booking and sharing app.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lec.leeds.ac.uk/casestudies/sam-ryan-and-barney-williams-jumpin/ "Leeds University case studies: JumpIn"], Leeds University Careers, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; The company was acquired by taxi firm [[Addison Lee]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jackwills.com/young-brits-story-far/ "Young brits: the winner's stories so far"], Jack Wills Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cab4now.co.uk/blog/rideshare/rideshare/ "2015: Year of the rideshare?"], Cab4Now, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; after which James returned to focus on MyCQs.

In 2014, MyCQs received funding and mentoring from [[Jisc]], an education technology charity,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/summer-of-student-innovation-2014  "Jisc Summer of Student Innovation 2014"], Jisc, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and received a scholarship from The University of Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/4610/university_bootcamp_puts_fledgling_entrepreneurs_through_their_paces "University bootcamp puts fledgling entrepreneurs through their paces"], University of Leeds, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synap===
In 2015, the team shifted focus by integrating more algorithms based on [[educational psychology]] research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aistartups.org/2016/01/interview-with-james-gupta-ceofounder.html "Interview with James Gupta, CEO &amp; Founder of Synap"], AIStartups.org, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and started to describe itself as a 'personalised learning' platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-gupta/the-death-of-the-universi_b_8173492.html "The death of the university lecture"], Huffington Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the company being renamed Synap&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207106445-What-Is-Synap- "Synap FAQ: What is Synap?"], Synap, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdfunding===
In August 2015, Synap launched an [[equity crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Crowdcube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crowdcube.com/investment/synap-19333 "Crowdcube official pitch page for Synap"], Crowdcube, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/725346-edtech-entrepreneurs-launch-180-000-crowdfunding-campaign.html "Edtech entrepreneurs launch £180,000 crowdfunding campaign"], Business Desk, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Synap uses the concept of spaced repetition to send new content to users based on what they need to practice the most. In this sense, Synap is similar to existing spaced repetition platforms such as [[Anki (software)|Anki]] and [[Supermemo|SuperMemo]], though notably it does not support the creation of flashcards, which are more commonly associated with spaced repetition.

==Infrastructure==
Synap was originally developed on Facebook's [[Parse (company)|Parse]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.ac/blog/developing-an-effective-technology-stack "Developing an effective technology stack"], Synap Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Facebook announced that Parse would be closing down, and advised developers to migrate their apps to other services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/ "Moving On"], Parse Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Synap has been hosted on [[Amazon Web Services]], using the newly open-sourced [https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server Parse Server], which itself uses [[Node.js]]. The website is developed in [[Ember.js]], and uses a MongoDB database, making Synap an example of [[MEAN (software bundle)|full stack JavaScript]] development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackshare.io/synap-ac/synap-ac "Synap.ac's technology stack"], StackShare, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
Synap has been featured in The Oxford Public Health Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/oxfordpublichealth/docs/oxph_magazine_issue_4_apr2016 "Oxford Public Health Magazine Issue 4: Innovation and social entrepreneurship (p32-33"], Oxford Public Health Magazine, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Synap was listed as one of 10 British AI companies to look out for, by Business Insider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/10-british-ai-companies-to-look-out-for-in-2016-2015-12 "10 British AI companies to look out for in 2016"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-24-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School''' is a scientific [[school of thought]] in the field of [[semiotics]] that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the [[semiotics of culture]].

==History==
The Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics developed an original method of multidimensional [[cultural analysis]]. The languages of culture are interpreted as secondary modelling systems in relation to verbal language. This method permits a productive understanding of the use of different languages of culture.

This school is widely known for its journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' (formerly published in Russian as ''Труды по знаковым системам''), published by [[Tartu University Press]]. It is the oldest semiotics journal in the world, established in 1964.

In its first period, the 1960s and 1970s, TMSS followed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach and was strongly influenced by [[Russian formalism]]. Since the 1980s, its approach can be characterized as [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], and is connected with the introduction of [[Yuri Lotman|Juri Lotman's]] concept of [[semiosphere]] and its relation to [[organicism]].

From 1990s, TMSS has been succeeded by the Tartu Semiotics School, which is based in the Department of Semiotics of the University of Tartu and led by [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Peeter Torop]], [[Mihhail Lotman]], and others.

[[File:Golden hour graph.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Critical windows in emergency medicine]]

A '''window of opportunity''' (also called a '''margin of opportunity''' or '''critical window''') is a period of time during which some action can be taken that will achieve a desired outcome. Once this period is over, or the "window has closed", the specified outcome is no longer possible.&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of windows of opportunity include:
*The '''[[critical period]]''' in the development of an organism, during which [[neuroplasticity]] is greatest and key neurological functions, such as [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and [[language]], are acquired which may be impossible to acquire at a later stage&lt;ref name="Robson"/&gt;
*The '''[[golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]]''' or '''golden time''', used in [[emergency medicine]] to describe the period following traumatic injury in which life-saving treatment is likely to be successful&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;
*'''[[Market opportunity|Market opportunities]]''', in which one may be positioned to take advantage of a gap in a particular [[market (economics)|market]],&lt;ref name="boundless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt; the timing of which may depend on the activities of customers, competitors, and other market context factors&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;
*'''[[Sowing|Planting]] and [[harvest]]ing seasons''', in agriculture
*'''Space [[launch window|launch]] and [[orbital maneuver|maneuver]] windows''', which are determined by [[orbital dynamics]] and constrained by [[rocket propellant|fuel]]/[[delta-v]] budgets&lt;ref name="Heiney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler"/&gt;
*The theorized '''[[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]''' in climatology, after which the Earth's climate is predicted to shift to a new stable equilibrium&lt;ref name="ipcc"/&gt;

==Variations==
===Timing===
The length of a critical window may be well known (as in the case of launch windows) or poorly known (in the case of medical emergencies or climate change). In some cases, there may be multiple windows during which a goal can be achieved.

===Automation===
In situations with very brief or unpredictable windows of opportunity, [[automation]] may be employed to take advantage of these windows, as in [[algorithmic trading]].&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; [[Real-time computing]] systems can guarantee responses on the order of milliseconds or less.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari-pg164"/&gt;

===Costs===
In some time-critical situations, failure to act may entail a continuously increasing cost over time, or a continuously decreasing probability over time of achieving the desired outcome. This may be represented in real-time computing systems by [[time-utility function]]s.

===Use as a marketing tactic===
In some cases, critical windows may be artificially imposed (or even falsely implied) as a [[marketing]] tactic to encourage action, in what is known as a "limited time offer".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;

'''Zearalenone''' ('''ZEN'''), also known as RAL and F-2 [[mycotoxin]], is a potent [[estrogenic]] [[metabolite]] produced by some ''[[Fusarium]]'' and ''[[Gibberella]]'' species.&lt;ref name=Fermentek&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.fermentek.com/zearalenone | title = Zearalenone | publisher = [[Fermentek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, is produced by ''[[Fusarium graminearum]]'', ''[[Fusarium culmorum]]'', ''[[Fusarium cerealis]]'', ''[[Fusarium equiseti]]'', ''[[Fusarium verticillioides]]'', and ''[[Fusarium incarnatum]]''.

Several ''Fusarium'' species produce toxic substances of considerable concern to livestock and poultry producers, namely [[deoxynivalenol]], [[T-2 toxin]], [[HT-2 toxin]], [[diacetoxyscirpenol]] (DAS) and zearalenone.  Zearalenone is the primary toxin, causing [[infertility]], [[abortion]] or other breeding problems, especially in swine.

Zearalenone is heat-stable and is found worldwide in a number of cereal crops, such as [[maize]], [[barley]], [[oats]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], and [[sorghum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kuiper-Goodman, T. |author2=Scott, P.

In addition to its actions on the classical [[estrogen receptor]]s, zearalenone has been found to act as an [[agonist]] of the [[GPER]] (GPR30).&lt;ref name="ProssnitzBarton2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prossnitz|first1=Eric R.|last2=Barton|first2=Matthias|title=Estrogen biology: New insights into GPER function and clinical opportunities|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=389|issue=1-2|year=2014|pages=71–83|issn=0303-7207|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2014.02.002|pmid=24530924|pmc=4040308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical and physical properties==
Zearalenone is a white [[crystalline]] solid. It exhibits blue-green [[fluorescence]] when excited by long wavelength [[ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]] (UV) light (360&amp;nbsp;nm) and a more intense green fluorescence when excited with short wavelength UV light (260&amp;nbsp;nm). In methanol, UV absorption maxima occur at 236 (e = 29,700), 274 (e = 13,909) and 316&amp;nbsp;nm (e = 6,020). Maximum fluorescence in [[ethanol]] occurs with irradiation at 314&amp;nbsp;nm and with emission at 450&amp;nbsp;nm. Solubility in water is about 0.002 g/100 mL. It is slightly soluble in [[hexane]] and progressively more so in [[benzene]], [[acetonitrile]], [[methylene chloride]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], and [[acetone]]. It is also soluble in aqueous [[alkali]].

==Dermal exposure==
Zearalenone can permeate through the human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Boonen, J. |author2=Malysheva, S. V. |author3=Taevernier, L. |author4=Diana di Mavungu, J. |author5=de Saeger, S. |author6=de Spiegeleer, B. | title = Human Skin Penetration of Selected Model Mycotoxins | journal = Toxicology | year = 2012 | volume = 301 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 21–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2012.06.012 | pmid = 22749975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, no significant hormonal effects are expected after dermal contact in normal agricultural or residential environments.

==Reproduction==
The human and livestock exposure to ZEN through the diet poses health concern due to the onset of several [[sexual disorders]] and alterations in the development of [[sexual apparatus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massart|first1=F.|last2=Saggese|first2=G.|title=Oestrogenic mycotoxin exposures and precocious pubertal development|journal=International Journal of Andrology|date=April 2010|volume=33|issue=2|pages=369–376|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.01009.x|pmid=20002219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoevers|first1=Eric J.|last2=Santos|first2=Regiane R.|last3=Colenbrander|first3=Ben|last4=Fink-Gremmels|first4=Johanna|last5=Roelen|first5=Bernard A.J.|title=Transgenerational toxicity of Zearalenone in pigs|journal=Reproductive Toxicology|date=August 2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=110–119|doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2012.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reliable case reports of early puberty in girls chronically exposed to ZEN in various regions of the world.&lt;ref name="HuezaRaspantini2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hueza|first1=Isis|last2=Raspantini|first2=Paulo|last3=Raspantini|first3=Leonila|last4=Latorre|first4=Andreia|last5=Górniak|first5=Silvana|title=Zearalenone, an Estrogenic Mycotoxin, Is an Immunotoxic Compound|journal=Toxins|volume=6|issue=3|year=2014|pages=1080–1095|issn=2072-6651|doi=10.3390/toxins6031080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling and analysis==
In common with other mycotoxins, sampling food commodities for zearalenone must be carried out to obtain samples representative of the consignment under test. Commonly used extraction solvents are aqueous mixtures of methanol, [[acetonitrile]], or [[ethyl acetate]] followed by a range of different clean-up procedures that depend in part on the food and on the detection method in use. [[Thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC) methods and [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) are commonly used. HPLC alone is not sufficient, as it may often yield false positive results. Today, HPLC-[[MS/MS]] analysis is used to quantify and confirm the presence of zearalenone.

The TLC method for zearalenone is: normal phase [[silica gel]] plates, the eluent: 90% [[dichloromethane]], 10% v/v acetone; or reverse phase C18 silica plates; the eluent: 90% v/v [[methanol]], 10% water. Zearalenone gives unmistakable blue luminiscence under UV.&lt;ref name=Fermentek/&gt;
