In [[mathematical logic]], an '''abstract logic''' is a [[formal system]] consisting of a class of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s and a [[satisfaction relation]] with specific properties related to occurrence, expansion, isomorphism, renaming and quantification.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Chang and Jerome Keisler ''Model Theory'', 1990 {{ISBN|0-444-88054-2}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Per Lindström (logician)|Lindström]]'s characterization, [[first-order logic]] is, up to equivalence, the only abstract logic which is [[countably compact]] and has [[Löwenheim number]] ω.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chen Chung Chang|C. C. Chang]] and [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Jerome Keisler]] ''Model Theory'', 1990 {{ISBN|0-444-88054-2}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximate [[max-flow min-cut theorem]]s are mathematical propositions in [[Flow network|network flow]] theory. They deal with the relationship between maximum flow rate ("max-flow") and [[minimum cut]] ("min-cut") in a [[multi-commodity flow problem]]. The theorems have enabled the development of [[approximation algorithm]]s for use in [[graph partition]] and related problems.

==Multicommodity flow problem==
A "commodity" in a network flow problem is a pair of source and sink [[node (graph theory)|node]]s. In a multi-commodity flow problem, there are {{math|k≥1}} commodities, each with its own source &lt;math&gt;s_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, sink &lt;math&gt;t_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and demand &lt;math&gt;D_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The objective is to simultaneously route &lt;math&gt;D_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt; units of commodity {{mvar|i}} from &lt;math&gt;s_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for each {{mvar|i}}, such that the total amount of all commodities passing through any edge is no greater than its capacity. (In the case of undirected edges, the sum of the flows in both directions cannot exceed the capacity of the edge).&lt;ref name="Leighton99"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Leighton |author-first1=Tom |author-last2=Rao |author-first2=Satish |title=Multicommodity Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorems and Their Use in Designing Approximation Algorithms |journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |date=November 1999 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=787–832 |doi=10.1145/331524.331526}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specially, a 1-commodity (or single commodity) flow problem is also known as a [[maximum flow problem]]. According to the [[Ford–Fulkerson algorithm]], the max-flow and min-cut are always equal in a 1-commodity flow problem.

===Max-flow and min-cut===
In a multicommodity flow problem, ''max-flow'' is the maximum value of {{mvar|f}}, where {{mvar|f}} is the common fraction of each commodity that is routed, such that &lt;math&gt;fD_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt; units of commodity {{mvar|i}} can be simultaneously routed for each {{mvar|i}} without violating any capacity constraints.
''min-cut'' is the minimum of all cuts of the ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of the capacity of the cut to the demand of the cut.
Max-flow is always upper bounded by the min-cut for a multicommodity flow problem.

===Uniform multicommodity flow problem===
In a uniform multicommodity flow problem, there is a commodity for every pair of nodes and the demand for every commodity is the same. (Without loss of generality, the demand for every commodity is set to one.) The underlying network and capacities are arbitrary.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

===Product multicommodity flow problem===
In a product multicommodity flow problem, there is a nonnegative weight for each node &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; in graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;. The demand for the commodity between nodes {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} is the product of the weights of node {{mvar|u}} and node {{mvar|v}}. The uniform multicommodity flow problem is a special case of the product multicommodity flow problem for which the weight is set to 1 for all nodes &lt;math&gt;u \in V&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

===Duality of linear programming===
{{see also|Linear programming}}
In general, the dual of a multicommodity flow problem for a graph {{mvar|G}} is the problem of apportioning a fixed amount of weight (where weights can be considered as distances) to the edges of {{mvar|G}} such that to maximize the cumulative distance between the source and sink pairs.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

===History===
The research on the relationship between the max-flow and min-cut of multicommodity flow problem has obtained great interest since Ford and Fulkerson's result for 1-commodity flow problems. Hu&lt;ref name="hu63"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Hu |author-first1=T. C. |title=Multicommodity network flows |journal=[[Operations Research (journal)|Operations Research]] |date=1963 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=344–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
showed that the max-flow and min-cut are always equal for two commodities. Okamura and Seymour&lt;ref name="Okamura and Seymour 81"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Okamura |author-first1=H. |author-last2=Seymour |author-first2=P. D. |title=Multicommodity flows in planar graphs |journal=[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B]] |date=1981 |volume=31 |issue= |pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated a 4-commodity flow problem with max-flow equals to 3/4 and min-cut equals 1. Shahrokhi and Matula&lt;ref name="Shahrokhi and Matula 90"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Shahrokri |author-first1=F. |author-last2=Matula |author-first2=David W. |title=The maximum concurrent flow problem |journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |date=1990 |volume=37 |pages=318–334 |doi=10.1145/77600.77620}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proved that the max-flow and min-cut are equal provided the dual of the flow problem satisfies a certain cut condition in a uniform multicommodity flow problem. Many other researchers also showed concrete research results in similar problems&lt;ref name="Klein97"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Klein |author-first1=P. |author-last2=Plotkin |author-first2=S. |author-last3=Rao |author-first3=S. |author-last4=Tardos |author-first4=E. |title=Bounds on the max-flow min-cut ratio for directed multicommodity flows |journal=[[J. Algorithms]] |date=1997 |volume=22 |pages=241–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garg96"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Garg |author-first1=N. |author-last2=Vazarani |author-first2=V. |author-last3=Yannakakis |author-first3=M. |title=Approximate max-flow min-(multi)cut theorems and their applications |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]] |date=1996 |volume=25 |pages=235–251 |doi=10.1137/s0097539793243016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plotkin and Tardos 93"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Plitkin |author-first1=S. |author-last2=Tardos |author-first2=E. |title=Improved bounds on the max-flow min-cut ratio for multicommodity flows |journal=Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing |date=1993 |pages=691–697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a general network flow problem, the max-flow is within a factor of {{mvar|k}} of the min-cut since each commodity can be optimized separately using &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt; of the capacity of each edge. This is not a good result especially in case of large numbers of commodities.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

==Approximate max-flow min-cut theorems==

===Theorems of uniform multicommodity flow problems===
There are two theorems first introduced by Tom Leighton and Satish Rao in 1988&lt;ref name="Leighton88"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Leighton |author-first1=Tom |author-last2=Rao |author-first2=Satish |title=An approximate max-flow min-cut theorem for uniform multicommodity flow problems with applications to approximation algorithms |journal=Proceedings of the 29th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science |date=1988 |pages=422–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and then extended in 1999.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt; Theorem 2 gives a tighter bound compared to Theorem 1.

'''Theorem 1.''' ''For any {{mvar|n}}, there is an {{mvar|n}}-node uniform multicommodity flow problem with max-flow {{mvar|f}} and min-cut &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;f\le O\left(\frac{\varphi}{\log n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

'''Theorem 2.''' ''For any uniform multicommodity flow problem, &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\varphi}{\log n}\right)\le f\le\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|f}} is the max-flow and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the min-cut of the uniform multicommodity flow problem.''&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

To prove Theorem 2, both the max-flow and the min-cut should be discussed. 
For the max-flow, the techniques from duality theory of linear programming have to be employed. According to the duality theory of linear programming, an optimal distance function results in a total weight that is equal to the max-flow of the uniform multicommodity flow problem. 
For the min-cut, a 3-stage process has to be followed:&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garg96"/&gt;

Stage 1: Consider the dual of uniform commodity flow problem and use the optimal solution to define a graph with distance labels on the edges.

Stage 2: Starting from a source or a sink, grow a region in the graph until find a cut of small enough capacity separating the root from its mate.

Stage 3: Remove the region and repeat the process of stage 2 until all nodes get processed.

===Generalized to product multicommodity flow problem===

'''Theorem 3.''' ''For any product multicommodity flow problem with {{mvar|k}} commodities, &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\varphi}{\log k}\right)\le f\le \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|f}} is the max-flow and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the min-cut of the product multicommodity flow problem.''&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

The proof methodology is similar to that for Theorem 2; the major difference is to take node weights into consideration.

===Extended to directed multicommodity flow problem===

In a directed multicommodity flow problem, each edge has a direction, and the flow is restricted to move in the specified direction. In a directed uniform multicommodity flow problem, the demand is set to 1 for every directed edge.

'''Theorem 4.''' ''For any directed uniform multicommodity flow problem with {{mvar|n}} nodes, &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\varphi}{\log n}\right)\le f\le \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|f}} is the max-flow and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the min-cut of the uniform multicommodity flow problem.''&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

The major difference in the proof methodology compared to Theorem 2 is that, now the edge directions need to be considered when defining distance labels in stage 1 and for growing the regions in stage 2, more details can be found in.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

Similarly, for product multicommodity flow problem, we have the following extended theorem:

'''Theorem 5.''' ''For any directed product multicommodity flow problem with {{mvar|k}} commodities, &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\varphi}{\log k}\right)\le f\le\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|f}} is the max-flow and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the directed min-cut of the product multicommodity flow problem.''&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

==Applications to approximation algorithms==
The above theorems are very useful to design [[approximation algorithm]]s for [[NP-hard]] problems, such as the [[graph partition]] problem and its variations. Here below we briefly introduce a few examples, and the in-depth elaborations can be found in Leighton and Rao (1999).&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

===Sparsest cuts===
A sparsest cut of a graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; is a partition for which the ratio of the number of edges connecting the two partitioned components over the product of the numbers of nodes of both components. This is a NP-hard problem, and it can be approximated to within &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; factor using Theorem 2. Also, a sparsest cut problem with weighted edges, weighted nodes or directed edges can be approximated within an &lt;math&gt;O(\log p)&lt;/math&gt; factor where {{mvar|p}} is the number of nodes with nonzero weight according to Theorem 3, 4 and 5.

===Balanced cuts and separators===
In some applications, we want to find a small cut in a graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; that partitions the graph into nearly equal-size pieces. We usually call a cut ''b-balanced'' or a {{math|(''b'',1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'')}}-''separator'' (for {{math|''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/2}}) if &lt;math&gt;b\pi(V)\le\pi(U)\le(1-b)\pi(V)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\pi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the node weights in {{mvar|U}}. This is also an [[NP-hard]] problem. An approximation algorithm has been designed for this problem,&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt; and the core idea is that {{mvar|G}} has a {{mvar|b}}-balanced cut of size {{mvar|S}}, then we find a {{math|''b''&amp;prime;}}-balanced cut of size &lt;math&gt;O\left(S\log \frac n b -b'\right)&lt;/math&gt; for any {{mvar|b'}} where {{math|''b''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''}} and {{math|''b''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/3}}. Then we repeat the process then finally obtain the result that total weight of the edges in the cut is at most &lt;math&gt;O\left(\frac{S\log n}{b-b'}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===VLSI layout problems===
It is helpful to find a layout of minimum size when designing a VLSI circuit. Such a problem can often be modeled as a graph embedding problem. The objective is to find an embedding for which the layout area is minimized. Finding the minimum layout area is also NP-hard. An approximation algorithm has been introduced&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt; and the result is &lt;math&gt;O(\log^6 n)&lt;/math&gt; times optimal.

===Forwarding index problem===
Given an {{mvar|n}}-node graph {{mvar|G}} and an embedding of &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; in {{mvar|G}}, Chung et al.&lt;ref name="CHUNG87"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Chung |author-first1=F. K. |author-last2=Coffman |author-first2=E. G. |author-last3=Reiman |author-first3=M. I. |author-last4=Simon |author-first4=B. E. |title=The forwarding index of communication networks |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |date=1987 |volume=33 |pages=224–232 |doi=10.1109/tit.1987.1057290}}&lt;/ref&gt;
defined the ''forwarding index'' of the embedding to be the maximum number of paths (each corresponding to an edge of &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;) that pass through any node of {{mvar|G}}. The objective is to find an embedding that minimizes the forwarding index. Using embedding approaches&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt; it is possible to bound the node and edge-forwarding indices to within an &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;-factor for every graph {{mvar|G}}.

===Planar edge deletion===
Tragoudas&lt;ref name="TRAGOUDAS90"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Tragoudas |author-first1=S. |title=VLSI partitioning approximation algorithms based on multicommodity flows and other techniques |type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
uses the approximation algorithm for balanced separators to find a set of 
&lt;math&gt;O\left((R\log n + \sqrt{nR})\log\frac{n}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
edges whose removal from a bounded-degree graph {{mvar|G}} results in a planar graph, where {{mvar|R}} is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from {{mvar|G}} before it becomes planar. It remains an open question if there is a [[Polylogarithmic function|polylog]] {{mvar|n}} times optimal approximation algorithm for {{mvar|R}}.&lt;ref name="Leighton99"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1123">In mathematics, an ''n''th-order '''Argand system''' (named after [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Jean-Robert Argand]]) is a [[coordinate system]] constructed around the ''n''th [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. From the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], ''n'' axes extend such that the angle between each axis and the axes immediately before and after it is 360/''n'' [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. For example, the [[number line]] is the 2nd-order Argand system because the two axes extending from the origin represent 1 and&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, the 2nd roots of unity. The [[complex plane]] (sometimes called the Argand plane, also named after Argand) is the 4th-order Argand system because the 4 axes extending from the origin represent 1, ''i'', &amp;minus;1, and &amp;minus;''i'', the 4th roots of unity.

'''AxCrypt''' is [[open-source software|open-source]] [[encryption]] software offering both a free version and a premium (at-cost) version for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[iOS]]. It was originally developed in [[Sweden]] by Svante Seleborg and is produced and maintained by him and the staff of AxCrypt [[Aktiebolag|AB]]. It can compress, delete, encrypt/decrypt, and edit files (though, thus far, the Android, iOS, and free macOS versions are read-only viewer programs). It is a file-based encryption program, as differs from a container-based encryption program, i.e., each single to-be-protected file is encrypted individually by the program, rather than the program putting all to-be-protected files into a single encrypted container like [[TrueCrypt]] or [[VeraCrypt]] does. Axcrypt comes in installer versions for all mentioned operating systems and also a standalone (portable) version for Windows.

== Features ==
AxCrypt can encrypt a file or a folder by using either a key file or a password. AxCrypt can also secure files on the file sharing services such as [[Dropbox (service)|DropBox]] or [[Google Drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Top 5 Encryption tools for Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive {{!}} Next of Windows|url=http://www.nextofwindows.com/top-3-free-encryption-tools-to-protect-your-data-stored-in-the-cloud|work=www.nextofwindows.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; AxCrypt is using [[Aes-128|AES-128]] and [[AES-256]] encryption standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=en-GB |last1=staff |first1=PC Advisor |title= Five of the best encryption tools|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/feature/software/five-of-the-best-encryption-tools-3290443/|work=PC Advisor|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users need to sign up for a user account in order to use AxCrypt. Users may log in by entering the password to encrypt files or folders. As long the user is logged in, he or she can open secured files and folders. The key file is actually a [[plain text]] document containing a code to open the file. An existing file can also be used to encrypt a file or a folder.

AxCrypt allows secured files to be opened by other AxCrypt users with the same password that was used to encrypt. AxCrypt can also delete data safely: the tool scrambles the data and then deletes them. The purpose of this feature is to prevent a malicious user to retrieve data later.

&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which each edge is given an independent orientation (or direction, or arrow) at each end.  Thus, there are three kinds of bidirected edges: those where the arrows point outward, towards the vertices, at both ends; those where both arrows point inward, away from the vertices; and those in which one arrow points away from its vertex and towards the opposite end, while the other arrow points in the same direction as the first, away from the opposite end and towards its own vertex.

Edges of these three types may be called, respectively, '''extraverted''', '''introverted''', and '''directed'''.  The "directed" edges are the same as ordinary directed edges in a [[directed graph]]; thus, a directed graph is a special kind of bidirected graph.

It is sometimes desirable to have also edges with only one end ('''half-edges'''); these get only one arrow.  An edge with no ends (a '''loose edge''') has no arrows.  The edges that are neither half nor loose edges may be called '''ordinary edges'''.

A [[skew-symmetric graph]] is the [[Bipartite double cover|double covering graph]] of a bidirected graph.

A symmetric [[directed graph]] (that is, a directed graph in which the reverse of every edge is also an edge) is sometimes also called a "bidirected graph".&lt;ref name="MehlhornSanders2008"&gt;{{citation

'''C&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-algebras''' &lt;!-- "C*" is almost fine, but some fonts render the star like ∗, i.e., not superscirpt, nor small. --&gt;(pronounced "C-star") are an area of research in [[functional analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]].  A C*-algebra is a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' of [[continuous linear operator]]s on a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] with two additional properties:

* ''A'' is a topologically [[closed set]] in the [[norm topology]] of operators.
* ''A'' is closed under the operation of taking [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]]s of operators.

C*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in [[quantum mechanics]] to [[model (abstract)|model]] algebras of physical [[observable]]s.  This line of research began with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and in a more mathematically developed form with [[Pascual Jordan]] around 1933.  Subsequently, [[John von Neumann]] attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators.  These papers considered a special class of C*-algebras which are now known as [[von Neumann algebra]]s.

Around 1943, the work of [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]] yielded an abstract characterisation of C*-algebras making no reference to operators on a Hilbert space.

C*-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s, and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for separable simple [[nuclear C*-algebra]]s.

== Abstract characterization ==

We begin with the abstract characterization of C*-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.

A C*-algebra, ''A'', is a [[Banach algebra]] over the field of [[complex number]]s, together with a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] * : ''A'' → ''A''. One writes ''x*'' for the image of an element ''x'' of ''A''. The map * has the following properties:

* It is an [[Semigroup with involution|involution]], for every ''x'' in ''A'':
::&lt;math&gt; x^{**} = (x^*)^* =  x &lt;/math&gt;

* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'':
::&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; (x y)^* = y^* x^*&lt;/math&gt;

* For every complex number λ in '''C''' and every ''x'' in ''A'':
::&lt;math&gt; (\lambda x)^* = \overline{\lambda} x^* .&lt;/math&gt;

* For all ''x'' in ''A'':
::&lt;math&gt;  \|x^* x \| = \|x\|\|x^*\|.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark.''' The first three identities say that ''A'' is a [[*-algebra]]. The last identity is called the '''C* identity''' and is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;\|xx^*\| = \|x\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

which is sometimes called the B*-identity. For history behind the names C*- and B*-algebras, see the [[#Some_history:_B.2A-algebras_and_C.2A-algebras|history]] section below.

The C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:

::&lt;math&gt; \|x\|^2 = \|x^* x\| = \sup\{|\lambda| : x^* x - \lambda \,1 \text{ is not invertible} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[bounded linear map]], π : ''A'' → ''B'', between C*-algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is called a '''*-homomorphism''' if

* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x y) = \pi(x) \pi(y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

* For ''x'' in ''A''

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x^*) = \pi(x)^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of C*-algebras, any *-homomorphism π between C*-algebras is [[Contraction (operator theory)|contractive]], i.e. bounded with norm ≤ 1. Furthermore, an injective *-homomorphism between C*-algebras is [[isometry|isometric]]. These are consequences of the C*-identity.

A bijective *-homomorphism π is called a '''C*-isomorphism''', in which case ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''isomorphic'''.

== Some history: B*-algebras and C*-algebras ==
The term B*-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe [[Banach *-algebra]]s that satisfy the condition:

* &lt;math&gt;\lVert x x^* \rVert = \lVert x \rVert ^2&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in the given B*-algebra. (B*-condition)

This condition automatically implies that the *-involution is isometric, that is, &lt;math&gt;\lVert x \rVert = \lVert x^* \rVert &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\lVert xx^*\rVert = \lVert x \rVert \lVert x^*\rVert&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore, a B*-algebra is also a C*-algebra. Conversely, the C*-condition implies the B*-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition &lt;math&gt;\lVert x \rVert = \lVert x^* \rVert&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|pp=5–6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&amp;pg=PA5 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the term B*-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term 'C*-algebra'.

The term C*-algebra was introduced by [[Irving Segal|I. E. Segal]] in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of ''B''(''H''), namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space ''H''. 'C' stood for 'closed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|p=6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&amp;pg=PA6 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper Segal defines a C*-algebra as a "uniformly closed, self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|1947|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of C*-algebras ==

C*-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. Some of these properties can be established by using the [[continuous functional calculus]] or by reduction to commutative  C*-algebras.  In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the [[Gelfand isomorphism]].

=== Self-adjoint elements ===

Self-adjoint elements are those of the form ''x''=''x''*. The set of elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' of the form ''x*x'' forms a closed [[convex cone]].  This cone is identical to the elements of the form ''xx*''. Elements of this cone are called ''non-negative'' (or sometimes ''positive'', even though this terminology conflicts with its use for elements of '''R'''.)

The set of self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' naturally has the structure of a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[vector space]]; the ordering is usually denoted ≥. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element ''x'' of ''A'' satisfies ''x'' ≥ 0 if and only if the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''x''  is non-negative,{{clarify|Under the Gelfand representation?|date=August 2014}} if and only if ''x'' = ''s*s'' for some ''s''. Two self-adjoint elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''A'' satisfy ''x'' ≥ ''y'' if ''x''−''y'' ≥ 0.

This partially ordered subspace allows the definition of a [[positive linear functional]] on a C*-algebra, which in turn is used to define the [[State (functional analysis)|states]] of a C*-algebra, which in turn can be used to construct the [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]] using the [[GNS construction]].

=== Quotients and approximate identities ===

Any C*-algebra ''A'' has an [[approximate identity]].  In fact, there is a directed family {''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;λ∈I&lt;/sub&gt; of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' such that

:: &lt;math&gt; x e_\lambda \rightarrow x &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq e_\lambda \leq e_\mu \leq 1\quad \mbox{ whenever } \lambda \leq \mu. &lt;/math&gt;

: In case ''A'' is separable, ''A'' has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, ''A'' will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if ''A'' contains a '''[[Hereditary C*-subalgebra|strictly positive element]]''', i.e. a positive element ''h'' such that ''hAh'' is dense in ''A''.

Using approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic [[quotient]] of a C*-algebra by a closed proper two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], with the natural norm, is a C*-algebra.

Similarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C*-algebra is itself a C*-algebra.

== Examples ==

=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===
The algebra M(''n'', '''C''') of ''n'' × ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''C''' becomes a C*-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and  use the [[operator norm]] ||.|| on matrices. The involution is given by the [[conjugate transpose]].  More generally, one can consider finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s of matrix algebras. In fact, all C*-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C*-algebras are [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]], from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem|Artin–Wedderburn]] type:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.'''  A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, ''A'', is [[Canonical form|canonically]] isomorphic to a finite direct sum
:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigoplus_{e \in \min A } A e&lt;/math&gt;
where min ''A'' is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of ''A''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each C*-algebra, ''Ae'', is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix algebra M(dim(''e''), '''C'''). The finite family indexed on min ''A'' given by {dim(''e'')}&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ''dimension vector'' of ''A''.  This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of [[operator K-theory|K-theory]], this vector is the [[ordered group|positive cone]] of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; group of ''A''.

A '''†-algebra''' (or, more explicitly, a ''†-closed algebra'') is the name occasionally used in [[physics]]&lt;ref&gt;John A. Holbrook, David W. Kribs, and Raymond Laflamme. "Noiseless Subsystems and the Structure of the Commutant in Quantum Error Correction." ''Quantum Information Processing''. Volume 2, Number 5, p. 381&amp;ndash;419.  Oct 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]], †, is used in the name because physicists typically use the symbol to denote a [[Hermitian adjoint]], and are often not worried about the subtleties associated with an infinite number of dimensions.  (Mathematicians usually use the asterisk, *, to denote the Hermitian adjoint.) †-algebras feature prominently in [[quantum mechanics]], and especially [[quantum information science]].

An immediate generalization of finite dimensional C*-algebras are the [[approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra]]s.

=== C*-algebras of operators ===
The prototypical example of a C*-algebra is the algebra ''B(H)'' of bounded (equivalently continuous) [[linear operator]]s defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''H''; here ''x*'' denotes the [[adjoint operator]] of the operator ''x'' : ''H'' → ''H''. In fact, every C*-algebra, ''A'', is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of ''B''(''H'') for a suitable Hilbert space, ''H''; this is the content of the [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]].

=== C*-algebras of compact operators ===
Let ''H'' be a [[separable space|separable]] infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra ''K''(''H'') of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on ''H'' is a [[norm closed]] subalgebra of ''B''(''H''). It is also closed under involution; hence it is a  C*-algebra.

Concrete C*-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburn's theorem for finite dimensional C*-algebras:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' If ''A'' is a C*-subalgebra of ''K''(''H''), then there exists Hilbert spaces {''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; A \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I } K(H_i),&lt;/math&gt;
where the (C*-)direct sum consists of elements (''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the Cartesian product Π ''K''(''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') with ||''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|| → 0.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though ''K''(''H'')  does not have an identity element, a sequential [[approximate identity]] for ''K''(''H'') can be developed. To be specific, ''H'' is isomorphic to the space  of square summable sequences ''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; we may assume that ''H'' = ''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  For each natural number ''n'' let ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the subspace of sequences of ''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which vanish for indices ''k'' ≤ ''n'' and let ''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the orthogonal projection onto ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The sequence {''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an approximate identity for ''K''(''H'').

''K''(''H'') is a two-sided closed ideal of ''B''(''H''). For separable Hilbert spaces, it is the unique ideal. The [[quotient]] of ''B''(''H'') by ''K''(''H'') is the [[Calkin algebra]].

=== Commutative C*-algebras ===
Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space.  The space &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; of complex-valued continuous functions on ''X'' that ''vanish at infinity'' (defined in the article on [[locally compact|local compactness]]) form a commutative C*-algebra &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; under pointwise multiplication and addition. The involution is pointwise conjugation. &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; has a multiplicative unit element if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is  compact.  As does any C*-algebra, &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; has an [[approximate identity]]. In the case of &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; this is immediate: consider the directed set of compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and for each compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;f_K&lt;/math&gt; be a function of compact support which is identically 1 on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.  Such functions exist by the [[Tietze extension theorem]] which applies to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Any such sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;\{f_K\}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximate identity.

The [[Gelfand representation]] states that every commutative C*-algebra is *-isomorphic to the algebra &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the space of [[Character (mathematics)|characters]] equipped with the [[Weak topology|weak* topology]]. Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;C_0(Y)&lt;/math&gt; as C*-algebras, it follows that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]. This characterization is one of the motivations for the [[noncommutative topology]] and [[noncommutative geometry]] programs.

=== C*-enveloping algebra ===
Given a Banach *-algebra ''A'' with an [[approximate identity]], there is a unique (up to C*-isomorphism) C*-algebra '''E'''(''A'') and *-morphism π from ''A'' into '''E'''(''A'') which is [[universal morphism|universal]], that is, every other continuous *-morphism {{nowrap|π ' : ''A'' → ''B''}} factors uniquely through π.  The algebra '''E'''(''A'') is called the '''C*-enveloping algebra''' of the Banach *-algebra ''A''.

Of particular importance is the C*-algebra of a [[locally compact group]] ''G''.  This is defined as the enveloping C*-algebra of the [[group algebra]] of ''G''.  The  C*-algebra of ''G''  provides context for general [[harmonic analysis]] of ''G'' in the case ''G'' is non-abelian.  In particular, the dual of a locally compact group is defined to be the primitive ideal space of the group C*-algebra.  See [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]].

=== Von Neumann algebras ===

[[Von Neumann algebra]]s, known as W* algebras before the 1960s, are a special kind of C*-algebra. They are required to be closed in the [[weak operator topology]], which is weaker than the norm topology.

The [[Sherman–Takeda theorem]] implies that any C*-algebra has a universal enveloping W*-algebra, such that any homomorphism to a W*-algebra factors through it.

== Type for C*-algebras ==
A C*-algebra ''A'' is of type I if and only if for all non-degenerate representations π of ''A'' the von Neumann algebra π(''A'')′′ (that is, the bicommutant of π(''A'')) is a type I von Neumann algebra. In fact it is sufficient to consider only factor representations, i.e. representations π for which π(''A'')′′ is a factor.

A locally compact group is said to be of type I if and only if its [[group C^*-algebra|group C*-algebra]] is type I.

However, if a C*-algebra has non-type I representations, then by results of [[James Glimm]] it also has representations of type II and type III. Thus for C*-algebras and locally compact groups, it is only meaningful to speak of type I and non type I properties.

== C*-algebras and quantum field theory ==
In [[quantum mechanics]], one typically describes a physical system with a C*-algebra ''A'' with unit element; the self-adjoint elements of ''A'' (elements ''x'' with ''x*'' = ''x'') are thought of as the ''observables'', the measurable quantities, of the system. A ''state'' of the system is defined as a positive functional on ''A'' (a '''C'''-linear map φ : ''A'' → '''C''' with φ(''u*u'') ≥ 0 for all ''u'' ∈ ''A'') such that φ(1) = 1. The expected value of the observable ''x'', if the system is in state φ, is then φ(''x'').

This C*-algebra approach is used in the Haag-Kastler axiomatization of [[local quantum field theory]], where every open set of [[Minkowski spacetime]] is associated with a C*-algebra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8580">The '''centered polygonal numbers''' are a class of series of [[figurate number]]s, each formed by a central dot, surrounded by polygonal layers with a constant number of sides. Each side of a polygonal layer contains one dot more than a side in the previous layer, so starting from the second polygonal layer each layer of a centered ''k''-gonal number contains ''k'' more points than the previous layer.

==Examples==

Each sequence is a multiple of the triangular numbers plus 1. For example, the centered square numbers are four times the triangular numbers plus 1.

These series consist of the
*[[centered triangular number]]s  1,4,10,19,31,... {{OEIS|id=A005448}}
*[[centered square number]]s 1,5,13,25,41,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A001844}})
*[[centered pentagonal number]]s 1,6,16,31,51,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A005891}})
*[[centered hexagonal number]]s 1,7,19,37,61,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A003215}})
*[[centered heptagonal number]]s 1,8,22,43,71,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A069099}})
*[[centered octagonal number]]s 1,9,25,49,81,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A016754}})
*[[centered nonagonal number]]s 1,10,28,55,91,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A060544}}, which include all even [[perfect number]]s except 6)
*[[centered decagonal number]]s 1,11,31,61,101,... ({{OEIS2C|id=A062786}})
and so on.

The following diagrams show a few examples of centered polygonal numbers and their geometric construction. Compare these diagrams with the diagrams in [[Polygonal number]].

==Formula==

As can be seen in the above diagrams, the ''n''th centered ''k''-gonal number can be obtained by placing ''k'' copies of the (''n''&amp;minus;1)th triangular number around a central point; therefore, the ''n''th centered ''k''-gonal number can be mathematically represented by

:&lt;math&gt;C_{k,n} =\frac{kn}{2}(n-1)+1.&lt;/math&gt;

Just as is the case with regular polygonal numbers, the first centered ''k''-gonal number is 1. Thus, for any ''k'', 1 is both ''k''-gonal and centered ''k''-gonal. The next number to be both ''k''-gonal and centered ''k''-gonal can be found using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k^2}{2}(k-1)+1&lt;/math&gt;

which tells us that 10 is both triangular and centered triangular, 25 is both square and centered square, etc.

Whereas a [[prime number]] ''p'' cannot be a [[polygonal number]] (except of course that each ''p'' is the second ''p''-agonal number), many centered polygonal numbers are primes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9827">In India, the '''Child Sex Ratio''' is defined as the number of females per thousand males in the age group 0&amp;ndash;6 years in a [[human population]].&lt;ref name="India's female freefall"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/south/06/19/india.ultrasound/index.html|title=India's female freefall|date=June 19, 2001|work=staff and wire reports|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is equal to 1000 x the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[sex ratio]] ([[ratio]] of [[male]]s to [[female]]s in a [[population]]) in the same age group, i.e. under age seven. An imbalance in this age group will extend to older age groups in future years. Currently, the ratio of males to females is generally significantly greater than 1, i.e. there are more boys than girls.

According to the decennial Indian census, the [[sex ratio]] in the 0-6 age group in India went from 104.0 males per 100 females in 1981 to 105.8 in 1991, to 107.8 in 2001, to 108.8 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census2011.co.in/p/glance.php India at Glance - Population Census 2011 - Final] Census of India, Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio is significantly higher in certain [[States and territories of India|states]] such as [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] (118 and 120 respectively per 2011 census).&lt;ref name=tec2011&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-03-31/news/29365989_1_ratio-males-girl-child Census of India 2011: Child sex ratio drops to lowest since Independence] The Economic Times, India&lt;/ref&gt; The child sex ratio has been more prominent for males in India for quite a while, since the 1980s with thirty fewer females to males &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/child-sex-ratio-to-worsen-as-patriarchal-mindset-spreading-gender-expert-bijayalaxmi-nanda/articleshow/63200597.cms|title=Child sex ratio to worsen as patriarchal mindset spreading: Gender expert Bijayalaxmi Nanda|last=IANs|first=|date=7 March 2018|website=Economic Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Likelihood of an Imbalanced Child Sex Ratio ==
Genetically, the odds of having a boy or girl is a 50/50 chance, therefore in a perfect theoretical world the child sex ratio would be split down the middle.  There is a fifty percent chance of having a boy or girl due to the genetics. A women would give one of her X chromosomes, whereas the male would either give the Y chromosome or the X chromosome resulting in a baby boy or baby girl. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081211121835.htm|title=Boy Or Girl? It's In The Father's Genes|last=Newcastle University|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly enough the child sex ratio is not a fifty percent male and fifty percent females, in South Asian countries there is a larger percentage of male children than female children.  Many counties in South Asia have a uneven child sex ratio.  A large city in India, [[Jhajjar]] had almost 15,000 more baby boys than baby girls, that is 128 boys per 100 girls. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20170413/On-the-Cover/Asia-s-gender-imbalance-is-bad-news-for-growth|title=Asia's gender imbalance is bad news for growth|last=Iwamoto|first=Kentaro|date=13 April 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables that Change the Child Sex Ratio ==

=== War Alters Child Sex Ratio ===
Unlike India, the number of males born surpassed the number of females born in England after [[World War I]].  For every 100 girls born, there were two more boys born in the UK.  It was believed the men were producing baby boys to replace the men lost during battle.  Others believed it was genetics, if the males had a family of many brothers it was likely for them to produce more sons than daughters. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-12/why-does-war-breed-more-boys|title=Why Does War Breed More Boys?|last=Allen|first=Laura|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more boys were born in many countries after the world wars. There are about 105 males to 100 females in the United States and Britain in 2008. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sex-Selective Abortions ===
In the [[Asian culture]], families want baby boys, because it is traditional that the boys take care of the parents, while the daughters go marry and leave the family.  These families want to ensure elderly security, therefor they want more boys in the family.  Typically it cost more to have a daughter and they cannot contribute to the family nearly as much as the son can. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These factors cause family to get an abortion because they want the variables that the boys have to offer, and unfortunately it causes the child male to child female sex ratio it be imbalanced.

=== Fertility Rates Change ===
Over the last forty years, India's fertility rate has decreased by more than half. [[Fertility factor (demography)|Fertility factor]] rates are cohort measures that are grouped together by year and are studied within a longer time frame.  Over time, this decrease in fertility would have a factor to the child sex ratio because the overall fertility rate has gone down.  Fewer women having babies will result in fewer babies and the child sex ratio to alter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-fertility-rate-more-than-halves-over-40-years/article19124554.ece|title=India's fertility rate more than halves over 40 years|journal=The Hindu|last=The Hindu|first=|date=22 June 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of skewed ratio ==
The impact of a skewed sex ratio with more male children than females is already being felt in some parts of India and China&lt;ref name="Bare branches, redundant males"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21648715-distorted-sex-ratios-birth-generation-ago-are-changing-marriage-and-damaging-societies-asias|title=Bare branches, redundant males|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-04|date=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is likely to continue to tighten the skewed ratio between genders.:&lt;ref name="India's female freefall" /&gt; 
* When there are fewer women of marriageable age, a significant proportion of men will have to delay their marriage. This is known as the "marriage squeeze." This is when one group, of marriage eligible men, choose brides from a group of women that is fewer in numbers than the males. When the next group of eligibility enters the group there will be leftover men from the prior group added to current, group. If the woman sex ratio of eligible marriage age is significantly smaller than the men, there will be a resulting decline in fertility. &lt;ref name="Bare branches, redundant males" /&gt; 

* This will initially affect younger generations of men in their 20s. These men will not only be in surplus within their cohort (age group), but they will also face competition from a backlog of older, unmarried men, who will still be in the marriage market.
* This problem will not be overcome simply by delaying marriage, due to the cumulative impact of the skewed sex ratio over several generations. Thus a proportion of men will in due course have to forgo marriage altogether. The poorest males will be disproportionately affected by this marriage squeeze. This may cause destabilization and may translate into class-based tensions.&lt;ref name="Sex-ratio imbalance in Asia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/docs/studies/summaries/regional_analysis.pdf|title=Sex-ratio imbalance in Asia - Trends, consequences and policy responses|first=Christophe Z |last=Guilmoto|publisher=United Nation Population Fund|pages=6|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A larger amount of unmarried men can cause havoc in the country.  Relationships and marriage potentially keep these men out of trouble, therefore with the problem of not having enough women for men to marry can cause men to make poor decisions.  Typically the men who are not able to marry are those of middle to low socioeconomic classes who do not have as much education, thus leading to closing themselves off to society and acting in violence behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0602203103| pmid=16938885| pmc=1569153|title = Abnormal sex ratios in human populations: Causes and consequences| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=103| issue=36| pages=13271–13275|year = 2006|last1 = Hesketh|first1 = T.| last2=Xing| first2=Z.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3623">In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford module''' is a [[representation of an algebra|representation]] of a [[Clifford algebra]]. In general a Clifford algebra ''C'' is a [[central simple algebra]] over some [[field extension]] ''L'' of the field ''K'' over which the [[quadratic form]] ''Q'' defining ''C'' is defined.

The [[abstract algebra|abstract theory]] of Clifford modules was founded by a paper of [[Michael Atiyah|M. F. Atiyah]], [[R. Bott]] and [[Arnold S. Shapiro]]. A fundamental result on Clifford modules is that the [[Morita equivalence]] class of a Clifford algebra (the equivalence class of the category of Clifford modules over it) depends only on the signature {{nowrap|''p'' − ''q'' (mod 8)}}. This is an algebraic form of [[Bott periodicity]].

==Matrix representations of real Clifford algebras==
We will need to study ''anticommuting'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ({{nowrap|1=''AB'' = −''BA''}}) because in Clifford algebras orthogonal vectors anticommute
:&lt;math&gt; A \cdot B = \frac{1}{2}( AB + BA ) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

For the real Clifford algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{p,q}&lt;/math&gt;, we need {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} mutually anticommuting matrices, of which ''p'' have +1 as square and ''q'' have −1 as square.
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}
\gamma_a^2 &amp;=&amp; +1 &amp;\mbox{if} &amp;1 \le a \le p \\
\gamma_a^2 &amp;=&amp; -1 &amp;\mbox{if} &amp;p+1 \le a \le p+q\\
\gamma_a \gamma_b &amp;=&amp; -\gamma_b \gamma_a &amp;\mbox{if} &amp;a \ne b. \ \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Such a basis of gamma matrices is not unique. One can always obtain another set of gamma matrices satisfying the same Clifford algebra by means of a similarity transformation.

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{a'} = S \gamma_{a} S^{-1} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' is a non-singular matrix. The sets ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''′&lt;/sub&gt; and ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; belong to the same equivalence class.

==Real Clifford algebra '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;3,1&lt;/sub&gt;==

Developed by [[Ettore Majorana]], this Clifford module enables the construction of a [[Dirac equation|Dirac-like equation]] without complex numbers, and its elements are called Majorana [[spinors]].

The four basis vectors are the three Pauli matrices and a fourth antihermitian matrix.  The [[sign convention|signature]] is (+++−).  For the signatures (+−−−) and (−−−+) often used in physics, 4×4 complex matrices or 8×8 real matrices are needed.

[[Image:Polynomialdeg3.svg|thumb|right|210px|Graph of a cubic function with 3 [[real number|real]] [[root of a function|roots]] (where the curve crosses the horizontal axis—where {{math|''y'' {{=}} 0}}). The case shown has two [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]]. Here the function is {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 6''x'' − 8)/4}}.]]

In [[algebra]], a '''cubic function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{mvar|a}} is nonzero.

Setting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} produces a '''cubic equation''' of the form

:&lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions of this equation are called [[root of a function|roots]] of the [[polynomial]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. If all of the [[coefficients]] {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, and {{mvar|d}} of the cubic equation are [[real number]]s, then it has at least one real root (this is true for all odd [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] polynomials). All of the roots of the cubic equation can be found [[Algebraic function|algebraically]]. (This is also true of [[quadratic function|quadratic]] (second degree) or [[quartic function|quartic]] (fourth degree) equations, but not of higher-degree equations, by the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]].) The roots can also be found [[Trigonometry|trigonometrically]]. Alternatively, [[numerical approximation]]s of the roots can be found using [[root-finding algorithm]]s such as [[Newton's method]].

The coefficients do not need to be complex numbers. Much of what is covered below is valid for coefficients of any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}} or greater than&amp;nbsp;{{math|3}}. The solutions of the cubic equation do not necessarily belong to the same field as the coefficients. For example, some cubic equations with rational coefficients have roots that are non-rational (and even non-real) [[complex number]]s.

==History==

Cubic equations were known to the ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Høyrup|first = Jens|title = Amphora: Festschrift for [[Hans Wussing]] on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday|chapter = The Babylonian Cellar Text BM 85200 + VAT 6599 Retranslation and Analysis|pages = 315–358|publisher = [[Birkhäuser]]|year = 1992|doi = 10.1007/978-3-0348-8599-7_16|isbn = 978-3-0348-8599-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxf"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wae/&gt; [[Babylonia]]n (20th to 16th centuries BC) cuneiform tablets have been found with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Roger|title=The History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CFDaj0WUvM8C&amp;pg=PT63|date=8 November 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-46029-0|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nen"&gt;{{cite book|last= Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lbmXsaTGNKUC&amp;pg=PA306|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonians could have used the tables to solve cubic equations, but no evidence exists to confirm that they did.&lt;ref name=co&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Roger|title=Classical Algebra: Its Nature, Origins, and Uses|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JG-skeT1eWAC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-27797-3|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of [[doubling the cube]] involves the simplest and oldest studied cubic equation, and one for which the ancient Egyptians did not believe a solution existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Guilbeau|1930|p=8}} states that "the Egyptians considered the solution impossible, but the Greeks came nearer to a solution."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century BC, [[Hippocrates of Chios|Hippocrates]] reduced this problem to that of finding two mean proportionals between one line and another of twice its length, but could not solve this with a [[compass and straightedge construction]],&lt;ref name=Guilbeau&gt;{{Harvtxt|Guilbeau|1930|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a task which is now known to be impossible.

In the 7th century, the [[Tang dynasty]] astronomer mathematician [[Wang Xiaotong]] in his mathematical treatise titled [[Jigu Suanjing]] systematically established and solved [[Numerical analysis|numerically]] 25 cubic equations of the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''px''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qx'' {{=}} ''N''}}, 23 of them with {{math|''p'', ''q'' ≠ 0}}, and two of them with {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the 11th century, the Persian poet-mathematician, [[Omar Khayyam]] (1048–1131), made significant progress in the theory of cubic equations. In an early paper, he discovered that a cubic equation can have more than one solution and stated that it cannot be solved using compass and straightedge constructions. He also found a [[#Omar Khayyám's solution|geometric solution]].&lt;ref&gt;A paper of Omar Khayyam, Scripta Math. 26 (1963), pages 323–337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In {{MacTutor|id=Khayyam|title=Omar Khayyam}} one may read ''This problem in turn led Khayyam to solve the cubic equation'' {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 200''x'' {{=}} 20''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2000}} ''and he found a positive root of this cubic by considering the intersection of a rectangular hyperbola and a circle. An approximate numerical solution was then found by interpolation in trigonometric tables''. The ''then'' in the last assertion is erroneous and should, at least, be replaced by ''also''. The geometric construction was perfectly suitable for Omar Khayyam, as it occurs for solving a problem of geometric construction. At the end of his article he says only that, for this geometrical problem, if approximations are sufficient, then a simpler solution may be obtained by consulting [[Generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric tables]]. Textually: ''If the seeker is satisfied with an estimate, it is up to him to look into the table of chords of Almagest, or the table of sines and versed sines of Mothmed Observatory.'' This is followed by a short description of this alternate method (seven lines).&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, the ''Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra'', he wrote a complete classification of cubic equations with general geometric solutions found by means of intersecting [[conic section]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson (1999), [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Khayyam.html Omar Khayyam], [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]], states, "Khayyam himself seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations."&lt;!-- quotation is in MacTutor--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Guilbeau|1930|p=9}} states, "Omar Al Hay of Chorassan, about 1079 AD did most to elevate to a method the solution of the algebraic equations by intersecting conics."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the Indian mathematician Bhaskara II attempted the solution of cubic equations without general success. However, he gave one example of a cubic equation: {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 12''x'' {{=}} 6''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 35}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Datta|first = Bibhutibhushan|author-link = Bibhutibhushan Datta|last2 = Singh|first2 = Avadhesh Narayan|title = [[History of Hindu Mathematics: A Source Book]]|volume = 2|page = 76|chapter = Equation of Higher Degree|publisher = Bharattya Kala Prakashan|publication-place = Delhi, India|year = 2004|isbn = 81-86050-86-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, another [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian]] mathematician, [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] (1135–1213), wrote the ''Al-Muʿādalāt'' (''Treatise on Equations''), which dealt with eight types of cubic equations with positive solutions and five types of cubic equations which may not have positive solutions. He used what would later be known as the "[[Ruffini's rule|Ruffini]]-[[Horner scheme|Horner]] method" to [[Numerical analysis|numerically]] approximate the [[root of a function|root]] of a cubic equation. He also used the concepts of [[maxima and minima]] of curves in order to solve cubic equations which may not have positive solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Tusi_Sharaf|title=Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the importance of the [[discriminant]] of the cubic equation to find algebraic solutions to certain types of cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=J.

In his book ''Flos'', Leonardo de Pisa, also known as [[Fibonacci]] (1170–1250), was able to closely approximate the positive solution to the cubic equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10''x'' {{=}} 20}}. Writing in  [[Babylonian numerals]] he gave the result as 1,22,7,42,33,4,40 (equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;22/60&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7/60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;42/60&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;33/60&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4/60&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40/60&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;), which has a [[relative error]] of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Fibonacci|title=Fibonacci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, the Italian mathematician [[Scipione del Ferro]] (1465–1526) found a method for solving a class of cubic equations, namely those of the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''mx'' {{=}} ''n''}}. In fact, all cubic equations can be reduced to this form if we allow {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} to be negative, but [[negative number]]s were not known to him at that time. Del Ferro kept his achievement secret until just before his death, when he told his student [[Antonio Fiore]] about it.
[[Image:Niccolò Tartaglia.jpg|thumb|160px|Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]]
In 1530, [[Niccolò Tartaglia]] (1500–1557) received two problems in cubic equations from [[Zuanne da Coi]] and announced that he could solve them. He was soon challenged by Fiore, which led to a famous contest between the two. Each contestant had to put up a certain amount of money and to propose a number of problems for his rival to solve. Whoever solved more problems within 30 days would get all the money. Tartaglia received questions in the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''mx'' {{=}} ''n''}}, for which he had worked out a general method. Fiore received questions in the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''mx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''n''}}, which proved to be too difficult for him to solve, and Tartaglia won the contest.

Later, Tartaglia was persuaded by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) to reveal his secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the condition that Cardano would never reveal it and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about Ferro's prior work and published Ferro's method in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'' in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). Cardano's promise with Tartaglia stated that he not publish Tartaglia's work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro's, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano by Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano's student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] (1522–1565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Katz |first=Victor |title=A History of Mathematics |page=220 |location=Boston |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=2004 |isbn=9780321016188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardano noticed that Tartaglia's method sometimes required him to extract the square root of a negative number. He even included a calculation with these [[complex number]]s in ''Ars Magna'', but he did not really understand it. [[Rafael Bombelli]] studied this issue in detail&lt;ref name="Bombelli"/&gt; and is therefore often considered as the discoverer of complex numbers.

[[François Viète]] (1540–1603) independently derived the trigonometric solution for the cubic with three real roots, and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) extended the work of Viète.&lt;ref name=Nickalls/&gt;

==Critical points and inflection point of a cubic function==
{{Cubic_graph_special_points.svg}}
{{see also|Stationary point}}
The [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function are those values of {{mvar|x}} where the slope of the function is zero. The critical points of a cubic function {{math|''f''}} defined by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' + ''d''}}, occur at values of {{math|''x''}} such that the [[derivative]] of the cubic function is zero:
:&lt;math&gt; 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The solutions of that equation are the critical points of the cubic equation and are given, using the [[quadratic formula]], by &lt;!-- Do not change 3ac into 4ac: here the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial are not the same as the coefficients generally used for expressing the quadratic formula --&gt;
:&lt;math style="vertical-align:-70%;"&gt;x_\text{critical}=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-3ac}}{3a}.&lt;/math&gt;
The expression inside of the square root,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_0 = b^2 - 3ac,&lt;/math&gt;
determines what type of critical points the function has. If {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}, then the cubic function has a local maximum and a local minimum. If {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, then the cubic's [[inflection point]] is the only critical point. If {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}, then there are no critical points. In cases where {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0}}, the cubic function is strictly [[monotonic]]. The adjacent diagram is an example of the case where {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}. The other two cases do not have the local maximum or the local minimum but still have an inflection point.

The value of {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} also plays an important role in determining the nature of the roots of the cubic equation and in the calculation of those roots; see [[#General formula|below]].

The inflection point of a function is where that function changes [[concavity]]. The inflection point of our cubic function occurs at:

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{inflection} = -\frac{b}{3a},&lt;/math&gt;

a value that is also important in solving the cubic equation. The cubic function [[#Symmetry|has point symmetry about its inflection point]].

All of the above assumes that the coefficients are real as well as the variable {{mvar|x}}.

==General solution to the cubic equation with real coefficients==

This section is about how to solve the cubic equation using various methods. For details and proofs see [[#Roots: Nature and derivation|below]]. The general cubic equation has the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
with {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}.

===Algebraic solution===
The algebraic solution of the cubic equation can be derived in a number of different ways. (See for example [[Cardano's method]] and [[Vieta's method]] below.)

====The discriminant====

The numbers of real and complex roots are determined by the [[discriminant]] of the cubic equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2.&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that:

* If {{math|Δ &gt; 0}}, then the equation has three distinct real roots.
* If {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}, then the equation has a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]] and all of its roots are real.
* If {{math|Δ &lt; 0}}, then the equation has one real root and two non-real [[complex conjugate]] roots.

====General formula====
The general solution of the cubic equation involves first calculating:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_0 = b^2 - 3ac\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_1 = 2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d,\quad\text{and}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \sqrt[3]{\frac{\Delta_1 \pm \sqrt{{\Delta_1}^2 - 4 {\Delta_0}^3}}2}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

(If the discriminant {{math|Δ}} has already been calculated, then the equality {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −27&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ}} can be used to simplify the calculation of {{math|''C''}}.) There are three possible cube roots implied by the expression, of which at least two are non-real complex numbers; any of these may be chosen when defining {{math|''C''}}. (In addition either sign in front of the square root may be chosen unless {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} in which case the sign must be chosen so that the two terms inside the cube root do not cancel.)

The general formula for one of the roots, in terms of the coefficients, is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x = - \frac{1}{3a}\left(b+C+\frac{\Delta_0}{C}\right)\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that, while this equality is valid for all non-zero {{mvar|C}}, it is not the most convenient form for multiple roots ({{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}), which is covered in the next section. (The case when {{math|''C'' {{=}} 0}} only occurs when both {{math|Δ}} and {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are equal to {{math|0}} and is also covered in the next section.)

The other two roots of the cubic equation can be determined using the same equality, using the other two choices for the cube root in the equation for {{mvar|C}}: denoting the first choice simply as {{mvar|C}}, the others can be written as
{{math|(−{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'') ''C''}} and {{math|(−{{sfrac|1|2}} − {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'') ''C''}}.

The above equality can be expressed compactly including all {{math|3}} roots as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x_k = - \frac{1}{3a}\left(b+\xi^kC+\frac{\Delta_0}{\xi^kC}\right), \qquad k \in \{0,1,2\} \text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}} (which is a cube root of unity). In the case of three real roots, this solution expresses them in terms of non-real complex terms (since any choice of {{mvar|C}} is non-real) whose imaginary components offset each other but [[Casus irreducibilis|cannot be eliminated from the formula]].

This formula for the three roots applies even when the coefficients in the cubic are non-real, although the analysis of the sign of {{math|Δ}} does not hold since {{math|Δ}} is then not real in general.

====Multiple roots, {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}====

If both {{math|Δ}} and {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are equal to {{math|0}}, then the equation has a single root (which is a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|triple root]]):

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{b}{3a}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}} and {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}}, then there are both a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|double root]],
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{9ad-bc}{2\Delta_0},&lt;/math&gt;
and a simple root,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4abc-9a^2d-b^3}{a\Delta_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions===&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Chebyshev cube root]] --&gt;

====Reduction to a depressed cubic====
Dividing {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}} by {{mvar|a}} and substituting {{math|''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}} for {{mvar|x}} we get the equation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;t^3+pt+q=0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p=&amp;\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a^2}, \\
q=&amp;\frac{2b^3-9abc+27a^2d}{27a^3}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The left hand side of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is a [[monic polynomial|monic]] [[trinomial]] called a '''depressed cubic''', because the quadratic term has coefficient 0.

Any formula for the roots of a depressed cubic may be transformed into a formula for the roots of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' by substituting the above values for {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} and using the relation {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}}.

Therefore, only equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is considered in the following.

====Trigonometric solution for three real roots====

When a cubic equation has three real roots, the formulas expressing these roots in terms of radicals involve complex numbers. It has been proved that when none of the three real roots is rational—the ''[[casus irreducibilis]]''— one cannot express the roots in terms of real radicals. Nevertheless, purely real expressions of the solutions may be obtained using [[hypergeometric function]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, I. J., "The cubic equation — a new look at the irreducible case", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, July 2008, 264–268.&lt;/ref&gt; or more elementarily in terms of [[trigonometry|trigonometric functions]], specifically in terms of the [[cosine]] and [[arccosine]] functions.

The formulas which follow, due to [[François Viète]],&lt;ref name=Nickalls&gt;{{Citation |last=Nickalls |first=R. W. D. |title=Viète, Descartes and the cubic equation |url=http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/descartes2006.pdf |journal=[[Mathematical Gazette]] |volume=90 |date=July 2006 |pages=203–208 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are true in general (except when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), and are purely real when the equation has three real roots, but involve complex cosines and arccosines when there is only one real root.

Starting from equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, let us set {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''u'' cos ''θ''}}. The idea is to choose {{mvar|u}} to make equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' coincide with the identity
:&lt;math&gt;4\cos^3\theta-3\cos\theta-\cos(3\theta)=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, choosing &lt;math&gt;u=2\sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and dividing equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' by &lt;math&gt;\frac{u^3}{4}&lt;/math&gt; we get 
:&lt;math&gt;4\cos^3\theta-3\cos\theta-\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Combining with the above identity, we get 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(3\theta)=\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
and thus the roots are&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;{{citation
|title=CRC Standard Mathematical Tables
|first=Samuel
|last=Shelbey
|publisher=CRC Press
|year=1975
|isbn=0-87819-622-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;t_k=2\sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}}\cos\left(\frac{1}{3}\arccos\left(\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}\right)-\frac{2\pi k}{3}\right) \quad \text{for} \quad k=0,1,2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula involves only real terms if {{math|''p'' &lt; 0}} and the argument of the arccosine is between {{math|−1}} and {{math|1}}. The last condition is equivalent to {{math|4''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 27''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 0}}, which itself implies {{math|''p'' &lt; 0}}. Thus the above formula for the roots involves only real terms if and only if the three roots are real.

Denoting by {{math|''C''(&amp;thinsp;''p'', ''q'')}} the above value of {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and using the inequalities {{math|0 ≤ arccos(''u'') ≤ {{pi}}}} for a real number {{mvar|u}} such that {{math|−1 ≤ ''u'' ≤ 1}}, the three roots may also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;t_0=C(p,q),\qquad t_2=-C(p,-q), \qquad t_1=-t_0-t_2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If the three roots are real, we have {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. All these formulas may be straightforwardly transformed into formulas for the roots of the general cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''', using the back substitution described [[#Reduction to a depressed cubic|above]].

====Hyperbolic solution for one real root====

When there is only one real root (and {{math|''p'' ≠ 0}}), it may be similarly represented using [[hyperbolic function]]s, as&lt;ref&gt;These are Formulas (80) and (83) of Weisstein, Eric W. 'Cubic Formula'. From MathWorld&amp;mdash;A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicFormula.html, rewritten for having a coherent notation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, G. C., "The use of hyperbolic cosines in solving cubic polynomials", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 86. November 2002, 473–477.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}t_0&amp;=-2\frac{|q|}{q}\sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}}\cosh\left(\frac{1}{3}\operatorname{arcosh}\left(\frac{-3|q|}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}\right)\right) \quad \text{if } \quad 4p^3+27q^2&gt;0 \text{ and } p&lt;0\,,\\
t_0&amp;=-2\sqrt{\frac{p}{3}}\sinh\left(\frac{1}{3}\operatorname{arsinh}\left(\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{3}{p}}\right)\right) \quad \text{if } \quad p&gt;0\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''p'' ≠ 0}} and the inequalities on the right are not satisfied (the case of three real roots), the formulas remain valid but involve complex quantities.

When {{math|''p'' {{=}} ±3}}, the above values of {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are sometimes called the '''Chebyshev cube root.'''&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz, Milton; Stegun, Irene A., eds. ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'', Dover (1965), chap. 22 p. 773&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the values involving cosines and hyperbolic cosines define, when {{math|''p'' {{=}} −3}}, the same [[analytic function]] denoted {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}}, which is the proper Chebyshev cube root. The value involving hyperbolic sines is similarly denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}}, when {{math|''p'' {{=}} 3}}.

===Factorization===

If a cubic function {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' + ''d'' }} with integer coefficients is [[irreducible polynomial|reducible]] over the rationals, meaning that it can be factored into lower-degree polynomials with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, then it has a rational root, which can be found using the [[rational root test]]: If the root {{math|''r'' {{=}}  {{frac|''m''|''n''}}}} is fully reduced, then {{mvar|m}} is a factor of {{mvar|d}} and {{mvar|n}} is a factor of {{mvar|a}}, so all possible combinations of values for {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} (both positive and negative for one of them) can be checked for whether they are roots of the cubic.

The rational root test may also be used for a cubic equation with rational coefficients: by multiplication by the [[lowest common denominator]] of the coefficients, one gets an equation with integer coefficients which has exactly the same roots.

The rational root test is particularly useful when there are three real roots because the algebraic solution unhelpfully expresses the [[casus irreducibilis|real roots in terms of complex entities]]; if the test yields a rational root, it can be factored out and the remaining roots can be found by solving a quadratic. The rational root test is also helpful in the presence of one real and two complex roots because again, if it yields a rational root, it allows all of the roots to be written without the use of cube roots: If {{mvar|r}} is any root of the cubic, then we may factor out {{math|''x'' − ''r''}} using [[polynomial long division]] to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=\left (x-r\right )\left (ax^2+(b+ar)x+c+br+ar^2 \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
Hence if we know one root, perhaps from the rational root test, we can find the other two by using the [[quadratic formula]] to find the roots of the quadratic {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''b'' + ''ar'')''x'' + ''c'' + ''br'' + ''ar''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, giving
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{-b-ra \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac-2abr-3a^2r^2}}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;
for the other two roots.

===Geometric solutions===

====Omar Khayyám's solution====
[[File:Omar Kayyám - Geometric solution to cubic equation.svg|thumb|right|200px|Omar Khayyám's geometric solution of a cubic equation, for the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 16}}, giving the root {{math|2}}. The intersection of the vertical line on the {{mvar|x}}-axis at the center of the circle is happenstance of the example illustrated.]] 
As shown in this graph, to solve the third-degree equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' {{=}} ''n''}} where {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, [[Omar Khayyám]] constructed the parabola {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''}}, the circle which has as a diameter the [[line segment]] {{math|[0, ''n''/''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]}} on the positive {{mvar|x}}-axis, and a vertical line through the point above the {{mvar|x}}-axis where the circle and parabola intersect. The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection of the vertical line and the {{mvar|x}}-axis.

A simple modern proof of the method is the following: multiplying the equation by {{mvar|x}} and regrouping the terms gives 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^4}{m^2}= x\left(\frac{n}{m^2}-x\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The left-hand side is the value of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the parabola. The equation of the circle being {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''(''x'' − {{sfrac|''n''|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) {{=}} 0}}, the right hand side is the value of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the circle.

====Solution with angle trisector====

A cubic equation with real coefficients can be solved geometrically using [[compass-and-straightedge construction|compass, straightedge]], and an [[angle trisection|angle trisector]] if and only if it has three real roots.&lt;ref name="Gleason"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Andrew Mattei|title=Angle trisection, the heptagon, and the triskaidecagon |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=March 1988|volume=95|issue=3 |pages=185–194|url=http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/1.pdf#3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219180208/http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/7.pdf#3 |accessdate= |doi= 10.2307/2323624|archivedate=2015-12-19 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Thm. 1}}

==Nature of the roots in the case of real coefficients==

===Algebraic nature of the roots===
Every cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''', {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' +''d'' {{=}} 0}}, with real coefficients and {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}, has three solutions (some of which may equal each other if they are real, and two of which may be complex non-real numbers) and at least one real solution {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this last assertion being a consequence of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. If {{math|''x'' − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is factored out of the cubic polynomial, what remains is a quadratic polynomial whose roots {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are roots of the cubic; by the [[quadratic formula]], these roots are either both real (giving a total of three real roots for the cubic) or are [[complex conjugate]]s, in which case the cubic has one real and two non-real roots.

It was explained [[#The discriminant|above]] how to use the sign of the discriminant in order to distinguish between these cases. In fact,
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\bigl(a^2(r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3)\bigr)^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
because a straightforward computation shows that

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \bigl(a^2(r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3)\bigr)^2 \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; a^4\bigl(18(r_1+r_2+r_3)(r_1r_2+r_1r_3+r_2r_3)r_1r_2r_3 \\[4pt]
&amp; {}-4(r_1+r_2+r_3)^3r_1r_2r_3+(r_1+r_2+r_3)^2(r_1r_2+r_1r_3+r_2r_3)^2 \\[4pt]
&amp; {}-4(r_1r_2+r_1r_3+r_2r_3)^3-27(r_1r_2r_3)^2\bigr)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and, by [[Vieta's formulas]], the right hand side of this equality is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;a^4\left(18\frac ba\cdot\frac ca\cdot\frac da-4\left(\frac ba\right)^3\frac da+\left(\frac ba\right)^2\left(\frac ca\right)^2-4\left(\frac ca\right)^3-27\left(\frac da\right)^2\right)=\Delta.&lt;/math&gt;

The equality '''({{EquationNote|3}})''' shows that {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}} if and only if the equation has a multiple root. This cannot possibly be the case when {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are non-real complex numbers, because the fact that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is real assures that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is different from {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and from {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and, on the other hand, the fact that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are non-real and that each of them is the conjugate of the other one assures that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

If {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are non-real, then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3)&amp;=(r_1-r_2)\bigl(r_1-\overline{r_2}\bigr)\bigl(r_2-\overline{r_2}\bigr)\\[4pt]
&amp; =(r_1-r_2)\overline{(r_1-r_2)}2\operatorname{Im}(r_2)i\\[4pt]
&amp; =2|r_1-r_2|^2\operatorname{Im}(r_2)i \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is the product of a non-zero real number by {{mvar|i}}, its square is a real number less than&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}} and therefore {{math|Δ &lt; 0}}. Finally, if the numbers {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are three distinct real numbers, then the product {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a non-zero real number, and so {{math|Δ &gt; 0}}.

===Geometric interpretation of the roots===

====Three real roots====
[[File:Trigonometric interpretation of a cubic equation with three real roots.svg|thumb|right|150px|For the cubic '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' with three real roots, the roots are the projection on the {{mvar|x}}-axis of the vertices {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}}, and {{mvar|C}} of an [[equilateral triangle]]. The center of the triangle has the same [[abscissa]] as the [[inflection point]].]]

Viète's trigonometric expression of the roots in the three-real-roots case lends itself to a geometric interpretation in terms of a circle.&lt;ref name=Nickalls/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;t_k=2\sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}}\cos\left(\frac{1}{3}\arccos\left(\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}\right)-k\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \quad \text{for} \quad k=0,1,2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\arccos\left(\frac{3q}{2p}\sqrt{\frac{-3}{p}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is an angle in the unit circle; taking {{math|{{sfrac|1|3}}}} of that angle corresponds to taking a cube root of a complex number; adding {{math|−''k''{{sfrac|2{{pi}}|3}}}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, 2}} finds the other cube roots; and multiplying the cosines of these resulting angles by &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}}&lt;/math&gt; corrects for scale.

For the non-depressed case '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' (shown in the accompanying graph), the depressed case as indicated previously is obtained by defining {{mvar|t}} such that {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}} so {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''x'' + {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}}. Graphically this corresponds to simply shifting the graph horizontally when changing between the variables {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|x}}, without changing the angle relationships. This shift moves the point of inflection and the centre of the circle onto the {{mvar|y}}-axis. Consequently, the roots of the equation in {{mvar|t}} sum to zero.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the complex conjugate roots are written as {{math|''g'' ± ''hi''}} then {{mvar|g}} is the abscissa (the positive or negative horizontal distance from the origin) of the tangency point of a line that is tangent to the cubic curve and intersects the horizontal axis at the same place as does the cubic curve; and {{mvar|h}} is the square root of the tangent of the angle between this line and the horizontal axis.

=====In the complex plane=====

With one real and two complex roots, the three roots can be represented as points in the complex plane, as can the two roots of the cubic's derivative. There is an interesting geometrical relationship among all these roots.

The points in the complex plane representing the three roots serve as the vertices of an isosceles triangle. (The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis and the other two roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) [[Marden's theorem]] says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of the triangle—the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}} then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do its foci and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the major axis is vertical and its foci, the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle's incircle, its foci coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.

==Derivation of the roots==

===Cardano's method===
The solutions can be found with the following method due to [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]], published by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1545 in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]''. 
This method applies to the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. We introduce two variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} linked by the condition {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}} and substitute this in the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', giving
:&lt;math&gt;u^3 + v^3 + (3uv + p)(u+v)+ q= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

At this point Cardano imposed a second condition for the variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}: {{math|3''uv'' + ''p'' {{=}} 0}}. As the first parenthesis vanishes in previous equality, we get {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −''q''}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}}}}. The combination of these two equations leads to a quadratic equation (since they are the sum and the product of {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Thus {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''qz'' − {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} {{=}} 0}}. Cardano assumed that {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} ≥ 0}}. He suggested that his readers consult another of his books, ''De Regula Aliza'', which was published only in 1570, for the case in which {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} &lt; 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Confalonieri|first = Sara|journal = [[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|title = The ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'' in Cardano’s ''Ars Magna'' and ''De Regula Aliza''|volume = 69|issue = 3|year = 2015|doi = 10.1007/s00407-015-0149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solving this quadratic equation and using the fact that {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} may be exchanged, we find
:&lt;math&gt; u^3=-{q\over 2} + \sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\,\, v^3=-{q\over 2} - \sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, {{math|''u'' + ''v''}} is equal to:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;t=\sqrt[3]{-{q\over 2}+\sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}} +\sqrt[3]{-{q\over 2}-\sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Cardano's formula}}}}

In his book ''L'Algebra'', published in 1572, [[Rafael Bombelli]] explained that what was done above still works, with a small difference, when {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} &lt; 0}}, as long as one knows how to use complex numbers.&lt;ref name="Bombelli"&gt;{{Citation|last2 = Mazur|first2 = Barry|author2-link = Barry Mazur|last = La Nave|first = Federica|journal = [[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]|title = Reading Bombelli|volume = 24|issue = 1|pages = 12–21|year = 2002|doi = 10.1007/BF03025306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small difference is due to the fact that a non-zero complex number has {{math|3}} cube roots and not just one. Therefore, although the equality {{math|''uv'' {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}} implies that {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}}}}, this is ''not'' an equivalence. So, we do not simply take ''any'' cube root of
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-\frac q2+\sqrt{\frac{q^2}4+\frac{p^3}{27}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
and add it to ''any'' cube root of
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-\frac q2-\sqrt{\frac{q^2}4+\frac{p^3}{27}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

(unless one of them is {{math|0}}); besides, that would provide {{math|9}} solutions to equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})'''. Instead, since we want to have {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}, {{EquationNote|Cardano's formula}} means the sum of ''a'' cube root {{mvar|u}} of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' with {{math|−{{sfrac|''p''|3''u''}}}} (or, if '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' is equal to&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}, the sum of ''a'' cube root {{mvar|v}} of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' with {{math|−{{sfrac|''p''|3''v''}}}}). This only fails if ''both'' numbers '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' are equal to&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}, in which case {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}} and Cardano's formula simply means {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{radic|0|3}} + {{radic|0|3}} ({{=}} 0)}}, which is compatible with the fact that, since {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' simplifies to {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

Actually, it is not necessary to compute the three cube roots of '''({{EquationNote|4}})'''. To see why, let {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}}. Then {{math|''ξ''}} and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}} ({{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} − {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'' {{=}} ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are the non-real cube roots of {{math|1}}. If {{mvar|u}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''', and {{mvar|v}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' such that {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}, then the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}, since, in each case, we have the sum of a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' with a cube root '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and moreover the product of these two roots is, in each case, equal to&amp;nbsp;{{math|−&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}.

Note that {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} and that {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''ξ''}}. Thus Cardano's formula, written unambiguously to give the three roots, is

:&lt;math&gt; t_k = \xi^k \sqrt[3]{-{q\over 2}+ \sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}} + \xi^{2k} \sqrt[3]{-{q\over 2}- \sqrt{{q^{2}\over 4}+{p^{3}\over 27}}}, \quad k=0,1,2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the cube roots expressed as radicals are defined to be any pair of cube roots whose product is {{math|−&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} &lt; 0}}, this is the same thing as requiring that the cube roots be complex conjugates, while if {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} ≥ 0}}, the real cube roots can be chosen.

Cardano's formula, interpreted in this way, is equivalent to the [[#General formula|general solution given earlier]] when the coefficient of the quadratic term is {{math|0}}.

We will examine certain particular cases. Before that, it is convenient to note that, if {{mvar|u}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''', if {{mvar|v}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''', and if both numbers {{mvar|p}} and {{math|''u''×''v''}} are real, then it is automatically true that {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. This is so because
:{{math|(''u''×''v'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} − ({{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}}) {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} {{=}} (−&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}})&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
Let us now see the particular cases.
* If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real numbers and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} &gt; 0}}, let {{mvar|u}} be the real cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and let {{mvar|v}} be the real cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})'''. Then {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}, because {{math|''u''×''v''}} is real. So, the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v''}} (which is a real number), {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}. Each of the second and the third roots is the [[Complex conjugate|conjugate]] of the other one. This can be used to prove that they are non-real. Indeed, two real numbers are the conjugates of each other if and only if they are the same real number. But

::{{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} {{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' ⇔ (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})(''u'' − ''v'') {{=}} 0}},

:and this last assertion is false, since {{math|''ξ'' ≠ {{overline|''ξ''}}}} and {{math|''u'' ≠ ''v''}} (because {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are real numbers whose cubes are distinct).
* If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real numbers and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} &lt; 0}}, then the numbers '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' are complex numbers each of which is the conjugate of the other one. Let {{mvar|u}} be a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and let {{mvar|v}} be the conjugate of {{mvar|u}}. Then {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the conjugate of {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and this proves that {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|5}})'''. So, again, since {{math|''u''×''v''}} is real we have {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}, and therefore the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + {{overline|''u''}}}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξu''}}}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξ''{{overline|''u''}}}}. In this case all roots are real, since each one of them is the sum of a complex number with its conjugate.
* If {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0}}, then the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are the cube roots of {{math|−''q''}}. This is compatible with Cardano's formula, because one of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' is {{math|0}} and the other is {{math|−''q''}}.
* If {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, then the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|0}} and the square roots of {{math|−''p''}}. Again, this is compatible with Cardano's formula, because if {{mvar|u}} is a square root of  {{math|{{frac|''p''|3}}}}, then {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a square root of {{math|{{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}}}}, and this square root is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''', since we are assuming that {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}. If {{math|''v'' {{=}} −''u''}} is the other square root of  {{math|{{frac|''p''|3}}}} then, by the same reason, {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and furthermore if {{mvar|u}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' then {{mvar|v}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and vice versa. Because {{math|''v'' {{=}} −''u''}} we have {{math|''u'' + ''v''{{=}} 0}}. On the other hand, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})×''u''}} and so {{math|(''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} (−3)×{{sfrac|''p''|3}} {{=}} −''p''}}, which means that {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}} is a square root of {{math|−''p''}}. Finally, {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' {{=}} ({{overline|''ξ''}} − ''ξ'')×''u'' {{=}} −(''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'')}}, and so it must be the other square root of {{math|−''p''}}.
* If {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} {{=}} 0}} (but {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are not {{math|0}}), then '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' has a simple root, which is {{math|{{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}}, and a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|double root]], which is {{math|−{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}. Again, this is compatible with Cardano's formula. To see why, note that asserting that {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} {{=}} 0}} is equivalent to asserting that {{math|{{sfrac|27''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} −1}}. If {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}, then {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|27''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|8''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} −{{sfrac|''q''|2}}}} and {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} {{sfrac|27''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} −''p''}}. Thus, Cardano's formula says that the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} 2''u'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} (''ξ'' + {{overline|''ξ''}})×''u'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' {{=}} ({{overline|''ξ''}} + ''ξ'')×''u'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}.

In this last case (that is, when {{math|{{sfrac|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27}} {{=}} 0}} but {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are not {{math|0}}), although the computations made above do suggest that {{math|{{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}} is a simple root of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' whereas {{math|−{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}} is a double root (having been obtained in two different ways), they don't really prove it. However, this can be easily confirmed. Just note that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\left(x-\frac{3q}p\right)\left(x+\frac{3q}{2p}\right)^2&amp;=x^3-\frac{27q^2}{4p^2}x-\frac{27q^3}{4p^3}\\ &amp;=x^3-\frac{27q^2}{4p^3}px-\frac{27q^2}{4p^3}q\\ &amp;=x^3+px+q\text{,}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
since {{math|{{sfrac|27''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|4''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} −1}}.

The numbers provided by Cardano's formula are solutions of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', but there might be other solutions besides these. However, this does not occur. Let {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} be numbers such that {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −''q''}} and {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}. In order to see that {{math|''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}} are the only roots of the polynomial {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q''}}, it is enough to notice that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\bigl(t-\bigl(u+v\bigr)\bigr)\bigl(t-\bigl(\xi u+\overline\xi v\bigr)\bigr)\bigl(t-\bigl(\overline\xi u+\xi v\bigr)\bigr)&amp;=
t^3-3uvt-u^3-v^3\\ &amp;=t^3+pt+q\text{.}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}} or {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}.

=== Vieta's substitution ===
Starting from the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, we make the substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}}, known as [[François Viète|Vieta's]] substitution. This results in the equation

:&lt;math&gt;w^3+q-\frac{p^3}{27w^3}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''w''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it becomes a [[sextic equation]] in {{mvar|w}}, which is in fact a quadratic equation in {{math|''w''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;w^6+qw^3-\frac{p^3}{27}=0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

The [[quadratic formula]] allows equation '''({{EquationNote|6}})''' to be solved for {{math|''w''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the three [[cube root]]s of one of the solutions in {{math|''w''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, and {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. Another way of expressing the roots is to take {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}}; then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, {{math|''ξw''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''ξw''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, and, {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|''p''|3''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. This method only fails when both roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|6}})''' are equal to {{math|0}}, but this only happens when {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, in which case the only solution of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is {{math|0}}.

Actually, the substitution originally used by Vieta (in a text published posthumously in 1615) was {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}} − ''w''}}, but it leads to similar computations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = van der Waerden|first = Bartel Leenert|author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|title = A History of Algebra: From [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|al-Khwārizmī]] to [[Emmy Noether]]|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year = 1985|chapter = From Viète to Descartes|isbn = 3-540-13610-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, Vieta introduced a new variable {{mvar|w}} and he imposed the condition {{math|''w''(''t'' + ''w'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}.

As far as formulae are concerned, Vieta's approach leads to the same result as [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]]. However, it is theoretically simpler, for two reasons:
* Each root of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is expressed from the start by an expression that involves a single cube root. Therefore, there is no ambiguity as in {{EquationNote|Cardano's formula}}.
* It is nearly trivial that there are no other roots besides the ones obtained by this method. This follows from the fact that any complex number can be written as {{math|''w'' − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}} for some other complex number&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|w}}.

===Lagrange's method===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Lagrange resolvents]] and [[Lagrange resolvent]] (singular) --&gt;

In his paper ''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations'' ("Thoughts on the algebraic solving of equations"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations|title = Œuvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205–421|volume = III}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] introduced a new method to solve equations of low degree.

This method works well for cubic and [[quartic equations]], but Lagrange did not succeed in applying it to a [[quintic equation]], because it requires solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six.&lt;ref name="efei"&gt;{{citation

Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.&lt;ref name="laz" /&gt;

In the case of cubic equations, Lagrange's method gives the same solution as Cardano's. By drawing attention to a geometrical problem that involves two cubes of different size Cardano explains in his book ''Ars Magna'' how he arrived at the idea of considering the unknown of the cubic equation as a sum of two other quantities. Lagrange's method may also be applied directly to the general cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''', {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}}, without using the reduction to the depressed cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. Nevertheless, the computation is much easier with this reduced equation.

Suppose that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the roots of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' or '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', and define {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}} (a complex cube root of {{math|1}}, i.e. a [[root of unity|primitive third root of unity]]) which satisfies the relation {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ξ'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}. We now set
:&lt;math&gt;s_0 = x_0 + x_1 + x_2,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_1 = x_0 + \xi x_1 + \xi^2 x_2,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_2 = x_0 + \xi^2 x_1 + \xi x_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
This is the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of the roots: observe that while the coefficients of the polynomial are symmetric in the roots, in this formula an ''order'' has been chosen on the roots, so these are not symmetric in the roots. The roots may then be recovered from the three {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by inverting the above linear transformation via the inverse discrete Fourier transform, giving
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \tfrac13(s_0 + s_1 + s_2),\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = \tfrac13(s_0 + \xi^2 s_1 + \xi s_2),\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_2 = \tfrac13(s_0 + \xi s_1 + \xi ^2 s_2).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal, by [[Vieta's formulas]], to {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} in case of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' and to {{math|0}} in case of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', so we only need to seek values for the other two.

The polynomials {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are not [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots: {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is invariant, while the two non-trivial [[cyclic permutation]]s of the roots send {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ξ''&amp;thinsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ξ''&amp;thinsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (depending on which permutation), while transposing {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} switches {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; other transpositions switch these sums and multiply them by a power of {{math|''ξ''}}.

Thus {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are left invariant by the cyclic permutations of the roots, which multiply them by {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}. Also {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} are left invariant by the transposition of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} which exchanges {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As the [[permutation group]] {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the roots is generated by these permutations, it follows that {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots and may thus be written as polynomials in the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s and thus as [[rational function]]s of the coefficients of the equation. Let {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''A''}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''}} in these expressions, which will be explicitly computed below.

We have that {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''Az'' + ''B''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}. Thus the resolution of the equation may be finished exactly as described for Cardano's method, with {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in place of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}.

====Computation of ''A'' and ''B''====

Setting {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the elementary symmetric polynomials, we have, using that {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}:
:&lt;math&gt;s_1^3=x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3+3\xi (x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0)+3\xi^2 (x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2) +6x_0x_1x_2\,. &lt;/math&gt;
The expression for {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the same with {{math|''ξ''}} and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} exchanged. Thus, using {{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ξ'' {{=}} −1}} we get
:&lt;math&gt;
A=s_1^3+s_2^3=2(x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3)-3(x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0+x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2)+12x_0x_1x_2\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
and a straightforward computation gives 
:&lt;math&gt;
A=s_1^3+s_2^3=2E_1^3-9E_1E_2+27E_3\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we have 
:&lt;math&gt;
B=s_1s_2=x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2+(\xi+\xi^2)(x_0x_1+x_1x_2+x_2x_0)=E_1^2-3E_2\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

When solving equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' we have {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −{{sfrac|''d''|''a''}}}}. With equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', we have {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''p''}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''q''}} and thus {{math|''A'' {{=}} −27''q''}} and {{math|''B'' {{=}} −3''p''}}.

Note that with equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', we have {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −3''p''}}, while in Cardano's method we have set {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}} and {{math|''uv'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|3}}''p''}}. Thus we have, up to the exchange of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 3''u''}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 3''v''}} . In other words, in this case, Cardano's method and Lagrange's method compute exactly the same things, up to a factor of three in the auxiliary variables, the main difference being that Lagrange's method explains why these auxiliary variables appear in the problem.

==General solution to the cubic equation with arbitrary coefficients==

If we are dealing with a cubic equation whose coefficients belong to some field {{mvar|k}} (whose [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is either {{math|0}} or greater than {{math|3}}), then what was [[#Algebraic solution|done above algebraically]] still works, with one exception: the results concerning the [[#The discriminant|sign of the discriminant]], since they make no sense for general fields, although the fact that the equation has a multiple root if and only if {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}} is still true (and for the same reason). In this more general case, we work with an [[field extension|extension]] {{mvar|K}} of {{mvar|k}} in which every non-zero element has two square roots and three cube roots. For instance, if {{math|''k'' {{=}} '''Q'''}}, we can take {{math|''K'' {{=}} {{overline|'''Q'''}}}}, the [[Algebraic number#The field of algebraic numbers|field of algebraic numbers]].

In particular, all that was done above algebraically still works if {{math|''k'' {{=}} ''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}}. Therefore, every cubic equation with complex coefficients has some complex root, which is a particular case of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].

In this general context, the formulae for roots [[#Multiple roots.2C .CE.94 .3D 0|in the case in which {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}]] show that these roots also belong to the field {{mvar|k}}.

In a field {{mvar|k}} whose [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is either {{math|2}} or {{math|3}}, this approach does not work because then the formulae for the roots became meaningless, since they involve division by {{math|2}} and {{math|3}}.

==Galois groups of irreducible cubics==

The [[Galois theory#Permutation group approach to Galois theory|Galois group]] of an irreducible [[separable polynomial]] of degree {{mvar|n}} is a [[Symmetric group#Transitive subgroups|transitive subgroup]] of [[Symmetric group|{{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}]]. In particular, the Galois group of an irreducible separable cubic is a transitive subgroup of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and there are only two such subgroups: {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and [[Alternating group|{{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]. There is a simple way of determining the Galois group of a concrete irreducible cubic {{math|''f''(''x'')}} over a field {{mvar|k}}: it is {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} if the discriminant of the cubic is the square of an element of {{mvar|k}} and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} otherwise. Indeed, if {{math|Δ}} is not the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}, then {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}]}} is an extension of [[Degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|2}} of {{mvar|k}}. On the other hand, if {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the roots of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, then, since the equality '''({{EquationNote|3}})''' holds, that is, since {{math|Δ {{=}} (''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}] ⊂ ''k''[''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]}}, and so, by the [[Degree of a field extension#The multiplicativity formula for degrees|multiplicativity formula for degrees]], the degree of {{math|''k''[''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]}} over {{mvar|k}} (that is, the order of the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}) must be a multiple of the degree of {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}]}}, which is {{math|2}}. Therefore, it must be an even number, and so the Galois group can only be {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

On the other hand, if {{math|Δ}} ''is'' the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}, then, again by the equality '''({{EquationNote|3}})''', we have {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ ''k''}}. Therefore, if&amp;nbsp;{{math|''σ''}} belongs to the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, then {{math|''σ''}} maps {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} into itself. But then {{math|''σ''}} cannot act on the set {{math|{''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}} as the [[Symmetric group#Transpositions|transposition]] that exchanges {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and leaves {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixed, because then {{math|''σ''}} would map {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} into {{math|−(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. So, in this case, the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is not {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and therefore it must be {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

It is clear from this criterion that, if we are working over the field {{math|'''Q'''}}, the Galois group of most irreducible cubic polynomials is {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. An example of an irreducible cubic polynomial with rational coefficients whose Galois group is {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' − 1}}, whose discriminant is {{math|81 {{=}} 9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The polynomial {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is used in the [[Angle trisection#Proof of impossibility|standard proof of the impossibility]] of trisecting arbitrary angles using straightedge and compass only.

==Collinearities==

They are collinear too.]]

The tangent lines to a cubic at three [[collinear points]] intercept the cubic again at collinear points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Whitworth|first = William Allen|author-link = William Allen Whitworth|title = Trilinear Coordinates and Other Methods of Modern Analytical Geometry of Two Dimensions|publisher = Deighton, Bell, and Co.|year = 1866|place = Cambridge|page = 425|url = https://archive.org/details/trilinearcoordin00whit|chapter = Equations of the third degree|accessdate = June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as follows. If the cubic is defined by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cx'' + ''d''}} and if {{mvar|α}} is a real number, then the tangent to the graph of {{mvar|f}} at the point {{math|(''α'', ''f''(''α''))}} is the line

:{{math|{(''x'', ''f''(''α'') + (''x'' − ''α'')''f''&amp;thinsp;′(''α'')) : ''x'' ∈ '''R'''}}}.

So, the intersection point between this line and the graph of {{mvar|f}} can be obtained solving the equation {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''α'') + (''x'' − ''α'')''f''&amp;thinsp;′(''α'')}}. This is a cubic equation, but it is clear that {{mvar|α}} is a root, and in fact a double root, since the line is tangent to the graph. The remaining root is {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}} − 2''α''}}. So, the other intersection point between the tangent line and the graph of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|f}} is the point

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(-\frac ba-2\alpha,f\left(-\frac ba-2\alpha\right)\right) \\[3pt]
= {} &amp; \left(-\frac ba-2\alpha,-8a\alpha^3-8b\alpha^2-2\left( \frac{b^2}a + c\right) \alpha-\frac{bc}a+d\right) \\[3pt]
= {} &amp; \left(-\frac ba-2\alpha,-\frac{bc}a+9d+\left(6c-2\frac{b^2}a\right)\alpha-8f(\alpha)\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if {{mvar|P}} is a point of the graph of {{mvar|f}}, the other intersection point between the tangent line at {{mvar|P}} and the graph is the point {{math|''A''(''P'')}}, where {{mvar|A}} is the map defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A : \mathbb{R}^2 &amp; \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\\[4pt]
(x,y) &amp; \mapsto \left(-\frac ba-2x,-\frac{bc}a+9d+\left(6c-2\frac{b^2}a\right)x-8y\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{mvar|A}} is an [[Affine transformation|affine map]], if {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are collinear, then so are the points {{math|''A''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|''A''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|''A''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

==Symmetry==

The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a cubic function has {{math|180°}} rotational or point symmetry about its inflection point. The inflection point of a general cubic polynomial,
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d&lt;/math&gt;
occurs at a point {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;))}} such that {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;′′(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 0}}. Since {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;′′(''x'') {{=}} 6''ax'' + 2''b''}}, the inflection point is {{math|(−{{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}, {{sfrac|2''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|27''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} − {{sfrac|''bc''|3''a''}} + ''d''&amp;thinsp;)}}. Translating the function so that the inflection point is at the origin, one obtains the function {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} defined by:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_T(x) &amp;= f\left(x + x_0\right) - y_0 \\
       &amp;= a\left(x - \frac{b}{3a} \right)^3 +\ b\left(x-\frac{b}{3a}\right)^2 +\ c\left(x-\frac{b}{3a}\right) +\ d\ -\left(\frac{2b^3}{27a^2} - \frac{bc}{3a} +d\right)\\
       &amp;= ax^3 + \left(c-\frac{b^2}{3a}\right)x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
As all terms are odd powers of {{mvar|x}}, {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;(−''x'') {{=}} −''f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;(''x'')}} proving that all cubic functions are rotationally symmetrical about their inflection points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = de Villiers|first = Michael|title=All cubic polynomials are point symmetric|journal = Learning &amp; Teaching Mathematics|volume = 1|pages = 12–15|year = 2004|url=http://educadores.diaadia.pr.gov.br/arquivos/File/2010/artigos_teses/EDUCACAO_E_TECNOLOGIA/CUBICS.PDF|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Cubic equations arise in various other contexts.

[[Marden's theorem]] states that the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of any triangle can be found by using the cubic function whose roots are the coordinates in the [[complex plane]] of the triangle's three vertices. The roots of the [[first derivative]] of this cubic are the complex coordinates of those foci.

The [[area]] of a regular [[heptagon]] can be expressed in terms of the roots of a cubic. Further, the ratios of the long diagonal to the side, the side to the short diagonal, and the negative of the short diagonal to the long diagonal all satisfy a particular cubic equation. In addition, the ratio of the [[inradius]] to the [[circumradius]] of a [[heptagonal triangle]] is one of the solutions of a cubic equation. The values of trigonometric functions of angles related to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/7&lt;/math&gt; satisfy cubic equations.

Given the cosine (or other trigonometric function) of an arbitrary angle, the cosine of [[angle trisection|one-third of that angle]] is one of the roots of a cubic.

The solution of the general [[quartic equation]] relies on the solution of its [[resolvent cubic]].

The [[eigenvalue]]s of a 3×3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] are the roots of a cubic polynomial which is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix.

The characteristic equation of a third-order linear [[difference equation]] or [[linear differential equation|differential equation]] is a cubic equation.

In [[analytical chemistry]], the [[Charlot equation]], which can be used to find the pH of [[buffer solution]]s, can be solved using a cubic equation.

In [[chemical engineering]] and [[thermodynamics]], cubic equations of state are used to model the [[PVT (physics)|PVT]] (pressure, volume, temperature) behavior of substances.

[[kinematics|Kinematic equations]] involving changing [[jerk (physics)|rates of acceleration]] are cubic.

In [[mathematics]], in [[linear algebra]], a '''cyclic subspace''' is a certain special [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of a [[dimension|finite-dimensional]] [[vector space]] associated with a vector in the vector space and a [[linear map|linear transformation]] of the vector space. The cyclic subspace associated with a vector ''v'' in a vector space ''V'' and a linear transformation ''T'' of ''V'' is called the ''' ''T''-cyclic subspace generated by ''v'''''. The concept of a cyclic subspace is a basic component in the formulation of the cyclic decomposition theorem in linear algebra.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;T:V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear transformation of a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; be a vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-cyclic subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; generated by the set of vectors &lt;math&gt;\{ v, T(v), T^2(v), \ldots, T^r(v), \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;. This subspace is denoted by &lt;math&gt; Z(v;T)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;V=Z(v;T)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''cyclic vector''' for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite book

There is another equivalent definition of cyclic spaces. Let &lt;math&gt;T:V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear transformation of a finite dimensional vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; be a vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all vectors of the form &lt;math&gt;g(T)v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polynomial]] in the [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;F[x]&lt;/math&gt; of all polynomials in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, is the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-cyclic subspace generated by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt;

===Examples===

# For any vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and any linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-cyclic subspace generated by the zero vector is the zero-subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. 
# If &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity operator]] then every &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-cyclic subspace is one-dimensional. 
# &lt;math&gt;Z(v;T)&lt;/math&gt; is one-dimensional if and only if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|characteristic vector]] (eigenvector) of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be the two-dimensional vector space and let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the linear operator on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; represented by the matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; relative to the standard ordered basis of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;v=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; Tv = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad T^2v=0,  \ldots, T^rv=0, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\{ v, T(v), T^2(v), \ldots, T^r(v), \ldots\} = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;Z(v;T)=V&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a cyclic vector for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

==Companion matrix==

Let &lt;math&gt;T:V\rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt; be a linear transformation of a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic vector for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Then the vectors 

::&lt;math&gt;B=\{v_1=v, v_2=Tv, v_3=T^2v, \ldots v_n = T^{n-1}v\}&lt;/math&gt; 

form an ordered basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Let the characteristic polynomial for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be  

::&lt;math&gt; p(x)=c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+\cdots + c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+x^n&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then 

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Tv_1 &amp; = v_2\\
Tv_2 &amp; = v_3\\
Tv_3 &amp; = v_4\\
\vdots &amp; \\
Tv_{n-1} &amp; = v_n\\
Tv_n &amp;= -c_0v_1 -c_1v_2 - \cdots c_{n-1}v_n
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, relative to the ordered basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the matrix 

::&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -c_0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; -c_1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots  &amp; 0 &amp; -c_2 \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 1 &amp; -c_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix is called the ''companion matrix'' of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt;

Informally, a '''definable real number''' is a [[real number]] that can be uniquely specified by its description.  The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a [[formal language]]. For example, the positive square root of 2, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2  = 2&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.

Different choices of a formal language or its interpretation can give rise to different notions of definability.  Specific varieties of definable numbers include the  [[constructible number]]s of geometry, the [[algebraic numbers]], and the [[computable number]]s.

== Constructible numbers ==
One way of specifying a real number uses geometric techniques. A real number ''r'' is a [[constructible number]] if there is a method to construct a line segment of length ''r'' using a compass and straightedge, beginning with a fixed line segment of length 1.

Each positive integer, and each positive rational number, is constructible. The positive square root of 2 is constructible.  However, the cube root of 2 is not constructible; this is related to the impossibility of [[doubling the cube]].

== Algebraic numbers ==
[[File:Algebraicszoom.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers on the [[complex plane]] colored by degree (red=1, green=2, blue=3, yellow=4)]]

A real number ''r'' is called an [[algebraic number]] if there is a polynomial ''p''(''x''), with only integer coefficients, so that ''r'' is a root of ''p'', that is, ''p''(''r'')=0.  
Each algebraic number can be defined individually using the order relation on the reals. For example, if a polynomial ''q''(''x'') has 5 roots, the third one can be defined as the unique ''r'' such that ''q''(''r'') = 0 and such that there are two distinct numbers less than ''r'' for which ''q'' is zero.

All rational numbers are algebraic, and all constructible numbers are algebraic.  There are numbers such as the cube root of 2 which are algebraic but not constructible.

The algebraic numbers form a [[field extension|subfield]] of the real numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are algebraic numbers and, moreover, if ''a'' and ''b'' are algebraic numbers, then so are ''a''+''b'', ''a''−''b'', ''ab'' and, if ''b'' is nonzero, ''a''/''b''.

The algebraic numbers also have the property, which goes beyond being a subfield of the reals, that for each positive integer ''n'' and each algebraic number ''a'', all of the ''n''th roots of ''a'' that are real numbers are also algebraic.

There are only [[Countable set|countably many]] algebraic numbers, but there are uncountably many real numbers, so in the sense of [[cardinality]] most real numbers are not algebraic.  This [[nonconstructive proof]] that not all real numbers are algebraic was first published by
Georg Cantor in his 1874 paper "[[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers]]".

Non-algebraic numbers are called [[transcendental numbers]]. Specific examples of transcendental numbers include &amp;pi; and [[Euler's number]] ''e''.

== Computable real numbers ==
A real number is a [[computable number]] if there is an algorithm that, given a natural number ''n'', produces a decimal expansion for the number accurate to ''n'' decimal places.  This notion was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936.

The computable numbers include the algebraic numbers along with many transcendental numbers including &amp;pi; and&amp;nbsp;''e''. Like the algebraic numbers, the computable numbers also form a subfield of the real numbers, and the positive computable numbers are closed under taking ''n''th roots for each positive&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Not all real numbers are computable. The entire set of computable numbers is countable, so most reals are not computable. Specific examples of noncomputable real numbers include the limits of [[Specker sequence]]s, and [[algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random real numbers]] such as [[Chaitin's constant|Chaitin's &amp;Omega; numbers]].

== Definability in arithmetic ==
Another notion of definability comes from the formal theories of arithmetic, such as [[Peano arithmetic]]. The [[Peano arithmetic|language of arithmetic]] has symbols for 0, 1, the successor operation, addition, and multiplication, intended to be interpreted in the usual way over the [[natural number]]s. Because no variables of this language range over the [[real number]]s, a different sort of definability is needed to refer to real numbers. A real number ''a'' is ''definable in the language of arithmetic'' (or ''[[arithmetical hierarchy|arithmetical]]'') if its [[Dedekind cut]] can be defined as a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] in that language; that is, if there is a first-order formula ''φ'' in the language of arithmetic, with three free variables, such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall m \, \forall n \, \forall p \left (\varphi(n,m,p)\iff\frac{(-1)^p\cdot n}{m+1}&lt;a \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''m'', ''n'', and ''p'' range over nonnegative integers.

The [[second-order arithmetic|second-order language of arithmetic]] is the same as the first-order language, except that variables and quantifiers are allowed to range over sets of naturals. A real that is second-order definable in the language of arithmetic is called ''[[analytical hierarchy|analytical]]''.

Every computable real number is arithmetical, and the arithmetical numbers form a subfield of the reals, as do the analytical numbers. Every arithmetical number is analytical, but not every analytical number is arithmetical. Because there are only countably many analytical numbers, most real numbers are not analytical, and thus also not arithmetical.

Every computable number is arithmetical, but not every arithmetical number is computable. For example, the limit of a Specker sequence is an arithmetical number that is not computable.

The definitions of arithmetical and analytical reals can be stratified into the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]]. In general, a real is computable if and only if its Dedekind cut is at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy, one of the lowest levels.  Similarly, the reals with arithmetical Dedekind cuts form the lowest level of the analytical hierarchy.

== Definability in models of ZFC ==
A real number ''a'' is '''first-order definable in the language of set theory, without parameters''', if there is a formula ''φ'' in the language of [[set theory]], with one [[free variable]], such that ''a'' is the unique real number such that ''φ''(''a'') holds (see {{harvnb|Kunen|1980|p=153}}).  This notion cannot be expressed as a formula in the language of set theory.

All analytical numbers, and in particular all computable numbers, are definable in the language of set theory. Thus the real numbers definable in the language of set theory include all familiar real numbers such as [[Zero|0]], [[One|1]], [[Pi|&amp;pi;]], [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']], et cetera, along with all algebraic numbers. Assuming that they form a set in the model, the real numbers definable in the language of set theory over a particular model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] form a field. 
 
Each set [[Model theory|model]] ''M'' of ZFC set theory that contains uncountably many real numbers must contain real numbers that are not definable within ''M'' (without parameters). This follows from the fact that there are only countably many formulas, and so only countably many elements of ''M'' can be definable over ''M''.  Thus, if ''M'' has uncountably many real numbers, we can prove from "outside" ''M'' that not every real number of ''M'' is definable over ''M''.  
 
This argument becomes more problematic if it is applied to class models of ZFC, such as the [[von Neumann universe]] {{harv|Hamkins|2010}}. The argument that applies to set models cannot be directly generalized to class models in ZFC because the property "the real number ''x'' is definable over the class model ''N''" cannot be expressed as a formula of ZFC. Similarly, the question whether the von Neumann universe contains real numbers that it cannot define cannot be expressed as a sentence in the language of ZFC. Moreover, there are countable models of ZFC in which all real numbers, all sets of real numbers, functions on the reals, etc. are definable {{harv|Hamkins|Linetsky|Reitz|2013}}.

'''Discounting''' is a financial mechanism in which a [[debtor]] obtains the right to delay payments to a [[creditor]], for a defined period of time, in exchange for a charge or fee.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"&gt;See "Time Value", "Discount", "Discount Yield", "Compound Interest", "Efficient Market", "Market Value" and "Opportunity Cost" in Downes, J. and Goodman, J. E. ''Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms'', Baron's Financial Guides, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the party that owes money in the present purchases the right to delay the payment until some future date.&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"&gt;See "Discount", "Compound Interest", "Efficient Markets Hypothesis", "Efficient Resource Allocation", "Pareto-Optimality", "Price", "Price Mechanism" and "Efficient Market" in Black, John, ''Oxford Dictionary of Economics'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''discount''', or '''charge''', is the difference between the original amount owed in the present and the amount that has to be paid in the future to settle the debt.&lt;ref Name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;

The discount is usually associated with a ''discount rate'', which is also called the ''discount yield''.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiscountRate_Explain"&gt;Here, the ''discount rate'' is different from the [[discount window|discount rate]] the nation's Central Bank charges financial institutions.&lt;/ref&gt; The discount yield is the proportional share of the initial amount owed (initial liability) that must be paid to delay payment for 1 year.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Discount yield} = \frac{\text{Charge to delay payment for 1 year}}{\text{debt liability} } &lt;/math&gt;

Since a person can earn a return on money invested over some period of time, most economic and financial models assume the discount yield is the same as the [[rate of return]] the person could receive by investing this money elsewhere (in assets of similar [[risk]]) over the given period of time covered by the delay in payment.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt; The concept is associated with the [[opportunity cost of capital|opportunity cost]] of not having use of the money for the period of time covered by the delay in payment. The relationship between the discount yield and the [[rate of return]] on other financial assets is usually discussed in economic and financial theories involving the inter-relation between various [[market price]]s, and the achievement of [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimality]] through the operations in the [[price mechanism|capitalistic price mechanism]],&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt; as well as in the discussion of the [[efficient-market hypothesis|efficient (financial) market hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Competition"&gt;Competition from other firms who offer other financial assets that promise the market [[rate of return]] forces the person who is asking for a delay in payment to offer a "discount yield" that is the same as the market rate of return.&lt;/ref&gt; The person delaying the payment of the current liability is essentially compensating the person to whom he/she owes money for the lost revenue that could be earned from an investment during the time period covered by the delay in payment.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt; Accordingly, it is the relevant "discount yield" that determines the "discount", and not the other way around.

As indicated, the rate of return is usually calculated in accordance to an annual [[return on investment]]. Since an investor earns a return on the original principal amount of the investment as well as on any prior period investment income, investment earnings are "compounded" as time advances.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt; Therefore, considering the fact that the "discount" must match the benefits obtained from a similar [[investment|investment asset]], the "discount yield" must be used within the same compounding mechanism to negotiate an increase in the size of the "discount" whenever the time period of the payment is delayed or extended.&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Competition"/&gt; The "discount rate" is the rate at which the "discount" must grow as the delay in payment is extended.&lt;ref name="MathEcon_Chiang"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiang |first=Alpha C. |authorlink=Alpha Chiang |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is directly tied into the [[time value of money]] and its calculations.&lt;ref name="Finance_Discount"/&gt;
[[File:Economics of climate change chapter3 discounting curves.png|thumb|right|The present value of $1,000, 100 years into the future. Curves representing constant discount rates of 2%, 3%, 5%, and 7%]]
The "time value of money" indicates there is a difference between the "future value" of a payment and the "present value" of the same payment. The rate of return on investment should be the dominant factor in evaluating the market's assessment of the difference between the future value and the present value of a payment; and it is the market's assessment that counts the most.&lt;ref name="Economics_Competition"/&gt; Therefore, the "discount yield", which is predetermined by a related [[return on investment]] that is found in the [[financial market]]s, is what is used within the time-value-of-money calculations to determine the "discount" required to delay payment of a financial liability for a given period of time.

==Basic calculation==
If we consider the value of the original payment presently due to be ''P'', and the debtor wants to delay the payment for ''t'' years, then an ''r'' market [[rate of return]] on a similar [[Investment|investment asset]] means the future value of ''P'' is &lt;math&gt;P(1 + r)^t&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MathEcon_Chiang"/&gt; and the discount would be calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Discount} = P(1+r)^t-P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;

where ''r'' is also the discount yield.

If ''F'' is a payment that will be made ''t'' years in the future, then the "present value" of this payment, also called the "discounted value" of the payment, is

: &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{F}{(1+r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics_Discount"/&gt;

To calculate the [[present value]] of a single cash flow, it is divided by one plus the interest rate for each period of time that will pass. This is expressed mathematically as raising the divisor to the power of the number of units of time.

Consider the task to find the present value ''PV'' of $100 that will be received in five years, or equivalently, to find which amount of money today will grow to $100 in five years when subject to a constant discount rate.

Assuming a 12% per year interest rate, it follows that

: &lt;math&gt;{\rm PV}=\frac{\$100}{(1+0.12)^5}=\$56.74.&lt;/math&gt;

== Discount rate ==

The discount rate which is used in financial calculations is usually chosen to be equal to the [[cost of capital]]. The cost of capital, in a financial market equilibrium, will be the same as the market [[rate of return]] on the financial asset mixture the firm uses to finance capital investment. Some adjustment may be made to the discount rate to take account of risks associated with uncertain cash flows, with other developments.

The discount rates typically applied to different types of companies show significant differences:

* Start-ups seeking money: 50–100%
* Early start-ups: 40–60%
* Late start-ups: 30–50%
* Mature companies: 10–25%

The higher discount rate for start-ups reflects the various disadvantages they face, compared to established companies:

* Reduced marketability of ownerships because stocks are not traded publicly
* Limited number of investors willing to invest
* High risks associated with start-ups
* Overly optimistic forecasts by enthusiastic founders

One method that looks into a correct discount rate is the [[capital asset pricing model]]. This model takes into account three variables that make up the discount rate:

'''1. Risk free rate''': The percentage of return generated by investing in risk free securities such as government bonds.

'''2. Beta''': The measurement of how a company's stock price reacts to a change in the market. A beta higher than 1 means that a change in share price is exaggerated compared to the rest of shares in the same market. A beta less than 1 means that the share is stable and not very responsive to changes in the market. Less than 0 means that a share is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the shares in the same market.

'''3. Equity market risk premium''': The return on investment that investors require above the risk free rate.

: '''Discount rate''' = (risk free rate) + beta * (equity market risk premium)

== Discount factor ==

The '''discount factor''', ''DF(T)'', is the factor by which a future cash flow must be multiplied in order to obtain the present value. For a zero-rate (also called spot rate) ''r'', taken from a [[yield curve]], and a time to cash flow ''T'' (in years), the discount factor is:

: &lt;math&gt; DF(T) = \frac{1}{(1+rT)}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the only discount rate one has is not a zero-rate (neither taken from a [[zero-coupon bond]] nor converted from a [[swap rate]] to a zero-rate through [[bootstrapping (finance)|bootstrapping]]) but an annually-compounded rate (for example if the benchmark is a US Treasury bond with annual coupons) and one only has its [[yield to maturity]], one would use an annually-compounded discount factor:

: &lt;math&gt; DF(T) = \frac{1}{(1+r)^T}. &lt;/math&gt;

However, when operating in a bank, where the amount the bank can lend (and therefore get interest) is linked to the value of its [[asset]]s (including [[accrued interest]]), traders usually use daily compounding to discount cash flows. Indeed, even if the interest of the bonds it holds (for example) is paid semi-annually, the value of its book of bond will increase daily, thanks to [[accrued interest]] being accounted for, and therefore the bank will be able to re-invest these daily accrued interest (by lending additional money or buying more financial products). In that case, the discount factor is then (if the usual [[money market]] [[day count convention]] for the currency is ACT/360, in case of currencies such as [[United States dollar]], [[euro]], [[Japanese yen]]), with ''r'' the zero-rate and ''T'' the time to cash flow in years:

: &lt;math&gt; DF(T) = \frac{1}{( 1 + \frac{r}{360} )^{ 360T } } &lt;/math&gt;

or, in case the market convention for the currency being discounted is ACT/365 ([[AUD]], [[Canadian dollar|CAD]], [[GBP]]):

: &lt;math&gt; DF(T) = \frac{1}{( 1 + \frac{r}{365} )^{ 365T } }. &lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, for manual calculation, the continuously-compounded hypothesis is a close-enough approximation of the daily-compounding hypothesis, and makes calculation easier (even though it does not have any real application as no financial instrument is continuously compounded). In that case, the discount factor is:

: &lt;math&gt; DF(T) = e^{-rT}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1925">In [[mathematics]], an '''eigenplane''' is a two-[[dimension]]al [[invariant subspace]] in a given [[vector space]]. By analogy with the term ''[[eigenvector]]'' for a vector which, when operated on by a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] is another vector which is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] multiple of itself, the term '''''eigenplane''''' can be used to describe a two-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (a ''2-plane''), such that the operation of a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] on a vector in the 2-plane always yields another vector in the same 2-plane.

A particular case that has been studied is that in which the linear operator is an [[isometry]] ''M'' of the [[hypersphere]] (written ''S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'') represented within four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;M \; [  \mathbf{s} \;  \mathbf{t} ] \; = \; [ \mathbf{s} \; \mathbf{t} ] \Lambda_\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''s''' and '''t''' are four-dimensional column vectors and &amp;Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; is a two-dimensional '''eigenrotation''' within the '''eigenplane'''.

In the usual [[eigenvector]] problem, there is freedom to multiply an eigenvector by an arbitrary scalar; in this case there is freedom to multiply by an arbitrary non-zero [[rotation]].

This case is potentially physically interesting in the case that the [[shape of the universe]] is a [[multiply connected]] [[3-manifold]], since finding the [[angle]]s of the eigenrotations of a candidate isometry for [[shape of the universe|topological lensing]] is a way to [[scientific method|falsify]] such hypotheses.

==Biography==
===Life===
He was born in [[Pescia]] on 11 November 1911, where his father was the Director of the local [[agricultural school]].&lt;ref&gt;The contents of this section are mainly sourced from reference {{Harv|Rizza|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His family later went to [[Rome]], where his father ended his working career as the [[Director-general]] of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Public Education (Italy)|Ministry of Public Education]]. Enzo Martilnelli lived in Rome almost all of his life: the only exception was a period of nearly eight years, from 1947 to 1954, when he was in [[Genova]], working at the local [[Università degli Studi di Genova|university]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Gallarati|2000|p=43}}, {{Harvnb|Rizza|1984|pp=1–2}} and {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|pp=163–165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 he married in [[Rome]] Luigia Panella, also her a [[mathematician]], who later become an [[associate professor]] at the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] of [[Engineering]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], and who was his loving companion for the rest of his life. They had a son, Roberto, and a daughter, Maria Renata, who later followed her parents footsteps becoming also her a mathematician:&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=165}}, around 2002 she worked as a [[research fellow]] at the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] of [[Engineering]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]&lt;/ref&gt; four grandchildren completed their family.&lt;ref name="R2002165"&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
In 1933 he earned his [[laurea]] from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]: the title of his [[thesis]] was "''Sulle funzioni poligene di una e di due variabili complesse''",&lt;ref&gt;An [[English language|English]] [[translation]] reads as "''Polygenic functions of one and of two complex variables''".&lt;/ref&gt; and his thesis [[Supervisor#Science|supervisor]] was [[Francesco Severi]].&lt;ref&gt;See reference {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934 to 1946 he worked as an assistant professor first to the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] held by [[Francesco Severi]] and then to the chair of [[geometry]] held by [[Enrico Bompiani]]. In 1939 he became "Libero Docente" (free professor) of [[Mathematical analysis]]: he taught also [[Course (education)|courses]] on [[analytic geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[topology]] as [[associate professor]].&lt;ref&gt;See references {{Harvnb|Rizza|1984|p=1}} and {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 he won a competitive examination by a judging commission for the chair of "''Geometria analitica con elementi di Geometria Proiettiva e Geometria Descrittiva con Disegno''",&lt;ref&gt;According to references {{Harvnb|Gallarati|2000|p=43}} and {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=163}}. An [[English Language|English]] [[translation]] reads as "''[[Analytic Geometry]] with elements of [[Projective Geometry]] and [[Descriptive Geometry]] with [[Drawing]]''".&lt;/ref&gt; awarded by the [[University of Genova]]: the second place and the third place went respectively to [[Giovanni Dantoni]] and [[Guido Zappa]].&lt;ref&gt;As {{harvtxt|Zappa|1984|p=14}} himself remembers. See also the official communication in the {{Harvnb|Bollettino UMI|1947|p=85}}, where all the winners of the chairs are listed, irrespectively of their placement.&lt;/ref&gt; Martinelli held that chair from 1946 to 1954, teaching also [[mathematical analysis]], [[complex analysis|function theory]], [[differential geometry]]&lt;ref name="R2002165"/&gt; and algebraic analysis&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=43}}: this topic is not the modern [[algebraic analysis]] founded by [[Mikio Sato]], [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and collaborators, but an old standard [[Italia]]n course topic in mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; as  [[associate professor]]. In 1954 He went back in [[Rome]] to the chair of [[Geometry]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|university]], holding that chair up to his [[retirement]], in 1982: he also taught courses on [[topology]], [[higher mathematics]], [[higher geometry]] upon charge. In the years 1968–1969, during a very difficult period for the [[Sapienza University of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;It was the season of the [[protests of 1968]]: a few more detail about Martinelli's work during this season can be find in the section describing [[Enzo Martinelli#Tracts of his personality|his personality]].&lt;/ref&gt; he served the university as the director of the [[Guido Castelnuovo]] Institute of Mathematics.

He attended to various [[Academic conference|conferences]] and [[meeting]]s. In 1943 and in 1946 he was invited in Zurich by [[Rudolf Fueter]], in order to present his researches: later and during all his career he lectured in almost all [[Italia]]n and foreign [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=165}}: [[Giovanni Battista Rizza|Rizza]] also lists a few universities where Martinelli lectured.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a member of the [[Unione Matematica Italiana|UMI]] Scientific Commission (from 1967 to 1972), of the [[editorial board]]s of the [[Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni]] (from 1955 to 1992) and of the [[Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata]] (from 1965 to 1999).&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|pp=165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors===
According to {{Harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=165}}, Enzo's talent for [[mathematics]] was already evident when he was only a [[lyceum]] [[student]]. While still attending the [[university]], he won the [[Cotronei Foundation]] prize, and after earning his [[laurea]], the [[Beltrami Foundation]] prize, the [[Fubini prize|Fubini]] and [[Torelli prize]]s,&lt;ref name="Tor.pr" /&gt; and the Prize for Mathematical Sciences of the [[Ministry of National Education (Italy)|Ministry of National Education]]: this last one was awarded him in 1943, and the judging commission consisted of [[Francesco Severi]] (as the [[president]] of the commission), [[Ugo Amaldi (mathematician)|Ugo Amaldi]]&lt;ref&gt;Ugo was a noted [[Italia]]n [[mathematician]], a collaborator of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] and [[Federigo Enriques]], and the father of noted [[physicist]] [[Edoardo Amaldi]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonio Signorini]] (as the [[Supervisor#Science|supervisor]] of the commission).&lt;ref&gt;See the inventory of the [[Reale Accademia d'Italia]] by {{Harvtxt|Cagiano De Azevedo|Gerardi|2005|p=113}}: this reference lists and briefly describes the contents of the documents of [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]] 207 of box (Busta) 104 of section VII, titled "Premi di Incoraggiamento e Sussidi" ({{lang-en|Encouragement Prizes and Grants}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1948 he was elected [[Corresponding Member]] of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040238/http://www.istituticulturali.it/moduli/istcult/istituto.jsp?s=2&amp;idIstituto=312 Accademia Ligure di Scienze e Lettere]:&lt;ref&gt;There is a discrepancy in the date of election reported by {{Harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=43}} (1948) and {{Harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=165}} (1986): however, [[Dionisio Gallarati]] published his commemoration of Martinelli in the [[Academic journal|journal]] (Atti) of this [[Academy]], and therefore his date is reasonably believed to be correct.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 and in 1977 he was elected respectively [[Corresponding Member|Corresponding]] and [[Academician|Full Member]] of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], and from 1982 to 1985 he was "''Professore Linceo''".&lt;ref name="Rizza.p165"&gt;See {{harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=165}}: the "''Professore linceo''" ({{lang-en|Lyncean professor}}) is a [[professor]] which is in charge to the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] as a distinguished lecturer.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1980 he was elected [[Corresponding Member]] of the [[Accademia delle Scienze di Torino]] and then, in 1994, [[Academician|Full Member]]. Also, in 1986, the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], to which Enzo Martinelli was particularly tied for all his life,&lt;ref name="R2002165"/&gt; awarded him the title of [[professor emeritus]].

===Personality traits===
He is unanimously remembered as a real [[gentleman]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=45}} and {{Harvtxt|Tomassini|2001|p=IV}}: the exact [[Italian language|Italian word]] they use to characterize him is ''signorilità'', which is somewhat untranslatable in its exact meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; gifted by a caring attention, politeness, generosity and the rare ability to listen to [[colleague]]s and [[student]]s alike:&lt;ref name="Rizza02p166"&gt;See {{harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=45}} and {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=6}} remember long conversations with him on various mathematical research topics,&lt;ref&gt;They mean "''mathematical research''" in a broad sense: {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=2}} precisely states that Martinelli was interested in all fields of mathematics, not only the ones within his personal research interest.&lt;/ref&gt; and his disposability to give help and advice to whoever asked for it. In particular {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=7}} recalls the time when he was his doctoral student at the [[University of Genova]]: they meet every Sunday in the afternoon at Martinelli's home, since Martinelli was not able to meet him during the week. During one of their meetings, lasting a little more than two hours, Martinelli taught him [[Élie Cartan]]'s theory of [[exterior differential form]]s, and Rizza used successfully this tool in his first research works.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=7}} and the entry about him for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; Another episode illustrating this aspect of Martinelli's personality is recalled by [[Gaetano Fichera]].&lt;ref&gt;Fichera sketches the episode in his "last lesson" {{Harv|Fichera|1995|pp=18–19}}: see also {{Harvnb|Colautti Fichera|2006|p=21}} and the entry about Gaetano Fichera for further information.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was back in Rome in 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]], he exposed to Martinelli a theory identical to the theory of differential form: he developed it while being prisoner of the [[nazist]]s in [[Teramo]] during wartime. Martinelli, very tactfully,&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1995|pp=18}} himself.&lt;/ref&gt; told him that the idea was already being developed by [[Élie Cartan]] and [[Georges de Rham]].

An excellent teacher himself, capable to arose curiosity and enthusiasm by his lessons,&lt;ref name="Rizza02p166" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some information on his teaching commitment can be found in the "[[Enzo Martinelli#Teaching activity|Teaching activity]]" section of this entry.&lt;/ref&gt; he admired and respected much his own:&lt;ref name="p7"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Rizza|1984|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was quite common for the [[Italy|Italian]] [[scientist]]s of the same and the preceding generations, who were advised in the early days of their scientific career by some of the best Italian scientists ever.&lt;ref&gt;See the entries about Italian [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s of that period, for example the entries about [[Renato Caccioppoli]], [[Gaetano Fichera]], [[Francesco Severi]].&lt;/ref&gt; His [[doctoral advisor]] was [[Francesco Severi]]: other great [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]]s where among his teachers. [[Guido Castelnuovo]], [[Federigo Enriques]], [[Enrico Bompiani]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] [[Mauro Picone]] and [[Antonio Signorini]] were all working at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] when Enzo Martinelli was a student there, following their lessons: {{harvtxt|Zappa|1984}} describes the activity of the institute of mathematics during that period as extremely stimulating.&lt;ref&gt;See also the description sketched by {{harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another central aspect of his personality was a deep sense of [[justice]] and [[legality]]:&lt;ref name="R2002165"/&gt; Martinelli was very careful in performing his [[citizen]] and [[university]] [[professor]] duties, and he was also ready to fight for his own rights and for the needs of higher education. Concerned by the growing interference of [[bureaucracy]] in university education, already in the 1950s he was heard by {{Harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=6}} complaining that: "''In Italia mancano le menti semplificatrici''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Italy lacks of simplifying minds''"An [[Italian language|Italian]] [[translation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Martinelli was also free from every kind of [[authoritarianism]] to the point that when, during the [[protests of 1968]] in Italy, many [[newspaper]]s accused the Italian university scientific community of being so, all the [[assistant professor]]s and [[student]]s of Martinelli (and perhaps Martinelli himself) were perplexed.&lt;ref name="concern"&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, while performing his duties as the director of the [[Guido Castelnuovo]] Institute of Mathematics at the Sapienza university of Rome, his rare [[intellectual honesty]]&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=45}} and to {{harvtxt|Rizza|2002|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and rigorous rationality, according to [[Giovanni Battista Rizza|Rizza]], caused him troubles when dealing with many who "''believed in everything except the cold light of [[reason]]''".&lt;ref&gt;"''... che in tutto credevano salvo nella fredda luce della ragione.''", as precisely stated by {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research activity===

|text= Fin troppo meticoloso, scriveva più volte ogni suo lavoro, curandone fin nei minimi particolari sostanza e forma, fino a renderli di piacevole lettura. È difficile trovare nei suoi scritti un concetto che possa essere espresso in modo migliore.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation reads as:-"''Too much meticulous, he rewrote many times each of his works, curing every detail of their content and form, up to make them pleasant to read.

|sign= [[Dionisio Gallarati]]
|source= {{Harv|Gallarati|2000|p=45}}.
}}

He is the author of more than 50 research works, the first of which was published when Martinelli still was an undergraduate student:&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvnb|Rizza|1984|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; precisely, his research production consist of 47 papers and 30 between [[treatise]]s, [[textbook]]s and various other publications.&lt;ref name="publist"&gt;For a complete list of his works, classified between research notes and [[memoir]]s or [[treatise]]s, textbooks and various writings, see the paper {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|pp=172–176}}: a strictly shorter, chronologically ordered list appears also in the paper {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=2}}, his research personality can be described by two words: "''[[enthusiasm]]''" and "''[[dissatisfaction]]''":&lt;ref&gt;Precisely, {{Harvtxt|Rizza|1984|p=2}} states the words "''entusiasmo''" e "''insoddisfazione''".&lt;/ref&gt; enthusiasm is meant as his steady interest in [[mathematics]] at all levels, while dissatisfaction is meant as the desire to going deeper into all mathematical problems investigated, without stopping at first success and expressing all the results in a simple, elegant and essential form.

===Teaching activity===
The aspects of his personality described before and his deep professional commitment also made him a great teacher:&lt;ref&gt;See references {{Harvnb|Rizza|1984|p=6}} and {{Harvnb|Rizza|2002|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at least fifteen [[textbook]]s on [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[complex analysis]]&lt;ref name="publist"/&gt; testify his didactic activity.&lt;ref name="concern"/&gt; Those books appear as models of clarity and [[mathematical rigour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gallarati|2000|p=45}} particularly praises this way the various [[geometry]] lecture notes redacted by Martinelli himself.&lt;/ref&gt; and also offer insights on more complex theories and problems to the clever student: indeed, it was one of Martinelli's concerns to teach mathematics showing its lively development and its attractiveness in term of interesting difficult problems offered, in order that no gifted student would abandon the idea to do mathematical research.&lt;ref name="concern"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2390">'''Ergodic Ramsey theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] where problems motivated by [[additive combinatorics]] are proven using [[ergodic theory]].

==History==
Ergodic Ramsey theory arose shortly after [[Szemerédi's theorem|Endre Szemerédi's proof]] that a set of positive [[upper density]] contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s, when [[Hillel Furstenberg]] gave a new proof of this theorem using ergodic theory. It has since produced combinatorial results, some of which have yet to be obtained by other means, and has also given a deeper understanding of the structure of [[measure-preserving dynamical system]]s.

==Szemerédi's theorem==
{{main|Szemerédi's theorem}}
[[Szemerédi's theorem]] is a result in [[arithmetic combinatorics]], concerning [[arithmetic progression]]s in subsets of the integers. In 1936, [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán|Turán]] conjectured&lt;ref name="erdos turan"&gt;{{citation|authorlink1=Paul Erdős|first1=Paul|last1=Erdős|authorlink2=Pál Turán|first2=Paul|last2=Turán|title=On some sequences of integers|journal=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=11|issue=4|year=1936|pages=261–264|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1936-05.pdf|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-11.4.261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that every set of integers ''A'' with positive [[natural density]] contains a ''k'' term arithmetic progression for every ''k''. This conjecture, which became Szemerédi's theorem, generalizes the statement of [[van der Waerden's theorem]]. [[Hillel Furstenberg]] proved the theorem using ergodic principles in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Hillel Furstenberg|first=Hillel|last=Furstenberg|title=Ergodic behavior of diagonal measures and a theorem of Szemerédi on arithmetic progressions|journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19922">In [[cryptography]], '''format-preserving encryption''' ('''FPE'''),  refers to encrypting in such a way that the output (the [[ciphertext]]) is in the same format as the input (the [[plaintext]]). The meaning of "format" varies. Typically only finite domains are discussed, for example:

* To encrypt a 16-digit credit card number so that the ciphertext is another 16-digit number.
* To encrypt an English word so that the ciphertext is another English word.
* To encrypt an n-bit number so that the ciphertext is another n-bit number (this is the definition of an n-bit [[block cipher]]).

For such finite domains, and for the purposes of the discussion below, the cipher is equivalent to a permutation of ''N'' integers {{math|{0, ... , ''N''−1}}} where ''N'' is the size of the domain.

==Motivation==

===Restricted field lengths or formats===
One motivation for using FPE comes from the problems associated with integrating encryption into existing applications, with well-defined data models. A typical example would be a [[credit card number]], such as &lt;code&gt;1234567812345670&lt;/code&gt; (16 bytes long, digits only).

Adding encryption to such applications might be challenging if data models are to be changed, as it usually involves changing field length limits or data types. For example, output from a typical [[block cipher]] would turn credit card number into a [[hexadecimal]] (e.g.&lt;code&gt;0x96a45cbcf9c2a9425cde9e274948cb67&lt;/code&gt;, 34 bytes, hexadecimal digits) or [[Base64]] value (e.g. &lt;code&gt;lqRcvPnCqUJc3p4nSUjLZw==&lt;/code&gt;, 24 bytes, alphanumeric and special characters), which will break any existing applications expecting the credit card number to be a 16-digit number.

Apart from simple formatting problems, using AES-128-CBC, this credit card number might get encrypted to the hexadecimal value &lt;code&gt;0xde015724b081ea7003de4593d792fd8b695b39e095c98f3a220ff43522a2df02&lt;/code&gt;. In addition to the problems caused by creating invalid characters and increasing the size of the data, data encrypted using the CBC mode of an encryption algorithm also changes its value when it is decrypted and encrypted again. This happens because the [[Initialization vector|random seed value]] that is used to initialize the encryption algorithm and is included as part of the encrypted value is different for each encryption operation. Because of this, it is impossible to use data that has been encrypted with the CBC mode as a [[Primary key|unique key]] to identify a row in a database.

FPE attempts to simplify the transition process by preserving the formatting and length of the original data, allowing a drop-in replacement of plaintext values with their ciphertexts in legacy applications.

==Comparison to truly random permutations==
Although a truly random permutation is the ideal FPE cipher, for large domains it is infeasible to pre-generate and remember a truly random permutation. So the problem of FPE is to generate a pseudorandom permutation from a secret key, in such a way that the computation time for a single value is small (ideally constant, but most importantly smaller than O(N)).

==Comparison to block ciphers==
An &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-bit block cipher technically ''is'' a FPE on the set {{math|{0, ..., 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;-1}}}. If an FPE is needed on one of these standard sized sets (for example, &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; = 64 for [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; = 128 for AES) a block cipher of the right size can be used.

However, in typical usage, a block cipher is used in a [[block cipher modes of operation|mode of operation]] that allows it to encrypt arbitrarily long messages, and with an [[initialization vector]] as discussed above. In this mode, a block cipher is not an FPE.

==Definition of security==
In cryptographic literature (see most of the references below), the measure of a "good" FPE is whether an attacker can distinguish the FPE from a truly random permutation. Various types of attackers are postulated, depending on whether they have access to oracles or known ciphertext/plaintext pairs.

==Algorithms==
In most of the approaches listed here, a well-understood [[block cipher]] (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]) is used as a primitive to take the place of an ideal random function. This has the advantage that incorporation of a secret key into the algorithm is easy. Where AES is mentioned in the following discussion, any other good block cipher would work as well.

===The FPE constructions of Black and Rogaway===
Implementing FPE with security provably related to that of the underlying block cipher was first undertaken in a paper by cryptographers [[John Black (cryptographer)|John Black]] and [[Phillip Rogaway]],&lt;ref&gt;John Black and Philip Rogaway, Ciphers with Arbitrary Domains, Proceedings RSA-CT, 2002, pp. 114–130. http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/black00ciphers.html (http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/subset.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; which described three ways to do this. They proved that each of these techniques is as secure as the block cipher that is used to construct it. This means that if the AES algorithm is used to create an FPE algorithm, then the resulting FPE algorithm is as secure as AES because an adversary capable of defeating the FPE algorithm can also defeat the AES algorithm. Therefore, if AES is secure, then the FPE algorithms constructed from it are also secure. In all of the following, ''E'' denotes the AES encryption operation that is used to construct an FPE algorithm and ''F'' denotes the FPE encryption operation.

====FPE from a prefix cipher====
One simple way to create an FPE algorithm on {0,...,&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;-1} is to assign a pseudorandom weight to each integer, then sort by weight. The weights are defined by applying an existing block cipher to each integer. Black and Rogaway call this technique a "prefix cipher" and showed it was provably as good as the block cipher used.

Thus, to create a FPE on the domain {0,1,2,3}, given a key &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt; apply AES(&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;) to each integer, giving, for example,

&lt;code&gt;''weight''(0) = 0x56c644080098fc5570f2b329323dbf62&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''weight''(1) = 0x08ee98c0d05e3dad3eb3d6236f23e7b7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''weight''(2) = 0x47d2e1bf72264fa01fb274465e56ba20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''weight''(3) = 0x077de40941c93774857961a8a772650d&lt;/code&gt;

Sorting [0,1,2,3] by weight gives [3,1,2,0], so the cipher is

&lt;code&gt;''F''(0) = 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''F''(1) = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''F''(2) = 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;''F''(3) = 0&lt;/code&gt;.

This method is only useful for small values of &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;. For larger values, the size of the lookup table and the required number of encryptions to initialize the table gets too big to be practical.

====FPE from cycle walking====
If there is a set ''M'' of allowed values within the domain of a pseudorandom permutation &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; (for example &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; can be a block cipher like AES), an FPE algorithm can be created from the block cipher by repeatedly applying the block cipher until the result is one of the allowed values (within ''M'').

  &lt;code&gt;CycleWalkingFPE(x)&lt;br /&gt;
  {&lt;br /&gt;
    if ''P''(x) is an element of ''M''&lt;br /&gt;
      return ''P''(x)&lt;br /&gt;
    else &lt;br /&gt;
      return CycleWalkingFPE(''P''(x))&lt;br /&gt;
  }&lt;/code&gt;

The recursion is guaranteed to terminate. (Because ''P'' is one-to-one and the domain is finite, repeated application of ''P'' forms a cycle, so starting with a point in ''M'' the cycle will eventually terminate in ''M''.)

This has the advantage that the elements of ''M'' do not have to be mapped to a consecutive sequence {0,...,''N''-1} of integers. It has the disadvantage, when ''M'' is much smaller than &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;'s domain, that too many iterations might be required for each operation. If &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is a block cipher of a fixed size, such as AES, this is a severe restriction on the sizes of ''M'' for which this method is efficient.

For example, an application may want to encrypt 100-bit values with AES in a way that creates another 100-bit value. With this technique, AES-128-ECB encryption can be applied until it reaches a value which has all of its 28 highest bits set to 0, which will take an average of 2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; iterations to happen.

====FPE from a Feistel network====
It is also possible to make a FPE algorithm using a [[Feistel cipher|Feistel network]]. A Feistel network needs a source of pseudo-random values for the sub-keys for each round, and the output of the AES algorithm can be used as these pseudo-random values. When this is done, the resulting Feistel construction is good if enough rounds are used.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Patarin, Luby-Rackoff: 7 Rounds Are Enough for 2&lt;sup&gt;n(1-epsilon)&lt;/sup&gt; Security, Proceedings of CRYPTO 2003, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 2729, Oct 2003, pp. 513–529. https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2003/27290510/27290510.pdf; also Jaques Patrin: Security of Random Feistel Schemes with 5 or more Rounds. https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2004/31520105/Version%20courte%20Format%20Springer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to implement an FPE algorithm using AES and a Feistel network is to use as many bits of AES output as are needed to equal the length of the left or right halves of the Feistel network. If a 24-bit value is needed as a sub-key, for example, it is possible to use the lowest 24 bits of the output of AES for this value.

This may not result in the output of the Feistel network preserving the format of the input, but it is possible to iterate the Feistel network in the same way that the cycle-walking technique does to ensure that format can be preserved. Because it is possible to adjust the size of the inputs to a Feistel network, it is possible to make it very likely that this iteration ends very quickly on average. In the case of credit card numbers, for example, there are 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; possible 16-digit credit card numbers, and because the 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;53.1&lt;/sup&gt;, using a 54-bit wide Feistel network along with cycle walking will create an FPE algorithm that encrypts fairly quickly on average.

===The Thorp shuffle===
A Thorp shuffle is like an idealized card-shuffle, or equivalently a maximally-unbalanced Feistel cipher where one side is a single bit. It is easier to prove security for unbalanced Feistel ciphers than for balanced ones.&lt;ref name=thorp&gt;{{Citation |first=Phillip |last=Rogaway |title=How to Encipher Messages on a Small Domain |url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/thorp.pdf |journal=Advances in Cryptology |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VIL mode===
For domain sizes that are a power of two, and an existing block cipher with a smaller block size, a new cipher may be created using VIL mode as described by Bellare, Rogaway.&lt;ref name=vil&gt;{{Citation |first=Mihir |last=Bellare |title=On the construction of Variable-Input-Length Ciphers |url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/lpe.pdf |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasty Pudding Cipher===
The [[Hasty Pudding Cipher]] uses custom constructions (not depending on existing block ciphers as primitives) to encrypt arbitrary finite small domains.

===The FFSEM/FFX mode of AES===
The FFSEM mode of AES (specification&lt;ref name=ffsem-spec&gt;Terence Spies, Feistel Finite Set Encryption Mode http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/ffsem/ffsem-spec.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) that has been accepted for consideration by NIST uses the Feistel network construction of Black and Rogaway described above, with AES for the round function, with one slight modification: a single key is used and is tweaked slightly for each round.

As of February 2010, FFSEM has been superseded by the FFX mode written by [[Mihir Bellare]], Phillip Rogaway, and Terence Spies. (specification,&lt;ref name=ffx-spec&gt;Mihir Bellare, Phillip Rogaway, Terence Spies: The FFX Mode of Operation for Format-Preserving Encryption http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/ffx/ffx-spec.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation |title=NIST Block Cipher Modes Development |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html |year=2010 }}).

===FPE for JPEG 2000 encryption===
In [[JPEG 2000]] standard, the marker codes (in the range 0xFF90 through 0xFFFF) should not appear in the plaintext and ciphertext. The simple modular-0xFF90 technique cannot be applied to solve the JPEG 2000 encryption problem. For example, the ciphertext words 0x23FF and 0x9832 are valid, but their combination 0x23FF9832 becomes invalid since it introduces the marker code 0xFF98. Similarly, the simple cycle-walking technique cannot be applied to solve the JPEG2000 encryption problem since two valid ciphertext blocks may give invalid ciphertext when they get combined. For example, if the first ciphertext block ends with bytes "...30FF" and the second ciphertext block starts with bytes "9832...", then the marker code "0xFF98" would appear in the ciphertext.

Two mechanisms for format-preserving encryption of JPEG 2000 were given in the paper "Efficient and Secure Encryption Schemes for JPEG2000"&lt;ref&gt;Hongjun Wu, Di Ma, "Efficient and Secure Encryption Schemes for JPEG2000", International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2004). MSP-L 1.6, Vol. V, pp. 869–872. http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/wuhj/research/publications/2004_ICASSP_JPEG2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by Hongjun Wu and Di Ma. To perform format-preserving encryption of JPEG 2000, the technique is to exclude the byte "0xFF" in the encryption and decryption. Then a JPEG 2000 encryption mechanism performs modulo-n addition with stream cipher; another JPEG 2000 encryption mechanism performs the cycle-walking technique with block cipher.

===Other FPE constructions===
Several FPE constructs are based on adding the output of a standard cipher, modulo n, to the data to be encrypted, with various methods of unbiasing the result. The modulo-n addition shared by many of the constructs is the immediately obvious solution to the FPE problem (thus its use in a number of cases), with the main differences being the unbiasing mechanisms used.

Section 8 of the [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] 74, ''Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 1981 Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data Encryption Standard'',&lt;ref&gt;FIPS 74, Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 1981 Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data Encryption Standard http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm&lt;/ref&gt; describes a way to use the DES encryption algorithm in a manner that preserves the format of the data via modulo-n addition followed by an unbiasing operation. This standard was withdrawn on May 19, 2005, so the technique should be considered obsolete in terms of being a formal standard.

Another early mechanism for format-preserving encryption was [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]]'s "Encrypting data with a restricted range of values"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gutmann, "Encrypting data with a restricted range of values", 23 January 1997, https://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/browse_thread/thread/6caf26496782e359/e576d7196b6cdb48&lt;/ref&gt; which again performs modulo-n addition on any cipher with some adjustments to make the result uniform, with the resulting encryption being as strong as the underlying encryption algorithm on which it is based.

The paper "Using Datatype-Preserving Encryption to Enhance Data Warehouse Security"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brightwell and Harry Smith, "Using Datatype-Preserving Encryption to Enhance Data Warehouse Security, Proceedings of the 1997 National Information Systems Security Conference https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=135556&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Brightwell and Harry Smith describes a way to use the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] encryption algorithm in a way that preserves the format of the plaintext. This technique doesn't appear to apply an unbiasing step as do the other modulo-n techniques referenced here.

The paper "Format-Preserving Encryption"&lt;ref&gt;Mihir Bellare and Thomas Ristenpart, Format-Preserving Encryption http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/251&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mihir Bellare]] and Thomas Ristenpart describes using "nearly balanced" Feistel networks to create secure FPE algorithms.

The paper "Format Controlling Encryption Using Datatype Preserving Encryption"&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Mattsson, Format Controlling Encryption Using Datatype Preserving Encryption http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/257&lt;/ref&gt; by Ulf Mattsson describes other ways to create FPE algorithms.

An example of FPE algorithm is FNR (''Flexible Naor and Reingold'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/sashank/libfnr |title=Flexible Naor and Reingold|publisher=Cisco Systems Inc|author=Sashank Dara, Scott Fluhrer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance of FPE algorithms by standards authorities==
NIST Special Publication 800-38G, "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=NIST Special Publication 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-38G}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies two methods: FF1 and FF3. Details on the proposals submitted for each can be found at the NIST Block Cipher Modes Development site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=NIST Block Cipher Modes Development |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; including patent and test vector information. Sample values are available for both FF1 and FF3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=NIST Cryptographic Toolkit Example Algorithms |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/examples.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* FF1 is FFX[Radix] "Format-preserving Feistel-based Encryption Mode" which is also in standards processes under ANSI X9 as X9.119 and X9.124. It was submitted to NIST by Mihir Bellare of University of California, San Diego, Phillip Rogaway of University of California, Davis, and Terence Spies of Voltage Security Inc. Test vectors are supplied and parts of it are patented.
* FF3 is BPS named after the authors. It was submitted to NIST by Eric Brier, Thomas Peyrin and Jacques Stern of Ingenico, France. Authors declared to NIST that their algorithm is not patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/bps/bps-ip.pdf|title=BPS Authors Patent Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.voltage.com HPE Voltage] company although claims to own patents also for BPS mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.voltage.com/technology/standards/patents-and-research/|title=HPE Voltage patent claims}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/ffx/ffx-voltage-ip.pdf|title=Revides letter of assurance for essential patent claims FFX Mode of Operation for Format-Preserving Encryption}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2017, NIST concluded that FF3 is "no longer suitable as a general-purpose FPE method" because researchers found a vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3|title=Recent Cryptanalysis of FF3|last=|first=|date=12 April 2017|website=NIST|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mode was included in the draft NIST guidance but was removed before final publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2956">'''Francisco Javier González-Acuña''' (nickname "Fico") is a mathematician in the [[UNAM]]'s institute of mathematics and [[CIMAT]], specializing in [[low-dimensional topology]].

He did his graduate studies at [[Princeton University]], obtaining his Ph.D. in 1970. His thesis, written under the supervision of [[Ralph Fox]], was titled ''On homology spheres''.

An early result of González-Acuña is that a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is the [[homomorphic]] image of some [[knot group]] if and only if ''G'' is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and has weight at most one. This result  (a "remarkable theorem", as  [[Lee Neuwirth]] called it in his review),
was published in 1975 in the highly respected journal, [[Annals of Mathematics]].  In 1978, together with José María Montesinos, he answered a question posed by Fox, proving the existence of 2-knots whose groups have [[End (topology)|infinitely many ends]].

With Hamish Short, González-Acuña proposed and worked on the [[cabling conjecture]]: the only [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s in the [[3-sphere]] which admit a reducible [[Dehn surgery]], i.e. a surgery which results in a reducible 3-manifold, are the [[cable knot]]s.  This conjecture is one of the most relevant, unresolved questions in the theory of Dehn surgery on knots in the 3-sphere.

González-Acuña has made other significant contributions, which have been published in journals such as ''[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]]'', ''[[Topology]]''  and ''[[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A genus-2 surface]]

In [[mathematics]], '''genus''' (plural '''genera''') has a few different, but closely related, meanings. The most common concept, the genus of an (orientable) surface, is the number of "holes" it has. This is made more precise below.

==Topology==
===Orientable surface===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] --&gt;
[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|Donut or coffee cup?]]
The '''genus''' of a connected, [[orientability|orientable]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is an [[integer]] representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple [[curve]]s without rendering the resultant [[manifold]] disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal to the number of [[Handle (mathematics)|handles]] on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g'' for closed surfaces, where ''g'' is the genus. For surfaces with ''b'' boundary components, the equation reads ''χ'' =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''. In layman's terms, it's the number of "holes" an object has ("holes" interpreted in the sense of doughnut holes; a hollow sphere would be considered as having zero holes in this sense). A doughnut, or torus, has 1 such hole. A sphere has 0. The green surface pictured above has 2 holes of the relevant sort.

For instance:
* The [[sphere]] '''''S''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;''' and a [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] both have genus zero.
* A [[torus]] has genus one, as does the surface of a coffee mug with a handle. This is the source of the joke that "topologists are people who can't tell their donut from their coffee mug."

An explicit construction of surfaces of genus ''g'' is given in the article on the [[fundamental polygon]].
&lt;gallery caption="Genus of orientable surfaces" widths="100px" heights="100px" perrow="6"&gt;
File:Sphere filled blue.svg|genus 0
File:Torus illustration.png|genus 1
File:Double torus illustration.png|genus 2
File:Triple torus illustration.png|genus 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In simpler terms, the value of an orientable surface's genus is equal to the number of "holes" it has.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Genus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-orientable surfaces===
The '''[[orientability|non-orientable]] genus''', '''demigenus''', or '''Euler genus''' of a connected, non-orientable closed [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is a positive [[integer]] representing the number of [[cross-cap]]s attached to a [[sphere]]. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − ''k'', where ''k'' is the non-orientable genus.

For instance:
* A [[projective plane]] has non-orientable genus one.
* A [[Klein bottle]] has non-orientable genus two.

===Knot===
The '''[[genus of a knot|genus]]''' of a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] ''K'' is defined as the minimal genus of all [[Seifert surface]]s for ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2004|isbn=0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Seifert surface of a knot is however a [[manifold with boundary]], the boundary being the knot, i.e.
homeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.

===Handlebody===
The '''genus''' of a 3-dimensional [[handlebody]] is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.

For instance:
* A [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] has genus zero.
* A solid torus ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has genus one.

===Graph theory===
{{Main|Graph embedding}}
The '''genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus ''n''). Thus, a [[planar graph]] has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.

The '''non-orientable genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus ''n'').  (This number is also called the '''demigenus'''.)

The '''Euler genus''' is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps or on a sphere with ''n/2'' handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphs on surfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topological graph theory]] there are several definitions of the genus of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. [[Arthur T. White]] introduced the following concept. The [[genus of a group]] ''G'' is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) [[Cayley graph]] for ''G''.

The [[Graph embedding#Computational complexity|graph genus problem]] is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Carsten |last1=Thomassen |title= The graph genus problem is NP-complete |journal= Journal of Algorithms |year=1989 |issue=4 |volume=10 |pages=568&amp;ndash;576 |issn=0196-6774 |doi=10.1016/0196-6774(89)90006-0 | zbl=0689.68071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic geometry==
There are two related definitions of '''genus''' of any projective algebraic [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'': the [[arithmetic genus]] and the [[geometric genus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hirzebruch | first=Friedrich | authorlink=Friedrich Hirzebruch | title=Topological methods in algebraic geometry | others=Translation from the German and appendix one by R. L. E. Schwarzenberger. Appendix two by A. Borel | edition=Reprint of the 2nd, corr. print. of the 3rd | origyear=1978 | series=Classics in Mathematics | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1995 | isbn=3-540-58663-6 | zbl=0843.14009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''X'' is an [[algebraic curve]] with field of definition the [[complex number]]s, and if ''X'' has no [[tangent space|singular points]], then these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the [[Riemann surface]] of ''X'' (its [[manifold]] of complex points). For example, the definition of [[elliptic curve]] from algebraic geometry is ''connected non-singular projective curve of genus 1 with a given [[rational point]] on it''.

By the [[Riemann-Roch theorem#Applications|Riemann-Roch theorem]], an irreducible plane curve of degree ''d'' has geometric genus

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}-s,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the number of singularities when properly counted.

In [[probability and statistics]], the '''Gompertz distribution''' is a [[continuous probability distribution]], named after [[Benjamin Gompertz]] (1779 - 1865). The Gompertz distribution is often applied to describe the distribution of adult lifespans by [[demographer]]s&lt;ref name=Vaupel1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Preston2001/&gt; and [[actuaries]].&lt;ref name=Benjamin1980/&gt;&lt;ref name=Willemse2000/&gt; Related fields of science such as biology&lt;ref name=Economos1982/&gt; and gerontology&lt;ref name=Brown1974/&gt; also considered the Gompertz distribution for the analysis of survival. More recently, computer scientists have also started to model the failure rates of computer codes by the Gompertz distribution.&lt;ref name=Ohishi2009/&gt; In Marketing Science, it has been used as an individual-level simulation for [[customer lifetime value]] modeling.&lt;ref name=BG/&gt; In [[network theory]], particularly the [[Erdős–Rényi model]], the walk length of a random [[self-avoiding walk]] (SAW) is distributed according to the Gompertz distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Tishby, Biham, Katzav (2016), [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06613v1.pdf The distribution of path lengths of self avoiding walks on Erdős-Rényi networks], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06613 arXiv:1603.06613].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification ==

===Probability density function===

The [[probability density function]] of the Gompertz distribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(x;\eta, b\right)=b\eta e^{\eta} e^{bx}\exp\left(-\eta e^{bx} \right)\text{for }x \geq 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scale parameter]] and &lt;math&gt;\eta &gt; 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shape parameter]] of the Gompertz distribution. In the actuarial and biological sciences and in demography, the Gompertz distribution is parametrized slightly differently ([[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]).

===Cumulative distribution function===

The [[cumulative distribution function]] of the Gompertz distribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(x;\eta, b\right)= 1-\exp\left(-\eta\left(e^{bx}-1 \right)\right) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta, b&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x \geq 0 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Moment generating function===
The moment generating function is:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{E}\left(e^{-t X}\right)=\eta e^{\eta}\text{E}_{t/b}\left(\eta\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\text{E}_{t/b}\left(\eta\right)=\int_1^\infin e^{-\eta v} v^{-t/b}dv,\ t&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
The Gompertz distribution is a flexible distribution that can be skewed to the right and to the left. Its hazard function is a convex function of &lt;math&gt;F\left(x;\eta, b\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The model can be fitted into the innovation-imitation paradigm with 
&lt;math&gt; p = \eta b &lt;/math&gt; as the coefficient of innovation and &lt;math&gt;  b &lt;/math&gt; as the coefficient of imitation. When &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; becomes large, &lt;math&gt; z(t) &lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;. The model can also belong to the propensity-to-adopt paradigm with  
&lt;math&gt;\eta &lt;/math&gt; as the propensity to adopt and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; as the overall appeal of the new offering. 
===Shapes===
The Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:
* When &lt;math&gt;\eta \geq 1,\,&lt;/math&gt; the probability density function has its mode at 0.
* When &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \eta &lt; 1,\,&lt;/math&gt; the probability density function has its mode at
::&lt;math&gt;x^*=\left(1/b\right)\ln \left(1/\eta\right)\text {with }0 &lt; F\left(x^*\right)&lt;1-e^{-1} = 0.632121&lt;/math&gt;

===Kullback-Leibler divergence===
If &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; are the probability density functions of two Gompertz distributions, then their [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
D_{KL} (f_1 \parallel f_2) 
&amp; = \int_{0}^{\infty} f_1(x; b_1, \eta_1) \, \ln \frac{f_1(x; b_1, \eta_1)}{f_2(x; b_2, \eta_2)} dx \\
&amp; = \ln \frac{e^{\eta_1} \, b_1 \, \eta_1}{e^{\eta_2} \, b_2 \, \eta_2}
+ e^{\eta_1} \left[ \left(\frac{b_2}{b_1} - 1 \right) \, \operatorname{Ei}(- \eta_1)
+ \frac{\eta_2}{\eta_1^{\frac{b_2}{b_1}}} \, \Gamma \left(\frac{b_2}{b_1}+1, \eta_1 \right) \right]
- (\eta_1 + 1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[exponential integral]] and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the upper [[incomplete gamma function]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauckhage, C. (2014), [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3193.pdf Characterizations and Kullback-Leibler Divergence of Gompertz Distributions], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3193 arXiv:1402.3193].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related distributions ==
*If ''X'' is defined to be the result of sampling from a [[Gumbel distribution]] until a negative value ''Y'' is produced, and setting ''X''=&amp;minus;''Y'', then ''X'' has a Gompertz distribution.
*The [[gamma distribution]] is a natural [[conjugate prior]] to a Gompertz likelihood with known scale parameter &lt;math&gt;b \,\!.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=BG/&gt;
* When &lt;math&gt;\eta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; varies according to a [[gamma distribution]] with shape parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and scale parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (mean = &lt;math&gt;\alpha/\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;), the distribution of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is Gamma/Gompertz.&lt;ref name=BG/&gt;

== Applications ==
* In [[hydrology]] the Gompertz distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Gompertz distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% [[confidence belt]] based on the [[binomial distribution]]. The rainfall data are represented by [[plotting position]]s as part of the [[cumulative frequency analysis]].

== Definition ==
Given a [[groupoid]] &lt;math&gt;(G, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (in the sense of a [[category theory|category]] with all arrows invertible), it is possible to define the groupoid algebra &lt;math&gt;KG&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; formed by the [[vector space]] having the elements of (the arrows of) &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as [[generator (mathematics)|generator]]s and having the [[multiplication]] of these elements defined by &lt;math&gt;g * h = g \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;, whenever this product is defined, and &lt;math&gt;g * h = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. The product is then extended by [[linearity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dokuchaev, Exel &amp; Piccione (2000), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of groupoid algebras are the following:&lt;ref&gt;da Silva &amp; Weinstein (1999), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=2fcC1EGKz08C|page=97|text=groupoid algebras}} p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Algebra of functions|Algebras of functions]]

== Properties ==
* When a groupoid has a [[Wikt:finite|finite]] number of [[Object (category theory)|objects]] and a finite number of [[morphism (category theory)|morphisms]], the groupoid algebra is a [[direct sum]] of [[tensor product]]s of group algebras and matrix algebras.&lt;ref&gt;Khalkhali &amp; [[Matilde Marcolli|Marcolli]] (2008), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=HsTkPOj0iusC|page=210|text=Groupoid algebra of a finite groupoid}} p. 210]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IFRS 4''' is an [[International Financial Reporting Standard]] (IFRS) issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) providing guidance for the accounting of [[insurance contract]]s.  The standard was issued in March 2004, and was amended in 2005 to clarify that the standard covers most [[financial guarantee contract]]s.&lt;ref name=ifrs4&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS 4|url=http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2014/ifrs4.pdf|publisher=[[IASB]]|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paragraph 35 of IFRS also applies the standard to [[financial instrument]]s with discretionary participation features.&lt;ref name=ifrs4/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Actuarial Practices Relating to Accounting for Insurance Pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards|author=Frasca, R.|url=http://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Practice_note_on_Actuarial_Practices_Relating_to_Accounting_for_Insurance_Pursuant_to_International_Financial_Reporting_Standards_mar2011.pdf|accessdate=2014-09-13|date=March 2011|publisher=[[American Academy of Actuaries]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS 4 was intended to provide limited improvements to accounting for insurance contracts until the IASB completed the second, more comprehensive phase of its insurance accounting project.&lt;ref name=ifrs4/&gt;&lt;ref name=arthur&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting challenges faced by the insurance industry|author=Arthur, P.|url=https://www2.eycom.ch/publications/items/ifrs/news/20050517/en.pdf|publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|date=May 2005|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The replacement standard, [[IFRS 17]] was issued in May 2017 and will become effective on January 1, 2021, supplanting IFRS 4 at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IASB releases insurance contracts standard|author=Cohn, Michael|date=May 17, 2017|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/iasb-releases-insurance-contracts-standard|publisher=Accounting Today|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
Generally, IFRS 4 permitted companies to continue previous accounting practices for insurance contracts, but did enhance the disclosure requirements.&lt;ref name=arthur/&gt;  IFRS 4 defines an insurance contract as a "contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder."&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS 4 — Insurance Contracts|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/ifrs/ifrs4|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard provides definitions to distinguish "insurance risk" from "financial risk."&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;  IFRS 4 exempts insurance companies from certain other IFRS standards, including [[IAS 8]] on changes in accounting policies, until phase II is complete, but IFRS 4 does introduce its own requirements for changes in accounting policies.&lt;ref name=deloitte/&gt;

Among the accounting requirements IFRS 4 introduced are a requirement to test that insurance liabilities are adequate and that [[reinsurance]] assets are not [[Revaluation of fixed assets|impaired]].&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte/&gt;  It also prohibits setting up a liability for insurance claims that have not been incurred.&lt;ref name=deloitte/&gt;  Although insurance contracts are subject to the requirements of [[IFRS 9]] that [[embedded derivative]]s within other contracts be measured separately at [[fair value]], IFRS 4 makes a limited exception for embedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte/&gt;  Such embedded derivatives within insurance contracts do not need to be measured separately.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte/&gt;

==Criticism==
6 of the 14 IASB board members dissented from issuing IFRS 4.&lt;ref name=dissent&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS 4 Basis for Conclusions|chapter=Dissenting opinions on IFRS 4|pages=B462-B466|url=http://calculusgroup.co.za/LMS/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IFRS04.pdf|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Board members [[James J.

==Life and career==
He was born in Chantenay-sur-Loire (today part of [[Nantes]]). He studied at [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1926 to 1929.  He received his Ph.D. in 1933. In 1934 Leray published an important paper that founded the study of [[Weak solution|weak solutions]] of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1934|title=Sur le mouvement d'un liquide visqueux emplissant l'espace|url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~bterrell/leray.pdf|journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]|volume=63|pages=193–248|doi=10.1007/BF02547354|last=Leray|first= Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he and [[Juliusz Schauder]] discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leray|first=Jean|last2=Schauder|first2=Juliusz|authorlink=Juliusz Schauder|title=Topologie et équations fonctionelles|journal=[[Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure]]|year=1934|volume=51|pages=45–78|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1934_3_51__45_0| zbl=0009.07301 | jfm=60.0322.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a topological invariant, now called the [[Leray–Schauder degree]], which they applied to prove the existence of solutions for partial differential equations lacking uniqueness.

From 1938 to 1939 he was professor at the [[University of Nancy]]. He did not join the [[Bourbaki group]], although he was close with its founders.

His main work in [[topology]] was carried out while he was in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in [[Edelbach, Allentsteig|Edelbach, Austria]] from 1940 to 1945. He concealed his expertise on differential equations, fearing that its connections with [[applied mathematics]] could lead him to be asked to do war work.

Leray's work of this period proved seminal to the development of [[spectral sequence]]s and [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]].&lt;ref name="Dieudonné123"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dieudonné | first = Jean |authorlink=Jean Dieudonné | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 123–141 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsequently developed by many others,&lt;ref name=HaynesMiller&gt;{{cite web | last = Miller | first = Haynes |author-link=Haynes Miller | title = Leray in Oflag XVIIA: The origins of sheaf theory, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences | work = | publisher = | year = 2000 | url = http://www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/ss.pdf | format = }}&lt;/ref&gt; each separately becoming an important tool in [[homological algebra]].

He returned to work on partial differential equations from about 1950.

He was professor at the [[University of Paris]]  from 1945 to 1947, and then at the [[Collège de France]] until 1978.

He was awarded the Malaxa Prize ([[Romania]], 1938), the Grand Prix in mathematical sciences ([[French Academy of Sciences]], 1940), the [[Feltrinelli Prize]] ([[Accademia dei Lincei]], 1971), the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] ([[Israel]], 1979), and the [[Lomonosov Gold Medal]] ([[Moscow]], 1988).

''The Common Sense of Science'', Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the world's first university statistics department at [[University College London]] in 1911, and contributed significantly to the field of biometrics and [[meteorology]]. Pearson was also a proponent of [[social Darwinism]] and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1995q1-00229 "The Concept of Heredity in the History of Western Culture: Part One,"] ''The Mankind Quarterly'', Vol. XXXV, No. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;237.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson was a protégé and biographer of [[Francis Galton|Sir Francis Galton]].

==Biography==
Pearson was born in [[Islington]], London to William Pearson [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] of the [[Inner Temple]], and his wife Fanny (née Smith), and had two siblings, Arthur and Amy. Pearson was educated privately at [[University College School]], after which he went to [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 1876 to study mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PR875CK|name=Pearson, Carl (or Karl)}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1879 as Third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in the [[Mathematical Tripos]]. He then travelled to Germany to study physics at the [[University of Heidelberg]] under [[G H Quincke]] and metaphysics under [[Kuno Fischer]]. He next visited the [[University of Berlin]], where he attended the lectures of the physiologist [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] on [[Darwinism]] (Emil was a brother of [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], the mathematician). Pearson also studied Roman Law, taught by [[Bruns]] and [[Mommsen]], medieval and 16th century German Literature, and Socialism. He became an accomplished historian and [[Germanist]] and spent much of the 1880s in [[Berlin]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Vienna]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, [[Saig bei Lenzkirch]], and [[Brixlegg]]. He wrote on [[Passion plays]],&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1897). [https://archive.org/stream/chancesofdeathot02pearuoft#page/246/mode/2up "The German Passion-Play: A Study in the Evolution of Western Christianity,"] in ''The Chances of Death and Other Studies in Evolution''. London: Edward Arnold, pp. 246–406.&lt;/ref&gt; religion, [[Goethe]], [[Werther]], as well as sex-related themes,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1888). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicoffreethoug00pear#page/394/mode/2up "A Sketch of the Sex-Relations in Primitive and Mediæval Germany,"] in ''The Ethic of Freethought''. London: T. Fisher Unwin, pp. 395–426.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a founder of the [[Men and Women's Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Walkowitz, Judith R., History Workshop Journal 1986 21(1):37–59, p 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|right|Pearson with Sir Francis Galton, 1909 or 1910.]]
Pearson was offered a [[Germanics]] post at [[Kings College, Cambridge]]. Comparing Cambridge students to those he knew from Germany, Karl found German students inathletic and weak. He wrote his mother, "I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, but now I think it cannot be too highly valued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Warwick, Andrew |title=Masters of theory: Cambridge and the rise of mathematical physics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=2003 |chapter=4: Exercising the student body: Mathematics, manliness and athleticism |pages=176–226 |isbn=0-226-87375-7 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to England in 1880, Pearson first went to Cambridge:

{{quote|Back in Cambridge, I worked in the engineering shops, but drew up the schedule in Mittel- and Althochdeutsch for the Medieval Languages Tripos.&lt;ref name="Pearson, Karl 1934 p.&amp;nbsp;20"&gt;Pearson, Karl (1934). ''Speeches Delivered at a Dinner Held in University College, London, in Honour of Professor Karl Pearson, 23 April 1934''. Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his first book, ''The New Werther'', Pearson gives a clear indication of why he studied so many diverse subjects:

{{quote|I rush from science to philosophy, and from philosophy to our old friends the poets; and then, over-wearied by too much idealism, I fancy I become practical in returning to science. Have you ever attempted to conceive all there is in the world worth knowing—that not one subject in the universe is unworthy of study? The giants of literature, the mysteries of many-dimensional space, the attempts of Boltzmann and Crookes to penetrate Nature's very laboratory, the Kantian theory of the universe, and the latest discoveries in embryology, with their wonderful tales of the development of life—what an immensity beyond our grasp! [...] Mankind seems on the verge of a new and glorious discovery. What Newton did to simplify the planetary motions must now be done to unite in one whole the various isolated theories of mathematical physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1880). [https://archive.org/stream/newwertherbylok00peargoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''The New Werther'']. London: C, Kegan Paul &amp; Co., pp. 6, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pearson then returned to London to study law, emulating his father. Quoting Pearson's own account:
{{quote|Coming to London, I read in chambers in Lincoln's Inn, drew up bills of sale, and was called to the Bar, but varied legal studies by lecturing on heat at Barnes, on Martin Luther at Hampstead, and on [[Ferdinand Lassalle|Lassalle]] and Marx on Sundays at revolutionary clubs around Soho.&lt;ref name="Pearson, Karl 1934 p.&amp;nbsp;20"/&gt;}}

His next career move was to the [[Inner Temple]], where he read law until 1881 (although he never practised). After this, he returned to mathematics, deputising for the mathematics professor at [[King's College, London]] in 1881 and for the professor at [[University College, London]] in 1883. In 1884, he was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College, London. Pearson became the editor of ''Common Sense of the Exact Sciences'' (1885) when [[William Kingdon Clifford]] died. 1891 saw him also appointed to the professorship of [[Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]]; here he met [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]], a zoologist who had some interesting problems requiring quantitative solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Provine, William B. (2001). ''The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics''. University of Chicago Press, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration, in [[biometry]] and [[evolution]]ary theory, was a fruitful one and lasted until Weldon died in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Tankard, James W. (1984). ''The Statistical Pioneers'', Schenkman Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Weldon introduced Pearson to [[Charles Darwin]]'s cousin [[Francis Galton]], who was interested in aspects of evolution such as heredity and [[eugenics]]. Pearson became Galton's protégé, at times to the verge of [[Apotheosis|hero worship]].{{citation needed| date= June 2017}}

In 1890 Pearson married Maria Sharpe. The couple had three children: Sigrid Loetitia Pearson, Helga Sharpe Pearson, and [[Egon Pearson]], who became a statistician himself and succeeded his father as head of the Applied Statistics Department at University College. Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory. He and his family lived at 7 Well Road in [[Hampstead]], now marked with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://openplaques.org/plaques/230 "Karl Pearson Blue Plaque,"] at Openplaques.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Galton's death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography — a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs — published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson's own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done "to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public", triumphed Galton's life, work and personal heredity. He predicted that Galton, rather than [[Charles Darwin]], would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of [[Erasmus Darwin]].

When Galton died, he left the residue of his estate to the [[University of London]] for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair — the ''Galton Chair of Eugenics'', later the ''Galton Chair of Genetics''&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, Tom (2011). ''The Chief Sea Lion's Inheritance: Eugenics and the Darwins''. Troubador Pub., p.&amp;nbsp;108. Also see Pearson, Roger (1991). ''Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe''. Scott-Townsend Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;—in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics (with financial support from the [[Drapers' Company]]), into which he incorporated the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He remained with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death at [[Coldharbour, Surrey]] on 27 April 1936.

Pearson was a "zealous" atheist and a freethinker.&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch.

==Family==

He married twice. First in 1890 to Maria Sharpe; Then following Maria's death in 1928, he married Margaret Victoria Child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Einstein and Pearson's work==
When the 23-year-old [[Albert Einstein]] started the [[Olympia Academy]] study group in 1902, with his two younger friends, [[Maurice Solovine]] and Conrad Habicht, his first reading suggestion was Pearson's ''[[The Grammar of Science]]''. This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Christopher (2001). "Karl Pearson and the Human Form Divine," in ''Victorian Relativity: Radical Thought and Scientific Discovery'', Chicago University Press, pp. 145–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed [[antimatter]], the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]], and wrinkles in time.

Pearson's [[principle of relativity|relativity]] was based on [[idealism]], in the sense of ideas or pictures in a [[mind]]. "There are many signs," he wrote, "that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude [[materialism]] of the older physicists." (Preface to 2nd Ed., ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'') Further, he stated, "...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind..." "In truth, the field of science is much more [[consciousness]] than an external world." (''Ibid.'', Ch. II, § 6) "Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man." (''Ibid.'', Ch. III, § 4)&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1900).

==Politics and eugenics==
[[File:Karl Pearson, 1910.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Karl Pearson at work, 1910.]]
A eugenicist who applied his [[social Darwinism]] to entire nations, Pearson saw war against "inferior races" as a logical implication of the theory of evolution. "My view – and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation," he wrote, "is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1901). [https://archive.org/stream/nationallifefro00peargoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''National Life from the Standpoint of Science'']. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned that, if [[August Weismann]]'s theory of [[germ plasm]] is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock.

Weismann claimed that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. Therefore, training benefits only the trained generation. Their children will not exhibit the learned improvements and, in turn, will need to be improved. "No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1892). Introduction to [https://archive.org/stream/grammarofscience00pearrich#page/n9/mode/2up ''The Grammar of Science'']. London: Water Scott, p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

"History shows me one way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the struggle of race with race, and the survival of the physically and mentally fitter race. If you want to know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1901). [https://archive.org/stream/nationallifefro00peargoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''National Life from the Standpoint of Science'']. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearson was known in his lifetime as a prominent "[[Freethought|freethinker]]" and socialist. He gave lectures on such issues as "the woman's question" (this was the era of the [[suffragette|suffragist movement]] in the UK)&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Karl (1888). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicoffreethoug00pear#page/370/mode/2up "The Woman's Question,"] in ''The Ethic of Freethought''. London: T. Fisher Unwin, pp. 370–394.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon [[Karl Marx]]. His commitment to socialism and its ideals led him to refuse the offer of being created an OBE ([[British honours system|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]]) in 1920 and also to refuse a [[knighthood]] in 1935.

In ''The Myth of the Jewish Race''&lt;ref&gt;Patai, Raphael, &amp; Jennifer Patai (1989). ''The Myth of the Jewish Race''. Wayne State University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;146. {{isbn|978-0814319482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael and Jennifer Patai cite Karl Pearson's 1925 opposition (in the first issue of the journal ''Annals of Eugenics'' which he founded) to Jewish immigration into Britain. Pearson alleged that these immigrants "will develop into a parasitic race. [...] Taken ''on the average'', and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearson | first1 = Karl | last2 = Moul | first2 = Margaret | year = 1925 | title= The Problem of Alien Immigration into Great Britain, Illustrated by an Examination of Russian and Polish Jewish Children| url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1925.tb02037.x/full | journal = Annals of Eugenics | volume = I | issue = 2| pages = 125–126| doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1925.tb02037.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to biometrics ==
Karl Pearson was important in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farrall|first=Lyndsay A.|date=August 1975|title=Controversy and Conflict in Science: A Case Study  The English Biometric School and Mendel's Laws|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=5|pages=269–301|via=|doi=10.1177/030631277500500302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the [[chi-squared test]], [[standard deviation]], and [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] and [[Regression analysis|regression]] coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Karl|date=1897|title=Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution. On the Law of Ancestral Heredity|jstor=115747|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=62|pages=386–412|bibcode=1897RSPS...62..386P|doi=10.1098/rspl.1897.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Pearson was a follower of [[Francis Galton|Galton]], and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the [[Mendelians]], focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelian's favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pence|first=Charles H.|date=2015|title=The early history of chance in evolution|url=|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=50|pages=48–58|via=|doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2014.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Pearson, the theory of evolution was not intended to identify a biological mechanism that explained patterns of inheritance, whereas the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian's]] postulated the [[gene]] as the mechanism for inheritance. Pearson criticized [[William Bateson|Bateson]] and other biologists for their failure to adopt biometrical techniques in their study of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Margaret|date=1 March 2002|title=Modelling Populations: Pearson and Fisher on Mendelism and Biometry|url=|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=53|pages=39–68|via=|doi=10.1093/bjps/53.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson criticized biologists who did not focus on the statistical validity of their theories, stating that "before we can accept [any cause of a progressive change] as a factor we must have not only shown its plausibility but if possible have demonstrated its quantitative ability"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100579982|title=The grammar of science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|date=1892|publisher=Walter Scott ; Charles Scribner's Sons|year=|isbn=|series=The contemporary science series|location=London : New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists had succumb to "almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity," which had replaced the process of experimental data collection that actually might allow scientists to narrow down potential theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Karl|date=1896-01-01|title=Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution. III. Regression, Heredity, and Panmixia|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/187/253|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=187|pages=253–318|doi=10.1098/rsta.1896.0007|issn=1364-503X|bibcode=1896RSPTA.187..253P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Pearson, laws of nature were useful for making accurate predictions and for concisely describing trends in observed data.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Causation was the experience "that a certain sequence has occurred and recurred in the past".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus, identifying a particular mechanism of genetics was not a worthy pursuit of biologists, who should instead focus on mathematical descriptions of empirical data. This, in part led to the fierce debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians, including [[William Bateson|Bateson]]. After Bateson rejected one of Pearson's manuscripts that described a new theory for the variability of an offspring, or homotyposis, Pearson and Weldon established [[Biometrika]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillham|first=Nicholas|date=9 August 2013|title=The Battle Between the Biometricians and the Mendelians: How Sir Francis Galton Caused his Disciples to Reach Conflicting Conclusions About the Hereditary Mechanism|url=|journal=Science &amp; Education|volume=24|pages=61–75|via=|doi=10.1007/s11191-013-9642-1|bibcode=2015Sc&amp;Ed..24...61G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the biometric approach to inheritance eventually lost to the Mendelian approach, the techniques Pearson and the biometricians at the time developed are vital to studies of biology and evolution today.

==Awards from professional bodies==
Pearson achieved widespread recognition across a range of disciplines and his membership of, and awards from, various professional bodies reflects this:
*1896: elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]: Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref name="rscat" /&gt;
*1898: awarded the [[Darwin Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=PEARSON, Karl|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1911: awarded the honorary degree of LLD from the [[University of St Andrews]]
*1911: awarded a DSc from University of London
*1920: offered (and refused) the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]
*1932: awarded the Rudolf Virchow medal by the Berliner Anthropologische Gesellschaft
*1935: offered (and refused) a [[knight]]hood

He was also elected an Honorary Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, University College London and the Royal Society of Medicine, and a Member of the Actuaries' Club. A [[sesquicentenary#Latin-derived numerical names|sesquicentenary]] conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref name="year150" /&gt;

==Contributions to statistics==
Pearson's work was all-embracing in the wide application and development of mathematical statistics, and encompassed the fields of [[biology]], [[epidemiology]], anthropometry, medicine, [[psychology]] and social history.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Donald (1981). ''Statistics in Britain, 1865–1930: The Social Construction of Scientific Knowledge'', Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, with Weldon and Galton, he founded the journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' whose object was the development of statistical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hald, Anders (1998). ''A History of Mathematical Statistics from 1750 to 1930''. Wiley, p.&amp;nbsp;651.&lt;/ref&gt; He edited this journal until his death. Among those who assisted Pearson in his research were a number of female mathematicians who included [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave]]. He also founded the journal ''Annals of Eugenics'' (now ''[[Annals of Human Genetics]]'') in 1925. He published the ''[[Drapers' Company]] Research Memoirs'' largely to provide a record of the output of the Department of Applied Statistics not published elsewhere.

Pearson's thinking underpins many of the 'classical' statistical methods which are in common use today. Examples of his contributions are:

*[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Correlation coefficient]]. The correlation coefficient (first conceived by [[Francis Galton]]) was defined as a product-moment, and its relationship with [[linear regression]] was studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1214/ss/1177012580 | last1 = Stigler | first1 = S. M. | year = 1989 | title = Francis Galton's Account of the Invention of Correlation | url = | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 73–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Method of moments (statistics)|Method of moments]]. Pearson introduced [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]], a concept borrowed from [[physics]], as descriptive statistics and for the fitting of distributions to samples.
*[[Pearson distribution|Pearson's system of continuous curves]]. A system of continuous univariate probability distributions that came to form the basis of the now conventional continuous probability distributions. Since the system is complete up to the fourth moment, it is a powerful complement to the Pearsonian method of moments.
*[[Mahalanobis distance|Chi distance]]. A precursor and special case of the [[Mahalanobis distance]].&lt;ref name="Pearson, On the criterion"&gt;{{Cite magazine | last1 = Pearson | first1 = K. | year = 1900 | title = On the Criterion that a given System of Deviations from the Probable in the Case of a Correlated System of Variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from Random Sampling | url = |magazine=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5 | volume = 50 | issue = 302| pages = 157–175 | doi=10.1080/14786440009463897}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[p-value]]. Defined as the probability measure of the complement of the [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] with the hypothesized value as center point and chi distance as radius.&lt;ref name="Pearson, On the criterion"/&gt;

The use of [[Type I error|preset evidence criteria]], so called alpha type-I error probabilities, was later proposed by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = E.

==History==
The '''Kermeta''' language was initiated by Franck Fleurey in 2005 within the [http://www.irisa.fr/triskell Triskell] team of [[IRISA]] (gathering researchers of the [[INRIA]], [[CNRS]], [[Institut national des sciences appliquées|INSA]] and the [[University of Rennes]] 1).

The Kermeta language borrows concepts from languages such [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]], [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] and [[QVT]], but also from BasicMTL, a model transformation language implemented in 2004 in the Triskell team by D. Vojtisek and F. Fondement.  It is also inspired by the previous experience on MTL, the first transformation language created by Triskell, and by the Xion action language for [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].

The name Kermeta is an abbreviation for "Kernel Metamodeling" and reflects the fact that the language is conceived as a core for (meta-)modeling. The [[Breton language]] consonance of this name is an intentional reflection of the Triskell team's location in Brittany.

Kermeta, and its execution platform under [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] is currently available under its version 2.0.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vojtisek|first=Didier|title=Version 2.0.4 is released !|url=https://gforge.inria.fr/forum/forum.php?forum_id=11204|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2012. It is [[open-source]], under the [[Eclipse Public License]].

==Philosophy==
Kermeta is a modeling and [[aspect oriented programming]] language.  Its underlying metamodel conforms to the [[EMOF]] standard.  It is designed to write programs which are also models, to write transformations of models (programs that transform a model into another), to write constraints on these models, and to execute them 1).  The goal of this model approach is to bring an additional level of abstraction on top of the "object" level and thus to see a given system like a set of concepts (and instances of concepts) that form an explicitly coherent whole, which one will call a model.

Kermeta thus brings:

* all the concepts of EMOF used for the specifications of a model.
* a real concept of model, more precisely of model type (Jim Steel).
* a concrete syntax that fits well to model and metamodel writing.
* two paradigms:  the object, and the model. 
* a bridge towards the Eclipse [[ECore]] formalism

==Characteristics ==
The main characteristics of the Kermeta language are :

*[[imperative programming|imperative]]: traditional structures of control
*[[object-oriented]]: multiple inheritance, late binding
*[[model-oriented]]: first-class concepts of associations and composition 
*[[aspect-oriented]]: integrate a simple but powerful weaver for simple meta-modeling tasks. Arbitrary complex weaving is achieved using a dedicated composer written in Kermeta. This allows to extend existing metamodel. Especially in order to add behavior to them by weaving behavioral [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantic]] (operational or translational).
*[[design by contract]]: operations support pre and post conditions, classes use invariants.
*[[functional programming|functional]]:  functions and first class lambda-expressions
*statically typed:  genericity for the classes and the operations, function types... 
*complete [[Type introspection|introspection]]:  the complete model of the program is available during execution.

==Syntax==
The curious reader will find further information on the [http://www.kermeta.org Kermeta website].

        var validTransitions : Collection&lt;Transition&gt; 
        validTransitions :=    outgoingTransition.select { t | t.input.equals(c) }
        // Check if there is one and only one valid transition
        if validTransitions.empty then raise "No Transition!" end

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12867">'''Kerner’s breakdown minimization principle (BM principle)''' is a principle for the optimization of vehicular traffic networks introduced by [[Boris Kerner]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Kerner2011A"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/9/092001|title=Optimum principle for a vehicular traffic network: Minimum probability of congestion|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|volume=44|issue=9|pages=092001|year=2011|last1=Kerner|first1=Boris S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The BM principle states that the optimum of a traffic network with ''N'' network [[Traffic bottleneck|bottlenecks]] is reached, when dynamic traffic optimization and/or control are performed in the network in such a way that the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown in at least one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time reaches the minimum possible value. The BM principle is equivalent to the maximization of the probability that traffic breakdown occurs at none of the network bottlenecks.

== Empirical ground ==

The empirical ground for Kerner’s BM principle is the set of fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck found in measured traffic data:

# Traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a local phase transition from free flow (F) to congested traffic whose downstream front is usually fixed at the bottleneck location. Within this front, vehicles accelerate from congested traffic to free flow downstream of the bottleneck. 
# At the same bottleneck, traffic breakdown can be either spontaneous (Figure 1(a)) or induced (Figure 1 (b)).
# The probability of traffic breakdown is an increasing flow rate function.
# There is a well-known [[hysteresis]] phenomenon associated with traffic breakdown: When the breakdown has occurred at some flow rates with resulting congested pattern formation upstream of the bottleneck, then a return transition to free flow at the bottleneck is usually observed at considerably smaller flow rates (Figure 2). 
A spontaneous traffic breakdown occurs, where there are free flows both upstream and downstream of the bottleneck before the breakdown has occurred (Fig. 1(a)). In contrast, an induced traffic breakdown is caused by a propagation of a congested pattern that has earlier emerged for example at another downstream bottleneck (Figure 1 (b)).

The set 1–4  of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck has first been explained in [[three-phase traffic theory|Kerner’s three-phase theory]]  (Figure 3). In Kerner’s theory there are three phases: Free flow (F), synchronized flow (S),  wide moving jam (J).  Synchronized flow and wide moving jam are associated with congested traffic. The synchronized flow phase is defined as congested traffic whose downstream front is fixed at the bottleneck. Therefore, in accordance with empirical feature 1 traffic breakdown is a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (called ''F'' → ''S'' transition). The main feature of an ''F'' → ''S'' transition is as follows (Figure 3 (c, d)):  There is a broad range of flow rates on a link of the traffic network between the minimum and maximum capacities of free flow. Within this range of flow rates traffic breakdown occurs with some probability, which depends on the flow rate (Figure 3 (c)).

== Mathematical formulation ==

Assuming that at different bottlenecks traffic breakdown occurs independently, the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown in at least one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{net}=1-\prod^N_{k=1}(1-P^{(B,k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

In accordance with the BM principle, the network optimum is reached at

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_M}\{P_\mathrm{net}( q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_M)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the number of network links for which flow rates can be adjusted;  &lt;math&gt;q_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the link inflow rate for a link with index &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;m=1,2,\ldots,M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the bottleneck index, &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,N&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;N&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; P^{(B,k)}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that during the observation time interval  traffic breakdown occurs at bottleneck with index &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

== Simulations ==

Results of simulations of the BM principle for a simple network consisting of only two routes are shown in Figure 4(a). Although the probability of traffic breakdown is an increasing flow rate function for each of the bottlenecks (Figure 3(c)), the probability of traffic breakdown in the network &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{net}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum as a function of the link inflow rates &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 4(b, c)). 
[[File:Simulations of the BM principle.png|thumb|Figure 4: Simulations of the BM principle for simple network model shown in (a). (b, c) probability of traffic breakdown in the network &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{net}&lt;/math&gt;  found with the BM principle. In (a), alternative routes 1 and 2 have lengths &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_2&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;; routes 1 and 2 are roads with on-ramp bottlenecks whose on-ramp inflow rates &lt;math&gt;q_{on1}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;q_{on2}&lt;/math&gt;  are given constants. Network optimization is performed through the assignment of a network inflow with the rate &lt;math&gt;q_O&lt;/math&gt; between network links &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;m=2&lt;/math&gt;.]]

=== Alternative routes in a network ===

Before the BM principle is applied to a large traffic network, for each of the origin-destination (O–D) pairs of the network a set of alternative routes (paths) should be found. The alternative routes can be calculated based on the following assumptions: (i) there is free flow in the whole network and (ii) the maximum difference between travel times for alternative routes does not exceed a given value that can be chosen differently for different O–D pairs.

=== How to apply the BM principle if traffic breakdown has already occurred at a network bottleneck ===

Network optimization with measured features of traffic breakdown can consist of the stages: (i) A spatial limitation of congestion growth with the subsequent congestion dissolution at the bottleneck, if the dissolution of congestion due to traffic management in a neighborhood of the bottleneck is possible. (ii) The minimization of traffic breakdown probability with the BM principle in the remaining network, i.e., the network part that is not influenced by congestion.

== The BM principle and classical Wardrop’s UE and SO principles ==

The BM principle is an alternative to well-known principles for vehicular network optimization and control based on the minimization of travel costs (travel time, fuel consumption, etc.) or the maximization of traffic throughput (like the maximization of band width of green wave in a city).&lt;ref name="Wardrop"&gt;Wardrop J.G.

Traffic Networks, Optimization and Control of Urban. In Encyclopedia of Complexity and System Science, ed. by R.A. Meyers. Springer, Berlin, pp. 9470—9500.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the most prominent classical principles for the minimization of travel costs in a traffic network are Wardrop’s [[Wardrop's Principle|user equilibrium]] (UE) and [[Wardrop's Principle|system optimum]] (SO) principles&lt;ref name="Wardrop" /&gt; that are widely used in a theory of dynamic traffic assignment in the network.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peeta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rakha" /&gt; Wardrop's SO and UE principles have been explained in Secs. 7.1 and 7.2 of Wikipedia article [[traffic flow]].

However, when the flow rate on a link of a network is between the maximum and minimum capacities, there may be at least two different states of a bottleneck on the link denoted by circles F and S shown in Figure 3 (d). The state F is related to free flow and state S to synchronized flow. Therefore, hypothetically assuming that each of the link flow rates for each of the N network bottlenecks is between the associated minimum and maximum bottleneck capacities, we find that there may be &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt;  different bottleneck states in the network at the same distribution of the flow rates in the network. If we apply an optimization algorithm associated with the minimization of travel cost in the network random transitions between these bottleneck states F and S may occur at different network bottlenecks during network optimization and/or control.

Rather than some travel costs, in the BM principle the objective function that should be minimized is the probability of traffic breakdown in the network &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{net}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the objective function in the BM principle that should be minimized depends neither on travel time nor other travel cost. The BM principle demands the minimization of the probability of traffic breakdown, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of congestion in the network. Under great traffic demand, the application of the BM principle should result in relatively small travel cost associated with free flow in a network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8566">While a `type` is a description of a specific set of values, a `kind` is a descripton of a specific quantity of `types` as in 1, 2, 3, etc. Some `type` constructors, such as a `Monad`, require only one `type` to be able to fully construct a new `type` while others may require two or three `types` to completely construct/describe their `type`. Still, another `type` constuctor may return a `type` constructor that requires even more `types`. Note, that the function `type` constructor, `-&gt;`, has a `kind` of 2 and is shown as, `(* -&gt; *)`, where `*` represents a `kind`. The idea of kinds generalizes the notion of generics.

In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''kind''' is the type of a [[type constructor]] or, less commonly, the type of a [[higher-order type operator]]. A kind system is essentially a [[simply typed lambda calculus]] "one level up", endowed with a primitive type, denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and called "type", which is the kind of any [[data type]] which does not need any [[parametric polymorphism|type parameters]].

A kind is sometimes confusingly described as the "type of a [[data type|(data) type]]", but it is actually more of an [[arity]] specifier. Syntactically, it is natural to consider polymorphic types to be type constructors, thus non-polymorphic types to be [[nullary]] type constructors. But all nullary constructors, thus all monomorphic types, have the same, simplest kind; namely &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Since higher-order type operators are uncommon in [[programming language]]s, in most programming practice, kinds are used to distinguish between data types and the types of constructors which are used to implement [[parametric polymorphism]]. Kinds appear, either explicitly or implicitly, in languages whose type systems account for parametric polymorphism in a programatically accessible way, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]&lt;!-- have to check Scala, but I bet it allows parametric polymorphism --&gt;.&lt;ref name="higherkinds"&gt;[https://adriaanm.github.com/files/higher.pdf Generics of a Higher Kind]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type", is the kind of all [[data type]]s seen as [[nullary]] type constructors, and also called proper types in this context. This normally includes function types in [[functional programming language]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], e.g. of a [[list type]] constructor.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] type constructor (via [[currying]]), e.g. of a [[pair type]] constructor, and also that of a [[function type]] constructor (not to be confused with the result of its application, which itself is a function type, thus of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a higher-order type operator from unary type constructors to proper types.&lt;ref&gt; Pierce (2002), chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds in Haskell ==
(''Note'': Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds.)

[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s kind system&lt;ref name="haskell98"&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1 Kinds - The Haskell 98 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; has just two rules:{{Vague|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--does this mean it prohibits higher order type operators? I can't tell from the report. --&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type" is the kind of all [[data type]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], which takes a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.

An inhabited type (as proper types are called in Haskell) is a type which has values. For instance, ignoring [[type class]]es which complicate the picture, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints). Therefore, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; have kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but so does any function type, for instance &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;.

A type constructor takes one or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports [[partial application]] thanks to currying.&lt;ref name=haskell-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 4 Declarations and Binding|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch4.html#x10-65017x3|work=Haskell 2010 Language Report|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miran|first=Lipovača|title=Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!|url=http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses|work=Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type of the elements of the list. Hence, &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints), &lt;code&gt;[Float]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Floats) and even &lt;code&gt;[&amp;#91;Int&amp;#93;]&lt;/code&gt; (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; type constructor. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is a type of kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, applying it to &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; results in &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt;, of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. The 2-[[tuple]] constructor &lt;code&gt;(,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, the 3-tuple constructor &lt;code&gt;(,,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
&lt;!-- needs rewriting to say what it really wants to  say, that is how kind inference is performed, but note that no kind polymorphism is allowed, so it's not quite the same.
The way kinds govern types is analogous to the way types govern values. If an expression &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1 \to t_2&lt;/math&gt; (that is, it is a function which accepts a type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the function application &lt;math&gt;f \ x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly if an expression &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt;, and type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the type application &lt;math&gt;t_1 \ t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

=== Kind inference ===

Standard Haskell does not allow [[polymorphic kind]]s. This is in contrast to [[parametric polymorphism]] on types, which is supported in Haskell.  For instance, in the following example:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree z  = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
&lt;/source&gt;

the kind of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; could be anything, including &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but also &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; etc. Haskell by default will always infer kinds to be &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, unless the type explicitly indicates otherwise (see below). Therefore the type checker will reject the following use of &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- invalid
&lt;/source&gt;

because the kind of &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; does not match the expected kind for &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, which is always &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Higher-order type operators are allowed however. For instance:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data App unt z = Z (unt z)
&lt;/source&gt;

has kind &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;code&gt;unt&lt;/code&gt; is expected to be a unary data constructor, which gets applied to its argument, which must be a type, and returns another type.

[[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] has the extension &lt;code&gt;PolyKinds&lt;/code&gt;, which, together with &lt;code&gt;KindSignatures&lt;/code&gt;, allows polymorphic kinds. For example:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree (z :: k) = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- OK
&lt;/source&gt;

In GHC 8.0.1, types and kinds can merged using the experimental compiler option &lt;code&gt;-XTypeInType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XTypeInType&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''k'' = 1, ''n'' = 2, ''T''='''R''' the inequality was first proved by Edmund Landau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=E.|last= Landau|title=Ungleichungen für zweimal differenzierbare Funktionen|journal=Proc.

Following contributions by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Georgiy Shilov]], Andrey Kolmogorov found the sharp constants and arbitrary ''n'', ''k'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolmogorov|first=A.|title=On Inequalities Between the Upper Bounds of the Successive Derivatives of an Arbitrary Function on an Infinite Integral|journal=Amer.

Math. Monthly|volume= 80|pages=121&amp;ndash;158|year=1973|doi=10.2307/2318373}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicit forms for the sharp constants are however still unknown.

==Generalisations==

There are many generalisations, which are of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\|f^{(k)}\|_{L_q(T)} \le K \cdot {\|f\|^\alpha_{L_p(T)}} \cdot {\|f^{(n)}\|^{1-\alpha}_{L_r(T)}}\text{ for }1\le k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

Here all three norms can be different from each other (from ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''L&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'', with ''p''=''q''=''r''=∞ in the classical case) and ''T'' may be the real axis, semiaxis or a closed segment.

The [[Kallman–Rota inequality]] generalizes the Landau–Kolmogorov inequalities from the derivative operator to more general [[Contraction (operator theory)|contractions]] on [[Banach space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In mathematics, '''Legendre's equation''' is the [[Diophantine equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2+by^2+cz^2=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation is named for [[Adrien Marie Legendre]] who proved in 1785 that it is solvable in integers ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', not all zero, if and only if
&amp;minus;''bc'', &amp;minus;''ca'' and &amp;minus;''ab'' are [[quadratic residue]]s modulo ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', respectively, where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are nonzero, [[Square-free integer|square-free]], [[Pairwise coprime|pairwise relatively prime integers]], not all positive or all negative .

'''Mohr–Coulomb theory''' is a [[mathematical model]] (see [[yield surface]]) describing the response of brittle materials such as [[concrete]], or rubble piles, to shear [[Stress (physics)|stress]] as well as normal stress. Most of the classical engineering materials somehow follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope.  Generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;Juvinal, Robert C. &amp; Marshek, Kurt .; Fundamentals of machine component design. – 2nd ed., 1991, pp. 217, {{ISBN|0-471-62281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geotechnical engineering]] it is used to define  [[Shear strength (soil)|shear strength of soils]] and rocks at different [[effective stress]]es.

In [[structural engineering]] it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of [[fracture]] of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials.  [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]'s [[friction]] hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. [[Mohr's circle]] is used to determine which principal stresses that will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the [[principle of normality]] the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition.

It can be shown that a material failing according to Coulomb's friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the [[angle of friction]]. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external [[mechanical work]] introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the  [[Deformation (mechanics)#strain|strain]] and stress at the line of failure. By [[conservation of energy]] the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the failure load of the construction.

A common improvement of this model is to combine Coulomb's friction hypothesis with [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine's]] principal stress hypothesis to describe a separation fracture.

== History of the development ==
The Mohr–Coulomb theory is named in honour of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] and [[Christian Otto Mohr]].  Coulomb's contribution was a 1773 essay entitled "''Essai sur une application des règles des maximis et minimis à quelques problèmes de statique relatifs à l'architecture''"
&lt;!--C.A. Coulomb, Essai sur une application des regles des maximis et minimis a quelquels problemesde statique relatifs, a la architecture, Mem. Acad. Roy. Div. Sav., 7, 343–387, 1776.--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;AMIR R. KHOEI;  &lt;u&gt;Computational Plasticity in Powder Forming Processes&lt;/u&gt;;  Elsevier, Amsterdam;  2005;  449 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohr developed a generalised form of the theory around the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;MAO-HONG YU;  "''Advances in strength theories for materials under complex stress state in the 20th Century''";  &lt;u&gt;Applied Mechanics Reviews&lt;/u&gt;;  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, U.S.A.;  May 2002;  '''55''' (3): pp. 169–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the generalised form affected the interpretation of the criterion, but not the substance of it, some texts continue to refer to the criterion as simply the ''''Coulomb criterion''''.&lt;ref&gt;NIELS SAABYE OTTOSEN and MATTI RISTINMAA;  &lt;u&gt;The Mechanics of Constitutive Modeling&lt;/u&gt;;  Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;  2005;  pp. 165ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion ==
[[Image:Mohr Coulomb Yield Surface 3Da.png|300px|right|thumb|Figure 1: View of Mohr–Coulomb failure surface in 3D space of principal stresses for &lt;math&gt;c=2, \phi=-20^\circ&lt;/math&gt;]]
The Mohr–Coulomb&lt;ref&gt;Coulomb, C. A. (1776). ''Essai sur une application des regles des maximis et minimis a quelquels problemesde statique relatifs, a la architecture.'' Mem. Acad. Roy. Div. Sav., vol. 7, pp. 343–387.&lt;/ref&gt; failure criterion represents the linear envelope that is obtained from a plot of the shear strength of a material versus the applied normal stress. This relation is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau = \sigma~\tan(\phi) + c
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the shear strength, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the normal stress, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the intercept of the failure envelope with the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; axis, and &lt;math&gt;tan(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the failure envelope. The quantity &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is often called the '''cohesion''' and the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''' angle of internal friction '''. Compression is assumed to be positive in the following discussion. If compression is assumed to be negative then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced with &lt;math&gt;-\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion reduces to the [[Yield surface#Tresca yield surface|Tresca criterion]]. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;\phi = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; the Mohr–Coulomb model is equivalent to the Rankine model. Higher values of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are not allowed.

From [[Mohr's circle]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma = \sigma_m - \tau_m \sin\phi ~;~~ \tau = \tau_m \cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_m = \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} ~;~~  \sigma_m = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum principal stress and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum principal stress.

Therefore, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion may also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau_m = \sigma_m \sin\phi + c \cos\phi ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

This form of the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is applicable to failure on a plane that is parallel to the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; direction.

=== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion in three dimensions ===
The Mohr–Coulomb criterion in three dimensions is often expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{\begin{align}
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_1 - \sigma_2}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi) \\
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_3}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_2 + \sigma_3}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi)\\
  \pm\cfrac{\sigma_3 - \sigma_1}{2} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\sigma_3 + \sigma_1}{2}\right]\sin(\phi) + c\cos(\phi).
\end{align}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Yield surface#Mohr – Coulomb yield surface|Mohr–Coulomb failure surface]] is a cone with a hexagonal cross section in deviatoric stress space.

The expressions for &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be generalized to three dimensions by developing expressions for the normal stress and the resolved shear stress on a plane of arbitrary orientation with respect to the coordinate axes (basis vectors). If the unit normal to the plane of interest is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{n} = n_1~\mathbf{e}_1 + n_2~\mathbf{e}_2 + n_3~\mathbf{e}_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i,~~ i=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; are three orthonormal unit basis vectors, and if the principal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; are aligned with the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the expressions for &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
    \sigma &amp; = n_1^2 \sigma_{1} + n_2^2 \sigma_{2} + n_3^2 \sigma_{3} \\
    \tau &amp; = \sqrt{(n_1\sigma_{1})^2 + (n_2\sigma_{2})^2 + (n_3\sigma_{3})^2 - \sigma^2} \\
         &amp; = \sqrt{n_1^2 n_2^2 (\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2 + n_2^2 n_3^2 (\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2 +
                   n_3^2 n_1^2 (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2}.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion can then be evaluated using the usual expression
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau = \sigma~\tan(\phi) + c
 &lt;/math&gt;
for the six planes of maximum shear stress.

== Mohr–Coulomb failure surface in Haigh–Westergaard space ==
The Mohr–Coulomb failure (yield) surface is often expressed in [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|Haigh–Westergaad coordinates]]. For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}~\sin\phi + c\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \left[\sqrt{3}~\sin\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right) - \sin\phi\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\right]\rho - \sqrt{2}\sin(\phi)\xi = \sqrt{6} c \cos\phi.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, in terms of the [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|invariants]] &lt;math&gt;p, q, r&lt;/math&gt; we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}~\cos\phi}~\sin\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right) - \cfrac{1}{3}\tan\phi~\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\right]q - p~\tan\phi = c
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  \theta = \cfrac{1}{3}\arccos\left[\left(\cfrac{r}{q}\right)^3\right] ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of alternative forms of Mohr–Coulomb yield function
|-
|We can express the yield function
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2} = \cfrac{\sigma_1+\sigma_3}{2}~\sin\phi + c\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_1~\cfrac{(1-\sin\phi)}{2~c~\cos\phi} - \sigma_3~\cfrac{(1+\sin\phi)}{2~c~\cos\phi} = 1 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The [[Yield surface#Invariants used in yield functions|Haigh–Westergaard invariants]] are related to the principal stresses by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_1 = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}~\xi + \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~\rho~\cos\theta ~;~~
  \sigma_3 = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}~\xi + \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~\rho~\cos\left(\theta+\cfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Plugging into the expression for the Mohr–Coulomb yield function gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  -\sqrt{2}~\xi~\sin\phi + \rho[\cos\theta - \cos(\theta+2\pi/3)] - \rho\sin\phi[\cos\theta+\cos(\theta+2\pi/3)] = \sqrt{6}~c~\cos\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using trigonometric identities for the sum and difference of cosines and rearrangement gives us the expression of the Mohr–Coulomb yield function in terms of &lt;math&gt;\xi, \rho, \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

We can express the yield function in terms of &lt;math&gt;p,q&lt;/math&gt; by using the relations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \xi = \sqrt{3}~p ~;~~ \rho = \sqrt{\cfrac{2}{3}}~q
 &lt;/math&gt;
and straightforward substitution.

For a charge distribution an integral over the region containing the charge is equivalent to an infinite summation, treating each infinitesimal element of space as a point charge dq.

For a linear charge distribution (a good approximation for charge in a wire) where &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\mathbf{r^\prime})&lt;/math&gt; gives the charge per unit length at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dl^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal element of length,

&lt;math&gt; dq = \lambda(\mathbf{r^\prime})dl^\prime&lt;/math&gt; [10]

For a surface charge distribution (a good approximation for charge on a plate in a parallel plate capacitor) where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{r^\prime})&lt;/math&gt; gives the charge per unit area at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and dA^\prime is an infinitesimal element of area,

&lt;math&gt;dq = \sigma(\mathbf{r^\prime})\,dA^\prime\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a volume charge distribution (such as charge within a bulk metal) where &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;) gives the charge per unit volume at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dV^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal element of volume,

&lt;math&gt;dq = \rho(\mathbf{r^\prime})\,dV^\prime&lt;/math&gt;[9]

The force on a small test charge &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q^\prime\int dq {\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r^\prime} \over |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r^\prime}|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The Mohr–Coulomb yield surface is often used to model the plastic flow of geomaterials (and other cohesive-frictional materials). Many such materials show dilatational behavior under triaxial states of stress which the Mohr–Coulomb model does not include. Also, since the yield surface has corners, it may be inconvenient to use the original Mohr–Coulomb model to determine the direction of plastic flow (in the [[plasticity theory|flow theory of plasticity]]).

A common approach is to use a '''non-associated''' plastic flow potential that is smooth. An example of such a potential is the function{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

:&lt;math&gt;
   g:= \sqrt{(\alpha c_\mathrm{y} \tan\psi)^2 + G^2(\phi, \theta)~ q^2} - p \tan\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter, &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; when the plastic strain is zero (also called the '''initial cohesion yield stress'''), &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle made by the yield surface in the '''Rendulic plane''' at high values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (this angle is also called the '''dilation angle'''), and &lt;math&gt;G(\phi,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate function that is also smooth in the deviatoric stress plane.

The '''Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA)'''
is a collaborative research alliance funded by the [[US Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) and focused on fundamental
research on the critical scientific and technical challenges that
emerge from the close interdependence of several genres of
networks such as social/cognitive, information, and communications networks.
The primary goal of the NS CTA is to deeply understand the underlying commonalities
among these intertwined networks, and, by understanding,
improve our ability to analyze, predict, design, and influence
complex systems interweaving many kinds of networks.&lt;ref&gt;URL: [http://www.ns-cta.org Network Science CTA Home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

This emerging research domain, termed [[network science]],
also has the potential to accelerate understanding of each
genre of network by cross-fertilization of insights, theories,
algorithms, and approaches and by expanding their study
into the larger context of the multi-genre (or ''composite'') network environments
within which each must act.

The NS CTA is an alliance between ARL, other government
researchers, and a consortium of four research centers: an
Academic Research Center (ARC) focused on social/cognitive
networks (the SCNARC), an ARC focused on information
networks (the INARC), an ARC focused on communications
networks (the CNARC), and an Interdisciplinary Research Center
(the IRC) focused on interdisciplinary research and technology transition. Overall, these centers include roughly one hundred
PhD-level researchers from about 30 universities and industrial
research labs, engaged with as many graduate students and interns.
The Alliance unites research across organizations and research
disciplines to address the critical technical challenges faced by
the Army in a world where all missions are embedded in and
depend upon many genres of networks. The expected impact
of its transdisciplinary research includes greatly enhanced
human performance for network-embedded missions and
greatly enhanced speed and precision for complex military
operations. Beyond this vital focus, its research is also
expected to accelerate the reach and depth of our understanding
of the interwoven networks that so profoundly influence all our
lives.

The Alliance conducts interdisciplinary research in network
science and transitions the results of this fundamental
research to address the technical challenges of network-embedded
Army operations. The NS CTA research program exploits
intellectual synergies across its disciplines by uniting
fundamental and applied network science research in parallel.
It drives the synergistic combination of these technical areas
for network-centric and network-enabling capabilities in
support of all missions required of today's military forces,
including humanitarian support, peacekeeping, and combat
operations in any kind of terrain, but especially in complex
and urban settings. It also supports and stimulates dual-use
applications of this research and resulting technology to benefit
commercial use.

As a critical element of this program, the Alliance has
created a network science research facility in Cambridge, MA,
as well as shared distributed experimental resources throughout
the Alliance. The NS CTA also serves the Army’s technical needs
through an education component, which acts to increase the
pool of network science expertise in the Army and the nation
while bringing greater awareness of Army technical challenges
into the academic and industrial network science research community.
In association with the NS CTA research program, there is
a separate technology transition component that provides a
contractual vehicle for other organizations to fund work focused
on transitioning scientific and technical advances into more
specific applications. 

Research projects in the NS CTA are by design, highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary, whether based in one of the three academic research centers, the interdisciplinary research center, or one of the two ''cross-cutting research initiatives'' (CCRI).

== Core Research Program ==

=== Communication Networks Academic Research Center (CNARC) ===

The CNARC’s research is focused on characterizing complex communications networks, such as those used for [[network-centric warfare]] and operations, so that their behavior can be predicted
accurately and networks can be configured for optimal information sharing and gathering. In particular, the CNARC will focus on characterizing and controlling the operational information content capacity (OICC) of a tactical network. OICC is a function of the quality and amount of information that is delivered to decision makers. This includes data delivery and security properties of the network. Thus, it is vastly different than other measures of network capacity that are traditionally modeled. In essence, the CNARC models treat the network as an information source. 

&lt;!-- More information about this center can be found [[Wikipedia:NSCTA-CNARC|here]]. --&gt;

=== Information Networks Academic Research Center (INARC) ===

INARC is aimed at developing the information network technologies required to improve the capabilities of the U.S. Army and providing users with reliable and actionable intelligence across the full spectrum of Network-Centric Operations. INARC will systematically develop the foundation, methodologies, algorithms, and implementations needed for effective, scalable, hierarchical, and most importantly, dynamic and resilient information networks for military applications. The center focuses on Distributed and Real Time Data Integration and Information Fusion; Scalable, Human-Centric Information Network System; and Knowledge Discovery in Information Networks. 

&lt;!-- More information about this center can be found [[Wikipedia:NSCTA-INARC|here]]. --&gt;

=== Social/Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center (SCNARC) &lt;ref&gt;URL: [http://scnarc.rpi.edu Social/Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center Home page]&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The modern military increasingly needs to rely on bottom up network processes, as compared to top down hierarchic processes. How does the pattern of interactions within a military unit affect
performance of tasks? What kinds of ties external to the Army are necessary to success? How can we use massive streams of data to detect adversarial networks? How can a social and cognitive network quickly extract the most meaningful information for the soldier and decision maker that is useful in all aspects of their operations from supporting humanitarian operations to force protection and full combat operations? These are but a sample of network-related questions with which the 21st century Army must wrestle. The long-term objective of the center is to advance the scientific understanding of how the social networks form, operate and evolve and how they affect the functioning of large, complex organizations such as the Army; how adversary networks hidden in large social networks can be detected, monitored or dissolved; and how human cognition directs and is impacted by the network-centric interactions. SCNARC will undertake research to gain a fundamental understanding of the underlying theory, as well as create scientific foundations for modeling, simulation, measurements, analysis, prediction, and influence of social/cognitive networks and their impact on the U.S. Army. 

&lt;!-- More information about this center can be found [[Wikipedia:NSCTA-SCNARC|here]]. --&gt;

=== Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC) ===
The IRC is focused on performing interdisciplinary research (both basic and applied) that spans the interests in the Alliance and leads to cross-cutting insights into network science and innovative technologies. The IRC transitions basic research from across the Consortium (its own and the ARCs’) into applied research, and, through the Technology Transition component, promotes the rapid transition of technology to meet the specific needs of a network-centric Army. The IRC leads the Education component as a cooperative program across all four centers. The IRC also operates the NS CTA facility, which supports and coordinates distributed collaborative research and experimentation.

Programmatically, the IRC is the leader of the Consortium, both intellectually (responsible for setting research directions for the four centers to ensure that research is focused on fundamental
network science issues that are relevant to network-centric operations and the Army mission) and administratively (responsible for financial management and for tracking and reporting on the
Consortium’s work).

&lt;!-- More information about this center can be found [[Wikipedia:NSCTA-IRC|here]]. --&gt;

=== Cross-Cutting Research Issues (CCRI) ===
In addition to the core research, the NS CTA is investigating two research issues that fundamentally cut across the social/cognitive, information, and communications network genres.

==== Trust in Distributed Decision Making ====
The goal of the Trust CCRI is to enhance distributed decision making capabilities of the Army in the context of network-centric operations, in particular, for irregular warfare and
counterinsurgency by understanding the role trust plays in composite networks that consist of large systems with complex interactions between communication, information, and
social/cognitive networks. Adding to the complexity, trust itself can be highly dynamic with uni- and bi-directional relationships forming, adapting, and dissolving at multiple timescales. Our work directly addresses these dynamics from the propagation and staging of data in the network to support establishment of trust and the revocation of network privileges or use in situations of
distrust.

Trust is contextual, and the degree of trust placed in a relationship can directly relate to factors that exist in each network type. Counterinsurgency and irregular warfare place significant demands on trusted tactical decision-making, as any number of social and cultural factors can influence relationships with the local population and governmental officials. Our work in developing models of trust in composite networks will identify these factors and develop [[trust metric]]s than expose utility versus risk in specific courses of action.

Trust is also a significant factor in how soldiers perceive and act upon information provided through tactical information systems. Our work in developing cognitive models of trust at the human-machine interface (HMI), models of corroboration for disambiguating data, and the use of argumentation as a mechanism to support automated trust reasoning will directly impact how we build trustworthy systems to convey information to the warfighter.

==== Evolving Dynamic Integrated Networks (EDIN) ====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
The goal of the EDIN CCRI is to develop appropriate mathematical representations and models of dynamic, composite networks composed of social, information, and communication networks; and to establish theories for analyzing their behavior and predicting the evolution of specific properties of such networks over time. The objective of a tactical network may be viewed as delivering the right information at the right time to the right user (persons, applications, and systems) to enable timely and accurate decision-making and therefore, mission success. The tactical network is composed of multiple interacting networks: communications networks, information networks, command-and-control and other social networks. Understanding the structure of the component networks and the dynamics therein, and of the dynamic interactions between these networks is crucial to the design of robust interdisciplinary (or composite1) networks which is one of the primary goals of the NS CTA program.

The overall approach in EDIN is to mathematically characterize the rich interactions between composite networks (which may comprise multiple networks with varying levels of coupling between them), and the dynamics that occur within each network or across networks. Examples of key technical approaches within EDIN include the development of formal models for reasoning about interacting networks; development of a theory of composite graphs for modeling interacting networks; modeling and analysis of group behaviors using techniques ranging beyond traditional graph theory; development of community discovery algorithms; characterization of temporal graph properties; development of mathematically tractable tactical mobility models; development of theories of co-evolution of interacting networks, etc.

Modeling the evolution and dynamics of a network entails understanding both the structural properties of dynamic networks and understanding the dynamics of processes (or behaviors) of interest embedded in the network. Typically, the dynamics of network structure impacts certain processes (e.g., how information propagates through the network); but at the same time the dynamics of processes (or behaviors) may result in alteration of network structures. Therefore, gaining a fundamental understanding of such relationships under several kinds of network dynamics is of paramount importance for obtaining significant insights into the behavior and evolution of complex military networks as well as adversarial networks. EDIN will also investigate a particular type of network dynamics, i.e., mobility (not only of communication devices but also of human beings, information etc.), which is particularly important in the military network context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25943">The proof of [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] given by [[Kurt Gödel]] in his doctoral dissertation of 1929 (and a rewritten version of the dissertation, published as an article in 1930) is not easy to read today; it uses concepts and formalism that are no longer used and terminology that is often obscure. The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of [[mathematical logic]]. This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem.

[[File:1925 kurt gödel (cropped).png|thumb|right|200px|Kurt Gödel (1925)]]

== Assumptions ==

We work with [[first-order predicate calculus]]. Our languages allow constant, function and relation symbols. Structures consist of (non-empty) domains and interpretations of the relevant symbols as constant members, functions or relations over that domain.

We assume classical logic (as opposed to intuitionistic logic for example).

We fix some axiomatization (i.e. a syntax-based, machine-manageable proof system) of the predicate calculus: logical axioms and rules of inference. Any of the several well-known equivalent axiomatizations will do. Gödel's original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.

We assume without proof all the basic well-known results about our formalism that we need, such as the [[normal form theorem]] or the [[soundness theorem]].

We axiomatize predicate calculus ''without equality'' (sometimes confusingly called ''without identity''), i.e. there are no special axioms expressing the properties of (object) equality as a special relation symbol. After the basic form of the theorem has been proved, it will be easy to extend it to the case of predicate calculus ''with equality''.

==Statement of the theorem and its proof==

In the following, we state two equivalent forms of the theorem, and show their equivalence.

Later, we prove the theorem. This is done in the following steps:

# Reducing the theorem to sentences (formulas with no free variables) in [[prenex form]], i.e. with all [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s ({{math|&amp;forall;}} and {{math|&amp;exist;}}) at the beginning. Furthermore, we reduce it to formulas whose first quantifier is {{math|&amp;forall;}}. This is possible because for every sentence, there is an equivalent one in prenex form whose first quantifier is {{math|&amp;forall;}}.
# Reducing the theorem to sentences of the form {{math|&amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &amp;phi;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;)}}. While we cannot do this by simply rearranging the quantifiers, we show that it is yet enough to prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
# Finally we prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
#* This is done by first noting that a sentence such as {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&amp;forall;&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&amp;exist;&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &amp;phi;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;...&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) }} is either refutable (its negation is always true) or satisfiable, i.e. there is some model in which it holds (it might even be always true, i.e. a tautology); this model is simply assigning [[truth value]]s to the subpropositions from which B is built.  The reason for that is the completeness of [[propositional logic]], with the existential quantifiers playing no role.
#* We extend this result to more and more complex and lengthy sentences, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n=1,2...), built out from B, so that either any of them is refutable and therefore so is φ, or all of them are not refutable and therefore each holds in some model.
#* We finally use the models in which the D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; hold (in case all are not refutable) in order to build a model in which φ holds.

===Theorem 1. Every valid formula (true in all structures) is provable.===

This is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:
When we say "all structures", it is important to specify that the structures involved are classical (Tarskian) interpretations I, where I=&lt;U,F&gt; (U is a non-empty (possibly infinite) set of objects, whereas F is a set of functions from expressions of the interpreted symbolism into U). [By contrast, so-called "free logics" countenance possibly empty sets for U. For more regarding free logics, see the work of Karel Lambert.]

===Theorem 2. Every formula &amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure.===

"&amp;phi; is refutable" means ''by definition'' "¬&amp;phi; is provable".

===Equivalence of both theorems===

To see the equivalence, note first that if '''Theorem 1''' holds, and φ is not satisfiable in any structure, then ¬φ is valid in all structures and therefore provable, thus φ is refutable and '''Theorem 2''' holds. If on the other hand '''Theorem 2''' holds and φ is valid in all structures, then ¬φ is not satisfiable in any structure and therefore refutable; then ¬¬φ is provable and then so is φ, thus '''Theorem 1''' holds.

===Proof of theorem 2: first step===

We approach the proof of '''Theorem 2''' by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove "&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas '''C''', such that "&amp;psi; is either refutable or satisfiable" → "&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove "&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable" only for φ's belonging to the class '''C'''. Note also that if φ is provably equivalent to ψ (''i.e.'', (φ≡ψ) is provable), then it is indeed the case that "&amp;psi; is either refutable or satisfiable"  → "&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable" (the [[soundness theorem]] is needed to show this).

There are standard techniques for rewriting an arbitrary formula into one that does not use function or constant symbols, at the cost of introducing additional quantifiers; we will therefore assume that all formulas are free of such symbols. Gödel's paper uses a version of first-order predicate calculus that has no function or constant symbols to begin with.

Next we consider a generic formula φ (which no longer uses function or constant symbols) and apply the [[prenex form]] theorem to find a formula ψ in ''normal form'' such that φ≡ψ (ψ being in ''normal form'' means that all the quantifiers in ψ, if there are any, are found at the very beginning of ψ). It follows now that we need only prove '''Theorem 2''' for formulas φ in normal form.

Next, we eliminate all free variables from φ by quantifying them existentially: if, say, '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' are free in φ, we form &lt;math&gt;\psi=\exists x_1 ... \exists x_n \phi&lt;/math&gt;. If ψ is satisfiable in a structure M, then certainly so is φ and if ψ is refutable, then &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi = \forall x_1 ... \forall x_n \neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable, and then so is ¬φ, thus φ is refutable. We see that we can restrict φ to be a ''sentence'', that is, a formula with no free variables.

Finally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the ''prefix'' of φ (that is, the string of quantifiers at the beginning of φ, which is in normal form)  begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic φ (subject to restrictions we have already proved), we take some one-place relation symbol '''F''' unused in φ, and two new variables '''y''' and '''z'''.. If φ = '''(P)Φ''', where (P) stands for the prefix of φ and Φ for the ''matrix'' (the remaining, quantifier-free part of φ) we form &lt;math&gt;\psi = \forall y (P) \exists z ( \Phi \wedge [ F(y) \vee \neg F(z) ] )&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\forall y \exists z ( F(y) \vee \neg F(z) )&lt;/math&gt; is clearly provable, it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\psi&lt;/math&gt; is provable.

===Reducing the theorem to formulas of degree 1===

Our generic formula φ now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas '''R'''. We are faced with proving that every formula in '''R''' is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula φ, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x_1 ... \forall x_{k_1})(\exists x_{k_1+1} ... \exists x_{k_2}).......(\forall x_{k_{n-2}+1} ... \forall x_{k_{n-1}})(\exists x_{k_{n-1}+1} ... \exists x_{k_n}) (\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;

We define the '''degree''' of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to be the number of universal quantifier blocks, separated by existential quantifier blocks as shown above, in the prefix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The following lemma, which Gödel adapted from Skolem's proof of the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], lets us sharply reduce the complexity of the generic formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; we need to prove the theorem for:

'''Lemma'''. Let '''k'''&gt;=1. If every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k''' is either refutable or satisfiable, then so is every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k+1'''.

:'''Comment''': Take a formula &amp;phi; of degree k+1 of the form &lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall u)(\exist v) (P) \psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(P)\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (it is thus of degree '''k-1'''). &amp;phi; states that for every x there is a y such that... (something). It would have been nice to have a predicate ''Q' '' so that for every x, ''Q'(x,y)'' would be true if and only if y is the required one to make (something) true. Then we could have written a formula of degree k, which is equivalent to &amp;phi;, namely &lt;math&gt;(\forall x')(\forall x)(\forall y)(\forall u)(\exist v)(\exist y') (P) Q'(x',y') \wedge (Q'(x,y) \rightarrow \psi)&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is indeed equivalent to &amp;phi; because it states that for every x, if there is a y that satisfies Q'(x,y), then (something) holds, and furthermore, we know that there is such a y, because for every x', there is a y' that satisfies Q'(x',y'). Therefore &amp;phi; follows from this formula. It is also easy to show that if the formula is false, then so is &amp;phi;. '''Unfortunately''', in general there is no such predicate Q'. However, this idea can be understood as a basis for the following proof of the Lemma.

'''Proof.''' Let φ be a formula of degree '''k+1'''; then we can write it as

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall u)(\exist v) (P) \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where '''(P)''' is the remainder of the prefix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (it is thus of degree '''k-1''') and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the quantifier-free matrix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. '''x''', '''y''', '''u''' and '''v''' denote here ''tuples'' of variables rather than single variables; ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;(\forall x)&lt;/math&gt; really stands for  &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \forall x_2 ... \forall x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1 ... x_n&lt;/math&gt; are some distinct variables.

Let now '''x'''' and '''y'''' be tuples of previously unused variables of the same length as '''x''' and '''y''' respectively, and let '''Q''' be a previously unused relation symbol that takes as many arguments as the sum of lengths of '''x''' and '''y'''; we consider the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = (\forall x')(\exists y') Q(x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y)( Q(x,y) \rightarrow (\forall u)(\exist v)(P)\psi )&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\Phi \rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable.

Now since the string of quantifiers &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)&lt;/math&gt; does not contain variables from '''x''' or '''y''', the following equivalence is easily provable with the help of whatever formalism we're using:

:&lt;math&gt;( Q(x,y) \rightarrow (\forall u )(\exists v)(P) \psi) \equiv (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

And since these two formulas are equivalent, if we replace the first with the second inside Φ, we obtain the formula Φ' such that Φ≡Φ':

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi' = (\forall x')(\exist y') Q(x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y) (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

Now Φ' has the form &lt;math&gt;(S)\rho \wedge (S')\rho'&lt;/math&gt;, where '''(S)''' and '''(S')''' are some quantifier strings, ρ and ρ' are quantifier-free, and, '''furthermore''', no variable of '''(S)''' occurs in ρ' and no variable of '''(S')''' occurs in ρ. Under such conditions every formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(T)(\rho \wedge \rho')&lt;/math&gt;, where '''(T)''' is a string of quantifiers containing all quantifiers in (S) and (S') interleaved among themselves in any fashion, but maintaining the relative order inside (S) and (S'), will be equivalent to the original formula Φ'(this is yet another basic result in first-order predicate calculus that we rely on). To wit, we form Ψ as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = (\forall x')(\forall x)(\forall y) (\forall u)(\exists y')(\exists v)(P)Q(x',y') \wedge (Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

and we have &lt;math&gt;\Phi' \equiv \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Now &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of degree '''k''' and therefore by assumption either refutable or satisfiable.
If &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable in a structure '''M''', then, considering &lt;math&gt;\Psi \equiv \Phi' \equiv \Phi \wedge \Phi \rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable as well.
If &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is refutable, then so is &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to it; thus &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable.
Now we can replace all occurrences of Q inside the provable formula &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; by some other formula dependent on the same variables, and we will still get a provable formula.
(''This is yet another basic result of first-order predicate calculus. Depending on the particular formalism adopted for the calculus, it may be seen as a simple application of a "functional substitution" rule of inference, as in Gödel's paper, or it may be proved by considering the formal proof of &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt;, replacing in it all occurrences of Q by some other formula with the same free variables, and noting that all logical axioms in the formal proof remain logical axioms after the substitution, and all rules of inference still apply in the same way.'')

In this particular case, we replace Q(x',y') in &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; with the formula &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y')&lt;/math&gt;. Here (x,y|x',y') means that instead of ψ we are writing a different formula, in which x and y are replaced with x' and y'. Note that Q(x,y) is simply replaced by &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\neg ( (\forall x')(\exists y') (\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y) ( (\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi \rightarrow (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) \psi ) )&lt;/math&gt;

and this formula is provable; since the part under negation and after the &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; sign is obviously provable, and the part under negation and before the &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; sign is obviously φ, just with '''x''' and '''y''' replaced by '''x'''' and '''y'''', we see that &lt;math&gt;\neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable, and φ is refutable. We have proved that φ is either satisfiable or refutable, and this concludes the proof of the '''Lemma'''.

Notice that we could not have used &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y')&lt;/math&gt; instead of Q(x',y') from the beginning, because &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; would not have been a [[well-formed formula]] in that case. This is why we cannot naively use the argument appearing at the comment that precedes the proof.

===Proving the theorem for formulas of degree 1===
As shown by the '''Lemma''' above, we only need to prove our theorem for formulas φ in '''R''' of degree 1. φ cannot be of degree 0, since formulas in R have no free variables and don't use constant symbols. So the formula φ has the general form:

:&lt;math&gt; (\forall x_1...x_k)(\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(x_1...x_k, y_1...y_m).&lt;/math&gt;

Now we define an ordering of the k-[[tuple]]s of [[natural number]]s as follows: &lt;math&gt; (x_1...x_k) &lt; (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt; should hold if either &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) &lt; \Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) = \Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; (x_1...x_k) &lt;/math&gt; precedes &lt;math&gt; (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt; in [[lexicographic order]]. [Here &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the sum of the terms of the tuple.] Denote the nth tuple in this order by &lt;math&gt; (a^n_1...a^n_k) &lt;/math&gt;.

Set the formula &lt;math&gt; B_n &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; \phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, z_{(n-1)m+2}, z_{(n-1)m+3}...z_{nm+1}) &lt;/math&gt;. Then put &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt; (\exists z_1...z_{nm+1}) (B_1 \wedge B_2 ... \wedge B_n).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''': For every ''n'', φ&lt;math&gt; \rightarrow D_n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': By induction on n; we have &lt;math&gt; D_k \Leftarrow D_{k-1} \wedge (\forall z_1...z_{(n-1)m+1})(\exists z_{(n-1)m+2}...z_{nm+1}) B_n \Leftarrow D_{k-1} \wedge (\forall z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k})(\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, y_1...y_m) &lt;/math&gt;, where the latter implication holds by variable substitution, since the ordering of the tuples is such that &lt;math&gt;(\forall k)({a^n_1}...{a^n_k}) &lt; (n-1)m + 2&lt;/math&gt;. But the last formula is equivalent to &lt;math&gt; D_{k-1} \wedge &lt;/math&gt;φ.

For the base case, &lt;math&gt; D_1 \equiv (\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \phi(z_{a^1_1}...z_{a^1_k}, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) \equiv (\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \phi(z_1...z_1, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt; is obviously a corollary of φ as well. So the '''Lemma''' is proven.

Now if &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt; is refutable for some ''n'', it follows that φ is refutable. On the other hand, suppose that &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt; is not refutable for any ''n''. Then for each ''n'' there is some way of assigning truth values to the distinct subpropositions &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; (ordered by their first appearance in &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt;; "distinct" here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in &lt;math&gt; B_k &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt; will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion. This follows from the completeness of the underlying [[propositional logic]].

We will now show that there is such an assignment of truth values to &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt;, so that all &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; will be true: The &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; appear in the same order in every &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt;; we will inductively define a general assignment to them by a sort of "majority vote": Since there are infinitely many assignments (one for each &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt;) affecting &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, either infinitely many make &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; true, or infinitely many make it false and only finitely many make it true. In the former case, we choose &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; to be true in general; in the latter we take it to be false in general. Then from the infinitely many ''n'' for which &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;E_{h-1}&lt;/math&gt; are assigned the same truth value as in the general assignment, we pick a general assignment to &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; in the same fashion.

This general assignment must lead to every one of the &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; being true, since if one of the &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; were false under the general assignment, &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; would also be false for every ''n &gt; k''. But this contradicts the fact that for the finite collection of general &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; assignments appearing in &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many ''n'' where the assignment making &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; true matches the general assignment.

From this general assignment, which makes all of the &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; true, we construct an interpretation of the language's predicates that makes φ true. The universe of the model will be the [[natural numbers]]. Each i-ary predicate &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; should be true of the naturals &lt;math&gt;(u_1...u_i)&lt;/math&gt; precisely when the proposition &lt;math&gt;\Psi(z_{u_1}...z_{u_i})&lt;/math&gt; is either true in the general assignment, or not assigned by it (because it never appears in any of the &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt;).

In this model, each of the formulas &lt;math&gt; (\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(a^n_1...a^n_k, y_1...y_m) &lt;/math&gt; is true by construction. But this implies that φ itself is true in the model, since the &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; range over all possible k-tuples of natural numbers. So φ is satisfiable, and we are done.

====Intuitive explanation====
We may write each B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as Φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) for some x-s, which we may call "first arguments" and y-s that we may call "last arguments".

Take B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for example. Its "last arguments" are z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and for every possible combination of k of these variables there is some j so that they appear as "first arguments" in B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus for large enough n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; has the property that the "last arguments" of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appear, in every possible combinations of k of them, as "first arguments" in other B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;-s within D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. For every B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; there is a D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; with the corresponding property.

Therefore in a model that satisfies all the D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-s, there are objects corresponding to z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... and each combination of k of these appear as "first arguments" in some B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that for every k of these objects z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; there are z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, which makes Φ(z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfied. By taking a submodel with only these z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... objects, we have a model satisfying φ.

==Extensions==

===Extension to first-order predicate calculus with equality===
Gödel reduced a formula containing instances of the equality predicate to ones without it in an extended language. His method involves replacing a formula φ containing some instances of equality with the formula

: &lt;math&gt; (\forall x) Eq(x, x) \wedge (\forall x,y,z) [Eq(x, y) \rightarrow (Eq(x, z) \rightarrow Eq(y, z))] &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \wedge (\forall x,y,z) [Eq(x, y) \rightarrow (Eq(z, x) \rightarrow Eq(z, y))] &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; \wedge &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; (\forall x_1...x_k, y_1...x_k) [(Eq(x_1, y_1) \wedge ... \wedge Eq(x_k, y_k)) \rightarrow (A(x_1...x_k) \equiv A(y_1...y_k))] &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; \wedge  ... \wedge &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; (\forall x_1...x_m, y_1...x_m) [(Eq(x_1, y_1) \wedge ... \wedge Eq(x_m, y_m)) \rightarrow (Z(x_1...x_m) \equiv Z(y_1...y_m))] &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; \wedge &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; \varphi'.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;A ... Z&lt;/math&gt; denote the predicates appearing in φ (with &lt;math&gt;k ... m&lt;/math&gt; their respective arities), and φ' is the formula φ with all occurrences of equality replaced with the new predicate ''Eq''. If this new formula is refutable, the original φ was as well; the same is true of satisfiability, since we may take a quotient of satisfying model of the new formula by the equivalence relation representing ''Eq''. This quotient is well-defined with respect to the other predicates, and therefore will satisfy the original formula φ.

===Extension to countable sets of formulas===

Gödel also considered the case where there are a countably infinite collection of formulas. Using the same reductions as above, he was able to consider only those cases where each formula is of degree 1 and contains no uses of equality. For a countable collection of formulas &lt;math&gt; \phi^i &lt;/math&gt; of degree 1, we may define &lt;math&gt; B^i_k &lt;/math&gt; as above; then define &lt;math&gt; D_k &lt;/math&gt; to be the closure of &lt;math&gt; B^1_1...B^1_k, ..., B^k_1...B^k_k &lt;/math&gt;. The remainder of the proof then went through as before.

===Extension to arbitrary sets of formulas===

When there is an uncountably infinite collection of formulas, the [[Axiom of Choice]] (or at least some weak form of it) is needed. Using the full AC, one can [[well-order]] the formulas, and prove the uncountable case with the same argument as the countable one, except with [[transfinite induction]]. Other approaches can be used to prove that the completeness theorem in this case is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], a weak form of AC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10457">In [[theoretical computer science]], and specifically [[computational complexity theory]], '''proof complexity''' is the field aiming to understand and analyse the computational resources that are required to prove or refute statements. Research in proof complexity is predominantly concerned with proving proof-length lower and upper bounds in various propositional proof systems. For example, among the major challenges of proof complexity is showing that the usual propositional-calculus does not admit polynomial-size proofs of all tautologies (the actual formalization of a propositional-calculus is immaterial here, since all natural formalizations have been proved to be polynomially-identical); here the size of the proof is simply the number of symbols in it, and a proof is said to be of polynomial size if it is polynomial in the size of the tautology it proves. 

Systematic study of proof complexity began with the work of Cook and Reckhow (1979) who provided the basic definition of a propositional proof system from the perspective of computational complexity. Specifically Cook and Reckhow  observed that proving proof size lower bounds on stronger and stronger propositional proof systems can be viewed as a step towards separating NP from coNP (and thus P from NP), since the existence of a propositional proof system that admits polynomial size proofs for all tautologies implies that NP=coNP.

Contemporary proof complexity research draws ideas and methods from many areas in computational complexity, algorithms and mathematics. Since many important algorithms and algorithmic techniques can be cast as proof search algorithms for certain proof systems, proving lower bounds on these proof sizes implies run time lower bounds on the corresponding algorithms.

Mathematical logic can also serve as a framework to study propositional proof sizes. Specifically weak fragments of Peano Arithmetic, which come under the name Bounded Arithmetic theories, serve as a uniform version of propositional proofs, corresponding to different propositional proof systems.

==Polynomiality of proofs==

Different [[propositional proof system|propositional proof systems]] for propositional logic, such as the [[sequent calculus]], the [[cutting-plane method]], [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]], etc., may provide different proofs for the same formula. Proof complexity measures the efficiency of the proof system usually in terms of the minimal size of proofs possible in the system for a given tautology (or dually, and unsatisfiable formula).

Two points make the study of proof complexity non-trivial:

# the size of a proof depends on the formula that is to be proved inconsistent;
# proof methods are generally families of algorithms, as some of their steps are not univocally specified; for example, resolution is based on iteratively choosing a pair of clauses containing opposite literals and producing a new clause that is a consequence of them; since several such pairs may be available at each step, the algorithm has to choose one; these choices affect the proof length.

The first point is taken into account by comparing the size of a proof of a formula with the size of the formula. This comparison is made using the usual assumptions of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]: first, a polynomial proof size/formula size ratio means that the proof is of size similar to that of the formula; second, this ratio is studied in the asymptotic case as the size of the formula increases.

The second point is taken into account by considering, for each formula, the shortest possible proof the considered method can produce.

The question of polynomiality of proofs is whether a method can always produce a proof of size polynomial in the size of the formula. If such a method exists, then [[NP (complexity)|NP]] would be equal to [[coNP]]: this is why the question of polynomiality of proofs is considered important in computational complexity. For some methods, the existence of formulae whose shortest proofs are always superpolynomial has been proved. For other methods, it is an open question.

==Proof size comparison==

A second question about proof complexity is whether a method is more efficient than another. Since the proof size depends on the formula, it is possible that one method can produce a short proof of a formula and only long proofs of another formula, while a second method can have exactly the opposite behavior.  The assumptions of measuring the size of the proofs relative to the size of the formula and considering only the shortest proofs are also used in this context.

When comparing two proof methods, two outcomes are possible:

# for every proof of a formula produced using the first method, there is a proof of comparable size of the same formula produced by the second method;
# there exists a formula such that the first method can produce a short proof while all proofs obtained by the second method are consistently larger.

Several proofs of the second kind involve contradictory formulae expressing the negation of the [[pigeonhole principle]], namely that &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; pigeons can fit &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; holes with no hole containing two or more pigeons.

==Automatizability==

A proof method is automatizable if one of the shorter proofs of a formula can always be generated in time polynomial (or sub-exponential) in the size of the proof. Some methods, but not all, are automatizable. Automatizability results are  not in contrast with the assumption that the [[polynomial hierarchy]] does not collapse, which would happen if generating a proof in time polynomial in the size ''of the formula'' were always possible.

==Interpolation==

Consider a tautology of the form &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z) &lt;/math&gt;.  The tautology is true for every choice of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and after fixing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are independent because are defined on disjoint sets of variables.  This means that it is possible to define an ''interpolant'' circuit &lt;math&gt;C(y)&lt;/math&gt;, such that both &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow C(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; hold.  The interpolant circuit decides either if &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is false or if &lt;math&gt;B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is true, by only considering &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  The nature of the interpolant circuit can be arbitrary.  Nevertheless, it is possible to use a proof of the initial tautology &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z) &lt;/math&gt; as a hint on how to construct &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  Some proof systems (e.g. resolution) are said to have ''efficient interpolation'' because the interpolant &lt;math&gt;C(y)&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently computable from any proof of the tautology &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; in such proof system.  The efficiency is measured with respect to the length of the proof: it is easier to compute interpolants for longer proofs, so this property seems to be anti-monotone in the strength of the proof system.

Interpolation is a weak form of automatization: a way to deduce the existence of small circuits from the existence of small proofs.  In particular the following three statements cannot be simultaneously true: (a) &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; has a short proof in a some proof system; (b) such proof system has efficient interpolation; (c) the interpolant circuit solves a computationally hard problem.  It is clear that (a) and (b) imply that there is a small interpolant circuit, which is in contradiction with (c).  Such relation allows to turn proof length upper bounds into lower bounds on computations, and dually to turn efficient interpolation algorithms into lower bounds on proof length.

==Non-classical logics==

The idea of comparing the size of proofs can be used for any automated reasoning procedure that generates a proof. Some research has been done about the size of proofs for propositional non-classical logics, in particular, intuitionistic, modal, and non-monotonic logics.

[[File:4 fonctions du second degré.svg|right|thumb|200px|The second derivative of a [[quadratic function]] is [[constant function|constant]].]]

In [[calculus]], the '''double derivative''', or the '''double anti-integral''', of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}} is the [[derivative]] of the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  Roughly speaking, the second derivative measures how the rate of change of a quantity is itself changing; for example, the second derivative of the position of a vehicle with respect to time is the instantaneous [[acceleration]]  of the vehicle, or the rate at which the [[velocity]] of the vehicle is changing with respect to time. In [[Leibniz notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =  \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\boldsymbol{x}}{dt^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the last term is the second derivative expression.

On the [[graph of a function]], the second derivative corresponds to the [[curvature]] or [[convex function|concavity]] of the graph.  The graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave, while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way.

== Second derivative power rule ==
The [[power rule]] for the first derivative, if applied twice, will produce the second derivative power rule as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[x^n]=\frac{d}{dx}\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]=\frac{d}{dx}[nx^{n-1}]=n\frac{d}{dx}[x^{n-1}]=n(n-1)x^{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Notation ==
{{Details|Notation for differentiation}}
The second derivative of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  That is:
:&lt;math&gt;f'' = (f')'&lt;/math&gt;
When using [[Leibniz's notation]] for derivatives, the second derivative of a dependent variable ''y'' with respect to an independent variable ''x'' is written
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This notation is derived from the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \,=\, \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Given the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3,&lt;/math&gt;
the derivative of ''f'' is the function
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = 3x^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The second derivative of ''f'' is the derivative of ''f''&amp;prime;, namely
:&lt;math&gt;f''(x) = 6x.&lt;/math&gt;

== Relation to the graph ==
[[File:Animated illustration of inflection point.gif|500px|thumb|A plot of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(2x)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;-\pi/4&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;5\pi/4&lt;/math&gt;. The tangent line is blue where the curve is concave up, green where the curve is concave down, and red at the inflection points (0, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/2, and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).]]

=== Concavity ===
The second derivative of a function ''f'' measures the '''concavity''' of the graph of ''f''.  A function whose second derivative is positive will be [[concave up]] (also referred to as convex), meaning that the [[tangent]] line will lie below the graph of the function.  Similarly, a function whose second derivative is negative will be [[concave down]] (also simply called concave), and its tangent lines will lie above the graph of the function.

=== Inflection points ===
{{main|Inflection point}}
If the second derivative of a function changes sign, the graph of the function will switch from concave down to concave up, or vice versa.  A point where this occurs is called an '''inflection point'''.  Assuming the second derivative is continuous, it must take a value of zero at any inflection point, although not every point where the second derivative is zero is necessarily a point of inflection.

=== Second derivative test ===
{{main|Second derivative test}}
The relation between the second derivative and the graph can be used to test whether a [[stationary point]] for a function (i.e. a point where &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; ) is a [[local maximum]] or a [[local minimum]].  Specifically,
* If &lt;math&gt;\ f^{\prime\prime}(x) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; has a local maximum at &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\ f^{\prime\prime}(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; has a local minimum at &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\ f^{\prime\prime}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the second derivative test says nothing about the point &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;, a possible inflection point.
The reason the second derivative produces these results can be seen by way of a real-world analogy. Consider a vehicle that at first is moving forward at a great velocity, but with a negative acceleration. Clearly the position of the vehicle at the point where the velocity reaches zero will be the maximum distance from the starting position – after this time, the velocity will become negative and the vehicle will reverse. The same is true for the minimum, with a vehicle that at first has a very negative velocity but positive acceleration.

== Limit ==
It is possible to write a single [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] for the second derivative:
:&lt;math&gt;f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The limit is called the [[second symmetric derivative]].&lt;ref name="Zygmund2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Zygmund|title=Trigonometric Series|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89053-3|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first= Brian S. 
 | last= Thomson 
 | year= 1994 
 | title= Symmetric Properties of Real Functions
 | publisher= Marcel Dekker
 | isbn= 0-8247-9230-0
 | page = 1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the second symmetric derivative may exist even when the (usual) second derivative does not.

The expression on the right can be written as a [[difference quotient]] of difference quotients:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2} = \frac{\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} - \frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
This limit can be viewed as a continuous version of the [[second difference]] for [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]].

Please note that the existence of the above limit does not mean that the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a second derivative. The limit above just gives a possibility for calculating the second derivative but does not provide a definition. As a counterexample look on the [[sign function]] &lt;math&gt;\sgn(x)&lt;/math&gt; which is defined through

:&lt;math&gt;\sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0, \\
0 &amp; \text{if } x = 0, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The sign function is not continuous at zero and therefore the second derivative for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; does not exist. But the above limit exists for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sgn(0+h) - 2\sgn(0) + \sgn(0-h)}{h^2} &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - 2\cdot 0 + (-1)}{h^2} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h^2} \\
&amp;= 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Quadratic approximation ==
Just as the first derivative is related to [[linear approximation]]s, the second derivative is related to the best [[quadratic approximation]] for a function ''f''.  This is the [[quadratic function]] whose first and second derivatives are the same as those of ''f'' at a given point.  The formula for the best quadratic approximation to a function ''f'' around the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' is
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \tfrac12 f''(a)(x-a)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This quadratic approximation is the second-order [[Taylor polynomial]] for the function centered at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''.

== Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative ==

For many combinations of [[boundary conditions]] explicit formulas for [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative]] can be obtained. For example, assuming &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,L]&lt;/math&gt; and homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]], i.e., &lt;math&gt; v(0)=v(L)=0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[eigenvalues]] are &lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{j^2 \pi^2}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding [[eigenvectors]] (also called [[eigenfunctions]]) are &lt;math&gt; v_j(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{j \pi x}{L}\right) &lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt; v''_j(x) = \lambda_j v_j(x), \, j=1,\ldots,\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

For other well-known cases, see the main article [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative]].

== Generalization to higher dimensions ==

=== The Hessian ===
{{main|Hessian matrix}}
The second derivative generalizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second [[partial derivative]]s.  For a function ''f'':'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''', these include the three second-order partials

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}, \; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}, \text{ and }\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the mixed partials

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \, \partial y}, \; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \, \partial z}, \text{ and }\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \, \partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the function's image and domain both have a potential, then these fit together into a [[symmetric matrix]] known as the '''Hessian'''.  The [[eigenvalue]]s of this matrix can be used to implement a multivariable analogue of the second derivative test.  (See also the [[second partial derivative test]].)

=== The Laplacian ===
{{main|Laplace operator}}
Another common generalization of the second derivative is the '''Laplacian'''.  This is the differential operator &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Laplacian of a function is equal to the [[divergence]] of the [[gradient]] and the [[Trace_(linear_algebra)|trace]] of the Hessian matrix.

In [[mathematics]], a '''space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (sometimes called a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]]) with some added [[mathematical structure|structure]].

While modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as [[Euclidean space]]s, [[linear space]]s, [[topological space]]s, [[Hilbert space]]s, or [[probability space]]s, it does not define the notion of "space" itself.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/177937/difference-between-space-and-mathematical-structure |title=Difference between 'space' and 'mathematical structure'?|first1= Kevin|last1= Carlson|date=August 2, 2012|work=Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Similarly, several types of numbers are in use (natural, integral, rational, real, complex); each one has its own definition; but just "number" is not used as a mathematical notion and has no definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

A space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. 
The nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an [[isomorphism]] between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms,&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms&gt;Reformed [[Euclidean_geometry#Logical_basis|by Hilbert, Tarski and Birkhoff]] in order to avoid hidden assumptions found in [[w:Euclid's Elements|Euclid's Elements]].&lt;/ref&gt; and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.

Topological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. 
However, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus "forgetful". Relations of this kind are sketched in Figure 1, and treated in more detail in the Section [[#Types of spaces|"Types of spaces"]]. 

It is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric "space", or an  algebraic "structure". A general definition of "structure", proposed by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]],&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Chapter IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.

===Before the golden age of geometry===

[[File:Homothety.svg|thumb|275px|Homothety transforms a geometric figure into a similar one by scaling.]]

In ancient Greek mathematics, "space" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, [[Euclid]] gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.

The method of coordinates ([[analytic geometry]]) was adopted by [[René Descartes]] in 1637.&lt;ref name="EDM987"&gt;{{harvnb|Itô|1993|loc=page 987}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science;&lt;ref name=Bb94&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bourbaki | first = Nicolas | author-link=w:Nicolas Bourbaki | title = Elements of the history of mathematics | year = 1994 | publisher = Masson (original), Springer (translation) |isbn=978-3-540-64767-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-61693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Two [[equivalence relation]]s between geometric figures were used: [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]] — into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by [[Gaspard Monge]] in 1795, occurs in [[projective geometry]]: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.

The relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} shows that mathematical objects are not given to us ''with their structure''.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|21}} Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by ''some'' of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|20}}

Distances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.

A different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]], introduced by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] in 1829 and [[János Bolyai]] in 1832 (and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1816, unpublished)&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868 and [[Felix Klein]] in 1871 obtained Euclidean "models" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Jeremy Gray |first1=Jeremy |last1= Gray |date=1989 |title=Ideas of Space: Euclidean, Non-Euclidean and Relativistic |edition=second |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0198539353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not "obvious", nor "implications of definitions". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a "geometry" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less "mathematical truths".&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

A Euclidean model of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations "play" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.

===The golden age and afterwards===
The word "geometry" (from Ancient Greek: geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).

According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|131}} the period between 1795 (''Géométrie descriptive'' of Monge) and 1872 (the [[Erlangen program|"Erlangen programme"]] of Klein) can be called the golden age of geometry.  The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with [[Hilbert's axioms]], [[Tarski's axioms]] and [[Birkhoff's axioms]]. These axiom systems describe the space via [[primitive notion]]s (such as "point", "between", "congruent") constrained by a number of [[axiom]]s.

Analytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|134,5}} Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|136}} However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}} "passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics".

Simultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics.  For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay ''Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen'' (''Continuity and irrational numbers''), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of [[Dedekind cut]]s, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers.  Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven.  In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic.  Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Gallier |title=Geometric Methods and Applications |chapter=Basics of Euclidean geometry |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-9961-0_6 |isbn=978-1-4419-9960-3 |publisher=Springer |date=2011}} See also [http://ocw.upm.es/algebra/affine-and-projective-geometry-1/class-material OpenCourseWare].&lt;/ref&gt; A definition "from scratch", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional [[projective space]] is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space.  This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.

A space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called "spaces" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.

According to the famous inaugural lecture given by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by ''n'' real numbers may be treated as a point of the ''n''-dimensional space of all such objects.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|140}} Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}}

[[w:Function (mathematics)|Functions]] are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional [[function space]]s, as noted already by Riemann&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|141}} and elaborated in the 20th century by [[functional analysis]].

== Taxonomy of spaces ==

===Three taxonomic ranks===
While each type of spaces has its own definition, the general idea of "space" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of "structure".
According to Pudlák,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-00118-0|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00119-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have."
We will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section "Spaces and structures", while  we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.

We classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.

For example, the ''upper-level classification'' distinguishes between Euclidean and [[projective space]]s, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. 
Another example. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.

Also, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question "what is the dimension" makes sense in both cases.

The ''second-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.
In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the second-level classification is the classification by "species". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.

The ''third-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.
More formally, the third level classifies spaces up to [[isomorphism]]. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.

The notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.

An isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.

Euclidean axioms&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms /&gt; leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have "the" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is ''univalent''. In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is ''multivalent''. A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name="BSr385"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=page 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.

===Relations between species of spaces===
Topological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called "[[homeomorphism]]"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; "topological space" is an ''underlying'' structure of the "Euclidean space" structure. Similar ideas occur in [[category theory]]: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the [[Forgetful functor|forgetful]] (or "stripping") [[functor]] maps the former category to the latter category.

A three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is ''richer'' than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.

[[File:Spaces arrows.svg|thumb|200px|Example relations between species of spaces]]

Such relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every {{nowrap|A-space}} is also a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or may be treated as a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or provides a {{nowrap|B-space,}} etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "procedure of deduction" of a {{nowrap|B-space}} from a {{nowrap|A-space.}} Not quite a function unless the [[Class (set theory)|classes]] A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. 

The transition from "Euclidean" to "topological" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, [[self-homeomorphism]]) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.

In contrast, the transition from "3-dim Euclidean" to "Euclidean" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is [[Injective function|injective]] (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, "↣" rather than "→".

Both transitions are not [[Surjective function|surjective]], that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, "↠" rather than "→". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from "real linear topological" to "real linear" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.

Such topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, [[Bijection|bijective]]; see the arrow from "finite-dim real linear topological" to "finite-dim real linear" on Fig. 4. The [[Inverse function|inverse]] transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.

The transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic {{nowrap|A-spaces}} lead to two isomorphic {{nowrap|B-spaces}}.

The diagram on Fig. 4 is [[Commutative diagram|commutative]]. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from "topological" to "measurable" is dashed for the reason explained there: "In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a σ-algebra. The σ-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice." A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called "canonical" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the [[Fine topology (potential theory)|fine topology]]; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.

==Types of spaces==

===Linear and topological spaces===
[[File:Spaces linear etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: linear, topological etc]]

Two basic spaces are [[w:linear space|linear spaces]] (also called vector spaces) and [[w:topological space|topological spaces]].

Linear spaces are of [[w:Algebra|algebraic]] nature; there are real linear spaces (over the [[w:field (mathematics)|field]] of [[w:Real number|real numbers]]),
complex linear spaces (over the field of [[w:Complex number|complex numbers]]), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter ''underlies'' the former), since each real number is also a complex number.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;For example, the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]] treated as a one-dimensional complex linear space may be downgraded to a two-dimensional real linear space. In contrast, the real line can be treated as a one-dimensional real linear space but not a complex linear space. See also [[w:Examples of vector spaces#Field extensions|field extensions]].&lt;/ref&gt;
More generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.
Linear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define 
orthogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space 
there is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} complex linear space is also a {{nowrap|2''n''-dimensional}} real linear space.

Topological spaces are of [[Mathematical analysis|analytic]] nature. [[Open set]]s, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as [[continuous function]]s, paths, maps; [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequences, limits]]; interior, boundary, exterior. However, [[uniform continuity]], [[bounded set]]s, [[Cauchy sequence]]s, [[differentiable function]]s (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The [[open interval]] (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole [[w:Real line|real line]] (-∞,∞) but not homeomorphic to the [[closed interval]] [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; [[inductive dimension]] (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and [[Lebesgue covering dimension (mathematics)|Lebesgue covering dimension]] can be used. In the case of a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to ''n''.

Every subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only ''linear'' subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by [[general topology]] (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. [[Compact space|Compact topological spaces]] are an important class of topological spaces ("species" of this "type"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the [[extended real line]] [-∞,∞] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (-∞,∞) are not. Geometric topology investigates [[Manifold (geometry)|manifolds]] (another "species" of this "type"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.

Both the linear and topological structures underly the [[Topological vector space|linear topological space]] (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. 

Every finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, "finite-dimensional real or complex linear space" and "finite-dimensional linear topological space", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.

===Affine and projective spaces===
[[File:Spaces affine etc.svg|thumb|250px|Relations between mathematical spaces: affine, projective etc]]

It is convenient to introduce [[w:Affine space|affine]] and [[w:Projective space|projective spaces]] by means of linear spaces, as follows. A {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear subspace of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space, being itself a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine spaces are mutually isomorphic. In the words of [[w:John C. Baez|John Baez]], "an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.

Given an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace ''A'' in a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space ''L'', a straight line in ''A'' may be defined as the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace  of ''L'' that intersects ''A'': in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to ''A''. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} affine subspace of ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L'' that intersects ''A''.

Every point of the affine subspace ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L''. However, some {{nobr|one-dimensional}} subspaces of ''L'' are parallel to ''A''; in some sense, they intersect ''A'' at infinity. The set of all {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspaces of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space is, by definition, a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} projective space. And the affine subspace ''A'' is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective space.

Defined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.

Every real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.

===Metric and uniform spaces===
[[File:Spaces metric etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: metric, uniform etc]]

Distances between points are defined in a [[w:Metric space|metric space]]. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called [[w:Metrizable|metrizable]], if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.

In a metric space, we can define 
bounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called [[w:Complete metric space|complete]] if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. 

Every Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points ''A'' and ''C'' consists of all points ''B'' such that the distance between ''A'' and ''C'' is equal to the sum of two distances, between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''B'' and ''C''.

The [[w:Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff dimension]] (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for [[w:Fractal|fractals]]). For a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to ''n''.

[[w:Uniform space|Uniform spaces]] do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or [[w:Filter (mathematics)#Cauchy filters|filters]] or [[w:Net (mathematics)#Cauchy nets|nets]]), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every ''linear'' topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.

===Normed, Banach, inner product, and Hilbert spaces===
[[File:Spaces Hilbert etc.svg|thumb|360px|Relations between mathematical spaces: normed, Banach etc]]

Vectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; has also a length, in other words, norm, &lt;math&gt;\lVert x\rVert&lt;/math&gt;. A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a [[w:Normed vector space|normed space]]. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A [[w:Banach space|Banach space]] is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

The set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or. more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) 
:&lt;math&gt; \lVert x-y\rVert^2 + \lVert x+y\rVert^2 = 2 \lVert x\rVert^2 + 2 \lVert y \rVert^2\ ,
&lt;/math&gt; 
generally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, &lt;math&gt; \lVert x\rVert^2 = (x, x)&lt;/math&gt;.

An [[w:Inner product space|inner product space]] is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A [[w:Hilbert space|Hilbert space]] is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for [[w:Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanczos|first1=Cornelius|author-link=w:Cornelius Lanczos|date= 1970|title=Space through the Ages: The Evolution of Geometrical Ideas from Pythagoras to Hilbert and Einstein|page=269|publisher=[[w:Academic Press|Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0124358508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space is the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product space that forgot its origin.

===Smooth and Riemannian manifolds ===
[[File:Spaces smooth etc.svg|thumb|330px|Relations between mathematical spaces: smooth, Riemannian etc]]

[[w:Smooth manifold|Smooth manifolds]] are not called "spaces", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space  are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.

At each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} smooth manifold are {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. 

A [[w:Riemannian manifold|Riemannian manifold]], or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic {{nowrap|non-Euclidean}} space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.

Waiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains [[w:Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemann spaces]], including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for [[w:General relativity|general relativity]].

===Measurable, measure, and probability spaces===
[[File:Spaces measurable etc.svg|thumb|390px|Relations between mathematical spaces: measurable, measure etc]]

Waiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches [[w:measure theory|measure theory]]. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to [[w:Andrey Kolmogorov|Andrey Kolmogorov's]] approach to [[w:probability theory|probability theory]].

A "geometric body" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called [[w:Measurable set|measurable sets]]. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.

Measurable sets, given in a [[w:Measurable space|measurable space]] by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a [[w:Sigma-algebra|{{nowrap|σ-algebra.}}]] The {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of [[w:Borel set|Borel sets]] is the most popular, but not the only choice. ([[w:Baire set|Baire sets]], [[w:Universally measurable set|universally measurable sets]], etc, are also used sometimes.) 
The topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra;}} for example, the [[w:Norm topology|norm topology]] and the [[w:Weak topology|weak topology]] on a [[w:Separable space|separable]] Hilbert space lead to the same Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}}.
Not every {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} is the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of some topology.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;
The space &lt;math&gt;2^{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; (equipped with its [[w:Product measure|tensor product]] {{nowrap|σ-algebra)}} has a measurable structure which is not generated by a topology. A slick proof can be found in [http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology/87888#87888 this answer] on [[w:MathOverflow|''MathOverflow'']].&lt;/ref&gt;
Actually, a {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology.  Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.

Standard measurable spaces (also called [[w:Standard Borel space|standard Borel spaces]]) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Standard_Borel_space EoM]). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.

Every Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra,}} is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.

A [[w:Measure space|measure space]] is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the [[w:Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measure]] is a measure space. [[w:Lebesgue integration|Integration theory]] defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.

Sets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a "mod&amp;nbsp;0 isomorphism" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).

A [[w:Probability space|probability space]] is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, [[w:Gaussian measure|Gaussian measures]]), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.

[[w:Standard probability space|Standard probability spaces]] are [[w:Standard probability space#Using the standardness|especially useful]]. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure ([[w:Standard probability space#Regular conditional probabilities|regular conditional probabilities]], see also [[w:Disintegration theorem|disintegration of measure]]). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Measure_algebra_(measure_theory) measure algebras] is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod&amp;nbsp;0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.

These spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.

===Non-commutative geometry===

The theoretical study of calculus, known as [[w:Mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]], led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions.  The earliest examples of these were [[w:Function space|function spaces]], each one adapted to its own class of problems.  These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces.  These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.

The most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called [[w:Banach algebra|Banach algebras]].  These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation.  An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space ''X''.  This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication.  With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative [[w:von Neumann algebra|von Neumann algebra]].  Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on ''X''.  An early observation of [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.

Von Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do.  Together with [[w:Francis Joseph Murray|Francis Murray]], he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras.  The [[w:direct integral|direct integral]] construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called ''factors''.  Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types.  Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case.  Types II and III exhibited new phenomena.  A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer.  Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.

A slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors.  This approach is the theory of {{nowrap|[[w:C*-algebra|C*-algebras]].}}  Here, the motivating example is the {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space.  By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on ''X'' that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication.  The [[w:Gelfand–Naimark theorem|Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] implied that there is a correspondence between commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} and geometric objects: Every commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} is of the form &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; for some locally compact Hausdorff space ''X''.  Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras.}}  Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras:}} If there were such a thing as a "non-commutative space ''X''," then its &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; would be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}}; if in addition the Gelfand–Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as {{nowrap|C*-algebras;}} so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is ''defined'' to be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra.}}  Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of {{nowrap|C*-algebras,}} and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}}.

Both of these examples are now cases of a field called [[w:noncommutative geometry|non-commutative geometry]].  The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively.  Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity.  Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions.  For example, consider the non-periodic [[w:Penrose tiling|Penrose tilings]] of the plane by kites and darts.  It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often.  As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion.  This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense.  Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra,}} and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry.  Another example, and one of great interest within [[w:differential geometry|differential geometry]], comes from [[w:foliation|foliations]] of manifolds.  These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called ''leaves'', each of which is locally parallel to others nearby.  The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space.  However, the example of an [[w:irrational rotation|irrational rotation]] shows that this topological space can be inacessible to the techniques of classical measure theory.  However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.

===Schemes===
[[File:Spaces schemes etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: schemes, stacks etc]]

[[w:Algebraic geometry|Algebraic geometry]] studies the geometric properties of [[w:polynomial|polynomial]] equations.  Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.  Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.

Prior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space.  The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of [[w:Perspective (geometry)|perspective]], and its algebra is described by [[w:homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous polynomials]].  All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space.  Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials.  At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero.  The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.

[[w:André Weil|André Weil]] saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite.  In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing ''abstract algebraic varieties'' which were not embedded in projective space.  These are now simply called ''varieties''.

The type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties.  It was introduced by [[w:Alexander Grothendieck|Alexander Grothendieck]] and is called a [[w:scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid.  This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations.  For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously.  However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line.  The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration—a single point on a circle—is not expressive enough to determine a unique line.  Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.

One of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space.  Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a [[w:sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] on the topological space, called the "structure sheaf".  On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called "regular functions".  The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.

Like manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space.  In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space.  For a scheme, the local models are called [[w:affine scheme|affine schemes]].  Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and [[w:commutative algebra|commutative algebra]].  The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are [[w:commutative ring|commutative rings]].  If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} R&lt;/math&gt; which translates the algebraic structure of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; into geometry.  Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf.  These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra.  By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.

There are many schemes that are not affine.  In particular,  projective spaces satisfy a condition called [[w:proper morphism|properness]] which is analogous to compactness.  Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces).  Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.{{sfn|Eisenbud|Harris|2000}}

Several generalizations of schemes have been introduced.  [[w:Michael Artin|Michael Artin]] defined an [[w:algebraic space|algebraic space]] as the quotient of a scheme by the [[w:equivalence relation|equivalence relations]] that define [[w:étale morphism|étale morphisms]].  Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible.  For instance, the [[w:Keel–Mori theorem|Keel–Mori theorem]] can be used to show that many [[w:moduli space|moduli spaces]] are algebraic spaces.

More general than an algebraic space is a [[w:Deligne–Mumford stack|Deligne–Mumford stack]].  DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials.  They play the same role for schemes that [[w:orbifold|orbifolds]] do for [[w:manifold|manifolds]].  For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne–Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space.  Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle.  But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point.  In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient.  This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe [[w:moduli of algebraic curves|moduli of algebraic curves]].

A further generalization are the [[w:algebraic stack|algebraic stacks]], also called Artin stacks.  DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions.  While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.

===Topoi===
[[File:Spaces topoi etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: locales, topoi etc]]

In Grothendieck's work on the [[w:Weil conjectures|Weil conjectures]], he introduced a new type of topology now called a [[w:Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topology]].  A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of "nearness," making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets.  By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of "covering".  A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space.  Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.

Grothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of [[w:topos (mathematics)|topoi]].  In his memoir ''Récoltes et Semailles'', he called them his "most vast conception".&lt;ref&gt;"Si le thème des schémas est comme le coeur de la géométrie nouvelle, le thème du topos en est l’enveloppe, ou la demeure. Il est ce que j’ai conçu de plus vaste, pour saisir avec finesse, par un même langage riche en résonances géométriques, une "essence" commune à des situations des plus éloignées les unes des autres, provenant de telle région ou de telle autre du vaste univers des choses mathématiques." ''Récoltes et Semailles'', page P43.&lt;/ref&gt; A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data.  The [[w:category (mathematics)|category]] of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data.  Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space.  Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right.  These are now called [[w:Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck topoi]].

Every topological space determines a topos, and vice versa.  There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological.  (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a [[w:sober space|sober space]].)  Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos.  But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest.  For instance, Grothendieck's theory of [[w:étale cohomology|étale cohomology]] (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the étale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.

Topological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called [[w:locale (mathematics)|locales]].  The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a [[w:lattice (order)|lattice]].  The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be [[w:complete Heyting algebra|complete Heyting algebras]].  The theory of locales takes this as its starting point.  A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms.  The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces.  Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called [[w:pointless topology|pointless topology]].

Topoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic.  Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier.  This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values.  In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to "False" and "True".  But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated.  [[w:William Lawvere|Lawvere]] and [[w:Myles Tierney|Tierney]] recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an [[w:elementary topos|elementary topos]], and that elementary topoi were models of [[w:intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic logic]].  In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.

==Spaces and structures==

According to Kevin Carlson,
:Neither of these words ["space" and "structure"] have a single mathematical definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same situations, but you often think of a "space" as more geometric and a "structure" as more algebraic. [...] So you could think of "structures" as places we do algebra, and "spaces" as places we do geometry. Then a lot of great mathematics has come from passing from structures to spaces and vice versa, as when we look at the [[w:Fundamental group|fundamental group]] of a topological space or the [[w:Spectrum of a ring|spectrum of a ring]]. But in the end, the distinction is neither hard nor fast and only goes so far: many things are obviously both structures and spaces, some things are not obviously either, and some people might well disagree with everything I've said here.&lt;ref name="carlson" /&gt;

Nevertheless, a general definition of "structure" was proposed by Bourbaki&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;; it embraces all [[#Types_of_spaces|types of spaces]] mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Robert C.|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1081878080 |title=Leo Corry, ''Modern Algebra and the Rise of Mathematical Structures''|department=Review|journal=Modern Logic|date=2000|volume=8|issue=1–2|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a book by Leo Corry:
:Corry does not seem to feel that ''any'' formal definition of structure could do justice to the use of the concept in actual mathematical practice [...] Corry's view could be summarized as the belief that 'structure' refers essentially to a way of ''doing'' mathematics, and is therefore a concept probably just as far from being precisely definable as the cultural artifact of mathematics itself.

For more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: [[w:Mathematical structure|mathematical structure]], [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures|equivalent definitions of mathematical structures]], and [[w:Transport of structure|transport of structure]].

The distinction between geometric "spaces" and algebraic "structures" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, [[w:Group (mathematics)|groups]] are algebraic, while [[w:Euclidean space|Euclidean spaces]] are geometric. [[w:Module (mathematics)|Modules]] over [[w:Ring (mathematics)|rings]] are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the [[w:Field (mathematics)#Constructing fields from rings|ring appears to be a field]], the [[w:Vector space#Modules|module appears to be a linear space]]; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and [[w:Inner product space|endowed with inner product]], it [[w:Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|becomes Euclidean space]]; now geometric. The (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of real numbers]] is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:real line|real line]]. Its [[w:Algebraic closure#Examples|algebraic closure]], the (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of complex numbers]], is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:Complex plane|complex plane]]. It is first of all "a place we do [[w:Complex analysis|analysis]]" (rather than algebra or geometry).

Every space treated in Section "[[#Types_of_spaces|Types of spaces]]" above, except for "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections, is a set (the "principal base set" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called "points" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called "points".

However, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be [[w:Projective geometry#Whitehead's axioms|formalized via two base sets]], the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, [[w:Duality (projective geometry)|a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines]]. A less geometric example: a graph may be [[w:Graph (discrete mathematics)#Graph|formalized via two base sets]], the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures#Transport of structures; isomorphism|finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets]] are stipulated by Bourbaki.

Many mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, "[[w:Pointless topology|pointless topology]]" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also [[w:Mereotopology|mereotopology]] and [[w:Whitehead's point-free geometry|point-free geometry]].

'''Stefan Andrus Burr''' (born 1940) is a [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].  He is a retired professor of Computer Science at [[The City College of New York]].

Burr received his Ph.D. in 1969 from [[Princeton University]] under the supervision of [[Bernard Dwork]]; his thesis research involved the [[Waring–Goldbach problem]] in [[number theory]], which concerns the representations of integers as sums of powers of [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Stefan Andrus Burr|id=28377}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his subsequent publications involve problems from the field of [[Ramsey theory]].  He has published 27 papers with [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/Erdos.html|title=Paul Erdős' papers|publisher=[[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] - http://www.renyi.hu|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Erdős–Burr conjecture]], published as a conjecture by Erdős and Burr in 1975, solved only in 2015, states that [[sparse graph]]s have [[linear growth|linearly growing]] [[Ramsey number]]s.

It is the [[inference]] from the truth of "''A'' implies ''B''" the truth of "Not-''B'' implies not-''A''", and conversely.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Bobuch A. "Glossary of Logical Terms". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 5–6, p. 76. Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi, Irving M. ''Symbolic Logic''.  5th ed. Macmillan, 1979.  See the Rules of Replacement, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very closely related to the [[rule of inference]] [[modus tollens]]. It is the rule that:

&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q) \Leftrightarrow (\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt;

Where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a proof with."

== Formal notation ==
The ''transposition'' rule may be expressed as a [[sequent]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q) \vdash (\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a metalogical symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;(\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q)&lt;/math&gt; in some logical system;

or as a rule of inference:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q}{\therefore \neg Q \to \neg P}&lt;/math&gt;
where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "&lt;math&gt;\neg Q \to \neg P&lt;/math&gt;";

or as the statement of a truth-functional [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in  ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q) \to (\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

==Traditional logic==
=== Form of transposition===
In the inferred proposition, the consequent is the contradictory of the antecedent in the original proposition, and the antecedent of the inferred proposition is the contradictory of the consequent of the original proposition.  The symbol for material implication signifies the proposition as a hypothetical, or the "if-then" form, e.g. "if P then Q".

The biconditional statement of the rule of transposition (↔) refers to the relation between hypothetical (→) ''propositions'', with each proposition including an antecent and consequential term.  As a matter of logical inference, to transpose or convert the terms of one proposition requires the conversion of the terms of the propositions on both sides of the biconditional relationship.  Meaning, to transpose or convert (P → Q) to (Q → P) requires that the other proposition, (~Q →  ~P), be transposed or converted to (~P →  ~Q).  Otherwise, to convert the terms of one proposition and not the other renders the rule invalid, violating the [[sufficient condition]] and [[necessary condition]] of the terms of the propositions, where the violation is that the changed proposition commits the fallacy of [[denying the antecedent]] or [[affirming the consequent]] by means of illicit [[Conversion (logic)|conversion]].

The truth of the rule of transposition is dependent upon the relations of sufficient condition and necessary condition in logic.

===Sufficient condition===
In the proposition "If P then Q", the occurrence of 'P' is sufficient reason for the occurrence of 'Q'.  'P', as an individual or a class, materially implicates 'Q', but the relation of 'Q' to 'P' is such that the converse proposition "If Q then P" does not necessarily have sufficient condition.  The rule of inference for sufficient condition is ''modus ponens'', which is an argument for conditional implication:

Premise (1): If P, then Q

Premise (2): P

Conclusion: Therefore, Q

===Necessary condition===
Since the converse of premise (1) is not valid, all that can be stated of the relationship of 'P' and 'Q' is that in the absence of 'Q', 'P' does not occur, meaning that 'Q' is the necessary condition for 'P'.  The rule of inference for necessary condition is ''modus tollens'':

Premise (1): If P, then Q

Premise (2): not Q

Conclusion: Therefore, not P

===Necessity and sufficiency example===
An example traditionally used by logicians contrasting sufficient and necessary conditions is the statement "If there is fire, then oxygen is present". An oxygenated environment is necessary for fire or combustion, but simply because there is an oxygenated environment does not necessarily mean that fire or combustion is occurring. While one can infer that fire stipulates the presence of oxygen, from the presence of oxygen the converse "If there is oxygen present, then fire is present" cannot be inferred.  All that can be inferred from the original proposition is that "If oxygen is not present, then there cannot be fire".

===Relationship of propositions===
The symbol for the biconditional ("↔") signifies the relationship between the propositions is both necessary and sufficient, and is verbalized as "[[if and only if]]", or, according to the example "If P then Q 'if and only if' if not Q then not P".

Necessary and sufficient conditions can be explained by analogy in terms of the concepts and the rules of immediate inference of traditional logic.  In the categorical proposition "All S is P", the subject term 'S' is said to be distributed, that is, all members of its class are exhausted in its expression.  Conversely, the predicate term 'P' cannot be said to be distributed, or exhausted in its expression because it is indeterminate whether every instance of a member of 'P' as a class is also a member of 'S' as a class.  All that can be validly inferred is that "Some P are S".  Thus, the type 'A' proposition "All P is S" cannot be inferred by conversion from the original 'A' type proposition "All S is P". All that can be inferred is the type "A" proposition "All non-P is non-S" (Note that (P → Q) and (~Q → ~P) are both 'A' type propositions).  Grammatically, one cannot infer "all mortals are men" from "All men are mortal".  An 'A' type proposition can only be immediately inferred by conversion when both the subject and predicate are distributed, as in the inference "All bachelors are unmarried men" from "All unmarried men are bachelors".

===Transposition and the method of contraposition===
In [[traditional logic]] the reasoning process of transposition as a rule of inference is applied to [[categorical propositions]] through [[contraposition]] and [[obversion]],&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, 1961, pp. 65–66.  For reference to the initial step of contraposition as obversion and conversion, see Copi, 1953, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; a series of immediate inferences where the rule of obversion is first applied to the original categorical proposition "All S is P"; yielding the obverse "No S is non-P". In the obversion of the original proposition to an 'E' type proposition, both terms become distributed. The obverse is then converted, resulting in "No non-P is S", maintaining distribution of both terms.  The No non-P is S" is again obverted, resulting in the [contrapositive] "All non-P is non-S".  Since nothing is said in the definition of contraposition with regard to the predicate of the inferred proposition, it is permissible that it could be the original subject or its contradictory, and the predicate term of the resulting 'A' type proposition is again undistributed.  This results in two contrapositives, one where the predicate term is distributed, and another where the predicate term is undistributed.&lt;ref&gt;See Stebbing, 1961, pp. 65–66. Also, for reference to the immediate inferences of obversion, conversion, and obversion again, see Copi, 1953, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between transposition and contraposition===
Note that the method of transposition and contraposition should not be confused.  Contraposition is a type of [[immediate inference]] in which from a given categorical proposition another categorical proposition is inferred which has as its subject the contradictory of the original predicate.  Since nothing is said in the definition of contraposition with regard to the predicate of the inferred proposition, it is permissible that it could be the original subject or its contradictory.  This is in contradistinction to the form of the propositions of transposition, which may be material implication, or a hypothetical statement.  The difference is that in its application to categorical propositions the result of contraposition is two contrapositives, each being the obvert of the other,&lt;ref&gt;See Stebbing, 1961, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. "No non-P is S" and "All non-P is non-S".  The distinction between the two contrapositives is absorbed and eliminated in the principle of transposition, which presupposes the "mediate inferences"&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation of the absorption of obversion and conversion as "mediate inferences see: Copi, Irving. ''Symbolic Logic''. pp. 171–74, MacMillan, 1979, fifth edition.&lt;/ref&gt; of contraposition and is also referred to as the "law of contraposition".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, A.N. "Logic, Traditional". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol.5, Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the phrase "there is '''one and only one'''" is used to indicate that exactly one object with a certain property exists. In [[mathematical logic]], this sort of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] is known as '''uniqueness quantification''' or '''unique existential quantification'''.

Uniqueness quantification is often denoted with the symbols "∃!" or "∃&lt;sub&gt;=1&lt;/sub&gt;".  For example, the formal statement 
: &lt;math&gt;\exists! n \in \mathbb{N}\,(n - 2 = 4)&lt;/math&gt;
may be read aloud as "there is exactly one natural number ''n'' such that ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4".

== Proving uniqueness ==

The most common technique to proving unique existence is to first prove existence of entity with the desired condition; then, to assume there exist two entities (say, ''a'' and ''b'') that both satisfy the condition, and logically deduce their equality, i.e.&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''.

As a simple high school example, to show ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 has exactly one solution, we first show by demonstration that at least one solution exists, namely 3; the proof of this part is simply the calculation

:&lt;math&gt; 3 + 2 = 5. &lt;/math&gt;

We now assume that there are two solutions, namely ''a'' and ''b'', satisfying ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. Thus

:&lt;math&gt; a + 2 = 5\text{ and }b + 2 = 5. &lt;/math&gt;

By transitivity of equality,
:&lt;math&gt; a + 2 = b + 2. &lt;/math&gt;

By cancellation,
:&lt;math&gt; a = b. &lt;/math&gt;

This simple example shows how a proof of uniqueness is done, the end result being the equality of the two quantities that satisfy the condition.

Both existence and uniqueness must be proven, in order to conclude that there exists exactly one solution.

An alternative way to prove uniqueness is to prove there exists a value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the condition, and then proving that, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the condition for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;.

== Reduction to ordinary existential and universal quantification ==
Uniqueness quantification can be expressed in terms of the [[existential quantifier|existential]] and [[universal quantifier|universal]] quantifiers of [[predicate logic]] by defining the formula
∃!''x'' ''P(x)'' to mean literally,
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x\,( P(x) \, \wedge \neg \exists y\,(P(y) \wedge y  \ne x))&lt;/math&gt;
which is the same as
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \, ( P(x) \wedge \forall y\,(P(y) \to y = x)).&lt;/math&gt;
An equivalent definition that has the virtue of separating the notions of existence and uniqueness into two clauses, at the expense of brevity, is
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x\, P(x) \wedge \forall y\, \forall z\,((P(y) \wedge P(z)) \to y = z).&lt;/math&gt;
Another equivalent definition with the advantage of brevity is
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x\,\forall y\,(P(y) \leftrightarrow y = x).&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==
One generalization of uniqueness quantification is [[counting quantification]].  This includes both quantification of the form "exactly ''k'' objects exist such that …" as well as "infinitely many objects exist such that …" and "only finitely many objects exist such that…".   The first of these forms is expressible using ordinary quantifiers, but the latter two cannot be expressed in ordinary [[first-order logic]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a consequence of the [[compactness theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniqueness depends on a notion of [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. Loosening this to some coarser [[equivalence relation]] yields quantification of uniqueness [[up to]] that equivalence (under this framework, regular uniqueness is "uniqueness up to equality"). For example, many concepts in [[category theory]] are defined to be unique up to [[isomorphism]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Éléments de mathématique'''''  is a [[treatise]] on mathematics by the collective [[Nicolas Bourbaki]],  composed of twelve books (each divided into one or more chapters). The first volumes were published by [[Éditions Hermann]] from 1939 initially in the form of booklets and then as bound volumes.  Following a disagreement with the editor, the publication was resumed in the 1970s by the CCLS, and then in the 1980s by [[Masson (publisher)|Éditions Masson]]. Since 2006, [[Springer Verlag]] has republished all the fascicles, and has published a new volume in 2016.

The strange [[Number_(grammar)#French|singular]] "mathématique" in the title is deliberate, to convey the authors' belief that the material is a unity, contrary to what conventional form of the title might suggest.&lt;ref name=M55&gt;Mashaal (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;55&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the title ''Éléments d'histoire des mathématiques'' by the same authors employs the [[Number_(grammar)#French|plural]] to indicate that before Bourbaki, mathematics was a set of scattered disciplines, and that the modern notion of structure has allowed their unification.&lt;ref name=M56&gt;Mashaal (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six volumes follow a logical sequence.  The subsequent volumes are dependent on the first six, but not on each other.&lt;ref name=M55/&gt;

== Volumes in the series ==

The series is divided into books and each book into chapters. Below is the list of books in the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bourbaki.ens.fr/Ouvrages.html Ouvrages de N.

== Inter-relationship of the books ==

In the first six books, every statement in the text assumes as known only those results which have already been discussed in the same chapter, or in the previous chapters ordered as follows:

# Set theory
# Algebra chapters 1 to 3
# General topology chapters 1 to 3
# Algebra chapter 4 onwards
# General topology chapters 4 onwards
# Functions of a real variable
# Topological vector spaces
# Integration

Later books assume knowledge of the first six books and their relationship to the other books in the series will be indicated at the outset.

==Evolution of the project==
The first volume, published in 1939, was the ''Fascicule de résultats'' of ''Théorie des ensembles''.   The publication of subsequent volumes did not follow the order of the Treatise.&lt;ref name=M55/&gt;  Publication continues intermittently - the tenth chapter of ''Algèbre commutative'' was published in 1998, an expanded second edition of the eighth chapter of ''Algèbre'' in 2012, and the first four chapters of a new book ''Topologie algébrique'' in 2016. This latest book was initially planned as the eleventh chapter of ''Topologie générale''. The ''Éléments de mathématique'' remains unfinished to this day.

Early versions are available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/ Archives de l'Association des Collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the books published were out of print for years. The publisher Springer started their republication in 2006.

In [[computability theory]], a '''Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; class''' is a subset of 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; of a certain form. These classes are of interest as technical tools within [[recursion theory]] and [[effective descriptive set theory]]. They are also used in the application of recursion theory to other branches of mathematics&amp;nbsp;(Cenzer 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;39).

== Definition ==

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt; ω&lt;/sup&gt; consists of all finite sequences of 0s and 1s, while the set 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; consists of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s (that is, functions from {{nowrap|1=&amp;omega; = {0, 1, 2, ...}}} to the set {{nowrap|1={0,1}}}).

A [[Tree (descriptive set theory)|tree]] on 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt; ω&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; that is closed under taking initial segments.   An element ''f'' of 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''path''' through a tree ''T'' on 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt; &amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; if every finite initial segment of ''f'' is in ''T''.

A ([[lightface]]) '''Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; class''' is a subset ''C'' of 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; for which there is a [[computable set|computable]] tree ''T'' such that ''C'' consists of exactly the paths through ''T''.  A '''boldface &amp;Pi;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; class''' is a subset ''D'' of 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; for which there is an oracle ''f'' in 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; and a subtree tree ''T'' of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt; &amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; from computable from ''f'' such that ''D'' is the set of paths through ''T''.

== As effectively closed sets ==

The boldface Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; classes are exactly the same as the closed sets of 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; and thus the same as the boldface Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; subsets of 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[Borel hierarchy]].

Lightface Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; classes in 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.5em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; classes whose tree is computable with no oracle) correspond to '''effectively closed sets'''. A subset ''B'' of 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; is effectively closed if there is a [[recursively enumerable]] sequence &amp;lang;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : i &amp;isin; &amp;omega;&amp;rang; of elements of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt; &amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; such that each ''g'' &amp;isin; 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;  is in ''B'' if and only if  &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is an initial segment of ''B''.

== Relationship with effective theories ==

For each effectively axiomatized theory ''T'' of [[first-order logic]], the set of all completions of ''T'' is a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; class. Moreover, for each &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; subset ''S'' of &lt;math&gt;2^\omega&lt;/math&gt; there is an effectively axiomatized theory ''T'' such that each element of ''S'' computes a completion of ''T'', and each completion of ''T'' computes an element of&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;(Jockusch and Soare 1972b).
