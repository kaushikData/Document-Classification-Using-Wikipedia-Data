In [[programming languages]], an '''abstract type''' is a type in a [[nominative type system]] that cannot be [[Instance (computer science)|instantiated]] directly; a type that is not abstract – which ''can'' be instantiated – is called a ''concrete type''. Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete [[subtype]]. Abstract types are also known as ''existential types''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt;

An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]]'', ''interfaces'', ''signatures'', or ''class types''. In [[Class-based programming|class-based]] [[object-oriented programming]], abstract types are implemented as ''abstract classes'' (also known as ''[[abstract base class]]es''), and concrete types as ''[[concrete class]]es''. In [[generic programming]], the analogous notion is a [[Concept (generic programming)|concept]], which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept.

Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that ''can'' be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include ''abstract methods'' or ''abstract properties''&lt;ref&gt;http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt; that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include ''[[Trait (computer science)|traits]]'', ''[[mixin]]s'', ''flavors'', ''roles'', or ''type classes''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Signifying abstract types ==

Abstract classes can be created, signified, or simulated in several ways:
* By use of the explicit [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] &lt;tt&gt;abstract&lt;/tt&gt; in the class definition, as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[D (programming language)|D]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* By including, in the class definition, one or more [[abstract method]]s (called ''pure [[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]), which the class is declared to accept as part of its protocol, but for which no implementation is provided.
* By [[inheritance (computer science)|inheriting]] from an abstract type, and not overriding all missing features necessary to complete the class definition.
* In many dynamically typed languages such as [[Smalltalk]], any class that sends a particular method to [[this (computer science)|this]], but doesn't implement that method, can be considered abstract.  (However, in many such languages, like [[Objective-C]], the error is not detected until the class is used, and the message returns results in an exception error message such as "Does not recognize selector: xxx" as &lt;code&gt;- [NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:(SEL)selector]&lt;/code&gt; is invoked upon detection of an unimplemented method).

=== Example (Java) ===

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;

//By default, all methods in all classes are concrete, unless the abstract keyword is used.
abstract class Demo {
    // An abstract class may include abstract methods, which have no implementation.
    abstract public int sum(int x, int y);

    // An abstract class may also include concrete methods.
    public int product(int x, int y) { return x*y; }
}

//By default, all methods in all interfaces are abstract, unless the default keyword is used.
interface DemoInterface {
    [abstract] int getLength(); //Abstract can be used here, though is completely useless
    
    //The default keyword can be used in this context to specify a concrete method in an interface
    default int product(int x, int y) {
        return x * y;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Use of abstract types ==

Abstract types are an important feature in [[static typing|statically typed]] OOP languages. Many [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages have no equivalent feature (although the use of [[duck typing]] makes abstract types unnecessary); however ''[[Trait (computer programming)|traits]]'' are found in some modern dynamically-typed languages.

Some authors argue that classes should be [[Leaf class (programming language)|leaf class]]es (have no subtypes), or else be abstract.&lt;ref name="riel1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riel|first=Arthur|title=Object-Oriented Design Heuristics|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63385-X|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meyers1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Scott|title=More Effective C++|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63371-X |page=258
|quote=Make non-leaf classes abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract types are useful in that they can be used to define and enforce a ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]]''; a set of operations that all objects implementing the protocol must support.

'''Automatic Clustering Algorithm''' refers to algorithms that can perform clustering without prior knowledge of the data sets. In contrast with other [[Cluster Analysis]] techniques, automatic clustering algorithms can determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points.

== Centroid-Based Clustering ==
Given a set of ''n'' objects, centroid-based algorithms create ''k'' partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that ''k≤n''. A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.  

Automated selection of ''k'' in a [[K-means clustering|''K''-means clustering algorithm]], one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a big problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the [[Elbow method (clustering)|elbow method]]. It consists of running ''k''-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of ''k'' will be on the "elbow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bl.ocks.org/rpgove/0060ff3b656618e9136b|title=Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering|website=bl.ocks.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another method that modifies the ''k''-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the ''G''-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, ''k'' is increased until each ''k''-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and it does not set limits for the covariance of the data.&lt;ref&gt;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2526-learning-the-k-in-k-means.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connectivity-Based Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering) ==
Connectivity-Based Clustering or [[Hierarchical clustering|Hierarchical Clustering]] is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects. Hierarchical models can either be divisive—where partitions are built from the entire data set available—or agglomerating—where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/introducing-clustering-ii-clustering-algorithms.html|title=Introducing Clustering II: Clustering Algorithms - GameAnalytics|date=2014-05-20|work=GameAnalytics|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it comes with many problems. For instance, it is sensitive to noise, to fluctuations in the data set, and it is more difficult to automate.  

Methods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms&lt;ref&gt;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19123336.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach, followed by the building up of a descriptive function, which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation (an option not found in classical HCA). This method includes the two following steps: outliers are removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allows expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-15|title=Improving hierarchical cluster analysis: A new method with outlier detection and automatic clustering|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169743907000068|journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=208–217|doi=10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.01.005|issn=0169-7439|last1=Almeida|first1=J.A.S.|last2=Barbosa|first2=L.M.S.|last3=Pais|first3=A.A.C.C.|last4=Formosinho|first4=S.J.|hdl=10316/5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[BIRCH]] (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Tian|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=Raghu|last3=Livny|first3=Miron|last4=Zhang|first4=Tian|last5=Ramakrishnan|first5=Raghu|last6=Livny|first6=Miron|date=1996-06-01|title=BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases, BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233269.233324,%20http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=235968.233324|journal=ACM SIGMOD Record|volume=25|issue=2|pages=103, 103–114, 114|doi=10.1145/235968.233324|issn=0163-5808}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it still has limitations because it requires the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserve the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the use had to input the cluster count, and improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces supercluster splitting with relatively high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Variations on the Clustering Algorithm BIRCH|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579617300151|journal=Big Data Research|language=en|volume=11|pages=44–53|doi=10.1016/j.bdr.2017.09.002|issn=2214-5796|last1=Lorbeer|first1=Boris|last2=Kosareva|first2=Ana|last3=Deva|first3=Bersant|last4=Softić|first4=Dženan|last5=Ruppel|first5=Peter|last6=Küpper|first6=Axel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Density-Based Clustering ==
Unlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, [[density-based clustering]] algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres. The Density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/how-density-based-clustering-works.htm|title=How Density-based Clustering works—ArcGIS Pro {{!}} ArcGIS Desktop|website=pro.arcgis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is [[DBSCAN]] and uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method [[OPTICS algorithm|OPTICS]] creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density. 

These methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7978726|title=An algorithm for automatic recognition of cluster centers based on local density clustering - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' 

In the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA’s alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6252874|title=AutoClustering: An estimation of distribution algorithm for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mathematical fields of [[graph theory]] and [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''bipartite dimension''' or '''biclique cover number''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is the minimum number of [[biclique]]s (that is complete bipartite subgraphs), needed to [[edge covering|cover]] all edges in ''E''. A collection of bicliques covering all edges in ''G'' is called a '''biclique edge cover''', or sometimes '''biclique cover'''. The bipartite dimension of ''G'' is often denoted by the symbol ''d''(''G'').

==Example==
An example for a biclique edge cover is given in the following diagrams:

&lt;gallery Caption="Example for biclique edge cover"&gt;
Image:Bipartite-dimension-bipartite-graph.svg|A bipartite graph...
Image:Bipartite-dimension-biclique-cover.svg|...and a covering with four bicliques

Image:Bipartite-dimension-green-biclique.svg|the green biclique from the cover
Image:Bipartite-dimension-black-biclique.svg|the black biclique from the cover
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Bipartite dimension formulas for some graphs==
The biclique dimension of the ''n''-vertex [[complete graph]], &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lceil \log_2 n\rceil &lt;/math&gt;.

The bipartite dimension of a ''2n''-vertex
[[crown graph]] equals &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)=\min \left\{\,k \mid n \le \binom{k}{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} \,\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the inverse function of the [[central binomial coefficient]] {{harv|de Caen|Gregory|Pullman|1981}}.
{{harvtxt|Fishburn|Hammer|1996}} determine the bipartite dimension for some special graphs. For example, the path &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;
has &lt;math&gt;d(P_n) = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and the cycle &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;d(C_n)=\lceil n/2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.

==Computing the bipartite dimension==
The computational task of determining the bipartite dimension for a given graph ''G'' is an [[optimization problem]]. The [[decision problem]] for bipartite dimension can be phrased as:

:INSTANCE: A graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; and a positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
:QUESTION: Does G admit a biclique edge cover containing at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; bicliques?

This problem appears as problem '''GT18''' in Garey and Johnson's classical book on [[NP-completeness|'''NP'''-completeness]], and is a rather straightforward reformulation of
another decision problem on families of finite sets.

The '''set basis problem''' appears as problem '''SP7''' in Garey and Johnson's book.
Here, for a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;,
a '''set basis''' for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is another family of subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = \{B_1,\ldots,B_\ell\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, such that every set &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; can be described as the union of some basis elements from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The set basis problem is now given as follows:

:INSTANCE: A finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, and a positive integer ''k''.
:QUESTION: Does there exist a set basis of size at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;?

In its former formulation, the problem was proved to be [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] by {{harvtxt|Orlin|1977}}, even for [[bipartite graph]]s. The formulation as a set basis problem was proved to be '''NP'''-complete earlier by {{harvtxt|Stockmeyer|1975}}. The problem remains '''NP'''-hard even if we restrict our attention to bipartite graphs whose bipartite dimension is guaranteed to be at most &lt;math&gt;O(\log\,\!n)&lt;/math&gt;, with ''n'' denoting the size of the given problem instance {{harv|Gottlieb|Savage|Yerukhimovich|2005}}. On the positive side, the problem is solvable in polynomial time on bipartite [[domino-free graph]]s {{harv|Amilhastre|Janssen|Vilarem|1997}}.

Regarding the existence of [[approximation algorithm]]s, {{harvtxt|Simon|1990}} proved that the problem cannot be approximated well (assuming [[P versus NP problem|'''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''']]). Indeed, the bipartite dimension is [[Hardness of approximation|'''NP'''-hard to approximate]] within &lt;math&gt;|V|^{1/3-\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; for every fixed &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, already for bipartite graphs {{harv|Gruber|Holzer|2007}}.

In contrast, proving that the problem is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] is an exercise in designing [[kernelization|kernelization algorithms]], which appears as such in the textbook by {{harvtxt|Downey|Fellows|1999}}. {{harvtxt|Fleischner|Mujuni|Paulusma|Szeider|2009}} also provide a concrete bound on the size of the resulting kernel, which has meanwhile been improved by {{harvtxt|Nor|Hermelin|Charlat|Engelstadter|2010}}.
In fact, for a given bipartite graph on ''n'' vertices, it can be decided in time &lt;math&gt;O(f(k))+n^3&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(k) = 2^{k2^{k-1}+3k}&lt;/math&gt; whether its bipartite dimension is at most ''k'' {{harv|Nor|Hermelin|Charlat|Engelstadter|2010}}

==Applications==
The problem of determining the bipartite dimension of a graph appears in various contexts of computing. For instance, in computer systems, different users of a system can be allowed or disallowed accessing various resources. In a [[role-based access control]] system, a role provides access rights to a set of resources. A user can own multiple roles, and he has permission to access all resources granted by some of his roles. Also, a role can be owned by multiple users. The ''role mining problem'' is to find a minimum set of roles, such that for each user, his roles taken together grant access to all specified resources. The set of users together with the set of resources in the system naturally induces a bipartite graph, whose edges are permissions. Each biclique in this graph is a potential role, and the optimum solutions to the role mining problem are precisely the minimum biclique edge covers {{harv|Ene|Horne|Milosavljevic|Rao|2008}}.

A similar scenario is known in [[computer security]], more specifically in secure [[broadcast]]ing. In that setup, several messages need to be sent each to a set of receivers, over an insecure channel. Each message has to be encrypted using some cryptographic key that is known only to the intended receivers. Each receiver may possess multiple encryption keys, and each key will be distributed to multiple receivers. The ''optimum key generation problem'' is to find a minimum set of encryption keys for ensuring secure transmission. As above, the problem can be modeled using a bipartite graph whose minimum biclique edge covers coincide with the solutions to the optimum key generation problem {{harv|Shu|Lee|Yannakakis|2006}}.

A different application lies in biology, where minimum biclique edge covers are used in mathematical models of [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) serology {{harv|Nau|Markowsky|Woodbury|Amos|1978}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">In [[mathematics]], a '''Carlyle circle''' (named for [[Thomas Carlyle]])  is a certain [[circle]] in a [[coordinate plane]] associated with a [[quadratic equation]]. The circle has the property that the [[equation solving|solutions]] of the quadratic equation are the horizontal coordinates of the intersections of the circle with the [[horizontal axis]]. Carlyle circles have been used to develop [[ruler-and-compass construction]]s of [[regular polygon]]s.

==Definition==
[[File:CarlyleCircle.svg|thumb|300px|Carlyle circle of the quadratic equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''sx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.]]
Given the quadratic equation
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''sx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0
the circle in the [[coordinate plane]] having the line segment joining the points ''A''(0,&amp;nbsp;1) and ''B''(''s'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') as a diameter is called the '''Carlyle circle''' of the quadratic equation. &lt;ref&gt;E.

==Defining property==
The defining property of the Carlyle circle can be established thus: the equation of the circle having the line segment AB as diameter is
:''x''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
The [[abscissa]]s of the points where the circle intersects the ''x''-axis are the roots of the equation (obtained by setting ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in the equation of the circle)
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''sx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Regular pentagon===

The problem of constructing a regular pentagon is equivalent to the problem of constructing the roots of the equation
:''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
One root of this equation is ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 which corresponds to the point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1,&amp;nbsp;0). Removing the factor corresponding to this root, the other roots turn out to be roots of the equation
:''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
These roots can be represented in the form ω, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; where ω = exp(2π''i''/5). Let these correspond to the points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Letting 
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
we have 
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;1, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. (These can be quickly shown to be true by direct substitution into the quartic above and noting that ω&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = ω, and ω&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)
So ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the roots of the quadratic equation 
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
The Carlyle circle associated with this quadratic has a diameter with endpoints at (0, 1) and (-1, -1) and center at (-1/2, 0). Carlyle circles are used to construct ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From the definitions of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it also follows that
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;pi;/5), ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;(4&amp;pi;/5).
These are then used to construct the points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

This detailed procedure involving Carlyle circles for the construction of regular [[pentagon]]s is given below.&lt;ref name=DeTemple/&gt;
#Draw a [[circle]] in which to inscribe the pentagon and mark the center point&amp;nbsp;''O''.
#Draw a horizontal line through the center of the circle. Mark one intersection with the circle as point&amp;nbsp;''B''.
#Construct a vertical line through the center. Mark one intersection with the circle as point ''A''.
#Construct the point ''M'' as the midpoint of ''O'' and ''B''.
#Draw a circle centered at ''M'' through the point ''A''. Mark its intersection with the horizontal line (inside the original circle) as the point ''W'' and its intersection outside the circle as the point ''V''.
#Draw a circle of radius ''OA'' and center ''W''. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon.
#Draw a circle of radius ''OA'' and center ''V''. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon.
#The fifth vertex is the intersection of the horizontal axis with the original circle.

===Regular heptadecagon===

There is a similar method involving Carlyle circles to construct regular [[heptadecagon]]s.&lt;ref name=DeTemple/&gt; The attached figure illustrates the procedure.

===Regular 257-gon===

To construct a regular [[257-gon]] using Carlyle circles, as many as 24 Carlyle circles are to be constructed. One of these is the circle to solve the quadratic equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name=DeTemple/&gt;

===Regular 65537-gon===

There is a procedure involving Carlyle circles for the construction of a regular [[65537-gon]]. However there are practical problems for the implementation of the procedure, as, for example, it requires the construction of the Carlyle circle for the solution of the quadratic equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name=DeTemple/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Carlyle circle original problem.svg|thumb|Carlyle's solution to Leslie's problem. The black line segment is divided in two segments in such a way that the two segments form a rectangle (green) being of equal area to another given rectangle (red).]]

According to [[Howard Eves]] (1911–2004) the mathematician [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] (1766-1832) described the geometric construction of roots of a quadratic equation with a circle in his book ''Elements of Geometry'' and noted that this idea was provided by his former student [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881).&lt;ref name=Eves&gt; See for instance Hornsby, DeTemple or Howard Eves: ''An Introduction into the History of Mathematics''. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 3rd edition, 1969, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; However while the description in Leslie's book contains an analogous circle construction, it was presented solely in elementary geometric terms without the notion of a Cartesian coordinate system or a quadratic function and its roots:&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;John Leslie: ''Elements of geometry and plane trigonometry: With an appendix, and copious notes and illustrations''. Archibald Constable &amp; Co, 3. Ausgabe, 1817, pp. 176, 340 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=stU3AAAAMAAJ online copy (Google)]). Note that the comment about Carlyle is not contained in earlier editions of the book (1809, 1811).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=To divide a straight line, whether internally or externally, so that the rectangle under its segments shall be equivalent to a given rectangle. |author=John Leslie, ''Elements of Geometry'', prop. XVII, p. 176&lt;ref name=Leslie/&gt;}}

In 1867 the Austrian engineer [[Eduard Lill]] published a graphical method to determine the roots of a polynomial ([[Lill's method]]). If it is applied on a quadratic function, then it yields the trapezoid figure from Carlyle's solution to Leslie's problem (see graphic) with one of its sides being the diameter of the Carlyle circle. In an article from 1925 G. A. Miller pointed out that a slight modification of Lill's method applied to a normed quadratic function yields a circle that allows the geometric construction of the roots of that function and gave the explicit modern definition of what was later to be called Carlyle circle.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;G. A. Miller: ''Geometric Solution of the Quadratic Equation''. The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 12, No. 179 (Dec., 1925), pp. 500-501 ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/3602823 JSTOR])&lt;/ref&gt;

Eves used the circle in the modern sense in one of the exercises of his book ''Introduction to the History of Mathematics'' (1953) and pointed out the connection to Leslie and Carlyle.&lt;ref name=Eves/&gt; Later publications started to adopt the names ''Carly circle'' , ''Carlyle method'' or ''Carlyle algorithm'', though in German speaking countries the term ''Lill circle'' (''Lill-Kreis'') is used as well.&lt;ref name=Kaenders&gt;Rainer Kaenders (ed.), Reinhard Schmidt (ed.): ''Mit GeoGebra mehr Mathematik verstehen''. Springer Spektrum, 2nd edition, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-658-04222-6}}, pp. [https://books.google.de/books?id=iOJeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 68-71] (German) &lt;/ref&gt;  DeTemple used in 1989 and 1991 Carlyle circles to devise [[Compass-and-straightedge construction]]s for regular polygons, in particular the [[pentagon]], the [[heptacontagon]], the [[257-gon]] and the [[65537-gon]]. Ladislav Beran described in 1999, how the Carlyle circle can be used to construct the complex roots of a normed quadratic function.&lt;ref name=Beran&gt;Ladislav Beran: ''The Complex Roots of a Quadratic from a Circle''. The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 83, No. 497 (Jul., 1999), pp. 287-291 ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/3619064 JSTOR]) &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24261">'''Chemometrics''' is the science of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means.  Chemometrics is inherently interdisciplinary, using methods frequently employed in core data-analytic disciplines such as [[multivariate statistics]], [[applied mathematics]], and [[computer science]], in order to address problems in [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[medicine]], [[biology]] and [[chemical engineering]].  In this way, it mirrors other interdisciplinary fields, such as [[psychometrics]] and [[econometrics]].

==Introduction==
Chemometrics is applied to solve both descriptive and predictive problems in experimental natural sciences, especially in chemistry.   In descriptive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of learning the underlying relationships and structure of the system (i.e., model understanding and identification).  In predictive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of predicting new properties or behavior of interest.  In both cases, the datasets can be small but are often very large and highly complex, involving hundreds to thousands of variables, and hundreds to thousands of cases or observations.

Chemometric techniques are particularly heavily used in [[analytical chemistry]] and [[metabolomics]], and the development of improved chemometric methods of analysis also continues to advance the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and methodology.  It is an application-driven discipline, and thus while the standard chemometric methodologies are very widely used industrially, academic groups are dedicated to the continued development of chemometric theory, method and application development.

==Origins==
Although one could argue that even the earliest analytical experiments in chemistry involved a form of chemometrics, the field is generally recognized to have emerged in the 1970s as computers became increasingly exploited for scientific investigation.  The term ‘chemometrics’ was coined by Svante Wold in a grant application 1971,&lt;ref name="Wold1974"&gt;As recounted in {{cite journal |first=S. |last=Wold |title=Chemometrics; what do we mean with it, and what do we want from it? |journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=109–115 |doi=10.1016/0169-7439(95)00042-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Chemometrics Society was formed shortly thereafter by Svante Wold and Bruce Kowalski, two pioneers in the field.  Wold was a professor of organic chemistry at [[Umeå University]], Sweden, and Kowalski was a professor of analytical chemistry at University of Washington, Seattle.

Many early applications involved multivariate classification, numerous quantitative predictive applications followed, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s a wide variety of data- and computer-driven chemical analyses were occurring.

Multivariate analysis was a critical facet even in the earliest applications of chemometrics.  The data resulting from infrared and UV/visible spectroscopy are often easily numbering in the thousands of measurements per sample.  Mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic emission/absorption and chromatography experiments are also all by nature highly multivariate.  The structure of these data was found to be conducive to using techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and [[partial least squares regression|partial least-squares]] (PLS).  This is primarily because, while the datasets may be highly multivariate there is strong and often linear low-rank structure present.  PCA and PLS have been shown over time very effective at empirically modeling the more chemically interesting low-rank structure, exploiting the interrelationships or ‘latent variables’ in the data, and providing alternative compact coordinate systems for further numerical analysis such as [[regression analysis|regression]], [[cluster analysis|clustering]], and [[pattern recognition]].  Partial least squares in particular was heavily used in chemometric applications for many years before it began to find regular use in other fields.

Through the 1980s three dedicated journals appeared in the field: ''[[Journal of Chemometrics]]'', ''[[Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems]]'', and ''[[Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling]]''. These journals continue to cover both fundamental and methodological research in chemometrics.  At present, most routine applications of existing chemometric methods are commonly published in application-oriented journals (e.g., ''Applied Spectroscopy, ''[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]'', ''Anal. Chim. Acta.'', ''Talanta''). Several important books/monographs on chemometrics were also first published in the 1980s, including the first edition of Malinowski’s ''Factor Analysis in Chemistry'',&lt;ref name="Malinowski1980"&gt;{{cite book |first=E. R. |last=Malinowski |first2=D. G. |last2=Howery |title=Factor Analysis in Chemistry |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=0471058815 }} (other editions followed in 1989, 1991 and 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Sharaf, Illman and Kowalski’s ''Chemometrics'',&lt;ref name="Sharaf1984"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=M.

Some large chemometric application areas have gone on to represent new domains, such as molecular modeling and [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR]], [[cheminformatics]], the ‘-omics’ fields of [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabonomics]] and [[metabolomics]], process modeling and [[process analytical technology]].

An account of the early history of chemometrics was published as a series of interviews by Geladi and Esbensen.&lt;ref name="Geladi2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Geladi |first2=K. |last2=Esbensen |title=The Start and Early History of Chemometrics: Selected Interviews.

==Techniques==

===Multivariate calibration===
Many chemical problems and applications of chemometrics involve [[calibration]].  The objective is to develop models which can be used to predict properties of interest based on measured properties of the chemical system, such as pressure, flow, temperature, [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]], [[NMR|NMR spectra]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectra]].  Examples include the development of multivariate models relating 1) multi-wavelength spectral response to analyte concentration, 2) molecular descriptors to biological activity, 3) multivariate process conditions/states to final product attributes.  The process requires a calibration or training data set, which includes reference values for the properties of interest for prediction, and the measured attributes believed to correspond to these properties.  For case 1), for example, one can assemble data from a number of samples, including concentrations for an analyte of interest for each sample (the reference) and the corresponding infrared spectrum of that sample.  Multivariate calibration techniques such as partial-least squares regression, or principal component regression (and near countless other methods) are then used to construct a mathematical model that relates the multivariate response (spectrum) to the concentration of the analyte of interest, and such a model can be used to efficiently predict the concentrations of new samples.

Techniques in multivariate calibration are often broadly categorized as classical or inverse methods.&lt;ref name="Martens1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franke2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Franke |chapter=Inverse Least Squares and Classical Least Squares Methods for Quantitative Vibrational Spectroscopy |title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy |publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |location=New York |pages= |isbn=0471988472 |doi=10.1002/0470027320.s4603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal difference between these approaches is that in classical calibration the models are solved such that they are optimal in describing the measured analytical responses (e.g., spectra) and can therefore be considered optimal descriptors, whereas in inverse methods the models are solved to be optimal in predicting the properties of interest (e.g., concentrations, optimal predictors).&lt;ref name="Brown2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. D. |last=Brown |title=Discordance between Net Analyte Signal Theory and Practical Multivariate Calibration |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=76 |year=2004 |issue=15 |pages=4364–4373 |doi=10.1021/ac049953w |pmid=15283574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inverse methods usually require less physical knowledge of the chemical system, and at least in theory provide superior predictions in the mean-squared error sense,&lt;ref name="krutchkoff1969"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. G. |last=Krutchkoff |title=Classical and inverse regression methods of calibration in extrapolation |journal=Technometrics |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=1969 |pages=11–15 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1969.10490714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalski1984"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. G. |last=Hunter |chapter=Statistics and chemistry, and the linear calibration problem |title=Chemometrics: mathematics and statistics in chemistry |editor-first=B. R. |editor-last=Kowalski |publisher=Riedel |location=Boston |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=9027718466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellinghuisen2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tellinghuisen |title=Inverse vs. classical calibration for small data sets |journal=Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. |volume=368 |year=2000 |issue=6 |pages=585–588 |doi=10.1007/s002160000556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence inverse approaches tend to be more frequently applied in contemporary multivariate calibration.

The main advantages of the use of multivariate calibration techniques is that fast, cheap, or non-destructive analytical measurements (such as optical spectroscopy) can be used to estimate sample properties which would otherwise require time-consuming, expensive or destructive testing (such as [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]).  Equally important is that multivariate calibration allows for accurate quantitative analysis in the presence of heavy interference by other analytes.  The selectivity of the analytical method is provided as much by the mathematical calibration, as the analytical measurement modalities.  For example, near-infrared spectra, which are extremely broad and non-selective compared to other analytical techniques (such as infrared or Raman spectra), can often be used successfully in conjunction with carefully developed multivariate calibration methods to predict concentrations of analytes in very complex matrices.

===Classification, pattern recognition, clustering===
Supervised multivariate classification techniques are closely related to multivariate calibration techniques in that a calibration or training set is used to develop a mathematical model capable of classifying future samples.  The techniques employed in chemometrics are similar to those used in other fields – multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, regression/classification trees.  The use of rank reduction techniques in conjunction with these conventional classification methods is routine in chemometrics, for example discriminant analysis on [[principal component analysis|principal components]] or [[partial least squares regression|partial least squares]] scores.

Unsupervised classification (also termed [[cluster analysis]]) is also commonly used to discover patterns in complex data sets, and again many of the core techniques used in chemometrics are common to other fields such as machine learning and statistical learning.

===Multivariate curve resolution===
In chemometric parlance, multivariate curve resolution seeks to deconstruct data sets with limited or absent reference information and system knowledge.  Some of the earliest work on these techniques was done by Lawton and Sylvestre in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=W. H. |last2=Sylvestre |first2=E. A. |year=1971 |title=Self Modeling Curve Resolution |journal=Technometrics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=617–633 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1971.10488823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sylvestre |first=E. A. |last2=Lawton |first2=W. H. |last3=Maggio |first3=M. S. |year=1974 |title=Curve Resolution Using a Postulated Chemical Reaction |journal=Technometrics |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1974.10489204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches are also called self-modeling mixture analysis, [[blind signal separation|blind source/signal separation]], and spectral unmixing.  For example, from a data set comprising fluorescence spectra from a series of samples each containing multiple fluorophores, multivariate curve resolution methods can be used to extract the fluorescence spectra of the individual fluorophores, along with their relative concentrations in each of the samples, essentially unmixing the total fluorescence spectrum into the contributions from the individual components. The problem is usually ill-determined due to rotational ambiguity (many possible solutions can equivalently represent the measured data), so the application of additional constraints is common, such as non-negatively, unmodality, or known interrelationships between the individual components (e.g., kinetic or mass-balance constraints).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2003 |title=Chemometrics Applied to Unravel Multicomponent Processes and Mixtures. Revisiting Latest Trends in Multivariate Resolution |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=500 |issue=1–2 |pages=195–210 |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(03)00724-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2006 |title=Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) from 2000: Progress in Concepts and Applications |journal=Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry |volume=36 |issue=3–4 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1080/10408340600970005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
'''[[design of experiments|Experimental design]]''' remains a core area of study in chemometrics and several monographs are specifically devoted to experimental design in chemical applications.&lt;ref name="Deming1987"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. N. |last=Deming |first2=S. L. |last2=Morgan |title=Experimental design: a chemometric approach |publisher=Elsevier |year=1987 |isbn=0444427341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruns2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. E. |last=Bruns |first2=I. S. |last2=Scarminio |first3=B. |last3=de Barros Neto |title=Statistical design – chemometrics |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2006 |isbn=044452181X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sound principles of experimental design have been widely adopted within the chemometrics community, although many complex experiments are purely observational, and there can be little control over the properties and interrelationships of the samples and sample properties.

'''[[Signal processing]]''' is also a critical component of almost all chemometric applications, particularly the use of signal pretreatments to condition data prior to calibration or classification.  The techniques employed commonly in chemometrics are often closely related to those used in related fields.&lt;ref name="Wentzell2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. |last=Wentzell |first2=C. D. |last2=Brown |chapter=Signal Processing in Analytical Chemistry |title=Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry |editor-first=R. A. |editor-last=Meyers |publisher=Wiley |year=2000 |pages=9764–9800 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance characterization, and figures of merit'''  Like most arenas in the physical sciences, chemometrics is quantitatively oriented, so considerable emphasis is placed on performance characterization, model selection, verification &amp; validation, and [[figure of merit|figures of merit]].  The performance of quantitative models is usually specified by [[root mean squared error]] in predicting the attribute of interest, and the performance of classifiers as a true-positive rate/false-positive rate pairs (or a full ROC curve).  A recent report by Olivieri et al. provides a comprehensive overview of figures of merit and uncertainty estimation in multivariate calibration, including multivariate definitions of selectivity, sensitivity, SNR and prediction interval estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. C. |last=Olivieri |first2=N. M. |last2=Faber |first3=J. |last3=Ferre |first4=R. |last4=Boque |first5=J. H. |last5=Kalivas |first6=H. |last6=Mark |title=Guidelines for calibration in analytical chemistry Part 3. Uncertainty estimation and figures of merit for multivariate calibration |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=78 |year=2006 |issue=3 |pages=633–650 |doi=10.1351/pac200678030633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemometric model selection usually involves the use of tools such as [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] (including bootstrap, permutation, cross-validation).

'''Multivariate [[statistical process control]] (MSPC)''', modeling and optimization accounts for a substantial amount of historical chemometric development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. L. |last=Illman |first2=J. B. |last2=Callis |first3=B. R. |last3=Kowalski |title=Process Analytical Chemistry: a new paradigm for analytical chemists |journal=American Laboratory |volume=18 |year=1986 |pages=8–10 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. F. |last=MacGregor |first2=T. |last2=Kourti |title=Statistical control of multivariate processes |journal=Control Engineering Practice |volume=3 |year=1995 |issue=3 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1016/0967-0661(95)00014-L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. B. |last=Martin |first2=A. J. |last2=Morris |title=An overview of multivariate statistical process control in continuous and batch process performance monitoring |journal=Transactions of the institute of Measurement &amp; Control |volume=18 |year=1996 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |doi=10.1177/014233129601800107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spectroscopy has been used successfully for online monitoring of manufacturing processes for 30–40 years, and this process data is highly amenable to chemometric modeling.  Specifically in terms of MSPC, multiway modeling of batch and continuous processes is increasingly common in industry and remains an active area of research in chemometrics and chemical engineering.  Process analytical chemistry as it was originally termed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Hirschfeld |first2=J. B. |last2=Callis |first3=B. R. |last3=Kowalski |title=Chemical sensing in process analysis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=226 |year=1984 |issue=4672 |pages=312–318 |doi=10.1126/science.226.4672.312 |bibcode=1984Sci...226..312H }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the newer term [[process analytical technology]] continues to draw heavily on chemometric methods and MSPC.

'''Multiway methods''' are heavily used in chemometric applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. K. |last=Smilde |first2=R. |last2=Bro |first3=P. |last3=Geladi |title=Multi-way analysis with applications in the chemical sciences |publisher=Wiley |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Bro |first2=J. J. |last2=Workman |first3=P. R. |last3=Mobley |first4=B. R. |last4=Kowalski |title=Overview of chemometrics applied to spectroscopy: 1985–95, Part 3—Multiway analysis |journal=Applied Spectroscopy Reviews |volume=32 |year=1997 |issue=3 |pages=237–261 |doi=10.1080/05704929708003315 |bibcode=1997ApSRv..32..237B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are higher-order extensions of more widely used methods.  For example, while the analysis of a table (matrix, or second-order array) of data is routine in several fields, multiway methods are applied to data sets that involve 3rd, 4th, or higher-orders.  Data of this type is very common in chemistry, for example a liquid-chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system generates a large matrix of data (elution time versus m/z) for each sample analyzed.  The data across multiple samples thus comprises a data cube.  Batch process modeling involves data sets that have time vs. process variables vs. batch number.  The multiway mathematical methods applied to these sorts of problems include [[PARAFAC]], trilinear decomposition, and multiway PLS and PCA.

In [[geometry]], a '''circular algebraic curve''' is a type of [[plane algebraic curve]] determined by an equation ''F''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''F'' is a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients and the highest-order terms of ''F'' form a polynomial divisible by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More precisely, if
''F'' =&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where each ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''i'', then the curve ''F''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is circular if and only if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is divisible by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Equivalently, if the curve is determined in [[homogeneous coordinates]] by ''G''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0, where ''G'' is a homogeneous polynomial, then the curve is circular if and only if ''G''(1,&amp;nbsp;''i'',0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''G''(1,&amp;nbsp;−''i'',0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In other words, the curve is circular if it contains the [[circular points at infinity]], (1,&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;,0) and (1,&amp;nbsp;−''i'',&amp;nbsp;0), when considered as a curve in the [[complex projective plane]].

==Multicircular algebraic curves==
An algebraic curve is called '''''p''-circular''' if it contains the points (1,&amp;nbsp;''i'',&amp;nbsp;0) and (1,&amp;nbsp;−''i'',&amp;nbsp;0) when considered as a curve in the complex projective plane, and these points are singularities of order at least ''p''. The terms ''bicircular'', ''tricircular'', etc. apply when ''p'' =&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3, etc. In terms of the polynomial ''F'' given above, the curve ''F''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is ''p''-circular if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is divisible by (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''p''−''i''&lt;/sup&gt; when ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''. When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 this reduces to the definition of a circular curve. The set of ''p''-circular curves is invariant under [[Euclidean group|Euclidean transformations]]. Note that a ''p''-circular curve must have degree at least 2''p''.

The set of ''p''-circular curves of degree ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'', where ''p'' may vary but ''k'' is a fixed positive integer, is invariant under [[inversive geometry|inversion]]. When ''k'' is 1 this says that the set of lines (0-circular curves of degree 1) together with the set of circles (1-circular curves of degree 2) form a set which is invariant under inversion.

==Examples==
* The [[circle]] is the only circular conic.
* [[Conchoid of de Sluze|Conchoids of de Sluze]] (which include several well-known cubic curves) are circular cubics.
* [[Cassini oval]]s (including the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]), [[toric section]]s and [[limaçon]]s (including the [[cardioid]]) are bicircular quartics.
* [[Watt's curve]] is a tricircular sextic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27424">There are '''common integrals in quantum field theory''' that appear repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=A. Zee| title=Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell| publisher= Princeton University| year=2003 | isbn=0-691-01019-6}} pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; These integrals are all variations and generalizations of [[gaussian integral]]s to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions. Other integrals can be approximated by versions of the gaussian integral. Fourier integrals are also considered.

==Variations on a simple gaussian integral==

===Gaussian integral===
The first integral, with broad application outside of quantum field theory, is the [[gaussian integral]].

:&lt;math&gt; G \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} x^2}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

In physics the factor of 1/2 in the argument of the exponential is common.

Note:

:&lt;math&gt; G^2 = \left ( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} x^2}\,dx \right ) \cdot \left ( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} y^2}\,dy \right ) = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} r e^{-{1 \over 2} r^2}\,dr = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{- w}\,dw = 2 \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{2\pi}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Slight generalization of the gaussian integral===
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{2\pi \over a} &lt;/math&gt;

where we have scaled

:&lt;math&gt; x \to {x \over \sqrt{a}} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Integrals of exponents and even powers of ''x''===
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = -2{d\over da} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = -2{d\over da} \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} = \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} {1\over a}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^4 e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = \left ( -2{d\over da} \right) \left ( -2{d\over da} \right) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = \left ( -2{d\over da} \right) \left ( -2{d\over da} \right) \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} = \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} {3\over a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In general

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^{2n} e^{-{1 \over 2} a x^2}\,dx = \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over {2}} {1\over a^{n}} \left ( 2n -1 \right ) \left ( 2n -3 \right ) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over {2}} {1\over a^{n}} \left ( 2n -1 \right )!! &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the integrals of exponents and odd powers of x are 0, due to [[odd function|odd]] symmetry.

===Integrals with a linear term in the argument of the exponent===

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( -{1 \over 2} a x^2 + Jx\right ) dx &lt;/math&gt;

This integral can be performed by completing the square:

:&lt;math&gt;  \left( -{1 \over 2} a x^2 + Jx\right ) = -{1 \over 2} a \left ( x^2 - { 2 Jx \over a } + { J^2 \over a^2 } - { J^2 \over a^2 } \right ) = -{1 \over 2} a \left ( x -  { J \over a } \right )^2 + { J^2 \over 2a } &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left( -{1 \over 2} a x^2 + Jx\right) \, dx &amp;= \exp\left( { J^2 \over 2a } \right ) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp \left [ -{1 \over 2} a \left ( x - { J \over a } \right )^2 \right ] \, dx \\[8pt]
&amp;= \exp\left( { J^2 \over 2a } \right )\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left( -{1 \over 2} a w^2 \right) \, dw \\[8pt]
&amp;=  \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} \exp\left( { J^2 \over 2a }\right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Integrals with an imaginary linear term in the argument of the exponent===
The integral

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( -{1 \over 2} a x^2 + iJx\right ) dx  =  \left ( {2\pi \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} \exp\left( -{ J^2 \over 2a }\right ) &lt;/math&gt;

is proportional to the [[Fourier transform]] of the gaussian where {{mvar|J}} is the [[conjugate variables|conjugate variable]] of {{mvar|x}}.

By again completing the square we see that the Fourier transform of a gaussian is also a gaussian, but in the conjugate variable. The larger {{mvar|a}} is, the narrower the gaussian in {{mvar|x}} and the wider the gaussian in {{mvar|J}}. This is a demonstration of the [[uncertainty principle]].

This integral is also known as the [[Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation]] used in field theory.

===Integrals with a complex argument of the exponent===
The integral of interest is (for an example of an application see [[Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics]])
 
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( {1 \over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\right ) dx.    &lt;/math&gt;

We now assume that {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|J}} may be complex.

Completing the square

:&lt;math&gt; \left( {1 \over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\right )  =  {1\over 2} ia \left ( x^2 + {2Jx \over a} + \left ( { J \over a} \right )^2 - \left ( { J \over a} \right )^2 \right ) = -{1\over 2} {a \over i} \left ( x + {J\over a} \right )^2 - { iJ^2 \over 2a}. &lt;/math&gt;

By analogy with the previous integrals

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( {1 \over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\right ) dx  =  \left ( {2\pi i \over a } \right ) ^{1\over 2} \exp\left( { -iJ^2 \over 2a }\right ).  &lt;/math&gt;

This result is valid as an integration in the complex plane as long as {{mvar|a}} has a positive imaginary part.

==Gaussian integrals in higher dimensions==
The one-dimensional integrals can be generalized to multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Frederick W. Byron and Robert W. Fuller| title=Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics | publisher= Addison-Wesley| year=1969 | isbn=0-201-00746-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left( - \frac 1 2 x \cdot A \cdot x +J \cdot x \right) d^nx = \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^n}{\det A}} \exp \left( {1\over 2} J \cdot A^{-1} \cdot J \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{mvar|A}} is a real [[symmetric matrix]].

This integral is performed by [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalization]] of {{mvar|A}} with an [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;D= O^{-1}  A  O = O^T  A  O&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|D}} is a [[diagonal matrix]] and {{mvar|O}} is an [[orthogonal matrix]]. This decouples the variables and allows the integration to be performed as {{mvar|n}} one-dimensional integrations.

This is best illustrated with a two-dimensional example.

===Example: Simple Gaussian integration in two dimensions===
The Gaussian integral in two dimensions is

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left( - \frac 1 2 A_{ij} x^i x^j \right) d^2x = \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^2}{\det A}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} is a two-dimensional symmetric matrix with components specified as

:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix}  a&amp;c\\ c&amp;b\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and we have used the [[Einstein summation convention]].

====Diagonalize the matrix====
The first step is to [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalize]] the matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Herbert S. Wilf| title=Mathematics for the Physical Sciences | publisher= Dover| year=1978 | isbn=0-486-63635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that

:&lt;math&gt;A_{ij} x^i x^j \equiv x^TAx = x^T \left(OO^T\right) A \left(OO^T\right)  x = \left(x^TO \right) \left(O^TAO \right) \left(O^Tx \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where, since {{mvar|A}} is a real [[symmetric matrix]], we can choose {{mvar|O}} to be [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]], and hence also a [[unitary matrix]]. {{mvar|O}} can be obtained from the [[eigenvectors]] of {{mvar|A}}. We choose {{mvar|O}} such that: {{math|''D'' ≡ ''O&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;AO''}} is diagonal.

=====Eigenvalues of ''A''=====
To find the eigenvectors of {{mvar|A}} one first finds the [[eigenvalues]] {{mvar|λ}} of {{mvar|A}} given by

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}a&amp;c\\ c&amp;b\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  u\\ v \end{bmatrix}=\lambda \begin{bmatrix}u\\ v\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues are solutions of the [[characteristic polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;( a - \lambda)( b-\lambda) -c^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 - \lambda(a+b) + ab -c^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which are found using the [[quadratic equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda_{\pm} = {1\over 2} ( a+b) \pm {1\over 2}\sqrt{(a+b)^2-4(ab - c^2)}. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda_{\pm} = {1\over 2} ( a+b) \pm {1\over 2}\sqrt{a^2 +2ab + b^2 -4ab + 4c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda_{\pm} = {1\over 2} ( a+b) \pm {1\over 2}\sqrt{(a-b)^2+4c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

=====Eigenvectors of ''A''=====
Substitution of the eigenvalues back into the eigenvector equation yields

:&lt;math&gt; v = -{ \left( a - \lambda_{\pm} \right)u \over c }, \qquad v = -{cu \over  \left( b - \lambda_{\pm}  \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the characteristic equation we know

:&lt;math&gt; {a - \lambda_{\pm} \over c } = {c \over b - \lambda_{\pm}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note

:&lt;math&gt; { a - \lambda_{\pm} \over c } = -{ b - \lambda_{\mp} \over c}. &lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvectors can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\eta}\\ -\frac{a - \lambda_-}{c\eta} \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \begin{bmatrix}-\frac{b - \lambda_+}{c\eta} \\ \frac{1}{\eta} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

for the two eigenvectors. Here {{mvar|η}} is a normalizing factor given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{a - \lambda_{-}}{c} \right)^2 } = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{b - \lambda_{+}}{c} \right)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easily verified that the two eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other.

=====Construction of the orthogonal matrix=====
The orthogonal matrix is constructed by assigning the normalized eigenvectors as columns in the orthogonal matrix

:&lt;math&gt;O = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\eta} &amp; -\frac{b - \lambda_{+}}{c \eta} \\ -\frac{a - \lambda_{-}}{c \eta} &amp;\frac{1}{\eta}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that {{math|det(''O'') {{=}} 1}}.

If we define

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(\theta) =  -\frac{a - \lambda_{-}}{c \eta }&lt;/math&gt;

then the orthogonal matrix can be written

:&lt;math&gt;O =  \begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply a rotation of the eigenvectors with the inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;O^{-1} = O^T =  \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \\ -\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=====Diagonal matrix=====
The diagonal matrix becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  D = O^T A O =  \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_{-}&amp;0\\ 0 &amp; \lambda_{+}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with eigenvectors

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \qquad \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=====Numerical example=====
:&lt;math&gt;A =  \begin{bmatrix} 2&amp;1\\ 1 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues are

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\pm}  =  {3\over 2} \pm {\sqrt{ 5} \over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvectors are

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over \eta}\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ -{1\over 2} - {\sqrt{5} \over 2}\end{bmatrix}, \qquad {1\over \eta} \begin{bmatrix} {1\over 2} + {\sqrt{5} \over 2 }\\  1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \sqrt{{5\over 2} + {\sqrt{5}\over 2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
O &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\eta} &amp; \frac{1}{\eta} \left({1\over 2} + {\sqrt{5} \over 2}\right) \\ \frac{1}{\eta} \left(-{1\over 2} - {\sqrt{ 5} \over 2}\right) &amp; {1\over \eta}\end{bmatrix} \\
O^{-1} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\eta} &amp; \frac{1}{\eta} \left(-{1\over 2} - {\sqrt{5} \over 2}\right) \\ \frac{1}{\eta} \left({1\over 2} + {\sqrt{5} \over 2}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{\eta} \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The diagonal matrix becomes

:&lt;math&gt;D = O^TAO = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_- &amp;0\\ 0 &amp; \lambda_+ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} {3\over 2} - {\sqrt{5} \over 2}&amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; {3\over 2} + {\sqrt{5} \over 2}\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

with eigenvectors

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \qquad \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

====Rescale the variables and integrate====
With the diagonalization the integral can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left( - \frac 1 2 x^T A x \right) d^2x = \int \exp\left( - \frac 1 2 \sum_{j=1}^2 \lambda_{j} y_j^2 \right) \, d^2y&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;y = O^T x.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the coordinate transformation is simply a rotation of coordinates the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] determinant of the transformation is one yielding

:&lt;math&gt;   dy^2  = dx^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The integrations can now be performed.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \exp\left( - \frac{1}{2} x^T A x \right) d^2x &amp;= \int \exp\left( - \frac 1 2 \sum_{j=1}^2 \lambda_{j} y_j^2 \right) d^2y \\
&amp;= \prod_{j=1}^2 \left( { 2\pi \over \lambda_j } \right)^{1\over 2} \\ 
&amp;= \left( { (2\pi)^2  \over \prod_{j=1}^2 \lambda_j } \right)^{1\over 2} \\
&amp;= \left( { (2\pi)^2  \over \det{ \left( O^{-1}AO \right)}  } \right)^{1\over 2} \\
&amp;= \left( { (2\pi)^2  \over \det{ \left( A \right)}  } \right)^{1\over 2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the advertised solution.

===Integrals with complex and linear terms in multiple dimensions===
With the two-dimensional example it is now easy to see the generalization to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions.

====Integrals with a linear term in the argument====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} x \cdot A \cdot x +J \cdot x \right) d^nx = \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^n}{\det A}} \exp \left( {1\over 2} J \cdot A^{-1} \cdot J \right)&lt;/math&gt;

====Integrals with an imaginary linear term====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} x \cdot A \cdot x +iJ \cdot x \right) d^nx = \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^n}{\det A}} \exp \left( -{1\over 2} J \cdot A^{-1} \cdot J \right)&lt;/math&gt;

====Integrals with a complex quadratic term====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} x \cdot A \cdot x +iJ \cdot x \right) d^nx =\sqrt{\frac{(2\pi i)^n}{\det A}} \exp \left( -{i\over 2} J \cdot A^{-1} \cdot J \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Integrals with differential operators in the argument===
As an example consider the integral&lt;ref&gt;Zee, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left[  \int d^4x \left (-\frac{1}{2} \varphi  \hat A  \varphi +  J  \varphi \right) \right ] D\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \hat A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator with &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|J}} functions of [[spacetime]], and &lt;math&gt; D\varphi &lt;/math&gt; indicates integration over all possible paths. In analogy with the matrix version of this integral the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left[  \int d^4x \left (-\frac 1 2 \varphi \hat A \varphi +J\varphi \right) \right ] D\varphi \; \propto \; \exp \left( {1\over 2} \int d^4x \; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat A D( x - y) = \delta^4 ( x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''D''(''x'' − ''y'')}}, called the [[propagator]], is the inverse of &lt;math&gt; \hat A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \delta^4( x - y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]].

Similar arguments yield

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left[\int d^4x \left (-\frac 1 2 \varphi  \hat A  \varphi +  i J  \varphi \right) \right ] D\varphi \; \propto \; \exp \left( - { 1\over 2} \int d^4x \; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y)  \right),&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\int \exp\left[ i \int d^4x \left ( \frac 1 2 \varphi  \hat A  \varphi +  J\varphi \right) \right ] D\varphi \; \propto \; \exp \left( -{ i\over 2} \int d^4x \; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

See [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Path-integral formulation of virtual-particle exchange|Path-integral formulation of virtual-particle exchange]] for an application of this integral.

==Integrals that can be approximated by the method of steepest descent==

In quantum field theory n-dimensional integrals of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( -{1 \over \hbar} f(q) \right ) d^nq&lt;/math&gt;

appear often. Here &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck's constant]] and f is a function with a positive minimum at &lt;math&gt; q=q_0&lt;/math&gt;. These integrals can be approximated by the [[method of steepest descent]].

For small values of Planck's constant, f can be expanded about its minimum

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left[ -{1 \over \hbar} \left( f\left( q_0 \right) + {1\over 2} \left( q-q_0\right)^2f^{\prime \prime} \left( q-q_0\right) + \cdots \right ) \right] d^nq&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt; f^{\prime \prime} &lt;/math&gt; is the n by n matrix of second derivatives evaluated at the minimum of the function.

If we neglect higher order terms this integral can be integrated explicitly.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left[ -{1 \over \hbar} (f(q)) \right] d^nq \approx \exp\left[ -{1 \over \hbar} \left( f\left( q_0 \right)   \right ) \right] \sqrt{ (2 \pi \hbar )^n \over \det f^{\prime \prime} }.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integrals that can be approximated by the method of stationary phase==

A common integral is a path integral of the form

:&lt;math&gt;  \int \exp\left( {i \over \hbar}  S\left( q, \dot q \right) \right ) Dq &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; S\left( q, \dot q \right) &lt;/math&gt; is the classical [[Action (physics)|action]] and the integral is over all possible paths that a particle may take. In the limit of small &lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt; the integral can be evaluated in the [[stationary phase approximation]]. In this approximation the integral is over the path in which the action is a minimum. Therefore, this approximation recovers the [[classical limit]] of [[classical mechanics|mechanics]].

==Fourier integrals==

===Dirac delta distribution===
The [[Dirac delta distribution]] in [[spacetime]] can be written as a [[Fourier transform]]&lt;ref&gt;Zee, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \int \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} \exp(ik ( x-y)) = \delta^4 ( x-y).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, for any dimension &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \int \frac{d^N k}{(2\pi)^N} \exp(ik ( x-y)) = \delta^N ( x-y).&lt;/math&gt;

===Fourier integrals of forms of the Coulomb potential===

====Laplacian of 1/r====

While not an integral, the identity in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]

:&lt;math&gt;-{1 \over 4\pi} \nabla^2 \left( {1 \over r} \right)  = \delta \left( \mathbf r \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 =  \mathbf r \cdot \mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;

is a consequence of [[Gauss's theorem]] and can be used to derive integral identities. For an example see [[Longitudinal and transverse vector fields]].

This identity implies that the [[Fourier integral]] representation of 1/r is

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3}  { \exp \left ( i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r \right) \over k^2  } = {1 \over 4 \pi r }.&lt;/math&gt;

====Yukawa Potential: The Coulomb potential with mass====
The [[Yukawa potential]] in three dimensions can be represented as an integral over a [[Fourier transform]]&lt;ref&gt;Zee, p. 26, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} { \exp \left ( i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r \right) \over k^2 +m^2 } = {e^{-mr} \over 4 \pi r }   &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 =  \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf r, \qquad k^2 =  \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf k.&lt;/math&gt;

See [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Selected examples|Static forces and virtual-particle exchange]] for an application of this integral.

In the small m limit the integral reduces to {{math|{{sfrac|1|4''πr''}}}}.

To derive this result note:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{\exp \left (i \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r\right)}{k^2 +m^2} &amp;= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{k^2 dk}{(2\pi)^2} \int_{-1}^1 du {e^{ikru}\over k^2 + m^2} \\
&amp;= {2\over r} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{k dk}{(2\pi)^2} {\sin(kr) \over k^2 + m^2} \\
&amp;= {1\over ir} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{k dk}{(2\pi)^2} {e^{ikr} \over k^2 + m^2} \\
&amp;= {1\over ir} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{k dk}{(2\pi)^2} {e^{ikr} \over (k + i m)(k - i m)} \\
&amp;= {1\over ir} \frac{2\pi i}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{im}{2im} e^{-mr} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4 \pi r} e^{-mr}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Modified Coulomb potential with mass====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \left(\mathbf{\hat{k}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right)^2 \frac{\exp \left (i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right)}{k^2 +m^2} = \frac{e^{-mr}}{4 \pi r} \left\{1 + \frac{2}{mr} - \frac{2}{(mr)^2} \left(e^{mr}-1 \right) \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

where the hat indicates a unit vector in three dimensional space. The derivation of this result is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \left(\mathbf{\hat k}\cdot \mathbf{\hat r}\right)^2 \frac{\exp \left (i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}\right )}{k^2 +m^2} &amp;= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{k^2 dk}{(2\pi)^2} \int_{-1}^{1} du u^2 \frac{e^{ikru}}{k^2 + m^2} \\
&amp;= 2 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{k^2 dk}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \left\{\frac{1}{kr} \sin(kr) + \frac{2}{(kr)^2} \cos(kr)- \frac{2}{(kr)^3} \sin(kr) \right \} \\
&amp;= \frac{e^{-mr}}{4\pi r} \left\{1 + \frac{2}{mr} - \frac{2}{(mr)^2} \left(e^{mr}-1 \right) \right \}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the small {{mvar|m}} limit the integral goes to the result for the Coulomb potential since the term in the brackets goes to {{math|1}}.

====Longitudinal potential with mass====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \mathbf{\hat{k}} \mathbf{\hat{k}} \frac{\exp \left ( i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right )}{k^2 +m^2 } = {1\over 2} \frac{e^{-mr}}{4\pi r} \left (\left[ \mathbf{1}- \mathbf{\hat{r}} \mathbf{\hat{r}} \right] + \left\{1 + \frac{2}{mr} - {2 \over (mr)^2} \left(e^{mr} -1 \right) \right \} \left[\mathbf{1}+ \mathbf{\hat{r}} \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right] \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where the hat indicates a unit vector in three dimensional space. The derivation for this result is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \mathbf{\hat k} \mathbf{\hat k} \frac{\exp \left (i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r \right)}{k^2 +m^2} &amp;= \int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \left[ \left( \mathbf{\hat k}\cdot \mathbf{\hat r}\right)^2\mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r} + \left( \mathbf{\hat k}\cdot \mathbf{\hat \theta}\right)^2\mathbf{\hat \theta} \mathbf{\hat \theta} + \left( \mathbf{\hat k}\cdot \mathbf{\hat \phi}\right)^2\mathbf{\hat \phi} \mathbf{\hat \phi} \right] \frac{\exp \left (i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r \right )}{k^2 +m^2 } \\
&amp;=\frac{e^{-mr}}{4 \pi r}\left\{ 1+ \frac{2}{mr}- {2\over (mr)^2 } \left( e^{mr} -1 \right) \right \} \left\{\mathbf 1  - {1\over 2} \left[\mathbf 1 - \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right] \right\} + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{k^2 dk}{(2\pi)^2 } \int_{-1}^{1} du \frac{e^{ikru}}{k^2 + m^2} {1\over 2}  \left[ \mathbf 1  - \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r} \right] \\
&amp;={1\over 2} \frac{e^{-mr}}{4 \pi r} \left[ \mathbf 1 - \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r} \right]+ {e^{-mr} \over 4 \pi r }  \left\{ 1+\frac{2}{mr} - {2\over (mr)^2} \left( e^{mr} -1 \right) \right \} \left\{ {1\over 2} \left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right] \right\} \\
&amp;={1\over 2} \frac{e^{-mr}}{4\pi r} \left (\left[ \mathbf{1}- \mathbf{\hat{r}} \mathbf{\hat{r}} \right] + \left\{1 + \frac{2}{mr} - {2 \over (mr)^2} \left(e^{mr} -1 \right) \right \} \left[\mathbf{1}+ \mathbf{\hat{r}} \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right] \right ) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the small {{mvar|m}} limit the integral reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} {1 \over 4 \pi r } \left[ \mathbf 1 - \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r} \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

====Transverse potential with mass====
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \left[\mathbf{1} - \mathbf{\hat{k}} \mathbf{\hat{k}} \right] { \exp \left ( i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}\right ) \over k^2 +m^2 } =  {1\over 2} {e^{-mr} \over 4 \pi r} \left\{ {2 \over (mr)^2  } \left( e^{mr} -1 \right) -  {2\over mr} \right \} \left[\mathbf{1} + \mathbf{\hat{r}} \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

In the small mr limit the integral goes to

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} {1 \over 4 \pi r } \left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

For large distance, the integral falls off as the inverse cube of r

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4 \pi m^2r^3 }\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

===Integration of the cylindrical propagator with mass===

====First power of a Bessel function====
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} {k\; dk \over k^2 +m^2} J_0 \left( kr \right)=K_0 (mr). &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; mr &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, we have&lt;ref&gt;Jackson,  p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} {k\; dk \over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) =I_1 (mr)K_1 (mr).&lt;/math&gt;

For small mr the integral becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\int_o^{\infty} {k\; dk \over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) \to {1\over 2 }\left[ 1 - {1\over 8} (mr)^2 \right].&lt;/math&gt;

For large mr the integral becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\int_o^{\infty} {k\; dk \over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) \to {1\over 2} \left( {1\over mr}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

For applications of this integral see [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Magnetic interaction between current loops in a simple plasma or electron gas|Magnetic interaction between current loops in a simple plasma or electron gas]].

In general

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} {k\; dk \over k^2 +m^2} J_{\nu}^2 (kr) = I_{\nu} (mr)K_{\nu} (mr) \qquad \Re (\nu) &gt; -1. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, M is a [[confluent hypergeometric function]]. For an application of this integral see [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Charge density spread over a wave function|Charge density spread over a wave function]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''covariant derivative''' is a way of specifying a [[derivative]] along [[tangent vector]]s of a [[manifold]]. Alternatively, the covariant derivative is a way of introducing and working with a [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] on a manifold by means of a [[differential operator]], to be contrasted with the approach given by a [[connection (principal bundle)|principal connection]] on the frame bundle – see [[affine connection]]. In the special case of a manifold isometrically embedded into a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the covariant derivative can be viewed as the [[orthogonal projection]] of the Euclidean derivative along a tangent vector onto the manifold's tangent space.  In this case the Euclidean derivative is broken into two parts, the extrinsic normal component and the intrinsic covariant derivative component.

In [[physics]], the '''covariant derivative''' is the derivative that under a general coordinate transformation transforms [[Covariant transformation|covariantly]], that is, linearly via the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|chapter=The General Theory of Relativity|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents an introduction to the covariant derivative of a [[vector field]] with respect to a vector field, both in a coordinate free language and using a local [[coordinate system]] and the traditional index notation. The covariant derivative of a [[tensor field]] is presented as an extension of the same concept. The covariant derivative generalizes straightforwardly to a notion of differentiation associated to a [[connection on a vector bundle]], also known as a '''Koszul connection'''.

==History==
Historically, at the turn of the 20th century, the covariant derivative was introduced by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] in the theory of [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Levi-Civita |first2=T. |last1=Ricci |first1=G. |title=Méthodes de calcul différential absolu et leurs applications |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PID=GDZPPN002258102 |journal=Mathematische Annalen |volume=54 |year=1901 |issue= |pages=125–201 |doi= 10.1007/bf01454201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci and Levi-Civita (following ideas of [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]]) observed that the [[Christoffel symbols]] used to define the [[Riemann tensor|curvature]] could also provide a notion of [[derivative|differentiation]] which generalized the classical [[directional derivative]] of [[vector fields]] on a manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riemann |first=G. F. B. |chapter=Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen |title=Gesammelte Mathematische Werke |year=1866 }}; reprint, ed. Weber, H. (1953), New York: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christoffel |first=E. B. |title=Über die Transformation der homogenen Differentialausdrücke zweiten Grades |journal=[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]] |volume=70 |issue= |year=1869 |pages=46–70 |url=https://eudml.org/doc/148073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new derivative – the [[Levi-Civita connection]] – was ''[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]'' in the sense that it satisfied Riemann's requirement that objects in geometry should be independent of their description in a particular coordinate system.

It was soon noted by other mathematicians, prominent among these being [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Jan Arnoldus Schouten]], and [[Élie Cartan]],&lt;ref&gt;cf. with {{cite journal |last=Cartan |first=É |url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1923_3_40__325_0 |title=Sur les variétés à connexion affine et la theorie de la relativité généralisée |journal=Annales, École Normale |volume=40 |year=1923 |pages=325–412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a covariant derivative could be defined abstractly without the presence of a [[metric tensor|metric]]. The crucial feature was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second order transformation law. This transformation law could serve as a starting point for defining the derivative in a covariant manner. Thus the theory of covariant differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider range of possible geometries.

In the 1940s, practitioners of [[differential geometry]] began introducing other notions of covariant differentiation in general [[vector bundle]]s which were, in contrast to the classical bundles of interest to geometers, not part of the [[tensor analysis]] of the manifold. By and large, these generalized covariant derivatives had to be specified ''ad hoc'' by some version of the connection concept. In 1950, [[Jean-Louis Koszul]] unified these new ideas of covariant differentiation in a vector bundle by means of what is known today as a '''[[connection (vector bundle)|Koszul connection]]'''  or a '''connection on a vector bundle'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koszul |first=J. L. |title=Homologie et cohomologie des algebres de Lie |journal=Bulletin de la Société Mathématique |volume=78 |year=1950 |pages=65–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ideas from [[Lie algebra cohomology]], Koszul successfully converted many of the analytic features of covariant differentiation into algebraic ones. In particular, Koszul connections eliminated the need for awkward manipulations of [[Christoffel symbols]] (and other analogous non-[[tensor]]ial objects) in differential geometry. Thus they quickly supplanted the classical notion of covariant derivative in many post-1950 treatments of the subject.

==Motivation==
The '''covariant derivative''' is a generalization of the [[directional derivative]] from [[vector calculus]]. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf u}{\mathbf v}&lt;/math&gt;, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, '''u''', defined at a point ''P'', and (2) a [[vector field]], '''v''', defined in a neighborhood of ''P''.&lt;ref&gt;The covariant derivative is also denoted variously by '''&lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;u''', '''D&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;u''', or other notations.&lt;/ref&gt; The output is the vector &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf u}{\mathbf v}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, also at the point ''P''. The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf u}{\mathbf v}&lt;/math&gt; must, in a certain precise sense, be ''independent'' of the manner in which it is expressed in a [[coordinate system]].

A vector may be ''described'' as a list of numbers in terms of a [[basis (mathematics)|basis]], but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in the fact that when a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a [[change of basis]] formula. Such a transformation law is known as a [[covariant transformation]]. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, in the same way as a basis does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name).

In the case of [[Euclidean space]], one tends to define the derivative of a vector field in terms of the difference between two vectors at two nearby points.
In such a system one [[Translation (geometry)|translates]] one of the vectors to the origin of the other, keeping it parallel. With a Cartesian (fixed [[orthonormal]]) coordinate system "keeping it parallel" amounts to keeping the components constant. Thus is obtained the simplest example: a covariant derivative which is obtained by taking the ordinary directional derivative of the components in the direction of the displacement vector between the two nearby points.

In the general case, however, one must take into account the change of the coordinate system. For example, if the same covariant derivative is written in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]] in a two dimensional Euclidean plane, then it contains extra terms that describe how the coordinate grid itself "rotates". In other cases the extra terms describe how the coordinate grid expands, contracts, twists, interweaves, etc. In this case "keeping it parallel" does ''not'' amount to keeping components constant under translation.

Consider the example of moving along a curve ''γ''(''t'') in the Euclidean plane. In polar coordinates, γ may be written in terms of its radial and angular coordinates by ''γ''(''t'') = (''r''(''t''), ''θ''(''t'')). A vector at a particular time ''t''&lt;ref&gt;In many applications, it may be better not to think of ''t'' as corresponding to time, at least for applications in [[general relativity]]. It is simply regarded as an abstract parameter varying smoothly and monotonically along the path.&lt;/ref&gt; (for instance, the acceleration of the curve) is expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; are unit tangent vectors for the polar coordinates, serving as a basis to decompose a vector in terms of radial and [[tangential component]]s. At a slightly later time, the new basis in polar coordinates appears slightly rotated with respect to the first set. The covariant derivative of the basis vectors (the [[Christoffel symbols]]) serve to express this change.
{{Clear}}

In a curved space, such as the surface of the Earth (regarded as a sphere), the [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] is not well defined and its analog, [[parallel transport]], depends on the path along which the vector is translated.

A vector '''e''' on a globe on the equator at point Q is directed to the north. Suppose we [[parallel transport]] the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) drag it along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we notice that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and is caused by the ''curvature'' of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector is a measure of the curvature.

===Remarks===
* The definition of the covariant derivative does not use the metric in space. However, for each metric there is a unique [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]-free covariant derivative called the [[Levi-Civita connection]] such that the covariant derivative of the metric is zero.
* The properties of a derivative imply that &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; depends on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point ''p'' in the same way as e.g. the derivative of a scalar function along a curve at a given point ''p'' depends on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of ''p''.
* The information on the neighborhood of a point ''p'' in the covariant derivative can be used to define [[parallel transport]] of a vector. Also the [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]], [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], and [[geodesic]]s may be defined only in terms of the covariant derivative or other related variation on the idea of a [[Connection (vector bundle)|linear connection]].

==Informal definition using an embedding into Euclidean space==
Suppose a (pseudo) Riemann manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is embedded into Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;(\R^n, \langle\cdot;\cdot\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; via a [[smoothness#Differentiability classes|twice continuously-differentiable]] (C{{sup|2}}) mapping &lt;math&gt;\vec\Psi : \R^d \supset U \rightarrow \R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that the tangent space at &lt;math&gt;\vec\Psi(p) \in M&lt;/math&gt; is spanned by the vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\left\lbrace \left. \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^i} \right|_p : i \in \lbrace1, \dots, d\rbrace\right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

and the scalar product on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with the metric on ''M'':
: &lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \left\langle \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^i} ; \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^j} \right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

(Since the manifold metric is always assumed to be regular, the compatibility condition implies linear independence of the partial derivative tangent vectors.)

For a tangent vector field, &lt;math&gt;\vec V = v^j \frac{\partial \vec\Psi}{\partial x^j}\,&lt;/math&gt;, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\vec V}{\partial x^i} = \frac{\partial v^j}{\partial x^i}  \frac{\partial\vec \Psi}{\partial x^j}  +  v^j \frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} &lt;/math&gt;.

The last term is not tangential to ''M'', but can be expressed as a linear combination of the tangent space base vectors using the [[Christoffel symbols]] as linear factors plus a vector normal to the tangent space:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j}  = {\Gamma^k}_{ij} \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^k} + \vec n
&lt;/math&gt;.

The covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_i} \vec V&lt;/math&gt;, also written &lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \vec V&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as just a tangential portion of the usual derivative:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_i} \vec V := \frac{\partial\vec V}{\partial x^i} - \vec n = \left( \frac{\partial v^k}{\partial x^i} + v^j {\Gamma^k}_{ij} \right) \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the [[Levi-Civita connection]], &lt;math&gt;\vec n&lt;/math&gt; is required to be orthogonal to tangent space, so
:&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle  \frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} ; \frac{\partial\vec \Psi}{\partial x^l} \right\rangle = {\Gamma^k}_{ij}  \left\langle \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^k} ; \frac{\partial\vec\Psi}{\partial x^l} \right\rangle =  {\Gamma^k}_{ij} \, g_{kl}
&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial g_{ab}}{\partial x^c} = \left\langle \frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{ \partial x^c \, \partial x^a} ; \frac{\partial \vec\Psi}{\partial x^b} \right\rangle +  \left\langle \frac{\partial \vec\Psi}{\partial x^a} ; \frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{ \partial x^c \, \partial x^b} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

implies (using the symmetry of the scalar product and swapping the order of partial differentiations)
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^i} + \frac{\partial g_{ki}}{\partial x^j} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^k} = 2\left\langle  \frac{\partial^2 \vec\Psi}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} ; \frac{\partial\vec \Psi}{\partial x^k} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and yields the Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection in terms of the metric:
:&lt;math&gt;
g_{kl} {\Gamma^k}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial g_{jl}}{\partial x^i} + \frac{\partial g_{li}}{\partial x^j}- \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^l}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

For a very simple example that captures the essence of the description above,  draw a circle on a flat sheet of paper.  Travel around the circle at a constant speed.  The derivative of your velocity, your acceleration vector, always points radially inward.  Roll this sheet of paper into a cylinder.  Now the (Euclidean) derivative of your velocity has a component that sometimes points inward toward the axis of the cylinder depending on whether you're near a solstice or an equinox. (At the point of the circle when you are moving parallel to the axis, there is no inward acceleration. At the point, the velocity is along the cylinder's bend, the inward acceleration is maximum.)  This is the (Euclidean) '''normal''' component. The '''covariant''' derivative component is the component parallel to the cylinder's surface, and is the same as that before you rolled the sheet into a cylinder.

==Formal definition==
A covariant derivative is a [[connection (vector bundle)|(Koszul) connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]] and other [[tensor bundle]]s. Thus it has a certain behavior on vector fields that extends that of the usual differential on functions.  It also extends in a unique way to the duals of vector fields (i.e., [[cotangent space|covector]] fields), and to arbitrary [[tensor field]]s, that ensures compatibility with the tensor product and trace operations (tensor contraction).

Given a point ''p'' of the manifold, a real function ''f'' on the manifold, and a tangent vector '''v''' at ''p'', the covariant derivative of ''f'' at ''p'' along '''v''' is the scalar at ''p'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} f\right)_p&lt;/math&gt;, that represents the [[principal part]] of the change in the value of ''f'' when the argument of '''f''' is changed by the infinitesimal displacement vector '''v'''.  (This is the [[differential of a function|differential]] of ''f'' evaluated against the vector '''v'''.)  Formally, there is a differentiable curve &lt;math&gt;\phi:[-1, 1]\to M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) = p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi'(0) = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, and the covariant derivative of ''f'' at ''p'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} f\right)_p = \left(f \circ \phi\right)'\left(0\right) = \lim_{t \to 0}t^{-1}\left(f\left[\phi\left(t\right)\right] - f\left[p\right]\right).&lt;/math&gt;

When '''v''' is a vector field, the covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v}f&lt;/math&gt; is the function that associates with each point ''p'' in the common domain of ''f'' and '''v''' the scalar &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}f\right)_p&lt;/math&gt;.  This coincides with the usual [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' along the vector field '''v'''.

===Vector fields===
A '''covariant derivative''' &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; at a point ''p'' in a smooth manifold assigns a tangent vector &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u})_p&lt;/math&gt; to each pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of a tangent vector '''v''' at ''p'' and vector field '''u''' defined in a neighborhood of ''p'', such that the following properties hold (for any vectors '''v''', '''x''' and '''y''' at ''p'', vector fields '''u''' and '''w''' defined in a neighborhood of ''p'', scalar values ''g'' and ''h'' at ''p'', and scalar function ''f'' defined in a neighborhood of ''p''):
# &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}\right)_p&lt;/math&gt; is linear in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; so
#: &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_{g\mathbf{x} + h\mathbf{y}} \mathbf{u}\right)_p = \left(\nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{u}\right)_p g + \left(\nabla_\mathbf{y} \mathbf{u}\right)_p h&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}\right)_p&lt;/math&gt; is additive in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; so:
#: &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\left[\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}\right]\right)_p = \left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}\right)_p + \left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{w}\right)_p&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u})_p&lt;/math&gt; obeys the [[product rule]]; i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v}f&lt;/math&gt; is defined above,
#: &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \left[f\mathbf{u}\right]\right)_p = f(p)\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u})_p + (\nabla_\mathbf{v}f\right)_p\mathbf{u}_p&lt;/math&gt;.

If '''u''' and '''v''' are both vector fields defined over a common domain, then &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v}\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vector field whose value at each point ''p'' of the domain is the tangent vector &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\mathbf u\right)_p&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that &lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}\right)_p&lt;/math&gt; depends not only on the value of '''v''' at ''p'' but also on values of '''u''' in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of ''p'' because of the last property, the product rule.

===Covector fields===
Given a field of [[Cotangent space|covectors]] (or [[one-form]]) &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; defined in a neighborhood of ''p'', its covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\alpha)_p&lt;/math&gt; is defined in a way to make the resulting operation compatible with tensor contraction and the product rule.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\alpha)_p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the unique one-form at ''p'' such that the following identity is satisfied for all vector fields '''u''' in a neighborhood of ''p''
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\alpha\right)_p \left(\mathbf{u}_p\right) = \nabla_\mathbf{v}\left[\alpha\left(\mathbf{u}\right)\right]_p - \alpha_p\left[\left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\mathbf{u}\right)_p\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant derivative of a covector field along a vector field '''v''' is again a covector field.

===Tensor fields===
Once the covariant derivative is defined for fields of vectors and covectors it can be defined for arbitrary [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)|tensor]] fields by imposing the following identities for every pair of tensor fields &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a neighborhood of the point ''p'':
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v}\left(\varphi \otimes \psi\right)_p = \left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\varphi\right)_p \otimes \psi(p) + \varphi(p) \otimes \left(\nabla_\mathbf{v}\psi\right)_p,&lt;/math&gt;
and for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of the same valence
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mathbf{v}(\varphi + \psi)_p = (\nabla_\mathbf{v}\varphi)_p + (\nabla_\mathbf{v}\psi)_p.&lt;/math&gt;
The covariant derivative of a tensor field along a vector field '''v''' is again a tensor field of the same type.

Explicitly, let ''T'' be a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. Consider ''T'' to be a differentiable [[multilinear map]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''α''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''α''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; of the cotangent bundle ''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' and of sections ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'', written ''T''(α&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) into '''R'''. The covariant derivative of ''T'' along ''Y'' is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (\nabla_Y T)&amp;\left(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, X_1, X_2, \ldots\right) = Y\left(T\left(\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \ldots, X_1, X_2, \ldots\right)\right) \\
              &amp;- T\left(\nabla_Y\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, X_1, X_2, \ldots\right) - T\left(\alpha_1, \nabla_Y\alpha_2, \ldots, X_1, X_2, \ldots\right) - \ldots \\
              &amp;- T\left(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \nabla_YX_1, X_2, \ldots\right) -  T\left(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, X_1, \nabla_YX_2, \ldots\right) - \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Coordinate description==
{{Hatnote|This section uses the [[Einstein summation convention]].}}
Given coordinate functions
: &lt;math&gt;x^i,\ i=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;,

any [[tangent vector]] can be described by its components in the basis
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i={\partial\over\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;.

The covariant derivative of a basis vector along a basis vector is again a vector and so can be expressed as a linear combination &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k \mathbf{e}_k\,&lt;/math&gt;.
To specify the covariant derivative it is enough to specify the covariant derivative of each basis vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\,&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j\,&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j} \mathbf{e}_i =  {\Gamma^k}_{i j} \mathbf{e}_k,&lt;/math&gt;

the coefficients  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k_{\ i j}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called '''[[Christoffel symbols]]'''.

Then using the rules in the definition, we find that for general vector fields &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^j \mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = u^i \mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u} = {}
    &amp;\nabla_{v^j \mathbf{e}_j} u^i \mathbf{e}_i = v^j \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j}  u^i \mathbf{e}_i = \\
    &amp;v^j u^i \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j} \mathbf{e}_i + v^j \mathbf{e}_i \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j} u^i = \\
    &amp;v^j u^i {\Gamma^k}_{i j}\mathbf{e}_k + v^j{\partial u^i \over \partial x^j} \mathbf{e}_i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

so
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u} = \left(v^j u^i {\Gamma^k}_{i j} + v^j{\partial u^k\over\partial x^j}\right)\mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in this formula is responsible for "twisting" the coordinate system with respect to the covariant derivative and the second for changes of components of the vector field ''u''. In particular
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j} \mathbf{u} = \nabla_j \mathbf{u} = \left( \frac{\partial u^i}{\partial x^j} + u^k {\Gamma^i}_{kj} \right) \mathbf{e}_i  &lt;/math&gt;

In words: the covariant derivative is the usual derivative along the coordinates with correction terms which tell how the coordinates change.

For covectors similarly we have
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_j} {\mathbf \theta} = \left( \frac{\partial \theta_i}{\partial x^j} - \theta_k {\Gamma^k}_{ij} \right) {\mathbf e^*}^i  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e^*}^i(\mathbf{e}_j) = {\delta^i}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

The covariant derivative of a type {{nowrap|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field along &lt;math&gt;e_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  {(\nabla_{e_c} T)^{a_1 \ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \ldots b_s} = {}
    &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial x^c}{T^{a_1 \ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \ldots b_s} \\
    &amp;+ \,{\Gamma ^{a_1}}_{dc} {T^{d a_2 \ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \ldots b_s} + \cdots + {\Gamma^{a_r}}_{dc} {T^{a_1 \ldots a_{r-1}d}}_{b_1 \ldots b_s} \\
    &amp;-\,{\Gamma^d}_{b_1 c} {T^{a_1 \ldots a_r}}_{d b_2 \ldots b_s} - \cdots - {\Gamma^d}_{b_s c} {T^{a_1 \ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \ldots b_{s-1} d}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in words: take the partial derivative of the tensor and add: &lt;math&gt;+{\Gamma^{a_i}}_{dc}&lt;/math&gt; for every upper index &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;-{\Gamma^d}_{b_ic}&lt;/math&gt; for every lower index &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If instead of a tensor, one is trying to differentiate a ''[[tensor density]]'' (of weight +1), then you also add a term
:&lt;math&gt;-{\Gamma^d}_{d c} {T^{a_1 \ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \ldots b_s}.&lt;/math&gt;
If it is a tensor density of weight ''W'', then multiply that term by ''W''.
For example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar density (of weight +1), so we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sqrt{-g}\right)_{;c} = \left(\sqrt{-g}\right)_{,c} - \sqrt{-g}\,{\Gamma^d}_{d c}&lt;/math&gt;

where semicolon ";" indicates covariant differentiation and comma "," indicates partial differentiation. Incidentally, this particular expression is equal to zero, because the covariant derivative of a function solely of the metric is always zero.

==Examples==
For a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, covariant differentiation is simply partial differentiation:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi_{;a} \equiv \partial_a \phi&lt;/math&gt;

For a contravariant vector field &lt;math&gt;\lambda^a\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;{\lambda^a}_{;b} \equiv \partial_b \lambda^a + {\Gamma^a}_{bc}\lambda^c&lt;/math&gt;

For a covariant vector field &lt;math&gt;\lambda_a\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{a;c} \equiv \partial_c \lambda_a - {\Gamma^b}_{c a}\lambda_b&lt;/math&gt;

For a type (2,0) tensor field &lt;math&gt;\tau^{a b}\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;{\tau^{a b}}_{;c} \equiv \partial_c \tau^{a b} + {\Gamma^a}_{c d}\tau^{d b} + {\Gamma^b}_{c d}\tau^{a d}&lt;/math&gt;

For a type (0,2) tensor field &lt;math&gt;\tau_{a b}\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{a b ;c} \equiv \partial_c \tau_{a b} - {\Gamma^d}_{c a}\tau_{d b} - {\Gamma^d}_{c b}\tau_{a d}&lt;/math&gt;

For a type (1,1) tensor field &lt;math&gt;{\tau^{a}}_{b}\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;{\tau^a}_{b;c}\equiv \partial_c {\tau^a}_b + {\Gamma^a}_{c d}{\tau^d}_b - {\Gamma^d}_{c b} {\tau^a}_d&lt;/math&gt;

The notation above is meant in the sense
:&lt;math&gt;{\tau^{a b}}_{;c} \equiv \left(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_c}\tau\right)^{a b}&lt;/math&gt;

Covariant derivatives do not commute; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{a;bc} \neq \lambda_{a;cb}\,&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{a;bc} - \lambda_{a;cb} = {R^d}_{abc}\lambda_d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{R^d}_{abc} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann tensor]]. Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt; {\lambda^a}_{;bc} - {\lambda^a}_{;cb} = -{R^a}_{dbc}\lambda^d&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt; {\tau^{ab}}_{;cd} - {\tau^{ab}}_{;dc} = -{R^a}_{ecd}\tau^{eb} - {R^b}_{ecd}\tau^{ae}&lt;/math&gt;

The latter can be shown by taking (without loss of generality) that &lt;math&gt;\tau^{ab} = \lambda^a \mu^b \,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Notation==
In textbooks on physics, the covariant derivative is sometimes simply stated in terms of its components in this equation.

Often a notation is used in which the covariant derivative is given with a [[semicolon]], while a normal [[partial derivative]] is indicated by a [[comma]]. In this notation we write the same as:
:&lt;math&gt;
          \nabla_{e_j} \mathbf{v} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {v^s}_{;j}e_s \;\;\;\;\;\;
          {v^i}_{;j}  =
          {v^i}_{,j} + v^k {\Gamma^i}_{k j}
&lt;/math&gt;
Once again this shows that the covariant derivative of a vector field is not just simply obtained by differentiating to the coordinates &lt;math&gt; {v^i}_{,j}&lt;/math&gt;, but also depends on the vector '''v''' itself through &lt;math&gt; v^k {\Gamma^i}_{k j}&lt;/math&gt;.

In some older texts (notably Adler, Bazin &amp; Schiffer, ''Introduction to General Relativity''), the covariant derivative is denoted by a double pipe:
:&lt;math&gt;
          \nabla_{e_j} \mathbf{v} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {v^i}_{||j}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivative along curve==
Since the covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla_XT&lt;/math&gt; of a tensor field &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the value of the vector field &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; one can define the covariant derivative along a smooth curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt; in a manifold:
:&lt;math&gt;D_tT=\nabla_{\dot\gamma(t)}T.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the tensor field &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; only needs to be defined on the curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt; for this definition to make sense.

In particular, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field along the curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; itself. If &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot\gamma(t)}\dot\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes then the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. If the covariant derivative is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a certain metric then the geodesics for the connection are precisely the [[geodesics]] of the [[Metric tensor|metric]] that are parametrised by arc length.

The derivative along a curve is also used to define the [[parallel transport]] along the curve.

Sometimes the covariant derivative along a curve is called '''absolute''' or '''intrinsic derivative'''.

==Relation to Lie derivative==
A covariant derivative introduces an extra geometric structure on a manifold that allows vectors in neighboring tangent spaces to be compared.  This extra structure is necessary because there is no canonical way to compare vectors from different vector spaces, as is necessary for this generalization of the [[directional derivative]].  There is however another generalization of directional derivatives which ''is'' canonical: the [[Lie derivative]].  The Lie derivative evaluates the change of one vector field along the flow of another vector field.  Thus, one must know both vector fields in an open neighborhood.  The covariant derivative on the other hand introduces its own change for vectors in a given direction, and it only depends on the vector direction at a single point, rather than a vector field in an open neighborhood of a point.  In other words, the covariant derivative is linear (over ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')) in the direction argument, while the Lie derivative is linear in neither argument.

Note that the antisymmetrized covariant derivative {{nowrap|∇&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;''v'' − ∇&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''}}, and the Lie derivative ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;''v'' differ by the [[torsion of connection|torsion of the connection]], so that if a connection is torsion free, then its antisymmetrization ''is'' the Lie derivative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[number theory]], a '''Cunningham number''' is a certain kind of integer named after English mathematician [[Allan Joseph Champneys Cunningham|A. J. C. Cunningham]].

==Definition==

Cunningham numbers are a simple type of [[binomial number]], they are of the form

:&lt;math&gt;b^n\pm1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' and ''n'' are integers and ''b'' is not a [[perfect power]].  They are denoted ''C''&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;(''b'',&amp;nbsp;''n'').

==Primality==

Establishing whether or not a given Cunningham number is prime has been the main focus of research around this type of number.&lt;ref&gt;J. Brillhart, D. H. Lehmer, J. Selfridge, B. Tuckerman,and S. S. Wagstaff Jr., ''Factorizations of b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;±1, b=2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 Up to High Powers (n)'', 3rd ed. Providence, RI: Amer. Math. Soc., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two particularly famous families of Cunningham numbers in this respect are the [[Fermat numbers]], which are those of the form ''C''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(2,2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;), and the [[Mersenne numbers]], which are of the form ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(2,''n'').

Cunningham worked on gathering together all known data on which of these numbers were prime. In 1925 he published tables which summarised his findings with [[H. J. Woodall]], and much computation has been done in the intervening time to fill these tables.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Brent and H. J. J. te Riele, ''Factorizations of a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;±1, 13≤a&amp;lt;100'' Report NM-R9212, Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica. Amsterdam, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''derangement''' is a [[permutation]] of the elements of a [[set (mathematics)|set]], such that no element appears in its original position.
In other words, derangement is a permutation that has no [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].

The number of derangements of a set of size ''n'', usually written ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', or !''n'', is called the "derangement number" or "de Montmort number".  (These numbers are generalized to [[rencontres numbers]].)  The '''subfactorial''' function (not to be confused with the [[factorial]] ''n''!) maps ''n'' to !''n''.&lt;ref&gt;The name "subfactorial" originates with [[William Allen Whitworth]]; see {{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations: Two Volumes in One|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.,|year=2011|isbn=9781616405717|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxrO8ZnMK_YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No standard notation for subfactorials is agreed upon; ''n''¡ is sometimes used instead of !''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth, Oren Patashnik, ''Concrete Mathematics'' (1994), Addison–Wesley, Reading MA. {{ISBN|0-201-55802-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of counting derangements was first considered by [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]]&lt;ref&gt;de Montmort, P. R. (1708). ''Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard''. Paris: Jacque Quillau. ''Seconde Edition, Revue &amp; augmentée de plusieurs Lettres''. Paris: Jacque Quillau. 1713.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1708; he solved it in 1713, as did [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicholas Bernoulli]] at about the same time.

Suppose that a professor gave a test to 4 students – A, B, C, and D – and wants to let them grade each other's tests. Of course, no student should grade his or her own test. How many ways could the professor hand the tests back to the students for grading, such that no student received his or her own test back? Out of [[v:Symmetric group S4#tables|24 possible permutations]] (4!) for handing back the tests:
:{| style="font:125% monospace;line-height:1;border-collapse:collapse;"
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;ABCD&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt;DC,
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;CB&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;CDB,
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;DBC,
|&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;D&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;B,
|-
|BA&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;BADC&lt;/span&gt;,
|BCA&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;BCDA&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;BDAC&lt;/span&gt;,
|BD&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;A,
|-
|CAB&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;CADB&lt;/span&gt;,
|C&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,
|C&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;DA,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;CDAB&lt;/span&gt;,
|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;CDBA&lt;/span&gt;,

|&lt;span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"&gt;DCBA&lt;/span&gt;.
|}
there are only 9 derangements (shown in blue italics above). In every other permutation of this 4-member set, at least one student gets his or her own test back (shown in bold red).

Another version of the problem arises when we ask for the number of ways ''n'' letters, each addressed to a different person, can be placed in ''n'' pre-addressed envelopes so that no letter appears in the correctly addressed envelope.

== Counting derangements ==
Suppose that there are ''n'' people who are numbered 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''. Let there be ''n'' hats also numbered 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''.  We have to find the number of ways in which no one gets the hat having the same number as their number. Let us assume that the first person takes hat ''i''. There are ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 ways for the first person to make such a choice. There are now two possibilities, depending on whether or not person ''i'' takes hat 1 in return:
#Person ''i'' does not take the hat 1. This case is equivalent to solving the problem with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 persons and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 hats: each of the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 people has precisely 1 forbidden choice from among the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 hats (''i'''s forbidden choice is hat 1).
#Person ''i'' takes the hat 1. Now the problem reduces to ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 persons and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 hats.
From this, the following relation is derived:

:&lt;math&gt;!n = (n - 1) (!(n-1) + !(n-2)).\,&lt;/math&gt;

where !n, known as the subfactorial, represents the number of derangements, with the starting values !0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and !1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Also, the following formulae are known:&lt;ref&gt;Hassani, M. "Derangements and Applications." J. Integer Seq. 6, No. 03.1.2, 1&amp;ndash;8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;!n = n! \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{(-1)^i}{i!},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;!n = \left[ \frac{n!}{e} \right]  = \left\lfloor\frac{n!}{e}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor, \quad n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\left[x\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[nearest integer function]] and &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]].

:&lt;math&gt;!n = \left\lfloor(e+e^{-1})n!\right\rfloor-\lfloor en!\rfloor , \quad n\geq 2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;!n = n! - \sum_{i=1}^n {n \choose i} \cdot !(n-i),&lt;/math&gt;

The following recurrence relationship also holds:&lt;ref&gt;See the notes for {{OEIS|id=A000166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;!n = n[!(n-1)] + (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;

Starting with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the numbers of derangements of ''n'' are:

:1, 0, 1, 2, 9, 44, 265, 1854, 14833, 133496, 1334961, 14684570, 176214841, 2290792932, ... {{OEIS|id=A000166}}.

These numbers are also called '''subfactorial''' or '''[[rencontres numbers]]'''.

A well-known method of counting derangements uses the [[inclusion–exclusion principle#Examples|inclusion–exclusion principle]]: counting all arrangements, subtracting those that fix at least one element and permute the rest in any way, then adding back those that fix at least two elements, etc. 
:&lt;math&gt;!n = n!-{n \choose 1}(n-1)!+{n \choose 2}(n-2)!-\cdots \pm {n \choose n}0! =n!+\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i{n \choose i} (n-i)!.&lt;/math&gt;
Factoring out {{math|''n''!}} gives the formula above, &lt;math&gt;!n = n! \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Limit of ratio of derangement to permutation as ''n'' approaches &amp;infin;==

Using this recurrence, it can be shown that, in the limit,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} {!n \over n!} = {1 \over e} \approx 0.3679\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the limit of the [[probability]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''! that a randomly selected permutation is a derangement. The probability converges to this limit extremely quickly as ''n'' increases, which is why ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the nearest integer to ''n''!/''e''. The above [[semi-log]] graph shows that the derangement graph lags the permutation graph by an almost constant value.

More information about this calculation and the above limit may be found in the article on the
[[Random permutation statistics#Number of permutations that are derangements|statistics of random permutations]].

== Generalizations ==

The [[rencontres numbers|problème des rencontres]] asks how many permutations of a size-''n'' set have exactly ''k'' fixed points.

Derangements are an example of the wider field of constrained permutations. For example, the ''[[ménage problem]]'' asks if ''n'' opposite-sex couples are seated man-woman-man-woman-... around a table, how many ways can they be seated so that nobody is seated next to his or her partner?

More formally, given sets ''A'' and ''S'',  and some sets ''U'' and ''V'' of [[surjection]]s ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''S'', we often wish to know the number of pairs of functions (''f'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') such that ''f'' is in ''U'' and ''g'' is in ''V'', and for all ''a'' in ''A'', ''f''(''a'') &amp;ne; ''g''(''a''); in other words, where for each ''f'' and ''g'', there exists a derangement &amp;phi; of ''S'' such that ''f''(''a'') = &amp;phi;(''g''(''a'')).

Another generalization is the following problem:

:''How many anagrams with no fixed letters of a given word are there?''

For instance, for a word made of only two different letters, say ''n'' letters A and ''m'' letters B, the answer is, of course, 1 or 0 according to whether ''n'' = ''m'' or not, for the only way to form an anagram without fixed letters is to exchange all the ''A'' with ''B'', which is possible if and only if ''n'' = ''m''.  In the general case, for a word with ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; letters ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; letters ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; letters ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; it turns out (after a proper use of the [[inclusion-exclusion]] formula) that the answer has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty P_{n_1} (x) P_{n_2}(x)\cdots P_{n_r}(x) e^{-x}\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

for a certain sequence of polynomials ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has degree ''n''.  But the above answer for the case ''r'' = 2 gives an orthogonality relation, whence the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s are the [[Laguerre polynomials]] ([[up to]] a sign that is easily decided).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Even|first=S.|author2=J. Gillis|title=Derangements and Laguerre polynomials|journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|year=1976|volume=79|issue=01|pages=135–143|doi=10.1017/S0305004100052154|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2128316|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Complex plot for derangement real between -1 to 11.png|thumb|&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty(t-1)^ze^{-t}dt&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane.]]
In particular, for the classical derangements

&lt;math&gt;!n=\int_0^\infty(x-1)^ne^{-x}dx.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">In [[mathematics]], the '''Ellis–Numakura lemma''' states that if ''S'' is a non-empty [[semigroup]] with a topology such that ''S'' is [[compact space|compact]] and the product is semi-continuous, then ''S'' has an [[idempotent]] element ''p'', (that is, with ''pp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'').  The [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] is named after Robert Ellis and Katsui Numakura.

==Applications==
Applying this lemma to the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] ''βN'' of the natural numbers shows that there are idempotent elements in ''βN''. The product on ''βN'' is not continuous, but is only semi-continuous (right or left, depending on the preferred construction, but never both).

==Proof==
*By compactness and [[Zorn's Lemma]], there is a minimal non-empty compact sub semigroup of ''S'', so replacing ''S'' by this sub semi group we can assume ''S'' is minimal.
*Choose ''p'' in ''S''. The set ''Sp'' is a non-empty compact subsemigroup, so by minimality it is ''S'' and in  particular contains ''p'', so the set of elements ''q'' with ''qp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'' is non-empty.
*The set of all elements ''q'' with ''qp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'' is a compact semigroup, and is nonempty by the previous step, so by minimality it is the whole of ''S'' and therefore contains ''p''. So ''pp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''.

The '''Elston&amp;ndash;Stewart algorithm''' is an algorithm for computing the [[likelihood]] of observed genotype data given a [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]].  It is due to [[Robert Elston]] and [[John Stewart (scientist)|John Stewart]].  It can handle relatively large pedigrees providing they are (almost) outbred.  Its computation time is exponential in the number of markers. It is used in the analysis of genetic linkage.

In the theory of [[quantum communication]], the '''entanglement-assisted classical capacity''' of a [[quantum channel]] is the highest rate at which [[classical information]] can be transmitted from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]]. It is given by the [[quantum mutual information]] of the channel, which is the input-output [[quantum mutual information]] maximized over all pure bipartite [[quantum states]] with one system transmitted through the [[quantum channel|channel]]. This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon's [[noisy channel coding theorem]], in the sense that this formula is equal to the capacity, and there is no need to regularize it. An additional feature that it shares with Shannon's formula is that a noiseless classical or [[quantum feedback]] channel cannot increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts: the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem. The direct coding theorem demonstrates that the [[quantum mutual information]] of the channel is an achievable rate, by a random coding strategy that is effectively a noisy version of the [[super-dense coding]] protocol. The converse theorem demonstrates that this rate is optimal by making use of the [[Strong Subadditivity of Quantum Entropy|strong subadditivity]] of [[quantum entropy]].

[[File:Cagnacci Allegoria.jpg|thumb|An [[allegorical]] painting of a woman, representing eternity. She holds an [[hourglass]], a skull rests on the table beside her, and an [[Ouroboros]] floats above her head. All of these are common symbols of eternity.]]

'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] is an infinitely long period of [[time]]. In [[classical philosophy]], however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time while sempiternity is the concept that corresponds to the colloquial definition of eternity. 

Eternity is an  important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Philosophy of space and time}}
[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&amp;pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the image of a snake swallowing its own tail, known as the [[Ouroboros]] (or Uroboros). The circle is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. {{cn|date=March 2015}}   Symbolically, it suggests that Eternity has no beginning or end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8407">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the [[calculus of variations]], a variation {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} of a function {{math|''f''}} can be concentrated on an arbitrarily small interval, but not a single point.
Accordingly, the necessary condition of extremum ([[functional derivative]] equal zero) appears in a [[weak formulation]] (variational form) integrated with an arbitrary function {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}}. The '''fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations''' is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation ([[differential equation]]), free of the integration with arbitrary function. The proof usually exploits the possibility to choose {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} concentrated on an interval on which {{math|''f''}} keeps sign (positive or negative). Several versions of the lemma are in use. Basic versions are easy to formulate and prove. More powerful versions are used when needed.

==Basic version==

:If a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x)h(x)\,\operatorname{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all [[compactly supported]] [[smooth function]]s &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.1.1 on p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GF1&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 1 on p.9 (and Remark)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here "smooth" may be interpreted as "infinitely differentiable",&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often is interpreted as "twice continuously differentiable" or "continuously differentiable" or even just "continuous",&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; since these weaker statements may be strong enough for a given task. "Compactly supported" means "vanishes outside &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;c&lt;d&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;";&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often a weaker statement suffices, assuming only that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and a number of its derivatives) vanishes at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; in this case the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is used.

==Version for two given functions==

:If a pair of continuous functions ''f'', ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f(x) \, h(x) + g(x) \, h'(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is differentiable, and ''g''' = ''f'' &amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;ref name=GF4&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 4 on p.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H1&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 15.1 on p.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special case for ''g'' = 0 is just the basic version.

Here is the special case for ''f'' = 0 (often sufficient).

:If a continuous function ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b g(x) \, h'(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is [[Constant function|constant]].&lt;ref name=GF2&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 2 on p.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, in addition, [[continuously differentiable|continuous differentiability]] of ''g'' is assumed, then [[integration by parts]] reduces both statements to the basic version; this case is attributed to [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], while the proof of differentiability of ''g'' is due to [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]].

==Versions for discontinuous functions==

The given functions (''f'', ''g'') may be discontinuous, provided that they are [[locally integrable]] (on the given interval). In this case, [[Lebesgue integration]] is meant, the conclusions hold [[almost everywhere]] (thus, in all continuity points), and differentiability of ''g'' is interpreted as local [[absolute continuity]] (rather than continuous differentiability).&lt;ref name=J2&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.2.1 on p.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gia&gt;{{harvnb|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|loc=section 2.3: Mollifiers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the given functions are assumed to be [[piecewise continuous]], in which case [[Riemann integration]] suffices, and the conclusions are stated everywhere except the finite set of discontinuity points.&lt;ref name=H1 /&gt;

==Higher derivatives==

:If a tuple of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_0,f_1,\dots,f_n&lt;/math&gt; on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f_0(x) \, h(x) + f_1(x) \, h'(x) + \dots + f_n(x) \, h^{(n)}(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then there exist continuously differentiable functions &lt;math&gt; u_0,u_1,\dots,u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; on (''a'',''b'') such that
::&lt;math&gt; f_0 = u'_0, \; f_1 = u_0+u'_1, \; \dots, \; f_{n-1}=u_{n-2}+u'_{n-1}, \; f_n = u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:everywhere.&lt;ref name=H2&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 13.1 on p.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This necessary condition is also sufficient, since the integrand becomes &lt;math&gt; (u_0 h)' + (u_1 h')' + \dots + (u_{n-1} h^{(n-1)})'. &lt;/math&gt;

The case ''n'' = 1 is just the version for two given functions, since &lt;math&gt; f=f_0=u'_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_1=u_0, &lt;/math&gt; thus, &lt;math&gt; f_0-f'_1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, the case ''n''=2 does not lead to the relation &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0, &lt;/math&gt; since the function &lt;math&gt; f_2 = u_1 &lt;/math&gt; need not be differentiable twice. The sufficient condition &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is not necessary. Rather, the necessary and sufficient condition may be written as &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - f'_2)' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=2, &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - (f_2-f'_3)')' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=3, and so on; in general, the brackets cannot be opened because of non-differentiability.

==Vector-valued functions==

Generalization to [[vector-valued functions]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is straightforward; one applies the results for scalar functions to each coordinate separately,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=p.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or treats the vector-valued case from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivariable functions==

:If a continuous [[Function of several real variables|multivariable function]] ''f'' on an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω, then ''f'' is identically zero.

Similarly to the basic version, one may consider a continuous function ''f'' on the closure of Ω, assuming that ''h'' vanishes on the boundary of Ω (rather than compactly supported).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma on p.22}}; the proof applies in both situations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a version for discontinuous multivariable functions.

:Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; be an open set, and &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω. Then ''f''=0 (in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, almost everywhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 3.2.3 on p.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This lemma is used to prove that [[maxima and minima|extrema]] of the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]
:&lt;math&gt; J[y] = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \, \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;
are  [[weak solution]]s &lt;math&gt;y:[x_0,x_1]\to V&lt;/math&gt; (for an appropriate vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial y} = {\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t} {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial \dot y} .&lt;/math&gt;
The Euler–Lagrange equation plays a prominent role in [[classical mechanics]] and [[differential geometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3574">The ''' generalized Helmholtz theorem ''' is the multi-dimensional generalization of the [[Helmholtz theorem (classical mechanics)|Helmholtz theorem]] which is valid only in one dimension. The generalized Helmholtz theorem reads as follows.

Let
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2,...,p_s),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}=(q_1,q_2,...,q_s),&lt;/math&gt;
be the [[canonical coordinates]] of a ''s''-dimensional [[Hamiltonian system]], and let

:&lt;math&gt; H(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q};V)=K(\mathbf{p})+\varphi(\mathbf{q};V) &lt;/math&gt;

be the [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]] function, where

:&lt;math&gt;K=\sum_{i=1}^{s}\frac{p_i^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;,

is the [[kinetic energy]] and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{q};V)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[potential energy]] which depends on a parameter &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.
Let the hyper-surfaces of constant energy in the 2''s''-dimensional phase space of the system be '''metrically indecomposable''' and let &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \cdot \right\rangle_t &lt;/math&gt; denote time average. Define the quantities &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;E = K + \varphi &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2}{s}\left\langle K\right\rangle _{t}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;P = \left\langle -\frac{\partial \varphi }{\partial V}\right\rangle _{t}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;S(E,V) = \log \int_{H(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q};V) \leq E} d^s\mathbf{p}d^s \mathbf{q}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then:

:&lt;math&gt;dS = \frac{dE+PdV}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Remarks ==
The thesis of this theorem of [[classical mechanics]] reads exactly as the [[heat theorem]] of [[thermodynamics]]. This fact shows that thermodynamic-like relations exist between certain mechanical quantities in multidimensional [[ergodic]] systems. This in turn allows to define the "thermodynamic state" of a multi-dimensional ergodic mechanical system, without the requirement that the system be composed of a large number of degrees of freedom. In particular the [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is given by twice the time average of the kinetic energy per degree of freedom, and the [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by the logarithm of the phase space volume enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] (i.e. the so-called [[volume entropy]]).

In [[mathematics]], a '''higher spin alternating sign matrix''' is a generalisation of the [[alternating sign matrix]] ('''ASM'''), where the columns and rows sum to an integer ''r'' (the ''spin'') rather than simply summing to 1 as in the usual alternating sign matrix definition. HSASMs are square matrices whose elements may be integers in the range &amp;minus;''r'' to +''r''. When traversing any row or column of an ASM or HSASM, the partial sum of its entries must always be non-negative.&lt;ref name="ecomjournal"&gt;[http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_14/PDF/v14i1r83.pdf R. E. Behrend and V. A. Knight, "Higher Spin Alternating Sign Matrices", ""The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics"", '''14''' (2007), #R83]&lt;/ref&gt;

High spin ASMs have found application in [[statistical mechanics]] and [[physics]], where they have been found to represent [[symmetry group]]s in [[ice crystal]] formation.

Some typical examples of HSASMs are shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp;-1 &amp; 1 \\
 2 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 &amp;-1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0&amp;0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 &amp;0\\
 2 &amp;-1 &amp;-1 &amp; 0 &amp;2\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\
0&amp;2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 2 &amp;-2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The set of HSASMs is a [[superset]] of the ASMs. The [[extreme points]] of the [[convex hull]] of the set of ''r''-spin HSASMs are themselves integer multiples of the usual ASMs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">'''Invariant-based programming'''&lt;ref&gt;Back, Ralph-Johan: [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00477903/document Invariant Based Programming: Basic approach and Teaching Experience], Formal Aspects of Computing, 14 February 2008, ISSN 0934-5043 (Print) 1433-299X (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; is a programming methodology where [[Formal specification|specifications]] and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]] are written before the actual program statements. Writing down the invariants during the programming process has a number of advantages: it requires the programmer to make their intentions about the program behavior explicit before actually implementing it, and invariants can be evaluated dynamically during execution to catch common programming errors. Furthermore, if strong enough, invariants can be used to prove the [[Formal verification|correctness]] of the program based on the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] of program statements. A combined programming and specification language, connected to a powerful formal proof system, will generally be required for full verification of non-trivial programs. In this case a high degree of automation of proofs is also possible.

In most existing programming languages the main organizing structures are control flow blocks such as [[For loop|&lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loops]], [[While loop|&lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops]] and [[If statement|&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements]]. Such languages may not be ideal for invariants-first programming, since they force the programmer to make decisions about control flow before writing the invariants. Furthermore, most programming languages do not have good support for writing specifications and invariants, since they lack quantifier operators and one can typically not express higher order properties.

The idea of developing the program together with its proof originated from [[Edsger Dijkstra|E.W. Dijkstra]]. Actually writing invariants before program statements has been considered in a number of different forms by M.H. van Emden, [[John C. Reynolds|J.C. Reynolds]] and [[Ralph-Johan Back|R-J Back]].

Pach received his [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidate]] degree from the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], in 1983, where his advisor was [[Miklós Simonovits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=15046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, he has been affiliated with the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=renyi&gt;[http://www.math-inst.hu/researchers.html Research Fellows], Renyi Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Research Professor at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] at [[NYU]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.nyu.edu/~pach/ Faculty profile], NYU, retrieved 2011-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  (since 1986), Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at [[City College of New York|City College, CUNY]] (1992-2011), and Neilson Professor at [[Smith College]] (2008-2009).

In 2008, he joined [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]&lt;ref name="epfl"&gt;[http://actualites.epfl.ch/presseinfo-com?id=538 János Pach appointed as a full professor of mathematics], EPFL, December 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as Professor of Mathematics.

He was the program chair for the [[International Symposium on Graph Drawing]] in 2004 and
[[Symposium on Computational Geometry]] in 2015. With [[Kenneth L. Clarkson]] and [[Günter Ziegler]], he is co-editor-in-chief of the journal ''[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]'', and he serves on the editorial boards of several other journals including ''[[Combinatorica]]'', ''[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]]'', ''Computational Geometry'', ''[[Graphs and Combinatorics]]'', ''Central European Journal of Mathematics'', and ''Moscow Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory''.

He was an invited speaker at the Combinatorics session of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], in Seoul, 2014.&lt;ref name="seoul"&gt;[http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByLastname.php List of Speakers at ICM.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Pach has authored several books and over 200 research papers. He was one of the most frequent collaborators of [[Paul Erdős]], authoring over 20 papers with him and thus has an [[Erdős number]] of one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakland.edu/enp/compute/ Computing Your Erdös Number]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pach's research is focused in the areas of [[combinatorics]] and [[discrete geometry]].
In 1981, he solved [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam's]] problem,  showing that there exists
no [[universal graph|universal planar graph]].&lt;ref name="P81"&gt;{{citation|

The '''Kepert model''' is a modification of [[VSEPR theory]] used to predict the 3-dimensional structures of transitional [[metal]] complexes. In the Kepert model, the [[ligands]] attached to the metal are considered to repel each other the same way that point charges repel each other in VSEPR theory. Unlike VSEPR theory, the Kepert model does not account for non-bonding [[electrons]]. Therefore, the [[geometry]] of the coordination complex is independent of the electronic configuration of the metal center. Thus [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;m+&lt;/sup&gt; has the same coordination [[geometry]] as [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;m−&lt;/sup&gt;.
The Kepert model cannot explain the formation of square planar complexes or distorted structures.

The Kepert model predicts the following geometries for coordination numbers of 2 through 6:

{{ordered list|start=2
| Linear
| Trigonal planar
| Tetrahedral
| Trigonal bipyramidal or Square pyramidal
| Octahedral
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2712">'''Leone Minna Burton''' (''née'' '''Gold'''; 14 September 1936&amp;nbsp; - 1 December 2007) was a professor of education in mathematics and science at the [[University of Birmingham]].

==Education==
She attended the [[University of London]] studying education with a focus on teaching mathematics.  She began teaching at the [[secondary school|secondary]] level but disliked the educational structure and methods of the day and moved to teaching at the [[primary school|primary]] level to have a greater opportunity to change teaching structure.  She received a postgraduate certificate in education in 1966 and an academic diploma in education in 1968, both from the University of London.  In 1967 she obtained a post as a mathematical education specialist at [[Battersea College of Education]], which is dedicated to teacher preparation.  She received her PHD from the [[Institute of Education]] in 1980.

==Career==
Her research has included what is now termed the field of [[ethnomathematics]] which examines how mathematics is related to the culture in which it is developed,

She has been visiting professor at institutions in Asia.  For 1984-1988 she was international convenor for the [[International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education]]. She founded the monograph series International Perspective on Mathematics Education with the [[Greenwood Publishing]] group in 2001 which published three monographs between 2002-2006. This monograph series was subsequently renamed [[International Perspectives on Mathematics Education: Cognition, Equity and Society]] in honor of her pioneering work on equity and gender issues in mathematics education, edited by [[Bharath Sriraman]] and Donna Ford, and published by [[Information Age Publishing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22373">{{Hatnote|For similarly named ordering systems outside mathematics, see [[alphabetical order]], [[natural sort order]], [[lexicographic preferences]], and [[collation]].}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''lexicographic''' or '''lexicographical order''' (also known as '''lexical order''', '''dictionary order''', '''alphabetical order''' or '''lexicographic(al) product''') is a generalization of the way words are [[alphabetical order|alphabetically ordered]] based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. This generalization consists primarily in defining a [[total order]] over the [[sequence]]s (often called [[String_(computer_science)|strings]] in [[computer science]]) of elements of a finite [[totally ordered set]], often called an [[alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]].

There are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering. One variant widely used in [[combinatorics]] orders subsets of a given [[finite set]] by assigning a total order to the finite set, and converting subsets into increasing sequences, to which the lexicographical order is applied. Another generalization defines an order on a [[Cartesian product]] of [[partially ordered set]]s; this order is a total order if and only if the factors of the Cartesian product are totally ordered.

==Motivation and definition==
The word ''lexicographic'' is derived from [[lexicon]], the set of words that are used in some language and appear in [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s. The lexicographic order has thus been introduced for [[sorting]] the entries of dictionaries and encyclopedias. This has been formalized in the following way.

Consider a [[finite set]] {{math|''A''}}, often called [[alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]], which is [[totally ordered]]. In dictionaries, this is the common alphabet, ordered by the [[alphabetical order]]. In [[Index (publishing)|book indexes]], the alphabet is generally extended to all [[alphanumeric]] characters; it is the object of a specific convention whether a digit is considered as smaller or larger than a letter. The lexicographic order is a [[total order]] on the [[sequence]]s of elements of {{math|''A''}}, often called [[string (computer science)|words]] on {{math|''A''}}, which is defined as follows.

Given two different sequences of the same length, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (for the order of  {{math|''A''}}), for the first {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} differ.

To compare sequences of different lengths, the shorter sequence is usually padded at the end with enough "blanks" (a special symbol that is treated as smaller than every element of {{math|''A''}}). This way of comparing sequences of different lengths is always used in dictionaries. However, in [[combinatorics]], another convention is frequently used, whereby a shorter sequence is always smaller than a longer sequence. This variant of the lexicographical order is sometimes called ''[[shortlex order]]''.

In dictionary order, the word "Thomas" appears before "Thompson" because the letter 'a' comes before the letter 'p' in the alphabet. The 5th letter is the first that is different in the two words; the first four letters are "Thom" in both. Because it is the first difference, the 5th letter is the most significant difference for the alphabetical ordering.

An important property of the lexicographical order on words of a fixed length on a finite alphabet is that it is a [[well-order]]; that is, every decreasing sequence of words is finite.&lt;ref name="Harzheim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaaderNipkow1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Franz Baader|author2=Tobias Nipkow|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77920-3|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numeral systems and dates==
The lexicographical order is used not only in dictionaries, but also commonly for numbers and dates.

One of the drawbacks of the [[Roman numeral system]] is that it is not always immediately obvious which of two numbers is the smaller. On the other hand, with the [[positional notation]] of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], comparing numbers is easy, because the natural order on [[nonnegative integer]]s is the same as the variant [[shortlex order|shortlex]] of the lexicographic order. In fact, with positional notation, a nonnegative integer is represented by a sequence of [[numerical digit]]s, and an integer is larger than another one if either it has more digits (ignoring leading zeroes) or the number of digits is the same and the first digit which differs is larger.

For [[real number]]s written in [[decimal notation]], a slightly different variant of the lexicographical order is used: the parts on the left of the decimal point are compared as before; if they are equal, the parts at the right of the decimal point are compared with the lexicographical order.

When negative numbers are also considered, one has to reverse the order for comparing negative numbers. This is not usually a problem for humans, but it may be for [[computer]]s (testing the sign takes some time). This is one of the reasons for adopting [[two's complement]] representation for representing [[signed integer]]s in computers.

Another example of a non-dictionary use of lexicographical ordering appears in the [[ISO 8601]] standard for dates, which expresses a date as YYYY-MM-DD. This formatting scheme has the advantage that the lexicographical order on sequences of characters that represent dates coincides with the [[chronological order]]: an earlier date is smaller in the lexicographical order than a later date. This date ordering makes [[sorting algorithm|computerized sorting]] of dates easier by avoiding the need for a separate sorting algorithm.

==Monoid of words==
The ''monoid of words'' over an alphabet {{math|''A''}} is the [[free monoid]] over {{math|''A''}}. That is, the elements of the monoid are the [[finite sequence]]s (words) of elements of {{math|''A''}} (including the empty sequence, of length 0), and the operation (multiplication) is the [[concatenation]] of words. A word {{math|''u''}} is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of another word {{math|''v''}} if there exists a word {{math|''w''}} such that {{math|1=''v'' = ''uw''}}.

With this terminology, the above definition of the lexicographical order becomes more concise: Given a [[partial order|partially]] or [[total order|totally ordered]] set {{math|''A''}}, and two words {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} over {{math|''A''}}, then one has {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}} for the lexicographical order, if 

* either {{math|''a''}} is a prefix of {{math|''b''}} 
* or there exists words {{math|''u''}}, {{math|''v''}}, {{math|''w''}} (possibly empty) and elements {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''A''}} such that
::{{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}
::{{math|1=''a'' = ''uxv''}}
::{{math|1=''b'' = ''uyw''}}

If &lt; is a total order on ''A'', then so is the lexicographic order on the words of {{math|''A''}}. However, in general this is not a [[well-order]], even if the alphabet {{math|''A''}} is well-ordered. For instance, if {{math|1=''A'' = {''a'', ''b''}{{void}}}}, the [[Formal language|language]] {{math|{''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' {{!}} ''n'' ≥ 0}{{void}}}} has no least element in the lexicographical order: {{math|... &lt; ''aab'' &lt; ''ab'' &lt; ''b''}}.

Since many applications require well orders, a variant of the lexicographical orders is often used. This well-order, sometimes called ''[[shortlex]]'' or ''quasi-lexicographical order'', consists in considering first the lengths of the words (if {{math|length(''a'') &lt; length(''b'')}}, then {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}), and, if the lengths are equal, using the lexicographical order. If the order on {{math|''A''}} is a well-order, the same is true for the shortlex order.&lt;ref name="BaaderNipkow1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Calude | first=Cristian | authorlink=Cristian S. Calude | title=Information and randomness.

==Cartesian products==
The lexicographical order defines an order on a [[Cartesian product]] of ordered sets, which is a total order when all these sets are themselves totally ordered. In fact, an element of a [[Cartesian product]] {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;× ... ×''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a sequence whose {{math|''i''}}th element belongs to {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for every {{math|''i''}}. As evaluating the lexicographical order of sequences compares only elements which have the same rank in the sequences, the lexicographical order extends to Cartesian products of ordered sets.

Specifically, given two [[partially ordered set]]s {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, the lexicographical order on the Cartesian product {{math|''A'' &amp;times; ''B''}} is defined as
:{{math|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''a''&amp;prime;,''b''&amp;prime;)}} if and only if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''a''&amp;prime;}} or {{math|1=(''a'' = ''a''&amp;prime; and ''b'' ≤ ''b''&amp;prime;)}}.

The result is a partial order. If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are each [[total order|totally ordered]], then the result is a total order as well. The lexicographical order of two totally ordered sets is thus a [[linear extension]] of their [[product order]].

One can define similarly the lexicographic order on the Cartesian product of an infinite family of ordered sets, if the family is indexed by the [[nonnegative integers]] or, more generally by a well-ordered set. This generalized lexicographical order is a total order, if each factor set is totally ordered.

Unlike the finite case, an infinite product of well-orders is not necessarily well-ordered by the lexicographical order. For instance, the set of [[countably infinite]] binary [[sequence]]s (by definition, the set of functions from [[non-negative integers]] to {{math|{0, 1}{{void}}}}, also known as the [[Cantor space]] {{math|{0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is not well-ordered; the subset of sequences that have precisely one {{math|1}} (i.e. {{math|{ 100000..., 010000..., 001000..., ... }{{void}}}}) does not have a least element under the lexicographical order induced by {{math|0 &lt; 1}}, because {{math|100000... &gt; 010000... &gt; 001000... &gt; ...}} is an [[infinite descending chain]].&lt;ref name="Harzheim"&gt;{{cite book|author=Egbert Harzheim|title=Ordered Sets|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-24222-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the infinite lexicographic product is not [[Noetherian relation|Noetherian]] either because {{math|011111... &lt; 101111... &lt; 110111 ... &lt; ...}} is an infinite ascending chain.

== Functions over a well-ordered set==
The functions from a [[well-ordered set]] {{math|''X''}} to a [[totally ordered set]] {{math|''Y''}} may be identified with sequences indexed by {{math|''X''}} of elements of {{math|''Y''}}. They can thus be ordered by the lexicographical order, and for two such functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}}, the lexicographical order is thus determined by their values for the smallest {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''f''(''x'') ≠ ''g''(''x'')}}.

If {{math|''Y''}} is also well-ordered and {{math|''X''}} is finite, then the resulting order is a well-order. As shown above, if {{math|''X''}} is infinite this is not the case.

==Finite subsets==
[[File:Orderings; 6 choose 3.svg|thumb|340px|Orderings of the 3-[[subset]]s of {1, ..., 6}, represented as sets of red squares, increasing sequences (in blue), or by their [[indicator function]]s, converted in [[decimal notation]] (in grey). The grey numbers are also the rank of the subsets in all subsets of {1, ..., 6}, numbered in colexicographical order, and starting from 0. The lexicographical (lex) and colexicographical (colex) orders are on the top and the corresponding reverse orders (rev) on the bottom&lt;br&gt;One passes from an order to its reverse order, either by reading bottom-up instead of up-bottom, or by exchanging red and white colors.]]

In [[combinatorics]], one has often to enumerate, and therefore to order the [[finite subset]]s of a given set {{math|''S''}}. For this, one usually chooses an order on {{math|''S''}}. Then, [[sorting]] a subset of {{math|''S''}} is equivalent to convert it into an [[increasing sequence]]. The lexicographic order on the resulting sequences induces thus an order on the subsets, which is also called the ''lexicographical order''.

In this context, one generally prefer to sort first the subsets by [[cardinality]], such as in the [[shortlex order]]. Therefore, in the following, we will consider only orders on subsets of fixed cardinal.

For example, using the natural order of the integers, the lexicographical ordering on the subsets of three elements of {{math|1=''S'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}{{void}}}} is

:{{math|123 &lt; 124 &lt; 125 &lt; 126 &lt; 134 &lt; 135 &lt; 136 &lt; 145 &lt; 146 &lt; 156 &lt;}} 
::{{math|234 &lt; 235 &lt; 236 &lt; 245 &lt; 246 &lt; 256 &lt; 345 &lt; 346 &lt; 356 &lt; 456}}.

For ordering finite subsets of a given cardinality of the [[natural number]]s, the ''colexicographical'' order (see below) is often more convenient, because all [[initial segment]]s are finite, and thus the colexicographical order defines an [[order isomorphism]] between the natural numbers and the set of sets of {{math|''n''}} natural numbers. This is not the case for the lexicographical order, as, with the lexicographical order, we have, for example, {{math|12''n'' &lt; 134}} for every {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}}.

==Group orders of &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt;==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; be the [[free Abelian group]] of rank {{math|''n''}}, whose elements are sequences of {{math|''n''}} integers, and operation is the [[additive group|addition]]. A [[totally ordered group|group order]] on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total order]], which is compatible with addition, that is 
:&lt;math&gt;a &lt; b \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad a+c&lt;b+c.&lt;/math&gt;

The lexicographical ordering is a group order on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The lexicographical ordering may also be used to characterize all group orders on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbiano, L. (1985). Term orderings on the polynomial ring.

The lexicographic order on the image of this map induces a group order on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n.&lt;/math&gt; Robbiano's theorem is that every group order may be obtained in this way.

More precisely, given a group order on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n,&lt;/math&gt; there exist an integer {{math|''s'' ≤ ''n''}} and {{math|''s''}} linear forms with real coefficients, such that the induced map &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\Bbb R^s&lt;/math&gt;  has the following properties;

* &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is injective;
* the resulting isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; to the image of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an order isomorphism when the image is equipped with the lexicographical order on &lt;math&gt;\Bbb R^s.&lt;/math&gt;

==Colexicographic order==
[[File:Orderings; permutations 5-cycle.svg|thumb|340px|Orderings of the 24 permutations of {1,...,5} that are [[Cycles and fixed points|5-cycles]] (in blue). The [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion vectors]] (in red) of permutations in ''colex'' order are in ''revcolex'' order, and vice versa.]]

The '''colexicographic''' or '''colex order''' is a variant of the lexicographical order, which is obtained by reading finite sequences from the right to the left instead of reading them from the left to the right.  More precisely, while the lexicographical order between two sequences is defined by

:{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt;sup&gt;lex&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for the first {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} differ,
the colexicographical order is defined by

:{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt;sup&gt;colex&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for the last {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} differ

In general, the difference between the colexicographical order and the lexicographical order is not very significant. However, when considering increasing sequences, typically for coding subsets, the two orders differ significantly.

For example, for ordering the increasing sequences (or the sets) of two natural integers, the lexicographical order begins by

:{{math|12 &lt; 13 &lt; 14 &lt; 15 &lt; ... &lt; 23 &lt; 24 &lt; 25 &lt; ... &lt; 34 &lt; 35 &lt; ... &lt; 45 &lt; ...}}, 

and the colexicographic order begins by

:{{math|12 &lt; 13 &lt; 23 &lt; 14 &lt; 24 &lt; 34 &lt; 15 &lt; 25 &lt; 35 &lt; 45 &lt; ...}}.

The main property of the colexicographical order for increasing sequences of a given length is that every [[initial segment]] is finite. In other words, the colexicographical order for increasing sequences of a given length induces an [[order isomorphism]] with the natural numbers, and allows enumerating these sequences. This is frequently used in [[combinatorics]], for example in the proof of the [[Kruskal-Katona theorem]].

==Monomials==
When considering [[polynomial]]s, the order of the terms does not matter in general, as the addition is commutative. However, some [[algorithm]]s, such as [[polynomial long division]] require a specific order of the terms. Many of the main algorithms for [[multivariate polynomial]]s are related with [[Gröbner bases]], concept that requires the choice of a [[monomial order]], that is a [[total order]], which is compatible with the [[monoid]] structure of the [[monomials]]. Here "compatible" means that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b \implies ac &lt; bc&lt;/math&gt;, if the monoid operation is denoted multiplicatively. This compatibility implies that the product of a polynomial by a monomial does not change the order of the terms. For Gröbner bases, a further condition must be satisfied, namely that every non constant monomial is greater than the monomial {{math|1}}. However this condition is not needed for other related algorithms, such as the algorithms for the computation of the [[tangent cone#Definition in algebraic geometry|tangent cone]].

As Gröbner bases are defined for polynomials in a fixed number of variables, it is common to identify monomials (for example &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2^3 x_4 x_5^2&lt;/math&gt;) with their exponent vectors (here {{math|[1, 3, 0, 1, 2]}}). If {{math|''n''}} is the number of variables, every monomial order is thus the restriction to &lt;math&gt;\Bbb N^n&lt;/math&gt; of a monomial order of &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; (see above {{slink||Group orders of}} &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt;, for a classification).

One of these admissible orders is the lexicographical order. It is, historically, the first to have been used for defining Gröbner bases, and is sometimes called ''pure lexicographical order'' for distinguishing it from other orders that are also related to a lexicographical order.

Another one consists in comparing first the [[total degree]]s, and then resolving the conflicts by using the lexicographical order. This order is not widely used, as either the lexicographical order or the degree reverse lexicographical order have generally better properties.

The ''degree reverse lexicographical order'' consists also in comparing first the total degrees, and, in case of equality of the total degrees, using the reverse of the colexicographical order. That is, given two exponent vectors, one has 

:&lt;math&gt;[a_1, \ldots, a_n] &lt;[b_1, \ldots, b_n]&lt;/math&gt;

if either 

:&lt;math&gt;a_1+ \cdots+ a_n &lt; b_1+ \cdots+ b_n,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;a_1+ \cdots+ a_n= b_1+\cdots+ b_n \quad \text{and}\quad a_i&gt;b_i \text{ for the largest } i \text{ for which } a_i\neq b_i.&lt;/math&gt;

For this ordering, the monomials of degree one have the same order as the corresponding indeterminates (this would not be the case if the reverse lexicographical order would be used).  For comparing monomials in two variables of the same total degree, this order is the same as the lexicographic order. This is not the case with more variables. For example, for exponent vectors of monomials of degree two in three variables, one has for the degree reverse lexicographic order:

:&lt;math&gt;[0, 0, 2] &lt; [0, 1, 1] &lt; [1, 0, 1] &lt;[0, 2, 0] &lt; [1, 1, 0] &lt; [2, 0, 0]&lt;/math&gt;

For the lexicographical order, the same exponent vectors are ordered as

:&lt;math&gt;[0, 0, 2] &lt; [0, 1, 1] &lt; [0, 2, 0] &lt; [1, 0, 1] &lt; [1, 1, 0] &lt; [2, 0, 0].&lt;/math&gt;

A useful property of the degree reverse lexicographical order is that a [[homogeneous polynomial]] is a multiple of the least indeterminate if and only if its leading monomial (its greater monomial) is a multiple of this least indeterminate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19663">In [[physics]], '''Liouville field theory''' (or simply '''Liouville theory''') is a [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] whose classical [[equation of motion]] is a generalization of [[Liouville's equation]].

Liouville theory is defined for all [[complex number|complex values]] of the central charge &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of its [[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro symmetry algebra]], but it is [[Unitary operator|unitary]] only if 
:&lt;math&gt;c\in(1,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;,

and its [[classical limit]] is 
:&lt;math&gt; c\to +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Although it is an interacting theory with a [[continuous spectrum]], Liouville theory has been [[Equation solving|solved]]. In particular, its three-point function on the [[sphere]] has been determined analytically. 

==Parameters==

Liouville theory has a background [[electric charge|charge]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and [[coupling constant]] &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; that are related to the central charge &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; c = 1 + 6 Q^2 \quad , \quad Q = b+\frac{1}{b} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

States and [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s are characterized by a momentum &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that is related to the [[conformal dimension]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta = \alpha(Q-\alpha) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The coupling constant and the [[momentum]] are the natural parameters for writing [[correlation function]]s in Liouville theory. However, the [[duality (mathematics)|duality]]
:&lt;math&gt; b \to \frac{1}{b}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
leaves the central charge [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], and therefore also leaves the correlation functions invariant. The conformal dimension is invariant under the [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] [[Transformation (function)|transformation]]
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \to Q- \alpha\ , &lt;/math&gt;
and the correlation functions are [[Covariant transformation|covariant]] under [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].

==Spectrum and correlation functions==

===Spectrum===

The [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of Liouville theory is a diagonal combination of [[Verma module]]s of the [[Virasoro algebra]],
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S} = \int_{\frac{c-1}{24} + \mathbb{R}_+} d\Delta\ \mathcal{V}_\Delta \otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_\Delta\ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}_\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathcal{V}}_\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denote the same Verma module, viewed as a representation of the left- and right-moving Virasoro algebra respectively. In terms of [[momentum]]s, 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \in \frac{c-1}{24} + \mathbb{R}_+ &lt;/math&gt; 
corresponds to 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \frac{Q}{2}+i\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Liouville theory is unitary if and only if &lt;math&gt;c\in (1,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. The spectrum of Liouville theory does not include a [[vacuum state]]. A vacuum state can be defined, but it does not contribute to [[operator product expansion]]s.

===Fields and reflection relation===

In Liouville theory, primary fields are usually [[Parametrization|parametrized]] by their momentum rather than their [[conformal dimension]], and denoted &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha(z)&lt;/math&gt;.
Both fields &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{Q-\alpha}(z)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the primary state of the [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}_\Delta \otimes \bar{\mathcal{V}}_\Delta &lt;/math&gt;, and are related by the reflection relation
:&lt;math&gt; V_\alpha(z) = R(\alpha) V_{Q-\alpha}(z)\ , &lt;/math&gt;
where the reflection coefficient is&lt;ref name="rib14"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1406.4290|last1=Ribault|first1=Sylvain|title=Conformal field theory on the plane|class=hep-th|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R(\alpha) =  \pm \lambda^{Q-2\alpha} \frac{\Gamma(b(2\alpha-Q))\Gamma(\frac{1}{b}(2\alpha-Q))}{\Gamma(b(Q-2\alpha))\Gamma(\frac{1}{b}(Q-2\alpha))}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

(The sign is &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;c\in(-\infty, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, and the normalization parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary.)

&lt;/math&gt;
where the special function &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_b&lt;/math&gt; is a kind of [[multiple gamma function]].

For &lt;math&gt;c\in (-\infty, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, the three-point structure constant is&lt;ref name="rib14" /&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;
where

\hat{\Upsilon}_b(x) = \frac{1}{\Upsilon_{ib}(-ix+ib)}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-point functions on the sphere can be expressed in terms of three-point structure constants, and [[Virasoro conformal block|conformal blocks]]. An &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-point function may have several different expressions: that they agree is equivalent to [[crossing symmetry]] of the four-point function, which has been checked numerically&lt;ref name="zz"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "rs15"/&gt; and proved analytically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/0303150|last1=Teschner|first1=J|title=A lecture on the Liouville vertex operators|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=19|issue=2|pages=436–458|year=2003|doi=10.1142/S0217751X04020567|bibcode=2004IJMPA..19S.436T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liouville theory exists not only on the sphere, but also on any [[Riemann surface]] of genus &lt;math&gt;g\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Technically, this is equivalent to the [[modular invariance]] of the [[torus]] one-point function. Due to remarkable identities of conformal blocks and structure constants, this modular invariance property can be deduced from crossing symmetry of the sphere four-point function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0911.4296|last1=Hadasz|first1=Leszek|title=Modular bootstrap in Liouville field theory|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=685|issue=1|pages=79–85|last2=Jaskolski|first2=Zbigniew|last3=Suchanek|first3=Paulina|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.01.036|bibcode=2010PhLB..685...79H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "rs15"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1503.02067|last1=Ribault|first1=Sylvain|title=Liouville theory with a central charge less than one|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2015|issue=8|pages=109|last2=Santachiara|first2=Raoul|year=2015|doi=10.1007/JHEP08(2015)109|bibcode=2015JHEP...08..109R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness of Liouville theory===

Using the [[conformal bootstrap]] approach, Liouville theory can be shown to be the unique conformal field theory such that&lt;ref name="rib14"/&gt;
* the spectrum is a continuum, with no multiplicities higher than one,
* the correlation functions depend analytically on &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and the momentums,
* degenerate fields exist.

==Lagrangian formulation==

===Action and equation of motion===

Liouville theory is defined by the local [[action (physics)|action]]
:&lt;math&gt;
S[\phi] = \frac{1}{4\pi } \int d^2x \sqrt{g} (g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial _{\nu} \phi + Q R \phi + \lambda' e^{2b\phi })\ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] of the [[two-dimensional space]] on which the theory is formulated, &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci scalar]] of that space, and the field &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is called the Liouville field. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt;, which is sometimes called the cosmological constant, is related to the parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; that appears in correlation functions by 
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda' =4 \frac{\Gamma(1-b^2)}{\Gamma(b^2)} \lambda^b &lt;/math&gt;.

The equation of motion associated to this action is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \phi(x) = \frac {1}{2} Q R(x) + \lambda' b e^{2b\phi (x)} \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \Delta = |g|^{-1/2} \partial _{\mu} (|g|^{1/2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_{\nu} ) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]]. If &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean metric]], this equation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial  x_1^2} + \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_2^2} \right) \phi (x_1,x_2) = \lambda' b e^{2b \phi (x_1,x_2)} \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to [[Liouville's equation]].

===Conformal symmetry===

Using a [[Complex coordinate space|complex coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Euclidean metric]] 
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu= dzd\bar{z} &lt;/math&gt;,
the [[energy-momentum tensor]]'s components obey
:&lt;math&gt;
T_{z\bar{z}} = T_{\bar{z}z} = 0 \quad , \quad \partial_{\bar{z}} T_{zz} = 0 \quad ,\quad \partial_z T_{\bar{z}\bar{z}}=0\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The non-vanishing components are
:&lt;math&gt;
T=T_{zz} = (\partial_z \phi)^2 + Q \partial_z^2 \phi \quad ,\quad \bar T = T_{\bar z \bar z} = (\partial_{\bar z}\phi)^2 + Q \partial_{\bar z}^2 \phi \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Each one of these two components generates a [[Virasoro algebra]] with the central charge 
:&lt;math&gt;c = 1+ 6Q^2&lt;/math&gt;. 

For both of these Virasoro algebras, a field &lt;math&gt; e^{2\alpha \phi} &lt;/math&gt; is a primary field with the conformal dimension 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \alpha(Q-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

For the theory to have [[Conformal symmetry|conformal invariance]], the field &lt;math&gt; e^{2b\phi}&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the action must be [[marginal operator|marginal]], i.e. have the conformal dimension 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(b) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This leads to the relation 

:&lt;math&gt;Q = b+\frac{1}{b} &lt;/math&gt; 
between the background charge and the coupling constant. If this relation is obeyed, then &lt;math&gt; e^{2b\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is actually exactly marginal, and the theory is conformally invariant.

===Path integral===

The path integral representation of an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-point correlation function of primary fields is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle\prod_{i=1}^N V_{\alpha_i}(z_i)\right\rangle = \int D\phi\ e^{-S[\phi]} 
\prod_{i=1}^N e^{2\alpha_i\phi(z_i)}\ .
&lt;/math&gt; 
It has been difficult to define and to compute this path integral. In the path integral representation, it is not obvious that Liouville theory has exact [[conformal invariance]], and it is not manifest that correlation functions are invariant under &lt;math&gt; b\to b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and obey the reflection relation. Nevertheless, the path integral representation can be used for computing the [[Residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s of correlation functions at some of their [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] as [[Dotsenko-Fateev integral]]s (i.e. Coulomb gas integrals), and this is how the DOZZ formula was first guessed in the 1990s. It is only in the 2010s that a rigorous probabilistic construction of the path integral was found, which led to a proof of the DOZZ formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1707.08785|last1=Kupiainen|first1=Antti|title=Integrability of Liouville theory: Proof of the DOZZ Formula|last2=Rhodes|first2=Rémi|last3=Vargas|first3=Vincent|class=math.PR|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other conformal field theories==

===Some limits of Liouville theory===

When the central charge and conformal dimensions are sent to the relevant discrete values, correlation functions of Liouville theory reduce to correlation functions of diagonal (A-series) Virasoro [[minimal models]].&lt;ref name="rib14" /&gt;

On the other hand, when the central charge is sent to one while conformal dimensions stay continuous, Liouville theory tends to Runkel-Watts theory, a nontrivial conformal field theory (CFT) with a continuous spectrum whose three-point function is not analytic as a function of the momentums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/0306026|last1=Schomerus|first1=Volker|title=Rolling Tachyons from Liouville theory|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2003|issue=11|pages=043|year=2003|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2003/11/043|bibcode=2003JHEP...11..043S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalizations of Runkel-Watts theory are obtained from Liouville theory by taking limits of the type &lt;math&gt; b^2\notin \mathbb{R}, b^2 \to \mathbb{Q}_{&lt;0} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="rs15" /&gt; So, for &lt;math&gt; b^2 \in\mathbb{Q}_{&lt;0} &lt;/math&gt;, two distinct CFTs with the same spectrum are known: Liouville theory, whose three-point function is analytic, and another CFT with a non-analytic three-point function.

===WZW models===

Liouville theory can be obtained from the &lt;math&gt; SL_2(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt; [[Wess–Zumino–Witten model]] by a quantum [[Drinfeld–Sokolov–Wilson equation|Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction]]. Moreover, correlation functions of the &lt;math&gt;H_3^+&lt;/math&gt; model (the Euclidean version of the &lt;math&gt; SL_2(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt; WZW model) can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of Liouville theory.&lt;ref name="rt05"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/0502048|last1=Ribault|first1=Sylvain|title=H(3)+ correlators from Liouville theory|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2005|issue=6|pages=014|last2=Teschner|first2=Joerg|year=2005|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2005/06/014|bibcode=2005JHEP...06..014R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0706.1030|last1=Hikida|first1=Yasuaki|title=H^+_3 WZNW model from Liouville field theory|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2007|issue=10|pages=064|last2=Schomerus|first2=Volker|year=2007|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2007/10/064|bibcode=2007JHEP...10..064H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of correlation functions of the 2d black hole &lt;math&gt; SL_2/U_1 &lt;/math&gt; coset model.&lt;ref name="rt05"/&gt; Moreover, there exist theories that continuously interpolate between Liouville theory and the &lt;math&gt;H_3^+&lt;/math&gt; model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0803.2099|last1=Ribault|first1=Sylvain|title=A family of solvable non-rational conformal field theories|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2008|issue=5|pages=073|year=2008|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2008/05/073|bibcode=2008JHEP...05..073R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conformal Toda theory===

Liouville theory is the simplest example of a [[Toda field theory]], associated to the &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; [[Cartan matrix]]. More general conformal Toda theories can be viewed as generalizations of Liouville theory, whose Lagrangians involve several bosons rather than one boson &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and whose symmetry algebras are [[W-algebra]]s rather than the Virasoro algebra.

===Supersymmetric Liouville theory===

Liouville theory admits two different [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extensions called &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}=1&lt;/math&gt; supersymmetric Liouville theory and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}=2&lt;/math&gt; supersymmetric Liouville theory. 
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1142/S0217751X04019500|arxiv=hep-th/0402009|title=Liouville Field Theory: A Decade After the Revolution|date=2004|last1=Nakayama|first1=Yu|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=19|issue=17n18|pages=2771–2930|bibcode = 2004IJMPA..19.2771N |citeseerx=10.1.1.266.6964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Liouville gravity===

In two dimensions, the [[Einstein equations]] reduce to [[Liouville's equation]], so Liouville theory provides a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] that is called '''Liouville gravity'''. It should not be confused&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grumiller | first1 = Daniel | authorlink1 = Daniel Grumiller | last2 = Kummer | first2 = Wolfgang | authorlink2 = Wolfgang Kummer | last3 = Vassilevich | first3 = Dmitri | authorlink3 = Dmitri Vassilevich | date = October 2002 | title = Dilaton Gravity in Two Dimensions | journal = Physics Reports | volume = 369 | issue = 4 | pages = 327&amp;ndash;430 | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(02)00267-3 |arxiv = hep-th/0204253 |bibcode = 2002PhR...369..327G | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/549532 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[CGHS model]] or [[Jackiw&amp;ndash;Teitelboim gravity]].

===String theory===

Liouville theory appears in the context of [[string theory]] when trying to formulate a non-critical version of the theory in the [[path integral formulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(81)90743-7|title=Quantum geometry of bosonic strings|date=1981|last1=Polyakov|first1=A.M.|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=103|issue=3|pages=207–210|bibcode = 1981PhLB..103..207P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the string theory context, if coupled to a free [[bosonic field]], Liouville field theory can be thought of as the theory describing string [[Excited state|excitation]]s in a two-dimensional space(time).

===Other applications===

Liouville theory is related to other subjects in physics and mathematics, such as three-dimensional [[general relativity]] in negatively [[curved space]]s, the [[Uniformization theorem|uniformization problem]] of [[Riemann surface]]s, and other problems in [[conformal map|conformal mapping]]. It is also related to [[instanton]] [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]]s in a certain four-dimensional [[Superconformal algebra|superconformal]] [[gauge theories]] by the [[AGT correspondence]].

==Historical notes==

===Naming confusion for &lt;math&gt;c\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;===

Liouville theory with &lt;math&gt;c\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; first appeared as a model of time-dependent string theory under the name '''timelike Liouville theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/0303221|last1=Strominger|first1=Andrew|title=Correlators in Timelike Bulk Liouville Theory|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.atmp/1112627637|journal=Adv.

It has also been called a '''generalized minimal model'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/0505063|last1=Zamolodchikov|first1=Al|title=On the Three-point Function in Minimal Liouville Gravity|journal=Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|volume=142|issue=2|pages=183–196|year=2005|doi=10.1007/s11232-005-0003-3|bibcode=2005TMP...142..183Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first called '''Liouville theory''' when it was found to actually exist, and to be spacelike rather than timelike.&lt;ref name = "rs15"/&gt; As of 2018, not one of these three names is universally accepted.

'''Substitutability''' is a principle in [[object-oriented programming]] stating that, in a [[computer program]], if S is a [[subtype]] of T, then objects of [[datatype|type]] T may be ''replaced'' with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be ''substituted'' with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).  More formally, the '''Liskov substitution principle''' ('''LSP''') is a particular definition of a [[subtyping]] relation, called '''(strong) behavioral subtyping''', that was initially introduced by [[Barbara Liskov]] in a 1987 conference [[keynote]] address titled ''Data abstraction and hierarchy''. It is a [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantic]] rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of [[data type|types]] in a hierarchy, [[Object (computer science)|object type]]s in particular. Barbara Liskov and [[Jeannette Wing]] described the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
&lt;!-- inline math as LaTeX has poor baseline alignment (better with MathJaX HTML/CSS rendering of LaTeX)     
:''Let &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a property provable about objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;q(y)&lt;/math&gt; should be provable for objects &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.''

 --&gt;
In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of [[Hoare logic]], which bears a certain resemblance to [[Bertrand Meyer]]'s [[design by contract]] in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]].

== Principle ==
Liskov's notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability for objects; that is, if ''S'' is a subtype of ''T'', then objects of type ''T'' in a program may be replaced with objects of type ''S'' without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (e.g. [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]).

Behavioural subtyping is a stronger notion than typical [[subtyping of functions]] defined in [[type theory]], which relies only on the [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariance]] of argument types and [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]] of the return type. Behavioural subtyping is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general: if ''q'' is the property "method for ''x'' [[halting problem|always terminates]]", then it is impossible for a program (e.g. a compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype ''S'' of ''T'', even if ''q'' does hold for ''T''. Nonetheless, the principle is useful in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.

Liskov's principle imposes some standard requirements on [[Type signature|signatures]] that have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages (usually at the level of classes rather than types; see [[Subtype#Subtyping schemes|nominal vs. structural subtyping]] for the distinction):

* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Contravariance]] of method arguments in the subtype.
* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Covariance]] of return types in the subtype.
* No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to the signature requirements, the subtype must meet a number of behavioural conditions. These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of [[design by contract]] methodology, leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]:

*[[Precondition]]s cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
*[[Postcondition]]s cannot be weakened in a subtype.
*[[Invariant (computer science)|Invariant]]s of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
* History constraint (the "history rule"). Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods ([[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]]). Because subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this constraint can be exemplified by defining a ''mutable point'' as a subtype of an ''immutable point''. This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the ''immutable point'', the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a ''mutable point'' in general. Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. Thus, one can derive ''a circle with fixed center but mutable radius'' from ''immutable point'' without violating LSP.

== Origins ==
The rules on pre- and postconditions are identical to those introduced by Bertrand Meyer in his 1988 book ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''. Both Meyer, and later Pierre America, who was the first to use the term ''behavioral subtyping'', gave [[proof-theoretic]] definitions of some behavioral subtyping notions, but their definitions did not take into account [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] that may occur in programming languages that support references or pointers. Taking aliasing into account was the major improvement made by Liskov and Wing (1994), and a key ingredient is the history constraint. Under the definitions of Meyer and America, a MutablePoint would be a behavioral subtype of ImmutablePoint, whereas LSP forbids this.

'''Macaulay brackets''' are a notation used to describe the [[ramp function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\} = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\ x, &amp; x \ge 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

A popular alternative transcription uses angle brackets, ''viz.'' &lt;math&gt;\langle x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/CAS/courses.d/Structures.d/IAST.Lect12.d/IAST.Lect12.pdf Lecture 12: Beam Deflections by Discontinuity Functions.] Introduction to Aerospace Structures. Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences, University of Colorado at Boulder &lt;/ref&gt; 
Another commonly used notation is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; for the [[positive number|positive]] part of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which avoids conflicts with &lt;math&gt;\{...\}&lt;/math&gt; for [[set notation]].

== In engineering ==
Macaulay's notation is commonly used in the static analysis of bending moments of a beam. This is useful because shear forces applied on a member render the [[shear and moment diagram]] discontinuous. Macaulay's notation also provides an easy way of integrating these discontinuous curves to give bending moments, angular deflection, and so on. For engineering purposes, angle brackets are often used to denote the use of [[Macaulay's method]].

:&lt;math&gt;\{x-a\}^n = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; x &lt; a \\ (x-a)^n, &amp; x \ge a. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; (n \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt;

The above example simply states that the function takes the value &lt;math&gt;(x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' values larger than ''a''. With this, all the forces acting on a beam can be added, with their respective points of action being the value of ''a''.

A particular case is the unit step function,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x-a\rangle^0 \equiv \{x-a\}^0 = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; x &lt; a \\ 1, &amp; x &gt; a. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18821">{{short description|Direction dependence of magnetization in a crystal}}
In [[physics]], a [[ferromagnetic]] material is said to have '''magnetocrystalline anisotropy''' if it takes more energy to [[magnetization|magnetize]] it in certain directions than in others.  These directions are usually related to the [[crystal structure|principal axes]] of its  [[crystal lattice]]. It is a special case of [[magnetic anisotropy]].

== Causes ==
The [[spin-orbit interaction]] is the primary source of magnetocrystalline [[anisotropy]]. It is basically the orbital motion of the electrons which couples with crystal electric field giving rise to the first order contribution to magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The second order arises due to the mutual interaction of the magnetic dipoles.

== Practical relevance ==
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy has a great influence on industrial uses of ferromagnetic materials.  Materials with high magnetic anisotropy usually have high [[coercivity]], that is, they are hard to demagnetize.  These are called "hard" ferromagnetic materials and are used to make [[permanent magnet]]s.  For example, the high anisotropy of [[rare-earth]] metals is mainly responsible for the strength of [[rare-earth magnet]]s.  During manufacture of magnets, a powerful magnetic field aligns the microcrystalline grains of the metal such that their "easy" axes of magnetization all point in the same direction, freezing a strong magnetic field into the material.

On the other hand, materials with low magnetic anisotropy usually have low coercivity, their magnetization is easy to change.  These are called "soft" ferromagnets and are used to make [[magnetic core]]s for [[transformer]]s and [[inductor]]s.  The small energy required to turn the direction of magnetization minimizes [[core losses]], energy dissipated in the transformer core when the alternating current changes direction.

==Microscopic origin==
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy arises mostly from [[spin–orbit coupling]].&lt;ref name=Cullity&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullity|Graham|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is weak compared to the [[exchange interaction]] and is difficult to compute from first principles, although some successful computations have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daalderop|Kelly|Schuurmans|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermodynamic theory==
The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is generally represented as an expansion in powers of the [[direction cosines]] of the magnetization. The magnetization vector can be written {{math|'''&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;''' {{=}} &lt;var&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;&amp;alpha;,&amp;beta;,&amp;gamma;&lt;/var&gt;)}}, where {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[saturation magnetization]]. Because of [[time reversal symmetry]], only even powers of the cosines are allowed.&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|Pitaevski|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonzero terms in the expansion depend on the [[crystal system]] (''e.g.'', [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]).&lt;ref name=Landau/&gt; The ''[[Degree of a polynomial|order]]'' of a term in the expansion is the sum of all the exponents of magnetization components, ''i.e.'', {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;alpha; &amp;beta;&lt;/var&gt;}} is second order.

[[File:Easy axes.jpg|largepx|framed|center|Examples of easy and hard directions: Although easy directions coincide with crystallographic axes of symmetry, it is important to note that there is no way of predicting easy directions from crystal structure alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullity|first=Bernard Dennis|title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials|date=1972|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Uniaxial anisotropy===
[[File:Uniaxial Anisotropy.jpg|thumbnail|right|Uniaxial anisotropy energy plotted for 2D case. The magnetization direction is constrained to vary on a circle and the energy takes different values with the minima indicated by the vectors in red.]]
More than one kind of crystal system has a single axis of high symmetry (threefold, fourfold or sixfold). The anisotropy of such crystals is called ''uniaxial anisotropy''. If the {{math|&lt;var&gt;z&lt;/var&gt;}} axis is taken to be the main symmetry axis of the crystal, the lowest order term in the energy is&lt;ref&gt;An arbitrary constant term is ignored.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E/V = K_1 \left(\alpha^2+\beta^2\right) = K_1\left(1-\gamma^2\right). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The lowest-order term in the energy can be written in more than one way because, by definition, {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio {{math| &lt;var&gt;E/V&lt;/var&gt;}} is an [[energy density]] (energy per unit volume). This can also be represented in [[spherical polar coordinates]] with {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} cos &lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt; sin &lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} sin &lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;  sin &lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}}, and {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} cos  &lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E/V = K_1 \sin^2\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, often represented as {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has units of [[energy density]] and depends on composition and temperature.

The [[minima]] in this energy with respect to {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}} satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta} = 0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial \theta^2} &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
If {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0}},
the directions of lowest energy are the {{math| &amp;plusmn; &lt;var&gt;z&lt;/var&gt;}} directions. The {{math| &lt;var&gt;z&lt;/var&gt;}} axis is called the ''easy axis''. If {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0}}, there is an ''easy plane'' perpendicular to the symmetry axis (the [[basal plane]] of the crystal).

Many models of magnetization represent the anisotropy as uniaxial and ignore higher order terms. However, if {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0}}, the lowest energy term does not determine the direction of the easy axes within the basal plane. For this, higher-order terms are needed, and these depend on the crystal system ([[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]], [[tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] or [[rhombohedral crystal system|rhombohedral]]).&lt;ref name=Landau/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Hexagonal system====
[[File:EasyCone.png|thumb|A representation of an easy cone. All the minimum-energy directions (such as the arrow shown) lie on this cone.]]
In a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal system]] the {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} axis is an axis of sixfold rotation symmetry. The energy density is, to fourth 
order,&lt;ref name=BogdanovDragunov&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanov|Dragunov|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E/V = K_1 \cos^2\theta + K_2 \sin^4\theta + K_3\sin^6\theta \cos 6\phi, &lt;/math&gt;

The uniaxial anisotropy is mainly determined by the first two terms. Depending on the values {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, there are four different kinds of anisotropy (isotropic, easy axis, easy plane and easy cone):&lt;ref name=Cullity7-7&gt;{{harvnb|Cullity|Graham|2005|p=7-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}: the ferromagnet is [[isotropic]].
* {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0}} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; −&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}: the {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} axis is an easy axis.
* {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0}} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; −&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}: the basal plane is an easy plane.
* {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0}} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; −&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/2}}: the basal plane is an easy plane.
* {{math| −2&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0}}: the ferromagnet has an ''easy cone'' (see figure to right).

The basal plane anisotropy is determined by the third term, which is sixth-order. The easy directions are projected onto three axes in the basal plane.

Below are some room-temperature anisotropy constants for hexagonal ferromagnets. Since all the values of {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are positive, these materials have an easy axis.

Higher order constants, in particular conditions, may lead to first order magnetization processes [[FOMP]].

====Tetragonal and rhombohedral systems====
The energy density for a tetragonal crystal is&lt;ref name=Landau/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E/V = K_1 \sin^2\theta + K_2 \sin^4\theta + K_3\sin^4\theta \sin 2\phi &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} term, the one that determines the basal plane anisotropy, is fourth order (same as the {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} term). The definition of {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} may vary by a constant multiple between publications.

The energy density for a rhombohedral crystal is&lt;ref name=Landau/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E/V = K_1 \sin^2\theta + K_2 \sin^4\theta + K_3\cos\theta\sin^3\theta \cos 3\phi &lt;/math&gt;.

===Cubic anisotropy===

In a [[cubic crystal system|cubic crystal]] the lowest order terms in the energy are&lt;ref name=Cullity/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landau/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E/V = K_1 \left(\alpha^2\beta^2+\beta^2\gamma^2+\gamma^2\alpha^2\right) + K_2\alpha^2\beta^2\gamma^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If the second term can be neglected, the easy axes are the ⟨100⟩ axes (''i.e.'', the {{math| &amp;plusmn; &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math| &amp;plusmn; &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;}}, and {{math| &amp;plusmn; &lt;var&gt;z&lt;/var&gt;}}, directions) for {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0}}  and the ⟨111⟩ directions for {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0}} (see images on right).

If {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not assumed to be zero, the easy axes depend on both {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These are given in the table below, along with ''hard axes'' (directions of greatest energy) and ''intermediate axes'' ([[saddle point]]s) in the energy). In energy surfaces like those on the right, the easy axes are analogous to valleys, the hard axes to peaks and the intermediate axes to mountain passes.

Below are some room-temperature anisotropy constants for cubic ferromagnets. The compounds involving {{Iron|2}}{{Oxygen|3}} are [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]], an important class of ferromagnets. In general the anisotropy parameters for cubic ferromagnets are higher than those for uniaxial ferromagnets. This is consistent with the fact that the lowest order term in the expression for cubic anisotropy is fourth order, while that for uniaxial anisotropy is second order.

==Temperature dependence of anisotropy==

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters have a strong dependence on temperature. They generally decrease rapidly as the temperature approaches the [[Curie temperature]], so the crystal becomes effectively isotropic.&lt;ref name=Cullity/&gt; Some materials also have an ''isotropic point'' at which {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}. [[Magnetite]] ({{Iron|3}}{{Oxygen|4}}), a mineral of great importance to [[rock magnetism]] and [[paleomagnetism]], has an isotropic point at 130 [[kelvin]].&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|Özdemir|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetite also has a [[phase transition]] at which the crystal symmetry changes from cubic (above) to [[monoclinic]] or possibly [[triclinic]] below. The temperature at which this occurs, called the Verwey temperature, is 120 Kelvin.&lt;ref name=Dunlop/&gt;

==Magnetostriction==

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters are generally defined for ferromagnets that are constrained to remain undeformed as the direction of magnetization changes. However, coupling between the magnetization and the lattice does result in deformation, an effect called [[magnetostriction]]. To keep the lattice from deforming, a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] must be applied. If the crystal is not under stress, magnetostriction alters the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy. If a ferromagnet is [[single domain (magnetic)|single domain]] (uniformly magnetized), the effect is to change the magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi&gt;{{harvnb|Chikazumi|1997|loc=chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the correction is generally not large. In hexagonal crystals, there is no change in {{math| &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ye&gt;{{harvnb|Ye|Newell|Merrill|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cubic crystals, there is a small change, as in the table below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18518">'''Model-driven architecture''' ('''MDA''') is a [[software design]] approach for the development of [[software system]]s. It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as [[model (abstract)|model]]s. Model-driven architecture is a kind of [[domain engineering]], and supports [[model-driven engineering]] of software systems. It was launched by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) in 2001.&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;[http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2001/2001-03-08a.htm "OMG pursues new strategic direction to build on success of past efforts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924103531/http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2001/2001-03-08a.htm |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Then, given a [[platform model]] corresponding to [[CORBA]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], the Web, etc., the PIM is translated to one or more [[platform-specific model]]s (PSMs) that computers can run. This requires mappings and transformations and should be modeled too.

The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to [[Request for Proposal|Requests for Proposals]] (RFPs). Implementations come from private companies or open source groups.

=== Related standards ===
The MDA model is related to multiple standards, including the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), the [[Meta-Object Facility]] (MOF), [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI), [[Enterprise Distributed Object Computing]] (EDOC), the [[Software Process Engineering Metamodel]] (SPEM), and the [[Common Warehouse Metamodel]] (CWM). Note that the term “architecture” in Model-driven architecture does not refer to the architecture of the system being modeled, but rather to the architecture of the various standards and model forms that serve as the technology basis for MDA.

[[Executable UML]] was the UML profile used when MDA was born. Now, the OMG is promoting [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|fUML]], instead. (The action language for fUML is ALF.)

=== Trademark ===
The [[Object Management Group]] holds registered trademarks on the term Model Driven Architecture and its acronym MDA, as well as trademarks for terms such as: Model Based Application Development, Model Driven Application Development, Model Based Application Development, Model Based Programming, Model Driven Systems, and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omg.org/legal/tm_list.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model-driven architecture topics ==
=== MDA approach ===
OMG focuses Model-driven architecture on forward engineering, i.e. producing code from abstract, human-elaborated modelling diagrams (e.g. class diagrams){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. OMG's ADTF (Analysis and Design Task Force) group leads this effort. With some humour, the group chose ADM (MDA backwards) to name the study of reverse engineering. ADM decodes to Architecture-Driven Modernization. The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems.&lt;ref&gt;adm website http://adm.omg.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.).

As the concepts and technologies used to realize designs and the concepts and technologies used to realize architectures have changed at their own pace, decoupling them allows system developers to choose from the best and most fitting in both domains. The design addresses the functional ([[use case]]) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized. MDA envisages that the platform independent model (PIM), which represents a conceptual design realizing the functional requirements, will survive changes in realization technologies and [[software architecture]]s.

Of particular importance to model-driven architecture is the notion of [[model transformation]]. A specific standard language for model transformation has been defined by [[Object Management Group|OMG]] called [[QVT]].

=== MDA tools ===
The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to [[Request for Proposal|Requests for Proposals]] (RFPs). The OMG documents the overall process in a document called the MDA Guide.

Basically, an MDA tool is a tool used to develop, interpret, compare, align, measure, verify, transform, etc. models or metamodels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|author=Bézivin, J, Gérard, S, Muller, P-A, and Rioux, L|title=MDA components: Challenges and Opportunities|version=In: Metamodelling for MDA|year=2003|url=http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/www/papers/MDAComponents-ChallengesOpportunities.V1.3.PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206191031/http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/www/papers/MDAComponents-ChallengesOpportunities.V1.3.PDF|archivedate=2006-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following section "model" is interpreted as meaning any kind of model (e.g. a UML model) or metamodel (e.g. the CWM metamodel). In any MDA approach we have essentially two kinds of models: ''initial models'' are created manually by human agents while ''derived models'' are created automatically by programs. For example, an analyst may create a UML initial model from its observation of some loose business situation while a Java model may be automatically derived from this UML model by a [[Model transformation]] operation.

An MDA tool may be a tool used to check models for completeness, inconsistencies, or error and warning conditions. Also used to calculate metrics for the model.&lt;ref name="MonperrusJézéquel2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monperrus|first1=Martin|last2=Jézéquel|first2=Jean-Marc|last3=Champeau|first3=Joël|last4=Hoeltzener|first4=Brigitte|title=A Model-Driven Measurement Approach|year=2008|pages=505–519|issn=0302-9743|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87875-9_36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tools perform more than one of the functions listed above. For example, some creation tools may also have transformation and test capabilities. There are other tools that are solely for creation, solely for graphical presentation, solely for transformation, etc.

Implementations of the OMG specifications come from private companies or [[open source]] groups. One important source of implementations for OMG specifications is the [[Eclipse Foundation]] (EF). Many implementations of OMG modeling standards may be found in the [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF) or [[Graphical Modeling Framework]] (GMF), the Eclipse foundation is also developing other tools of various profiles as GMT. Eclipse's compliance to OMG specifications is often not strict. This is true for example for OMG's EMOF standard, which Eclipse approximates with its ECORE implementation. More examples may be found in the M2M project implementing the QVT standard or in the M2T project implementing the MOF2Text standard.

One should be careful not to confuse the ''List of MDA Tools'' and the [[List of UML tools]], the former being much broader. This distinction can be made more general by distinguishing 'variable metamodel tools' and 'fixed metamodel tools'. A UML CASE tool is typically a 'fixed metamodel tool' since it has been hard-wired to work only with a given version of the UML metamodel (e.g. UML 2.1). On the contrary, other tools have internal generic capabilities allowing them to adapt to arbitrary metamodels or to a particular kind of metamodels.

Usually MDA tools focus rudimentary architecture specification, although in some cases the tools are architecture-independent (or platform independent).

Simple examples of architecture specifications include:
* Selecting one of a number of supported [[reference architecture]]s like [[Java EE]] or [[Microsoft .NET]],
* Specifying the architecture at a finer level including the choice of presentation layer technology, business logic layer technology, persistence technology and persistence mapping technology (e.g. object-relational mapper).
* Metadata: information about data.

=== MDA concerns ===
Some key concepts that underpin the MDA approach (launched in 2001) were first elucidated by the [[Shlaer-Mellor]] method during the late 1980s. Indeed, a key absent technical standard of the MDA approach (that of an action language syntax for [[Executable UML]]) has been bridged by some vendors by adapting the original Shlaer-Mellor Action Language (modified for UML){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. However, during this period the MDA approach has not gained mainstream industry acceptance; with the [[Gartner Group]] still identifying MDA as an "on the rise" technology in its 2006 "[[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]]",&lt;ref name=gartnermda&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=494180&amp;subref=simplesearch "Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2006"] $495.00&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forrester Research]] declaring MDA to be "D.O.A." in 2006.&lt;ref name=forrestermda&gt;[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,39156,00.html "MDA Is DOA, Partly Thanks To SOA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013004355/http://forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,39156,00.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential concerns that have been raised with the OMG MDA approach include:
* Incomplete Standards: The MDA approach is underpinned by a variety of technical standards, some of which are yet to be specified (e.g. an action semantic language for [[Executable UML|xtUML]]), or are yet to be implemented in a standard manner (e.g. a [[QVT]] transformation engine or a [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] with a virtual execution environment).&lt;ref name=mdanoaslsyntaxone&gt;[http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2003_01/column1 "UML - Unified or Universal Modeling Language? UML2, OCL, MOF, EDOC - The Emperor Has Too Many Clothes"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdanoaslsyntaxtwo&gt;[http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=MDA_Haywood "MDA: Nice Idea. Shame about the..."]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vendor Lock-in: Although MDA was conceived as an approach for achieving (technical) platform independence, current MDA vendors have been reluctant to engineer their MDA toolsets to be interoperable. Such an outcome could result in vendor lock-in for those pursuing an MDA approach.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* Idealistic: MDA is conceived as a forward engineering approach in which models that incorporate Action Language programming are transformed into implementation artifacts (e.g. executable code, database schema) in one direction via a fully or partially automated "generation" step. This aligns with OMG's vision that MDA should allow modelling of a problem domain's full complexity in UML (and related standards) with subsequent transformation to a complete (executable) application.&lt;ref name=eclipsemda&gt;[http://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/jfs/2006/folien/A5_Schoenhage_Compuware.pdf "Bringing MDA to Eclipse, using a pragmatic approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach does, however, imply that changes to implementation artifacts (e.g. database schema tuning) are not supported . This constitutes a problem in situations where such post-transformation "adapting" of implementation artifacts is seen to be necessary. Evidence that the full MDA approach may be too idealistic for some real world deployments has been seen in the rise of so-called "pragmatic MDA".&lt;ref name=forresterresponse&gt;[http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/04-06-COL-MDA-ResponseToForrester-Frankel.pdf#search=%22%22pragmatic%20MDA%22%22 "A Response to Forrester"]&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatic MDA blends the literal standards from OMG's MDA with more traditional model driven mechanisms such as [[round-trip engineering]] that provides support for adapting implementation artifacts.
* Specialised Skillsets: Practitioners of MDA based software engineering are (as with other toolsets) required to have a high level of expertise in their field. Current expert MDA practitioners (often referred to as Modeller/Architects) are scarce relative to the availability of traditional developers.&lt;ref name=amblermda&gt;[http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/readyForMDA.htm "Are You Ready For the MDA?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* OMG Track Record: The OMG consortium who sponsor the MDA approach (and own the MDA trademark) also introduced and sponsored the CORBA standard which itself failed to materialise as a widely utilised standard.&lt;ref name=corba&gt;[http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=396 "The Rise and Fall of CORBA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202033636/http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=396 |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertain Value Proposition (UVP): As discussed, the vision of MDA allows for the specification of a system as an abstract model, which may be realized as a concrete implementation (program) for a particular computing platform (e.g. .NET). Thus an application that has been successfully developed via a pure MDA approach could theoretically be ported to a newer release .NET platform (or even a Java platform) in a deterministic manner &amp;ndash; although significant questions remain as to real-world practicalities during translation (such as user interface implementation). Whether this capability represents a significant value proposition remains a question for particular adopters. Regardless, adopters of MDA who are seeking value via an "alternative to programming" should be very careful when assessing this approach. The complexity of any given problem domain will always remain, and the programming of business logic needs to be undertaken in MDA as with any other approach. The difference with MDA is that the programming language used (e.g. xtUML) is more abstract (than, say, Java or C#) and exists interwoven with traditional UML artifacts (e.g. class diagrams). Whether programming in a language that is more abstract than mainstream [[Third-generation programming language|3GL]] languages will result in systems of better quality, cheaper cost or faster delivery, is a question that has yet to be adequately answered.
* MDA was recognized as a possible way to bring various independently developed standardized solutions together. For the simulation community, it was recommended as a business and industry based alternative to yet another US DoD mandated standard.&lt;ref name=mdasim&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1011/1011.6671.pdf "Avoiding Another Green Elephant"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
Among the various conferences on this topic we may mention [http://www.ecmda-fa.org/ ECMDA], the European Conference on MDA and also [[MoDELS]], former firmed as &lt;&lt;UML&gt;&gt; conference series (till 2004), the [http://mdaforum.soluta.net Italian Forum on MDA] in collaboration with the [[Object Management Group|OMG]]. There are also several conferences and workshops (at [[OOPSLA]], [[ECOOP]] mainly) focusing on more specific aspects of MDA like model transformation, model composition, and generation.

== Code generation controversy ==
&lt;!-- MDA isn't just about UML - this section needs to be rewritten --&gt;
[[Automatic programming|Code generation]] means that the user abstractly models solutions, which are connoted by some model data, and then an automated tool derives from the models parts or all of the [[source code]] for the software system. In some tools, the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code [[Template (programming)|template]] where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process.

An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams just lack the detail which is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source. Some developers even claim that "the Code ''is'' the design".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W. Reeves&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleading-edge.com/ Bleading-Edge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">In [[mathematical logic]], '''monadic second order logic (MSO)''' is the fragment of [[Second-order logic|second-order logic]] where the second-order quantification is limited to quantification over sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bruno|last1=Courcelle|author1-link=Bruno Courcelle|first2=Joost|last2=Engelfriet| title=Graph Structure and Monadic Second-Order Logic: A Language-Theoretic Approach| publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2012-01-01|isbn=978-0521898331|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2414243|accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly important in the [[logic of graphs]], because of [[Courcelle's theorem]], which provides algorithms for evaluating monadic second-order formulas over certain types of graphs.

Second-order logic allows quantification over [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].  However, MSO is the [[Fragment (logic)|fragment]] in which second-order quantification is limited to monadic predicates (predicates having a single argument).  This is often described as quantification over "sets" because monadic predicates are equivalent in expressive power to sets (the set of elements for which the predicate is true).

Existential monadic second-order logic (EMSO) is the fragment of MSO in which all quantifiers over sets must be [[existential quantifier]]s, outside of any other part of the formula. The first-order quantifiers are not restricted. By analogy to [[Fagin's theorem]], according to which existential (non-monadic) second-order logic captures precisely the [[descriptive complexity]] of the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], the class of problems that may be expressed in existential monadic second-order logic has been called monadic NP. The restriction to monadic logic makes it possible to prove separations in this logic that remain unproven for non-monadic second-order logic. For instance, in the [[logic of graphs]], testing whether a graph is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|disconnected]] belongs to monadic NP, as the test can be represented by a formula that describes the existence of a proper subset of vertices with no edges connecting them to the rest of the graph; however, the complementary problem, testing whether a graph is connected, does not belong to monadic NP.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The monadic second order theory of the infinite complete [[binary tree]], called S2S, is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]].  As a consequence of this result, the following theories are decidable:
* The monadic second-order theory of trees.
* The monadic second order theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; under successor (S1S).
* wS2S and wS1S, which restrict quantification to finite subsets (weak monadic second order logic).  Note that for binary numbers (represented by subsets), addition is definable even in wS1S.

For each of these theories (S2S, S1S, wS2S, wS1S), the complexity of the decision problem is [[nonelementary problem|nonelementary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14109">'''NAR 2''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] '''Na'''stavni '''R'''ačunar 2, [[English language|en.]] ''Educational Computer'' 2) is a theoretical model of a 32-[[bit]] word computer created by Faculty of Mathematics of [[University of Belgrade]] professor [[Nedeljko Parezanović]] as an enhancement to its predecessor, [[NAR 1]].  It was used for [[Assembly language]] and [[Computer architecture]] courses. The word "nar" means [[Pomegranate]] in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. Many NAR 2 simulators have been created &amp;mdash; for instance, one was named "Šljiva" ([[English language|en.]] ''[[plum]]'') as that fruit grows in [[Serbia]], while "nar" does not.

==Instruction structure==
The NAR 2 [[Central Processing Unit|processor]] uses 32-bit machine words.  Each [[machine language|Machine]] [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] contains:
* [[opcode]] in 8 [[most significant bit]]s (bits 24 to 31)
* 4 bits (20 to 23) specifying the [[Index register]] to use with indexed addressing modes
* 4 bits (16 to 19) containing [[Addressing mode|address mode]] [[Flag (computing)|flags]]:
** bit 19: '''P''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''osredno, [[English language|en.]] ''mediated'') - indexed
** bit 18: '''R''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''R'''elativno) - relative to program counter
** bit 17: '''I''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''I'''ndirektno) - [[Addressing mode#Multi-level memory indirect|multi-level memory indirect]] (note: the address is loaded from specified location and, should it also specify "I" flag the indirect address calculation continues)
** bit 16: '''N''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''N'''eposredno) - immediate
* 16 bit ''signed'' parameter value

==Registers==
NAR 2 has four registers:

* a [[Program counter]] called '''BN''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''B'''rojač '''N'''aredbi, [[English language|en.]] ''Counter of Instructions'')
* Single 32-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] that can be treated either as integer ([[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]]) or real (floating point) number
* Up to 16 [[Index register]]s are specifiable, X0 to X15. However, X0 was never used, possibly because it was reserved as program counter (BN)
* There were no [[Flag (computing)|flags or flag registers]]

==Mnemonics==
Following opcodes were available (actual codes were not specified, only mnemonics):

===Memory/register access===
* '''MUA''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''M'''emorija '''U''' '''A'''kumulator, [[English language|en.]] Memory Into Accumulator) loads the value into accumulator
* '''AUM''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''A'''kumulator '''U''' '''M'''emoriju, [[English language|en.]] Accumulator Into Memory) stores the content of the accumulator
* '''PIR''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''unjenje '''I'''ndeksnog '''R'''egistra, [[English language|en.]] Load Index Register) Loads the value into the index register

===Integer arithmetic===
''Note: all mnemonincs in this group end with letter "F" indicating "Fiksni zarez" ([[English language|en.]] Fixed point) arithmetic. However, this is only true for addition, subtraction and negation (sign change). Multiplication and division assume that the "point" is fixed to the right of least significant bit - that is that the numbers are integer.''

* '''SABF''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Sab'''eri u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Add, Fixed Point) - adds parameter to the accumulator
* '''ODUF''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Odu'''zmi u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Subtract, Fixed Point) - subtracts the parameter from the accumulator
* '''MNOF''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Mno'''ži u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Multiply, Fixed Point) - Multiples the accumulator with the parameter
* '''DELF''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Del'''i u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Divide, Fixed Point) - Divides the accumulator by the parameter
* '''PZAF''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''romeni '''Z'''nak '''A'''kumulatora u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Change the Sign of Accumuator, Fixed Point) - Changes (flips) the sign of the accumulator

===Floating point arithmetic===
* '''SAB''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Sab'''eri, [[English language|en.]] Add) - adds parameter to the accumulator
* '''ODU''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Odu'''zmi, [[English language|en.]] Subtract) - subtracts the parameter from the accumulator
* '''MNO''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Mno'''ži, [[English language|en.]] Multiply) - Multiples the accumulator with the parameter
* '''DEL''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Del'''i, [[English language|en.]] Divide) - Divides the accumulator by the parameter
* '''PZA''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''romeni '''Z'''nak '''A'''kumulatora, [[English language|en.]] Change the Sign of Accumuator) - Changes (flips) the sign of the accumulator

===Bitwise/logical===
* '''KON''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Kon'''junkcija, [[English language|en.]] [[Logical conjunction|Conjunction]]) - performs [[Logical conjunction|logical AND]] with the parameter and the accumulator and stores the result in the accumulator
* '''DIS''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Dis'''junkcija, [[English language|en.]] [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]) - performs [[Logical disjunction|logical OR]] with the parameter and the accumulator and stores the result in the accumulator
* '''NEG''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Neg'''acija, [[English language|en.]] [[Negation]]) - performs [[Negation|logical NOT]] on the content of the accumulator (ignores the parameter)

Note: above operations are all [[Bitwise operations|bitwise]]. Their names imply that they are purely [[Logical connective|logical operations]] but they can be explained as if they operate on  vectors of bits and separately apply logical operations on each pair of bits.

===[[Logical shift]]s===
* '''POL''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Po'''meri '''L'''evo, [[English language|en.]] Shift Left) - shifts the bits of the accumulator to the left
* '''POD''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Po'''meri '''D'''esno, [[English language|en.]] Shift Right) - shifts the bits of the accumulator to the right

===Flow control===
* '''NES''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Ne'''gativni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Negative Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is negative
* '''BES''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Be'''zuslovni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Unconditional Jump) performs an [[Jump instruction|unconditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter
* '''NUS''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Nu'''la-'''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Zero Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is zero
* '''ZAR''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Za'''ustavi '''R'''ačunar, [[English language|en.]] Stop the Computer) stops any further processing; this is the only instruction that ignores the parameter.

==Standard assembly language syntax==
The NAR 2 assembly language syntax was designed to be straightforward and easy to parse.  Each program line may contain up to one instruction specified as follows:

# Instruction mnemonic
# Whitespace, if instruction specifies any index registers, addressing mode or a parameter and then comma-separated:
## Name of index register, if used
## Names of addressing mode flags (also comma separated)
## Parameter value

'''Sample code:'''

   '''aum  ''' X1, p, 0
   '''mua  ''' n, 1
   '''aum  ''' 15
   '''pir  ''' X1, p, n, 1
   '''mua  ''' X1, p, n, 0
   '''oduf ''' n, 1
   '''oduf ''' X2, p, n, 0

==Addressing modes==

With four address mode selection bits (P, R, I and N - indexed, relative, indirect and immediate), NAR 2 instructions can specify 16 different addressing modes but not all make sense in all instructions. In the following table:

* M[x] specifies the 32-bit value (content) of memory location x
* BN specifies the program counter
* p specifies the 16-bit signed parameter at location
* Xi specifies the index register selected by data at location
* f() is the "effective value" function used for indirect addressing (see details below):

Note 1: "N" (immediate) flag has no effect on jump (flow control) instructions, as the processor can not jump into a specified value, but only to a memory address.

===Multi-level memory indirect===

NAR 2 supports [[Addressing mode#Multi-level memory indirect|multi-level memory indirect]] addressing mode. The location is first chosen by "looking" at P (indexed) and R (relative to program counter) flags. Then, if I (indirect) flag is detected, a 32-bit word is loaded from the memory location calculated so far and the calculation is restarted (including all addressing mode flags, index register selection and parameter value - only the "opcode" is omitted). Thus, the following program, if loaded at memory location 0 and executed:

'''mua''' I, 0 ; Memory-Into-Accumulator, Indirect, from location 0

... will freeze NAR 2 in an infinite address calculation loop:

# "I, 0" specifies that the actual address is to be loaded from memory location 0
# Memory location 0 is loaded. It reads "I, 0" again
# "I, 0" specifies that the actual address is to be loaded from memory location 0
# Memory location 0 is loaded. It reads "I, 0" again
# "I, 0" specifies that the actual address is to be loaded from memory location 0
# Memory location 0 is loaded. It reads "I, 0" again
# ...

Note that:

'''mua''' R, I, 0 ; Memory-Into-Accumulator, Relative, Indirect, from location BN+0

seems more generic (could freeze NAR 2 from any location), but this depends on when BN register value is incremented/changed.

The question of treatment of "N" (immediate) flag in presence of I (indirect) flag is open as the situation is somewhat ambiguous—that is, whether or not to honour the flag value specified in the original instruction or the one in the indirectly specified (looked up) address leads to a conflict.  The table above presents the first case to show different addressing modes achievable this way.

===Reading values from Index Registers===
NAR 2 has instructions to initialize the value of particular index register ("PIR" mnemonic). However, it does not have special instructions to read values index registers. This is achieved by using indexed and immediate (P, N) addressing mode flags, such as:

'''mua''' Xi, P, N, n ; Memory-Into-Accumulator, Indexed, Immediate, 0

... which essentially puts Xi+n into accumulator. For n=0, this turns into a "load index register value into accumulator" instruction.

In [[mathematics]], a sequence of ''n'' [[real number]]s can be understood as a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in ''n''-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] space. When ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9, the set of all such locations is called '''9-dimensional space'''. Often such spaces are studied as [[vector space]]s, without any notion of distance. Nine-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is nine-dimensional space equipped with a [[Euclidean metric]], which is defined by the [[dot product]].

More generally, the term may refer to a nine-dimensional vector space over any [[Field (mathematics)|field]], such as a nine-dimensional [[Complex number|complex]] vector space, which has 18 real dimensions. It may also refer to a nine-dimensional [[manifold]] such as a [[9-sphere]], or any of a variety of other geometric constructions.

==Geometry==

===9-polytope===
{{Main article|Uniform 9-polytope|l1=9-polytope}}

A [[polytope]] in nine dimensions is called a 9-polytope. The most studied are the [[regular polytope]]s, of which there are only [[List of regular polytopes#Convex 4|three in nine dimensions]]: the [[9-simplex]], [[9-cube]], and [[9-orthoplex]]. A broader family are the [[uniform 9-polytope]]s, constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a [[Coxeter group]]. Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The [[9-demicube]] is a unique polytope from the D&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; family.

This terminology should not be blamed on me. It was obtained by a democratic process in my course of 1976–77. An orbifold is something with many folds; unfortunately, the word "manifold" already has a different definition. I tried "foldamani", which was quickly displaced by the suggestion of "manifolded". After two months of patiently saying "no, not a manifold, a manifol''dead''," we held a vote, and "orbifold" won.

}}
In the mathematical disciplines of [[topology]], [[geometry]], and [[geometric group theory]], an '''orbifold''' (for "orbit-manifold") is a generalization of a [[manifold]]. It is a topological space (called the ''underlying space'') with an orbifold structure (see below).

The underlying space locally looks like the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of a [[Euclidean space]] under the [[linear map|linear]] [[group action|action]] of a [[finite group]]. Definitions of orbifold have been given several times: by [[Ichirô Satake|Satake]] in the context of [[automorphic form]]s in the 1950s under the name ''V-manifold'';&lt;ref&gt;Satake (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; by [[William Thurston|Thurston]] in the context of the geometry of [[3-manifold]]s in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (1978), Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; when he coined the name ''orbifold'', after a vote by his students; and by [[André Haefliger|Haefliger]] in the 1980s in the context of [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]]'s programme on [[CAT(k) space]]s under the name ''orbihedron''.&lt;ref&gt;Haefliger (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of Thurston will be described here: it is the most widely used and is applicable in all cases.

Mathematically, orbifolds arose first as surfaces with [[Singularity (mathematics)|singular points]] long before they were formally defined.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first classical examples arose in the theory of [[modular forms]]&lt;ref&gt;Serre (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; with the action of the [[modular group]] ''SL''(2,'''Z''') on the [[upper half-plane]]: a version of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] holds after the quotient is compactified by the addition of two orbifold cusp points. In [[3-manifold]] theory, the theory of [[Seifert fiber spaces]], initiated by [[Herbert Seifert|Seifert]], can be phrased in terms of 2-dimensional orbifolds.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[geometric group theory]], post-Gromov, discrete groups have been studied in terms of the local curvature properties of orbihedra and their covering spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Bridson and Haefliger (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[string theory]], the word "orbifold" has a slightly different meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Di Francesco, Mathieu &amp; Sénéchal (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in detail below. In [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]], it refers to the theory attached to the fixed point subalgebra of a [[vertex algebra]] under the action of a finite group of automorphisms.

The main example of underlying space is a quotient space of a manifold under the [[properly discontinuous]] action of a possibly infinite [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s with finite [[isotropy subgroup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bredon (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular this applies to any action of a [[finite group]]; thus a [[manifold with boundary]] carries a natural orbifold structure, since it is the quotient of its [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology#D|double]] by an action of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Similarly the quotient space of a manifold by a smooth proper action of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; carries the structure of an orbifold.

Orbifold structure gives a natural [[stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] by open manifolds on its underlying space, where one stratum corresponds to a set of singular points of the same type.

One topological space can carry many different orbifold structures. For example, consider the orbifold ''O'' associated with a factor space of the 2-sphere along a rotation by &lt;math&gt;\pi^{}_{} &lt;/math&gt;; it is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, but the natural orbifold structure is different. It is possible to adopt most of the characteristics of manifolds to orbifolds and these characteristics are usually different from correspondent characteristics of underlying space.
In the above example, the ''orbifold [[fundamental group]]'' of ''O'' is '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its ''orbifold [[Euler characteristic]]'' is 1.

==Formal definitions==
Like a manifold, an orbifold is specified by local conditions; however, instead of being locally modelled on open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, an orbifold is locally modelled on quotients of open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by finite group actions. The structure of an orbifold encodes not only that of the underlying quotient space, which need not be a manifold, but also that of the [[isotropy subgroup]]s.

An ''n''-dimensional '''orbifold''' is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] ''X'', called the '''underlying space''', with a covering by a collection of open sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, closed under finite intersection. For each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is
* an open subset ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, invariant under a [[Group action#Types of actions|faithful]] linear action of a finite group Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
* a continuous map φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; invariant under Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, called an '''orbifold chart''', which defines a homeomorphism between ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The collection of orbifold charts is called an '''orbifold atlas''' if the following properties are satisfied:
* for each inclusion ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; there is an injective [[group homomorphism]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; : Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Γ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;
* for each inclusion ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; there is a Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[equivariant]] homeomorphism ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, called a '''gluing map''', of  ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; onto an open subset of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;
* the gluing maps are compatible with the charts, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
* the gluing maps are unique up to composition with group elements, i.e. any other possible gluing map from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ''g''·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; for a unique ''g'' in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;

The orbifold atlas defines the '''orbifold structure''' completely:
two orbifold atlases of ''X'' give the same orbifold structure if they can be consistently combined to give a larger orbifold atlas. Note that the orbifold structure determines the isotropy subgroup of any point of the orbifold up to isomorphism: it can be computed as the stabilizer of the point in any orbifold chart. If ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \subset &lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \subset &lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, then there is a unique ''transition element'' ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt; in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;

These transition elements satisfy

:(Ad ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;)·''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;·''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;

as well as the ''cocycle relation'' (guaranteeing associativity)

:f&lt;sub&gt;''km''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;)·''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ikm''&lt;/sub&gt;   = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijm''&lt;/sub&gt;·''g''&lt;sub&gt;''jkm''&lt;/sub&gt;.

More generally, attached to an open covering of an orbifold by orbifold charts, there is the combinatorial data of a so-called ''complex of groups'' (see below).

Exactly as in the case of manifolds, differentiability conditions can be imposed on the gluing maps to give a definition of a '''differentiable orbifold'''. It will be a ''Riemannian orbifold'' if in addition there are invariant [[Riemannian metric]]s on the orbifold charts and the gluing maps are [[Riemannian manifold|isometries]].

For applications in [[geometric group theory]], it is often convenient to have a slightly more general notion of orbifold, due to Haefliger. An '''orbispace''' is to topological spaces what an orbifold is to manifolds. An orbispace is a topological generalization of the orbifold concept. It is defined by replacing the model for the orbifold charts by a [[locally compact]] space with a ''rigid'' action of a finite group, i.e. one for which points with trivial isotropy are dense. (This condition is automatically satisfied by faithful linear actions, because the points fixed by any non-trivial group element form a proper [[linear subspace]].) It is also useful to consider [[metric space]] structures on an orbispace, given by invariant [[metric space|metrics]] on the orbispace charts for which the gluing maps preserve distance. In this case each orbispace chart is usually required to be a [[Intrinsic metric#Definitions|length space]] with unique [[Intrinsic metric|geodesics]] connecting any two points.

===Examples===
* Any manifold without boundary is trivially an orbifold. Each of the groups Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[trivial group]].
* If ''N'' is a compact manifold with boundary, its '''double''' ''M'' can be formed by gluing together a copy of ''N'' and its mirror image along their common boundary. There is natural ''reflection'' action of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the manifold ''M'' fixing the common boundary; the quotient space can be identified with ''N'', so that ''N''  has a natural orbifold structure.
* If ''M'' is a Riemannian ''n''-manifold with a [[cocompact]] [[proper map|proper]] isometric action of a discrete group Γ, then the orbit space ''X'' = ''M''/Γ has natural orbifold structure: for each ''x'' in ''X'' take a representative ''m'' in ''M'' and an open neighbourhood ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''m'' invariant under the stabiliser Γ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, identified equivariantly with a Γ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;-subset of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' under the exponential map at ''m''; finitely many neighbourhoods cover ''X'' and each of their finite intersections, if non-empty, is covered by an intersection of Γ-translates ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;·''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; with corresponding group ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; Γ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Orbifolds that arise in this way are called ''developable'' or ''good''.
* A classical theorem of [[Henri Poincaré]] constructs [[Fuchsian group]]s as hyperbolic [[reflection group]]s generated by reflections in the edges of a geodesic triangle in the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] for the [[Poincaré metric]]. If the triangle has angles π / ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for positive integers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the triangle is a [[fundamental domain]] and naturally a 2-dimensional orbifold. The corresponding group is an example of a hyperbolic [[triangle group]]. Poincaré also gave a 3-dimensional version of this result for [[Kleinian group]]s: in this case the Kleinian group Γ is generated by hyperbolic reflections and the orbifold is '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / Γ.
* If ''M'' is a closed 2-manifold, new orbifold structures can be defined on ''M''i by removing finitely many disjoint closed discs from ''M'' and gluing back copies of discs ''D''/ Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''D'' is the closed [[unit disc]] and Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite cyclic group of rotations. This generalises Poincaré's construction.

==Orbifold fundamental group==
There are several ways to define the '''orbifold fundamental group'''. More sophisticated approaches use orbifold [[covering space]]s or [[classifying space]]s of [[groupoid]]s. The simplest approach (adopted by Haefliger and known also to Thurston) extends the usual notion of [[fundamental group|loop]] used in the standard definition of the [[fundamental group]].

An '''orbifold path''' is a path in the underlying space provided with an explicit piecewise lift of path segments to orbifold charts and explicit group elements identifying paths in overlapping charts; if the underlying path is a loop, it is called an '''orbifold loop'''. Two orbifold paths are identified if they are related through multiplication by group elements in orbifold charts. The orbifold fundamental group is the group formed by [[homotopy class]]es of orbifold loops.

If the orbifold arises as the quotient of a [[simply connected]] manifold ''M'' by a proper rigid action of a discrete group Γ, the orbifold fundamental group can be identified with Γ. In general it is an [[group extension|extension]] of Γ by π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''M''.

The orbifold is said to be ''developable'' or ''good'' if it arises as the quotient by a finite group action; otherwise it is called ''bad''. A ''universal covering orbifold'' can be constructed for an orbifold by direct analogy with the construction of the [[fundamental group|universal covering space]] of a topological space, namely as the space of pairs consisting of points of the orbifold and homotopy classes of orbifold paths joining them to the basepoint. This space is naturally an orbifold.

Note that if an orbifold chart on a [[contractible]] open subset corresponds to a group Γ, then there is a natural ''local homomorphism'' of Γ into the orbifold fundamental group.

In fact the following conditions are equivalent:
* The orbifold is developable.
* The orbifold structure on the universal covering orbifold is trivial.
* The local homomorphisms are all injective for a covering by contractible open sets.

==Non-positively curved orbispaces==
As explained above, an '''orbispace''' is basically a generalization of the orbifold concept applied to topological spaces. Let then ''X'' be an orbispace endowed with a metric space structure for which the charts are geodesic length spaces. The preceding definitions and results for orbifolds can be generalized to give definitions of ''orbispace fundamental group'' and ''universal covering orbispace'', with analogous criteria for developability. The distance functions on the orbispace charts can be used to define the length of an orbispace path in the universal covering orbispace. If the distance function in each chart is [[CAT(k) space|non-positively curved]], then the [[Surface (topology)#Surfaces of non-positive curvature|Birkhoff curve shortening argument]] can be used to prove that any orbispace path with fixed endpoints is homotopic to a unique geodesic. Applying this to constant paths in an orbispace chart, it follows that each local homomorphism is injective and hence:
* every non-positively curved orbispace is developable (i.e. ''good'').

==Complexes of groups==
Every orbifold has associated with it an additional combinatorial structure given by a ''complex of groups''.

===Definition===
A '''complex of groups''' (''Y'',''f'',''g'') on an [[abstract simplicial complex]] ''Y'' is given by
* a finite group Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; for each simplex σ of ''Y''
* an injective homomorphism ''f''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; : Γ&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; whenever σ &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; τ
* for every inclusion ρ &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; σ &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; τ, a group element ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; in Γ&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; such that (Ad ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt;)·''f''&lt;sub&gt;ρτ&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ρσ&lt;/sub&gt;·''f''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; (here Ad denotes the [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint action]] by conjugation)

The group elements must in addition satisfy the cocycle condition

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;πρ&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt;) ''g''&lt;sub&gt;πρτ&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;πστ&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;πρσ&lt;/sub&gt;

for every chain of simplices π &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ρ&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;  σ&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;  τ. (This condition is vacuous if ''Y'' has dimension 2 or less.)

Any choice of elements ''h''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; in Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; yields an ''equivalent'' complex of groups by defining
* ''f'''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; = (Ad ''h''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt;)·''f''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''g'''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; =    ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ρσ&lt;/sub&gt;·''f''&lt;sub&gt;ρσ&lt;/sub&gt;(''h''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt;)·''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt;·''h''&lt;sub&gt;ρτ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

A complex of groups is called '''simple''' whenever ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 everywhere.
* An easy inductive argument shows that every complex of groups on a ''simplex'' is equivalent to a complex of groups with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 everywhere.

It is often more convenient and conceptually appealing to pass to the [[barycentric subdivision]] of ''Y''. The vertices of this subdivision correspond to the simplices of ''Y'', so that each vertex has a group attached to it. The edges of the barycentric subdivision are naturally oriented (corresponding to inclusions of simplices) and each directed edge gives an inclusion of groups. Each triangle has a transition element attached to it belonging to the group of exactly one vertex; and the tetrahedra, if there are any, give cocycle relations for the transition elements. Thus a complex of groups involves only the 3-skeleton of the barycentric subdivision; and only the 2-skeleton if it is simple.

===Example===
If ''X'' is an orbifold (or orbispace), choose a covering by open subsets from amongst the orbifold charts ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' &lt;/sub&gt;: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''Y'' be the abstract simplicial complex given by the [[nerve of an open covering|nerve of the covering]]: its vertices are the sets of the cover and its ''n''-simplices correspond to ''non-empty'' intersections ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ··· &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. For each such simplex there is an associated group Γ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and the homomorphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; become the homomorphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt;. For every triple ρ &lt;math&gt; \subset &lt;/math&gt; σ  &lt;math&gt; \subset &lt;/math&gt; τ corresponding to intersections

:''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\supset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\supset&lt;/math&gt;   ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;

there are charts φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and gluing maps ψ : ''V''&lt;sub&gt; ''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ψ' : ''V''&lt;sub&gt; ''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ" : ''V''&lt;sub&gt; ''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is a unique transition element ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ" = ψ·ψ'. The relations satisfied by the transition elements of an orbifold imply those required for a complex of groups. In this way a complex of groups can be canonically associated to the nerve of an open covering by orbifold (or orbispace) charts. In the language of non-commutative [[sheaf theory]] and [[gerbe]]s, the complex of groups in this case arises as a [[sheaf theory|sheaf of groups]] associated to the covering ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; the data ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt; is a 2-cocycle in non-commutative [[sheaf cohomology]] and the data ''h''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; gives a 2-coboundary perturbation.

===Edge-path group===
The '''edge-path group''' of a complex of groups can be defined as a natural generalisation of the [[Fundamental group#Edge-path group of a simplicial complex|edge path group]] of a simplicial complex. In the barycentric subdivision of ''Y'', take generators ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;  corresponding to edges from ''i'' to ''j'' where ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j'', so that there is an injection ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; : Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Γ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let Γ be the group generated by the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with relations

:''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · ''g'' · ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')

for ''g'' in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  and

:''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt;  = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;·''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;·''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;

if ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''k''.

For a fixed vertex ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the edge-path group Γ(''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined to be the subgroup of Γ  generated by all products

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; · e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; · ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; · e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; · ··· · ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;  · e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt; 0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;

where ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
is an edge-path, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; if ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j''.

===Developable complexes===
A simplicial [[proper action]] of a discrete group Γ on a [[simplicial complex]] ''X'' with finite quotient is said to be '''regular''' if it
satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions (see Bredon 1972):
* ''X'' admits a finite subcomplex as [[fundamental domain]];
* the quotient ''Y'' = ''X''/Γ has a natural simplicial structure;
* the quotient simplicial structure on orbit-representatives of vertices is consistent;
* if (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;·''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) are simplices, then ''g''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''g'' in Γ.

The fundamental domain and quotient ''Y'' = ''X'' / Γ can naturally be identified as simplicial complexes in this case, given by the stabilisers of the simplices in the fundamental domain. A complex of groups ''Y'' is said to be '''developable''' if it arises in this way.
* A complex of groups is developable if and only if the homomorphisms of Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; into the edge-path group are injective.
* A complex of groups is developable if and only if for each simplex σ there is an injective homomorphism θ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;  from Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; into a fixed discrete group Γ such that θ&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;·''f''&lt;sub&gt;στ&lt;/sub&gt; = θ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case the simplicial complex ''X'' is canonically defined: it has ''k''-simplices (σ, xΓ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;) where σ is a ''k''-simplex of ''Y'' and ''x'' runs over Γ / Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;. Consistency can be checked using the fact that the restriction of the complex of groups to a ''simplex'' is equivalent to one with trivial cocycle ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ρστ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The action of Γ on the barycentric subdivision ''X'' ' of ''X'' always satisfies the following condition, weaker than regularity:
* whenever σ and ''g''·σ are subsimplices of some simplex τ, they are equal, i.e. σ = ''g''·σ

Indeed, simplices in ''X'' ' correspond to chains of simplices in ''X'', so that a subsimplices, given by subchains of simplices, is uniquely determined by the ''sizes'' of the simplices in the subchain. When an action satisfies this condition, then ''g'' necessarily fixes all the vertices of σ. A straightforward inductive argument shows that such an action becomes regular on the barycentric subdivision; in particular
* the action on the second barycentric subdivision ''X''" is regular;
* Γ is naturally isomorphic to the edge-path group defined using edge-paths and vertex stabilisers for the barycentric subdivision of the fundamental domain in ''X''".

There is in fact no need to pass to a ''third'' barycentric subdivision: as Haefliger observes using the language of [[category theory]], in this case the 3-skeleton of the fundamental domain of ''X''" already carries all the necessary data – including transition elements for triangles – to define an edge-path group isomorphic to Γ.

In two dimensions this is particularly simple to describe. The fundamental domain of ''X''" has the same structure as the barycentric subdivision ''Y'' ' of a complex of groups ''Y'', namely:
* a finite 2-dimensional simplicial complex ''Z'';
* an orientation for all edges ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j'';
* if ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j'' and ''j'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''k'' are edges, then ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''k'' is an edge and (''i'', ''j'', ''k'') is a triangle;
* finite groups attached to vertices, inclusions to edges and transition elements, describing compatibility, to triangles.

An edge-path group can then be defined. A similar structure is inherited by the barycentric subdivision ''Z'' ' and its edge-path group is isomorphic to that of ''Z''.

==Orbihedra==
If a countable discrete group acts by a ''regular'' ''simplicial'' [[proper action]] on a [[simplicial complex]], the quotient can be given not only the structure of a complex of groups, but also that of an orbispace. This leads more generally to the definition of "orbihedron", the simplicial analogue of an orbifold.

===Definition===
Let ''X'' be a finite simplicial complex with barycentric subdivision ''X'' '. An '''orbihedron''' structure consists of:
* for each vertex ''i'' of ''X'' ', a simplicial complex ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;' endowed with a rigid simplicial action of a finite group Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* a simplicial map φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;' onto the [[link (geometry)|link]] ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''i'' in ''X'' ', identifying the quotient ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;' / Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This action of Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;' extends to a simplicial action on the simplicial cone ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; over ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;' (the simplicial join of ''i'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'), fixing the centre ''i'' of the cone. The map φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; extends to a simplicial map of
''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; onto the [[simplicial complex|star]] St(''i'') of ''i'', carrying the centre onto ''i''; thus φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; identifies ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the quotient of the star of ''i'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with St(''i'') and gives an ''orbihedron chart'' at ''i''.
* for each directed edge ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''j'' of ''X'' ', an injective homomorphism ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; of Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; into Γ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* for each directed edge ''i'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''j'', a Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equivariant simplicial ''gluing map'' ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; into ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* the gluing maps are compatible with the charts, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* the gluing maps are unique up to composition with group elements, i.e. any other possible gluing map from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ''g''·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; for a unique ''g'' in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''i''&lt;math&gt; \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''j'' &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; ''k'', then there is a unique ''transition element'' ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt; in Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;·ψ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;

These transition elements satisfy

:(Ad ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;)·''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;·''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;

as well as the cocycle relation

:ψ&lt;sub&gt;''km''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;)·''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ikm''&lt;/sub&gt;   = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ijm''&lt;/sub&gt;·''g''&lt;sub&gt;''jkm''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Main properties===
* The group theoretic data of an orbihedron gives a complex of groups on ''X'', because the vertices ''i'' of the barycentric subdivision ''X'' ' correspond to the simplices in ''X''.
* Every complex of groups on ''X'' is associated with an essentially unique orbihedron structure on ''X''. This key fact follows by noting that the star and link of a vertex ''i'' of ''X'' ', corresponding to a simplex σ of ''X'', have natural decompositions: the star is isomorphic to the abstract simplicial complex given by the join of σ and the barycentric subdivision σ' of σ; and the link is isomorphic to join of the link of σ in ''X'' and the link of the barycentre of σ in σ'. Restricting the complex of groups to the link of σ in ''X'', all the groups Γ&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; come with injective homomorphisms into Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the link of ''i'' in ''X'' ' is canonically covered by a simplicial complex on which Γ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; acts, this defines an orbihedron structure on ''X''.
* The orbihedron fundamental group is (tautologically) just the edge-path group of the associated complex of groups.
* Every orbihedron is also naturally an orbispace: indeed in the geometric realization of the simplicial complex, orbispace charts can be defined using the interiors of stars.
* The orbihedron fundamental group can be naturally identified with the orbispace fundamental group of the associated orbispace. This follows by applying the [[simplicial approximation theorem]] to segments of an orbispace path lying in an orbispace chart: it is a straightforward variant of the classical proof that the [[fundamental group]] of a [[simplicial complex#Algebraic topology|polyhedron]] can be identified with its [[Fundamental group#Edge-path group|edge-path group]].
* The orbispace associated to an orbihedron has a ''canonical metric structure'', coming locally from the length metric in the standard geometric realization in Euclidean space, with vertices mapped to an orthonormal basis. Other metric structures are also used, involving length metrics obtained by realizing the simplices in [[hyperbolic space]], with simplices identified isometrically along common boundaries.
* The orbispace associated to an orbihedron is [[non-positively curved space|non-positively curved]] if and only if the link in each orbihedron chart has [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] greater than or equal to 6, i.e. any closed circuit in the link has length at least 6. This condition, well known from the theory of [[CAT(k) space|Hadamard spaces]], depends only on the underlying complex of groups.
* When the universal covering orbihedron is non-positively curved the fundamental group is infinite and is generated by isomorphic copies of the isotropy groups. This follows from the corresponding result for orbispaces.

==Triangles of groups==
Historically one of the most important applications of orbifolds in [[geometric group theory]] has been to ''triangles of groups''. This is the simplest 2-dimensional example generalising the 1-dimensional "interval of groups" discussed in [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]'s lectures on trees, where [[free product|amalgamated free products]] are studied in terms of actions on trees. Such triangles of groups arise any time a discrete group acts simply transitively on the triangles in the [[Building (mathematics)#Spherical and affine buildings for SLn|affine Bruhat-Tits building]] for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;); in 1979 [[David Mumford|Mumford]] discovered the first example for ''p'' = 2 (see below) as a step in producing an [[algebraic surface]] not isomorphic to [[projective space]], but having the same [[Betti number]]s. Triangles of groups were worked out in detail by Gersten and Stallings, while the more general case of complexes of groups, described above, was developed independently by Haefliger. The underlying geometric method of analysing finitely presented groups in terms of metric spaces of non-positive curvature is due to Gromov. In this context triangles of groups correspond to non-positively curved 2-dimensional simplicial complexes with the regular action of a group, '''''transitive on triangles'''''.

[[File:Triangle.Centroid.svg|right]]
A '''triangle of groups''' is a ''simple'' complex of groups consisting of a triangle with vertices '''A''', '''B''', '''C'''. There are groups
* Γ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, Γ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, Γ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; at each vertex
* Γ&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt;, Γ&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt;, Γ&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; for each edge
* Γ&lt;sub&gt;ABC&lt;/sub&gt; for the triangle itself.

There is an injective homomorphisms of Γ&lt;sub&gt;ABC&lt;/sub&gt; into all the other groups and of an edge group Γ&lt;sub&gt;XY&lt;/sub&gt; into Γ&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;. The three ways of mapping Γ&lt;sub&gt;ABC&lt;/sub&gt; into a vertex group all agree. (Often Γ&lt;sub&gt;ABC&lt;/sub&gt; is the trivial group.) The Euclidean metric structure on the corresponding orbispace is non-positively curved if and only if the link of each of the vertices in the orbihedron chart has girth at least 6.

This girth at each vertex is always even and, as observed by Stallings, can be described at a vertex '''A''', say, as the length of the smallest word in the kernel of the natural homomorphism into Γ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;  of the [[free product|amalgamated free product]] over Γ&lt;sub&gt;ABC&lt;/sub&gt; of the edge groups Γ&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{AB} \star_{\,\Gamma_{ABC}} \Gamma_{AC} \rightarrow \Gamma_A.&lt;/math&gt;

The result using the Euclidean metric structure is not optimal. Angles α, β, γ at the vertices '''A''', '''B''' and '''C''' were defined by Stallings as 2π divided by the girth. In the Euclidean case α, β, γ ≤ π/3. However, if it is only required that α + β + γ ≤ π, it is possible to identify the
triangle with the corresponding geodesic triangle in the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] with the [[Poincaré metric]] (or the Euclidean plane if equality holds). It is a classical result from hyperbolic geometry that the hyperbolic medians intersect in the hyperbolic barycentre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~wws/cabripages/hyperbolic/pmedian.html Theorem of the hyperbolic medians]&lt;/ref&gt; just as in the familiar Euclidean case. The barycentric subdivision and metric from this model yield a non-positively curved metric structure on the corresponding orbispace. Thus, if α+β+γ≤π,
* the orbispace of the triangle of groups is developable;
* the corresponding edge-path group, which can also be described as the [[colimit]] of the triangle of groups, is infinite;
* the homomorphisms of the vertex groups into the edge-path group are injections.

===Mumford's example===
[[File:Fano plane.svg|thumb|right|[[Fano plane|The Fano plane]]]]
Let α = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-7}&lt;/math&gt; be given by the [[binomial expansion]] of (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;8)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and set ''K'' = '''Q'''(α) &lt;math&gt;\subset &lt;/math&gt; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let

:ζ = exp 2π''i''/7

:λ = (α − 1)/2 = ζ + ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  + ζ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

:μ = λ/λ*.

Let ''E'' = '''Q'''(ζ), a 3-dimensional vector space over ''K'' with basis 1, ζ and ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Define ''K''-linear operators on ''E'' as follows:
* σ is the generator of the [[Galois group]] of ''E'' over ''K'', an element of order 3 given by σ(ζ) = ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* τ is the operator of multiplication by ζ on ''E'', an element of order 7
* ρ is the operator given by ρ(ζ) = 1, ρ(ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ζ and ρ(1) = μ·ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so that ρ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is scalar multiplication by μ.

The elements ρ, σ and τ generate a discrete subgroup of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') which acts [[proper action|properly]] on the [[Building (mathematics)#Spherical and affine buildings for SLn|affine Bruhat–Tits building]] corresponding to ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This group acts ''transitively'' on all vertices, edges and triangles in the building. Let

:σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = σ, σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρσρ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;σρ&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Then
* σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generate a subgroup Γ of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'').
* Γ is the smallest subgroup generated by σ and τ, invariant under conjugation by ρ.
* Γ acts [[Group actions#Types of actions|simply transitively]] on the triangles in the building.
* There is a triangle Δ such that the stabiliser of its edges are the subgroups of order 3 generated by the σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s.
* The stabiliser of a vertices of Δ is the [[Frobenius group]] of order 21 generated by the two order 3 elements stabilising the edges meeting at the vertex.
* The stabiliser of Δ is trivial.

The elements σ and τ generate the stabiliser of a vertex. The [[link (geometry)|link]] of this vertex can be identified with the spherical building of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the stabiliser can be identified with the [[collineation|collineation group]] of the [[Fano plane]] generated by a 3-fold symmetry σ fixing a point and a cyclic permutation τ of all 7 points, satisfying στ = τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;σ. Identifying '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;* with the Fano plane, σ can be taken to be the restriction of the [[Frobenius automorphism]] σ(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and τ to be multiplication by any element not in the [[Characteristic (algebra)#Case of fields|prime field]] '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. an order 7 generator of the [[finite field#Applications|cyclic multiplicative group]] of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. This Frobenius group acts simply transitively on the 21 flags in the Fano plane, i.e. lines with marked points. The formulas for σ and τ on ''E'' thus "lift" the formulas on '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

Mumford also obtains an action [[Group action#Types of actions|simply transitive]] on the vertices of the building by passing to a subgroup of Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;ρ, σ, τ, −''I''&gt;. The group Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; preserves the '''Q'''(α)-valued hermitian form

:f(x,y)=xy* + σ(xy*) + σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(xy*)

on '''Q'''(ζ) and can be identified with ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(f) &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') where ''S'' = '''Z'''[α,½]. Since ''S''/(α) = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a homomorphism of the group Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). This action leaves invariant a
2-dimensional subspace in  '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and hence gives rise to a homomorphism Ψ of Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), a group of order 16·3·7. On the other hand, the stabiliser of a vertex is a subgroup of order 21 and Ψ is injective on this subgroup. Thus if the [[congruence subgroup]] Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the [[inverse image]] under Ψ of the 2-[[Sylow subgroup]] of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), the action of
Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on vertices must be simply transitive.

===Generalizations===
Other examples of triangles or 2-dimensional complexes of groups can be constructed by variations of the above example.

Cartwright et al. consider actions on buildings that are '''''simply transitive on vertices'''''. Each such action produces a bijection (or modified duality) between the points ''x'' and lines ''x''* in the [[flag (linear algebra)|flag complex]] of a finite [[projective plane]] and a collection of oriented triangles of points (''x'',''y'',''z''), invariant under cyclic permutation, such that ''x'' lies on ''z''*, ''y'' lies on ''x''* and ''z'' lies on ''y''* and any two points uniquely determine the third. The groups produced have generators ''x'', labelled by points, and relations ''xyz'' = 1 for each triangle. Generically this construction will not correspond to an action on a classical affine building.

More generally, as shown by Ballmann and Brin, similar algebraic data encodes all actions that are simply transitively on the vertices of a non-positively curved 2-dimensional simplicial complex, provided the link of each vertex has girth at least 6. This data consists of:
* a generating set ''S'' containing inverses, but not the identity;
*  a set of relations ''g'' ''h'' ''k'' = 1, invariant under cyclic permutation.

The elements ''g'' in ''S'' label the vertices ''g''·''v'' in the link of a fixed vertex ''v''; and the relations correspond to edges (''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·''v'', ''h''·''v'') in that link. The graph with vertices ''S'' and edges (''g'', ''h''), for ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' in ''S'', must have girth at least 6. The original simplicial complex can be reconstructed using complexes of groups and the second barycentric subdivision.

[[File:Heawood graph bipartite.png|thumb|right|The [[Heawood graph|bipartite Heawood graph]]]]
Further examples of non-positively curved 2-dimensional complexes of groups have been constructed by Swiatkowski based on actions '''''simply transitive on oriented edges''''' and inducing a 3-fold symmetry on each triangle; in this case too the complex of groups is obtained from the regular action on the second barycentric subdivision. The simplest example, discovered earlier with Ballmann, starts from a finite group ''H'' with a symmetric set of generators ''S'', not containing the identity, such that the corresponding [[Cayley graph]] has girth at least 6. The associated group is generated by ''H'' and an involution τ subject to (τg)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 for each ''g'' in ''S''.

In fact, if Γ acts in this way, fixing an edge (''v'', ''w''), there is an involution τ interchanging ''v'' and ''w''. The link of ''v'' is made up of vertices ''g''·''w'' for ''g'' in a symmetric subset ''S'' of ''H'' =  Γ&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, generating ''H'' if the link is connected. The assumption on triangles implies that

:τ·(''g''·''w'') = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·''w''

for ''g'' in ''S''. Thus, if σ = τ''g'' and ''u'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·''w'', then

:σ(''v'') = ''w'', σ(''w'') = ''u'', σ(''u'') = ''w''.

By simple transitivity on the triangle (''v'', ''w'', ''u''), it follows that σ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

The second barycentric subdivision gives a complex of groups consisting of singletons or pairs of barycentrically subdivided triangles joined along their large sides: these pairs are indexed by the quotient space ''S''/~ obtained by identifying inverses in ''S''. The single or "coupled" triangles are in turn joined along one common "spine". All stabilisers of simplices are trivial except for the two vertices at the ends of the spine, with stabilisers ''H'' and &lt;τ&gt;, and the remaining vertices of the large triangles, with stabiliser generated by an appropriate σ. Three of the smaller triangles in each large triangle contain transition elements.

When all the elements of ''S'' are involutions, none of the triangles need to be doubled. If ''H'' is taken to be the [[dihedral group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; of order 14, generated by an involution ''a'' and an element ''b'' of order 7 such that

:''ab''= ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''a'',

then ''H'' is generated by the 3 involutions ''a'', ''ab'' and ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The link of each vertex is given by the corresponding Cayley graph, so is just the [[Heawood graph|bipartite Heawood graph]], i.e. exactly the same as in the affine building for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This link structure implies that the corresponding simplicial complex is necessarily a [[building (mathematics)|Euclidean building]]. At present, however, it seems to be unknown whether any of these types of action can in fact be realised on a classical affine building: Mumford's group Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (modulo scalars) is only simply transitive on edges, not on oriented edges.

==2-dimensional orbifolds==
In two dimensions, there are three singular point types of an orbifold:
* A boundary point
* An elliptic point or [[gyration point]] of order ''n'', such as the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; quotiented out by a cyclic group of order ''n'' of rotations.
* A corner reflector of order ''n'': the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; quotiented out by a dihedral group of order 2''n''.

A compact 2-dimensional orbifold has an '''[[Euler characteristic]]''' Χ
given by
:Χ = Χ(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − Σ(1 − 1/''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; )/2 − Σ(1 − 1/''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; )
where Χ(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is the Euler characteristic of the underlying topological manifold ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the orders of the corner reflectors, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the orders of the elliptic points.

A 2-dimensional compact connected orbifold has a hyperbolic structure if its Euler characteristic is less than 0, a Euclidean structure if it is 0, and if its Euler characteristic is positive it is either '''bad''' or has an elliptic structure (an orbifold is called bad if it does not have a manifold as a covering space). In other words, its universal covering space has a hyperbolic, Euclidean, or spherical structure.

The compact 2-dimensional connected orbifolds that are not hyperbolic are listed in the table below. The 17 parabolic orbifolds are the quotients of the plane by the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s.

==3-dimensional orbifolds==
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
A 3-manifold is said to be ''small'' if it is closed, irreducible and does not contain any incompressible surfaces.

'''Orbifold Theorem.'''  Let ''M'' be a small 3-manifold. Let φ be a non-trivial periodic orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of ''M''. Then ''M'' admits a φ-invariant hyperbolic or Seifert fibered structure.

This theorem is a special case of Thurston's [[orbifold theorem]], announced without proof in 1981; it forms part of [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture|his geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds]]. In particular it implies that if ''X'' is a compact, connected, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-orbifold with non-empty singular locus, then ''M'' has a geometric structure (in the sense of orbifolds). A complete proof of the theorem was published by Boileau, Leeb &amp; Porti in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;General introductions to this material can be found in Peter Scott's 1983 notes and the expositions of Boileau, Maillot &amp; Porti and Cooper, Hodgson &amp; Kerckhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Applications==

===Orbifolds in string theory===
In [[string theory]], the word "orbifold" has a slightly new meaning. For mathematicians, an orbifold is a generalization of the notion of [[manifold]] that allows the presence of the points whose neighborhood is [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a quotient of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by a finite group, i.e. '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''Γ''. In physics, the notion of an orbifold usually describes an object that can be globally written as an orbit space ''M''/''G'' where ''M'' is a manifold (or a theory), and ''G'' is a group of its isometries (or symmetries) — not necessarily all of them. In string theory, these symmetries do not have to have a geometric interpretation.

A [[quantum field theory]] defined on an orbifold becomes singular near the fixed points of ''G''. However string theory requires us to add new parts of the [[closed string]] [[Hilbert space]] — namely the twisted sectors where the fields defined on the closed strings are periodic up to an action from ''G''. Orbifolding is therefore a general procedure of string theory to derive a new string theory from an old string theory in which the elements of ''G'' have been identified with the identity. Such a procedure reduces the number of states because the states must be invariant under ''G'', but it also increases the number of states because of the extra twisted sectors. The result is usually a perfectly smooth, new string theory.

[[D-branes]] propagating on the orbifolds are described, at low energies, by gauge theories defined by the [[quiver diagram]]s. Open strings attached to these [[D-branes]] have no twisted sector, and so the number of open string states is reduced by the orbifolding procedure.

More specifically, when the orbifold group ''G'' is a discrete subgroup of spacetime isometries, then if it has no fixed point, the result is usually a compact smooth space; the twisted sector consists of closed strings wound around the compact dimension, which are called ''winding states''.

When the orbifold group G is a discrete subgroup of spacetime isometries, and it has fixed points, then these usually have [[Gravitational singularity#Conical|conical singularities]], because '''R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Cyclic group|Z&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]]''' has such a singularity at the fixed point of [[Cyclic group|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In string theory, gravitational singularities are usually a sign of extra [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] which are located at a locus point in spacetime. In the case of the orbifold these [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] are the twisted states, which are strings "stuck" at the fixed points. When the fields related with these twisted states acquire a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]], the singularity is deformed, i.e. the metric is changed and becomes regular at this point and around it. An example for a resulting geometry is the [[Gravitational instanton#Eguchi-Hanson|Eguchi-Hanson]] spacetime.

From the point of view of D-branes in the vicinity of the fixed points, the effective theory of the open strings attached to these D-branes is a supersymmetric field theory, whose space of vacua has a singular point, where additional massless degrees of freedom exist. The fields related with the closed string twisted sector couple to the open strings in such a way as to add a Fayet-Iliopoulos term to the supersymmetric field theory Lagrangian, so that when such a field acquires a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]], the Fayet-Iliopoulos term is non-zero, and thereby deforms the theory (i.e. changes it) so that the singularity no longer exists [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603167], [http://www-spires.fnal.gov/spires/find/hep/www?j=NUPHA,B342,246].

====Calabi–Yau manifolds====
{{Main article|Calabi–Yau manifold}}
In [[superstring theory]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Green, J. Schwartz and E. Witten, ''Superstring theory'', Vol. 1 and 2, Cambridge University Press, 1987, ISBN
0521357527&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Polchinski, ''String theory'', Vol. 2, Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{isbn|0-521-63304-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the construction of realistic [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological models]] requires [[dimensional reduction]] because the strings naturally propagate in a 10-dimensional space whilst the observed dimension of [[space-time]] of the universe is 4. Formal constraints on the theories nevertheless place restrictions on the [[Compactification (physics)|compactified space]] in which the extra "hidden" variables live: when looking for realistic 4-dimensional models with [[supersymmetry]], the auxiliary compactified space must be a 6-dimensional [[Calabi–Yau manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Candelas, ''Lectures On Complex Manifolds'', in *Trieste 1987, Proceedings, Superstrings '87* 1-88, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a large number of possible Calabi–Yau manifolds (tens of thousands), hence the use of the term "landscape" in the current theoretical physics literature to describe the baffling choice. The general study of Calabi–Yau manifolds is mathematically complex and for a long time examples have been hard to construct explicitly. Orbifolds have therefore proved very useful since they automatically satisfy the constraints imposed by supersymmetry. They provide degenerate examples of Calabi–Yau manifolds due to their [[singularity (mathematics)|singular points]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Basic Concepts of String Theory|series=Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|first1=Ralph|last1=Blumenhagen|first2=Dieter|last2=Lüst|first3=Stefan|last3=Theisen|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9783642294969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3PNFQn6AzcC&amp;pg=PA487|page=487|quote=Orbifolds can be viewed as singular limits of smooth Calabi–Yau manifolds}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is completely acceptable from the point of view of theoretical physics. Such orbifolds are called "supersymmetric": they are technically easier to study than general Calabi–Yau manifolds. It is very often possible to associate a continuous family of non-singular Calabi–Yau manifolds to a singular supersymmetric orbifold. In 4 dimensions this can be illustrated using complex [[K3 surface]]s:

:*Every K3 surface admits 16 cycles of dimension 2 that are topologically equivalent to usual 2-spheres. Making the surface of these spheres tend to zero, the K3 surface develops 16 singularities. This limit represents a point on the boundary of the [[moduli space]] of K3 surfaces and corresponds to the orbifold &lt;math&gt;T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2\,&lt;/math&gt; obtained by taking the quotient of the torus by the symmetry of inversion.

The study of Calabi–Yau manifolds in string theory and the duality between different models of string theory (type IIA and IIB) led to the idea of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] in 1988. The role of orbifolds was first pointed out by Dixon, Harvey, Vafa and Witten around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Harvey, Vafa and Witten, Nucl.Phys. 1985, B261, 678; 1986, B274, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music theory===
Beyond their manifold&lt;!-- pun intended --&gt; and various applications in mathematics and physics, orbifolds have been applied to [[music theory]] at least as early as 1985 in the work of [[Guerino Mazzola]]&lt;ref name="Mazzola1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guerino Mazzola|title=Gruppen und Kategorien in der Musik: Entwurf einer mathematischen Musiktheorie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktPuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=1985|publisher=Heldermann|isbn=978-3-88538-210-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MazzolaMüller2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guerino Mazzola|author2=Stefan Müller|title=The topos of music: geometric logic of concepts, theory, and performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6I9U9-Rls8oC|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2002|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-7643-5731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] and collaborators {{Harv|Tymoczko|2006}} and {{Harv|Callender|Tymoczko|2008}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Tymoczko, ''[http://dmitri.tymoczko.com/sciencearticle.html The Geometry of Music]'' – links to papers and to visualization software.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/the-moduli-space-of-chords-dmitri-tymoczko-on-geometry-and-music-friday-7-mar-230pm/ The moduli space of chords: Dmitri Tymoczko on "Geometry and Music", Friday 7 Mar, 2:30pm],'' posted 28/Feb/08 – talk abstract and high-level mathematical description.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the papers of Tymoczko was the first music theory paper published by the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].''&lt;ref&gt;Michael D.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Topological III by Robert R. Wilson, at Harvard University.JPG|upright|thumb|Musical triads can be modeled as points in a certain 3-dimensional orbifold, which may be realized as a solid torus with triangular cross-section and a twist.]] --&gt;
[[File:3-orbifold-voronoi-animated.gif|thumbnail|Animated slices of the three-dimensional orbifold &lt;math&gt;T^3 / S_3&lt;/math&gt;.

Slices of cubes standing on end (with their long diagonals perpendicular to the plane of the image) form colored [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] regions (colored by chord type) which represent the three note chords at their centers, with [[augmented triad]]s at the very center, surrounded by major and minor [[Triad (music)|triads]] (lime green and navy blue). The white regions are degenerate trichords (one-note repeated three times), with the three lines (representing two note chords) connecting their centers forming the walls of the twisted triangular prism, 2D planes perpendicular to plane of the image acting as mirrors.]]

Tymoczko models musical chords consisting of ''n'' notes, not necessarily distinct, as points in the orbifold &lt;math&gt;T^n/S_n&lt;/math&gt; – the space of ''n'' unordered points (not necessarily distinct) in the circle, realized as the quotient of the ''n''-[[torus]] &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; (the space of ''n'' ''ordered'' points on the circle) by the symmetric group &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding from moving from an ordered set to an unordered set).

Musically, this is explained as follows:
* Musical tones depend on the frequency (pitch) of their fundamental, and thus are parametrized by the positive real numbers, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Musical tones that differ by an octave (a doubling of frequency) are considered the same tone – this corresponds to taking the [[logarithm]] base 2 of frequencies (yielding the real numbers, as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \log_2 \mathbf{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;), then quotienting by the integers (corresponding to differing by some number of octaves), yielding a circle (as &lt;math&gt;S^1 = \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;).
* Chords correspond to multiple tones without respect to order – thus ''t'' notes (with order) correspond to ''t'' ordered points on the circle, or equivalently a single point on the ''t''-torus &lt;math&gt;T^t := S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1,&lt;/math&gt; and omitting order corresponds to taking the quotient by &lt;math&gt;S_t,&lt;/math&gt; yielding an orbifold.

For [[dyad (music)|dyads]] (two tones), this yields the closed [[Möbius strip]]; for [[triad (music)|triads]] (three tones), this yields an orbifold that can be described as a triangular prism with the top and bottom triangular faces identified with a 120° twist (a ⅓ twist) – equivalently, as a solid torus in 3 dimensions with a cross-section an equilateral triangle and such a twist.

The resulting orbifold is naturally stratified by repeated tones (properly, by integer partitions of ''t'') – the open set consists of distinct tones (the partition &lt;math&gt;t = 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1&lt;/math&gt;), while there is a 1-dimensional singular set consisting of all tones being the same (the partition &lt;math&gt;t = t&lt;/math&gt;), which topologically is a circle, and various intermediate partitions. There is also a notable circle which runs through the center of the open set consisting of equally spaced points. In the case of triads, the three side faces of the prism correspond to two tones being the same and the third different (the partition &lt;math&gt;3 = 2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;), while the three edges of the prism correspond to the 1-dimensional singular set. The top and bottom faces are part of the open set, and only appear because the orbifold has been cut – if viewed as a triangular torus with a twist, these artifacts disappear.

Tymoczko argues that chords close to the center (with tones equally or almost equally spaced) form the basis of much of traditional Western harmony, and that visualizing them in this way assists in analysis. There are 4 chords on the center (equally spaced under [[equal temperament]] – spacing of 4/4/4 between tones), corresponding to the [[augmented triad]]s (thought of as [[Set (music)|musical sets]]) C♯FA, DF♯A♯, D♯GB, and EG♯C (then they cycle: FAC♯ = C♯FA), with the 12 [[major chord]]s and 12 [[minor chord]]s being the points next to but not on the center – almost evenly spaced but not quite. Major chords correspond to 4/3/5 (or equivalently, 5/4/3) spacing, while minor chords correspond to 3/4/5 spacing. Key changes then correspond to movement between these points in the orbifold, with smoother changes effected by movement between nearby points.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In [[analytic number theory]], the '''Petersson trace formula''' is a kind of orthogonality relation between coefficients of a holomorphic [[modular form]]. It is a specialization of the more general [[Kuznetsov trace formula]].

In its simplest form the Petersson trace formula is as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[orthonormal basis]] of &lt;math&gt;S_k(\Gamma(1))&lt;/math&gt;, the space of cusp forms of weight &lt;math&gt;k&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;SL_2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any positive integers &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma(k-1)}{(4\pi \sqrt{mn})^{k-1}} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \bar{f}(m) f(n) = \delta_{mn} + 2\pi i^{-k} \sum_{c &gt; 0}\frac{S(m,n;c)}{c} J_{k-1}\left(\frac{4\pi \sqrt{mn}}{c}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta function]], &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kloosterman sum]] and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">'''Predictive intake modelling''' uses [[mathematical model]]ling strategies to estimate intake of food, [[personal care]] products, and their [[Formulations#Other examples of product formulations|formulations]].

== Definition ==

Predictive intake modelling seeks to estimate intake of products and/or their constituents which may enter the body through various routes such as ingestion, [[inhalation]] and [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]].

Predictive intake modelling can be applied to determine trends in food consumption and product use for the purpose of [[extrapolation]].

== Applications ==

A predictive intake modelling approach is used to estimate voluntary food intake (VFI) by animals where their eating habits cannot be exactly measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hackmann T.

Predictive intake modelling has applications in [[public health]], [[Risk assessment#Risk assessment and human health|risk assessment]] and [[exposure assessment]], where estimating intake or exposure to different substances can influence the decision making process.

== Predictive intake modelling strategies ==

=== Regression approach ===

The [[regression analysis]] approach is based on estimations through extrapolation or interpolation where there is a cause-and-effect relationship found by data fitting.  These trends tend to be [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]].

=== Mechanistic modelling approach ===

A mechanistic modelling approach is one where a model is derived from basic theory. Examples of these include compartmental models which can be used to describe the circulation and concentration of airborne particles in a room or household for estimating intake of inhalants.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singal, "RIFM 2-Box Indoor Air Dispersion Model Is An Alternative Method To Calculate Inhalation Exposure To Fragrance," Research Institute for Fragrance Materials, 2012. [Online]. Available: http://www.rifm.org/press-detail.php?id=68. [Accessed: 28-Nov-2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population-based approach ===

A population-based approach tracks consumer intake from individual members of a sample population over time. Mathematical models are used to combine these habits and practices databases with separate databases on product or food formulation to estimate intake or exposure for the sample population. Moreover, [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|survey weights]] may be applied to each subject in the study based on their age, demographic and location allowing the sample of subjects to correctly represent an entire population, and thus estimate intake for that population.

=== Probabilistic modelling approach ===
Probabilistic models are based on the [[Monte Carlo methods|Monte Carlo]] method where distributions of data from various sources are randomly sampled from to calculate percentile statistics. Such probabilistic techniques typically utilise product or consumption survey data from a sample population combined with distributions of substances that may be found within those foods or products. For example, [[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA)|The Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) suggest that the estimation of intake of substances in food can be probabilistically conducted through food consumption surveys ([[NHANES]]/[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=7764 CSFII]) from sample populations combined with distributions of substance concentration data to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, "Guidance for Industry: Estimating Dietary Intake of Substances in Food," 2006.

[Accessed: 24-Feb-2014].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) funded the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool to estimate usual intake exposure distributions based on statistical models which utilise the EFSA Comprehensive Database, which contains detailed food consumption survey data.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Wapperoma, and H. van der Voet, "A European tool for usual intake distribution estimation in relation to data collection by EFSA," Bilthoven, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; EFSA also funded Creme Global to develop a model and databases of European food consumption on which statistical models can be run to assess intake and exposure on a pan-European basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vilone G. |author2=Comiskey D |author3=Heraud F |author4=O'Mahony C | year = 2014 | title = Statistical method to assess usual dietary intakes in the European population | url = | journal = Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 1639–51 | doi = 10.1080/19440049.2014.955886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4373">In [[game theory]], a '''princess and monster game''' is a [[pursuit-evasion]] game played by two players in a region. The game was devised by [[Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)|Rufus Isaacs]] and published in his book ''Differential Games'' (1965) as follows:

{{quote|The monster searches for the princess, the time required being the payoff. They are both in a totally dark room (of any shape), but they are each cognizant of its boundary. Capture means that the distance between the princess and the monster is within the capture radius, which is assumed to be small in comparison with the dimension of the room. The monster, supposed highly intelligent, moves at a known speed. We permit the princess full freedom of locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;R. Isaacs, Differential Games: A Mathematical Theory with Applications to Warfare and Pursuit, Control and Optimization, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1965), PP 349&amp;ndash;350.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This game remained a well-known open problem until it was solved by [[Shmuel Gal]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gal, SEARCH GAMES, Academic Press, New York (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shmuel79"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gal Shmuel |title=Search games with mobile and immobile hider |journal=SIAM J. Control Optim. |volume=17 |year=1979 |issue=1 |pages=99–122 |doi=10.1137/0317009 |mr=0516859}}&lt;/ref&gt; His optimal strategy for the princess is to move to a random location in the room and stay still for a time interval which is neither too short nor  too long, before going to another (independent) random location and repeating the procedure.&lt;ref name="Shmuel79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Garnaev |title=A Remark on the Princess and Monster Search Game |journal=Int. J. Game Theory |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=269–276 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF01253781 |url=http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/~kmms/garnaev/html/Downloads/1992bGT.pdf }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Chrobak |title=A princess swimming in the fog looking for a monster cow |journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=74–78 |year=2004 |doi=10.1145/992287.992304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed optimal search strategy, for the monster, is based on subdividing the room into many narrow rectangles, picking a rectangle at random and searching it in some specific way, after some time picking another rectangle randomly and independently, and so on.

Princess and monster games can be played on a pre-selected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. It can be demonstrated that for any finite graph an optimal [[Mixed strategy|mixed search strategy]] exists that results in a finite payoff. This game has been solved by [[Steve Alpern]] and independently by [[Mikhail Zelikin]] only for the very simple graph consisting of a single loop (a circle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. Alpern |title=The search game with mobile hiders on the circle |journal=Proceedings of the Conference on Differential Games and Control Theory |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. I. Zelikin|title=On a differential game with incomplete information |journal=Soviet Math. Dokl. |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the game on the unit interval (a graph with two nodes with a link in-between) has been estimated approximatively.

The game appears simple but is quite complicated. The obvious search strategy of starting at a random end and "sweeping" the whole interval as fast as possible guarantees a 0.75 expected capture time, and is not optimal. By utilising a more sophisticated mixed searcher and hider strategy, one can reduce the expected capture time by about 8.6%. This number would be quite close to the value of the game if someone was able to prove the optimality of the related strategy of the princess.&lt;ref&gt;S. Alpern, R. Fokkink, R. Lindelauf, and G. J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">In [[mathematics]], the '''Property P conjecture''' is a statement about [[3-manifold]]s obtained by [[Dehn surgery]] on a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] in the [[3-sphere]]. A knot in the 3-sphere is said to have '''Property P''' if every 3-manifold obtained by performing (non-trivial) Dehn surgery on the knot is not [[simply-connected]]. The conjecture states that all knots, except the unknot, have Property P.

Research on Property P was jump-started by [[R. H. Bing]], who popularized the name and conjecture.

This conjecture can be thought of as a first step to resolving the [[Poincaré conjecture]], since the [[Lickorish–Wallace theorem]] says any closed, orientable 3-manifold results from Dehn surgery on a link.

A proof was announced in 2004, as the combined result of efforts of mathematicians working in several different fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">In numerical analysis, the '''quasi-Newton inverse least squares method''' is a [[quasi-Newton method]] for [[root-finding algorithm|finding roots]] of functions of several variables. It was originally described by Degroote et al. in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Degroote |author2=R. Haelterman |author3=S. Annerel |author4=A. Swillens |author5=P. Segers |author6=J.

[[Newton's method]] for solving {{math|'''f'''('''x''') {{=}} '''0'''}} uses the [[Jacobian matrix]], {{math|'''J'''}}, at every iteration. However, computing this Jacobian is a difficult (sometimes even impossible) and expensive operation. The idea behind the quasi-Newton inverse least squares method is to build up an approximate Jacobian based on known input–output pairs of the function {{math|'''f'''}}.

Haelterman et al. also showed that when the quasi-Newton inverse least squares method is applied to a linear system of size {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n''}}, it converges in at most {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} steps, although like all quasi-Newton methods, it may not converge for nonlinear systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2013.08.020|author1=R.

'''Reproducibility''' is the closeness of the agreement between the results of [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal). Reproducibilty can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] to check, that the results are not an artefact of the measurment procedures.&lt;ref name=GUM&gt;{{Citation

The values obtained from distinct experimental trials are said to be ''commensurate'' if they are obtained according to the same reproducible experimental description and procedure. The basic idea can be seen in [[Aristotle]]'s dictum that there is no scientific knowledge of the [[singleton (mathematics)|individual]], where the word used for ''individual'' in Greek had the connotation of the ''idiosyncratic'', or wholly isolated occurrence. Thus all knowledge, all science, necessarily involves the formation of general concepts and the invocation of their corresponding symbols in language (cf. Turner). Aristotle′s conception about the knowledge of the individual being considered unscientific is due to lack of the field of [[statistics]] in his time, so he could not appeal to statistical averaging by the individual.

A particular experimentally obtained value is said to be reproducible if there is a high degree of agreement between [[measurements]] or observations conducted on [[Replication (statistics)|replicate]] specimens in different locations by different people—that is, if the experimental value is found to have a high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/E177.htm|title = Standard Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods|year = 2014|author = Subcommittee E11.20 on Test Method Evaluation and Quality Control|publisher = ASTM International|id = ASTM E177}}{{Paywall}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in science, a very well reproduced result is one that can be confirmed using as many ''different'' experimental setups as possible and as many lines of evidence as possible ([[consilience]]).

==History==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump was, in terms of the 17th Century, a complicated and expensive scientific apparatus, making reproducibility of results difficult]]
The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]], in England in the 17th century. Boyle's [[air pump]] was designed to generate and study [[vacuum]], which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. [[History of science|Historians of science]] e.g. [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], in their 1985 book ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the [[experimental method]], maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.

The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] built his own air pump in [[Amsterdam]], the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time [[Robert Hooke]]. Huygens reported an effect he termed "anomalous suspension", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, “it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump”. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that “the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]] noted briefly in his famous 1934 book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' that “non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science”.&lt;ref&gt;This citation is from the 1959 translation to English, [[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistics|Statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote in his 1935 book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of [[hypothesis testing]] and [[statistical significance]], that “we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]], ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', (1971) [1935](9th ed.), Macmillan, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assertions express a common [[dogma]] in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.

==Reproducible data==

Reproducibility is one component of the precision of a measurement or test method.  The other component is [[repeatability]] which is the degree of agreement of tests or measurements on replicate specimens by the same observer in the same laboratory.  Both repeatability and reproducibility are usually reported as a [[standard deviation]].  A reproducibility limit is the value below which the difference between two test results obtained under reproducibility conditions may be expected to occur with a probability of approximately 0.95 (95%).&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"/&gt;

Reproducibility is determined from controlled interlaboratory test programs or a [[measurement systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E691  Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM F1469  Standard Guide for Conducting a Repeatability and Reproducibility Study on Test Equipment for Nondestructive Testing&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are often confused, there is an important distinction between replicates and an independent repetition of an experiment. Replicates are performed within an experiment. They are not and cannot provide independent evidence of reproducibility. Rather they serve as an internal "check" on an experiment and should not be shown as part of the experimental results within a scientific publication. It is the independent repetition of an experiment that serves to underpin its reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaux | first1 = D.

==Reproducible research==

{{see also|Open research computation}}

The term ''reproducible research'' refers to the idea that the ultimate product of [[academic research]] is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kühne | first1 = Martin | last2 = Liehr | first2 = Andreas W. | year = 2009 | title = Improving the Traditional Information Management in Natural Sciences | doi = 10.2481/dsj.8.18 | format = PDF | journal = Data Science Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 18–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fomel | first1 = Sergey | authorlink2 = Jon Claerbout | last2 = Claerbout | first2 = Jon | year = 2009 | title = Guest Editors' Introduction: Reproducible Research | url = https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4720217 | format = PDF | journal = Computing in Science and Engineering | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 5–7 | doi = 10.1109/MCSE.2009.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buckheit1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 = | title = The Yale Law School Round Table on Data and Core Sharing: "Reproducible Research" | url = | journal = Computing in Science and Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 8–12 | doi = 10.1109/MCSE.2010.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marwick| first1 = Ben|  year = 2016 |title = Computational reproducibility in archaeological research: Basic principles and a case study of their implementation | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9 | journal = Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory | volume =  | issue = | pages =  | doi = 10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=Steven N.|last2=Fanelli|first2=Daniele|last3=Ioannidis|first3=John P.

Psychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results. Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J.

Fewer than half of the attempted replications were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, which began with the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the [[EQUATOR Network]]. This group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Waste/EQUATOR Conference {{!}} Research Waste|url = http://researchwaste.net/research-wasteequator-conference/|website = researchwaste.net|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially biomedical research.

Reproducible research is key to new discoveries in [[pharmacology]]. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = F. | last2 = Schlange | first2 = T. | last3 = Asadullah | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1038/nrd3439-c1 | title = Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets? | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 712 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21892149| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study by Begley and Ellis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that reviewed a decade of research. That study found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were irreproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Begley | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = L.

A. Ioannidis]] writes, "While currently there is unilateral emphasis on 'first' discoveries, there should be as much emphasis on replication of discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3342867/Is-the-spirit-of-Piltdown-man-alive-and-well.html Is the spirit of Piltdown man alive and well?]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nature'' study was itself reproduced in the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]'', which confirmed that a majority of cancer researchers surveyed had been unable to reproduce a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mobley | first1 = A. | last2 = Linder | first2 = S.

In 2016, ''Nature'' conducted a survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. According to the survey, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. "Although 52% of those surveyed agree there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think failure to reproduce published results means the result is probably wrong, and most say they still trust the published literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Monya | year = | title =  1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 533 | issue = | pages = 452–454 | doi = 10.1038/533452a | bibcode = 2016Natur.533..452B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy irreproducible results==
[[Hideyo Noguchi]] became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of [[syphilis]], but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.{{citation needed|reason=Needs to be verifiable, otherwise it is anecdotal. Wild claims need citations. |date=August 2015}}

In March 1989, [[University of Utah]] chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process ("[[cold fusion]]"). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an [[electrolysis]] cell containing [[heavy water]] and a [[palladium]] [[cathode]] which rapidly absorbed the [[deuterium]] produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see [[science by press conference]]). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physicists Debunk Claim Of a New Kind of Fusion|newspaper=New York Times|last=Browne|first=Malcolm|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/050399sci-cold-fusion.html|date=3 May 1989|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over {{convert|25|mi|km}} away [[Wireless energy transfer|without using wires]]. In 1904 he built [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] on [[Shoreham, New York|Long Island]] to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret (1999), ''Tesla Master of Lightning'', New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books,  {{ISBN|0-7607-1005-8}}, pp. 107.; "Unable to overcome his financial burdens, he was forced to close the laboratory in 1905."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:
* [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency]], revealed to be the result of fraud
* [[GFAJ-1]], a bacterium that could purportedly incorporate [[arsenic biochemistry|arsenic]] into its DNA in place of phosphorus
* [[MMR vaccine controversy]] – a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' claiming the MMR vaccine caused autism was revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Schön scandal]] – semiconductor "breakthroughs" revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Power posing]] – a [[social psychology]] phenomenon that went viral after being the subject of a very popular [[TED talk]], but was unable to be replicated in dozens of studies&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stochastic processes==
The reproducibility requirement cannot be applied to individual samples of phenomena which have a partially or totally non-deterministic nature.  However, it still applies to the probabilistic description of such phenomena, with error tolerance given by probability theory.

[[File:Sangaku of Konnoh Hachimangu 1859.jpg|thumb|A Sangaku dedicated to Konnoh Hachimangu ([[Shibuya, Tokyo]]) in 1859.]]
'''Sangaku''' or '''San Gaku''' (算額; lit. translation: calculation tablet) are Japanese [[Euclidean geometry|geometrical]] problems or theorems on wooden tablets which were placed as offerings at [[Shinto shrine]]s or [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] during the [[Edo period]] by members of all social classes.

==History==
[[File:Sangaku at Enmanji.jpg|thumb|A Sangaku dedicated at Emmanji Temple in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]]]
The Sangaku were painted in color on wooden tablets ([[Ema (Shinto)|ema]]) and hung in the precincts of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines as offerings to the kami and buddhas, as challenges to the congregants, or as displays of the solutions to questions. Many of these tablets were lost during the period of [[modernization]] that followed the Edo period, but around nine hundred are known to remain.

[[Fujita Kagen]] (1765&amp;ndash;1821), a Japanese mathematician of prominence, published the first collection of ''sangaku'' problems, his ''Shimpeki Sampo'' (Mathematical problems Suspended from the Temple) in 1790, and in 1806 a sequel, the ''Zoku Shimpeki Sampo''.

During this period [[Japan]] applied strict regulations  to commerce and foreign relations for western countries so the tablets were created using [[Japanese mathematics]], (''[[wasan]]''), developed in parallel to western mathematics. For example, the connection between an integral and its derivative (the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]) was unknown, so Sangaku problems on areas and volumes were solved by expansions in [[infinite series]] and term-by-term calculation.

A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the [[Gunma Prefecture]], covers the relationship of three touching circles with a common [[tangent]]. Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the size of the small circle between them? ''The answer is:'' &lt;!-- Info from ScAm May98 article --&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{middle}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{left}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{right}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

(See also [[Ford circle]].)

===In the west===
[[Soddy's hexlet]], thought previously to have been discovered in the west in 1937, has been discovered on a Sangaku dating from 1822.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">In [[ring theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Skolem–Noether theorem''' characterizes the [[automorphism]]s of [[simple ring]]s. It is a fundamental result in the theory of [[central simple algebra]]s.

The theorem was first published by [[Thoralf Skolem]] in 1927 in his paper ''Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme'' ([[German language|German]]: ''On the theory of associative number systems'') and later rediscovered by [[Emmy Noether]].

== Statement ==
In a general formulation, let ''A'' and ''B'' be simple unitary rings, and let ''k'' be the centre of ''B''. Notice that ''k'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] since given ''x'' nonzero in ''k'', the simplicity of ''B'' implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal ''BxB = (x)'' is the whole of ''B'', and hence that ''x'' is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]]. If the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of ''B'' over ''k'' is finite, i.e. if ''B'' is a [[central simple algebra]] of finite dimension, and ''A'' is also a ''k''-algebra, then given ''k''-algebra homomorphisms

:''f'', ''g'' : ''A'' → ''B'',

there exists a unit ''b'' in ''B'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A''&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008) p.173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farb|first=Benson|title=Noncommutative Algebra|year=1993|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387940571|author2=Dennis, R. Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''g''(''a'') = ''b'' · ''f''(''a'') · ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In particular, every [[automorphism]] of a central simple ''k''-algebra is an [[inner automorphism]].&lt;ref name=GS40&gt;Gille &amp; Szamuely (2006) p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lor174&gt;Lorenz (2008) p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proof ==
First suppose &lt;math&gt;B = \operatorname{M}_n(k) = \operatorname{End}_k(k^n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''f'' and ''g'' define the actions of ''A'' on &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;; let &lt;math&gt;V_f, V_g&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''A''-modules thus obtained. Any two simple ''A''-modules are isomorphic and &lt;math&gt;V_f, V_g&lt;/math&gt; are finite direct sums of simple ''A''-modules. Since they have the same dimension, it follows that there is an isomorphism of ''A''-modules &lt;math&gt;b: V_g \to V_f&lt;/math&gt;. But such ''b'' must be an element of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{M}_n(k) = B&lt;/math&gt;. For the general case, note that &lt;math&gt;B \otimes B^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix algebra and thus by the first part this algebra has an element ''b'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;(f \otimes 1)(a \otimes z) = b (g \otimes 1)(a \otimes z) b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in B^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, we find
:&lt;math&gt;1 \otimes z = b (1\otimes z) b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''z''. That is to say, ''b'' is in &lt;math&gt;Z_{B \otimes B^{\text{op}}}(k \otimes B^{\text{op}}) = B \otimes k&lt;/math&gt; and so we can write &lt;math&gt;b = b' \otimes 1&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;z = 1&lt;/math&gt; this time we find
:&lt;math&gt;f(a)= b' g(a) {b'^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is what was sought.

== Background and employment ==
An exact timeline for Susan Brown's career has been difficult to pin down, but a newsletter published by Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at [[University College London|UCL]] shortly after her death offers a framework for her career achievements and highlights the esteem in which she was held by colleagues and students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/newsletter/professor-susan-brown|title=Professor Susan Brown|date=2018-01-02|website=University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her undergraduate degree in mathematics was from [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]].  For about two years more years she continued studies at Oxford, in theoretical [[fluid mechanics]]  --  and she then moved to the [[University of durham|University of Durham]] to complete her DPhil in 1964.  During this time she held temporary Lectureships at both [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] and in 1964 began a Lectureship that started her long association with [[University College London|UCL]].  From her Lectureship she advanced to a Readership in 1971 and was appointed to a Professorship in 1986.  The [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/newsletter/professor-susan-brown afore-mentioned departmental newsletter] that recapped her accomplishments after her death expresses the belief that Brown was the first female in the UK to be appointed to a professorship in Mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516093028/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/women-in-mathematics| url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/women-in-mathematics|date=1 May 2015|title= UCL Women in Mathematics|archive-date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Brown's department described her as an outstanding teacher and someone with an international reputation for her research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  She had a productive partnership in fluid dynamics with [[University College London|UCL]] colleague [[Keith Stewartson]] -- who also arrived at [[University College London|UCL]] in 1964. Quoting from the afore-mentioned departmental newsletter, " Together they published 29 papers and pioneered early developments of 'triple-deck' theory, which, in turn, enabled resolution of long-standing questions in steady and unsteady trailing-edge flows, and addressed associated important aerodynamic applications. Another area for which Professor Brown was especially renowned was a series of discussions of critical layers, especially effects of viscosity and nonlinearity and applications to geophysical flows such as atmospheric jets."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Google-[https://scholar.google.com/ Scholar] lists numerous papers for the pair "SN Brown, K Stewartson" and several of these are listed below.

==Death==
Brown died on 11 August 2017, aged 79, in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimes-uk/obituary.aspx?n=susan-north-brown&amp;pid=186452746|title=Susan North Brown's Obituary on The Times|last=|first=|date=|website=The Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Swiss cheese''' is a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the [[complex plane]] obtained by removing from a [[closure (mathematics)|closed disc]] some countable [[Union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set|open discs]], usually with some restriction on the centres and radii of the removed discs. Traditionally the deleted discs should have pairwise disjoint closures which are subsets of the interior of the starting disc, the sum of the radii of the deleted discs should be finite, and the Swiss cheese should have empty interior. This is the type of Swiss cheese originally introduced by the Swiss mathematician [[Alice Roth]].

More generally, a Swiss cheese may be all or part of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; or of an even more complicated [[manifold]] &amp;ndash; with "holes" in it.

'''Sylvia D. Trimble Bozeman''' (''née'' '''Sylvia Trimble''', 1947) is an American mathematician and mathematics educator.&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;''Notable Women in Mathematics, a Biographical Dictionary'', edited by Charlene Morrow and Teri Perl, Greenwood Press, 1998. pp 17–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in rural Alabama, Bozeman attended segregated primary and secondary schools in [[Camp Hill, Alabama|Camp Hill]], and was encouraged by her teachers and parents to continue her education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75bnncOVqEIC|title=Black Women Scientists in the United States|last=Warren|first=Wini|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253336031|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bozeman did her undergraduate studies in mathematics at [[Alabama A&amp;M University]], during which she also worked on summer projects at [[NASA]] and [[Harvard University]]. She graduated in 1968 as salutatorian and moved with her husband Robert, also a mathematician, to non-segregated [[Vanderbilt University]], where they both began their graduate studies. She earned a master's degree in 1970, despite not having studied much of the prerequisite coursework that her white classmates had. The Bozemans had a son and a daughter while Sylvia taught part-time at Vanderbilt and [[Tennessee State University]] and Robert finished his doctoral studies in mathematics.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1974, Bozeman took a teaching position at [[Spelman College]], a college for Black women in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; Robert was then teaching at Morehouse College, another [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically Black college]]. While there, she worked under [[Shirley McBay|Shirley Mathis McBay]], [[Etta Zuber Falconer]], and [[Gladys Glass]], mathematicians and chemists who were pushing to improve Spelman's science and mathematics programs. In 1976, Bozeman took up graduate studies again at [[Emory University]] while continuing to hold a position at Spelman. She earned her doctorate in 1980 from Emory, under the supervision of Luis Kramarz and [[John Neuberger]]; her thesis was titled ''Representations of Generalized Inverses of Fredholm Operators''.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Sylvia D. Trimble Bozeman|id=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bozeman continues to work as a professor at Spelman, and has also held the position of vice provost there.&lt;ref name="bwim"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/bozeman_sylviat.html|title=Sylvia T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">In mathematical [[set theory]], a '''transitive model''' is a [[Model theory|model]] of set theory that is [[Inner model|standard and transitive]]. Standard means that the membership relation is the usual one, and transitive means that the model is a [[transitive set]] or class.

==Examples==
*An [[inner model]] is a transitive model containing all ordinals.
*A countable transitive model (CTM) is, as the name suggests, a transitive model with a countable number of elements.

==Properties==
 
If ''M'' is a transitive model, then &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt; is the standard &amp;omega;. This implies that the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers of the model are also the same as their standard counterparts.   Each real number in a transitive model is a standard real number, although not all standard reals need be included in a particular transitive model.

In [[Euclidean plane]] [[geometry]], the '''van Lamoen circle''' is a special [[circle]] associated with any given [[triangle]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  It contains the [[circumcenter]]s of the six triangles that are defined inside &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by its three [[median (geometry)|median]]s.&lt;ref name=kimberlingX1153/&gt;&lt;ref name=wolframVLC/&gt;

Specifically, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be its [[centroid]] (the intersection of its three medians).  Let &lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M_c&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoints of the sidelines &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CA&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. It turns out that the circumcenters of the six triangles &lt;math&gt;AGM_c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BGM_c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; BGM_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CGM_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CGM_b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;AGM_b&lt;/math&gt; lie on a common circle, which is the van Lamoen circle of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=wolframVLC/&gt;

==History==

The van Lamoen circle is named after the mathematician [[Floor van Lamoen]] who posed it as a problem in 2000.&lt;ref name=lamoen2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=liVLC/&gt; A proof was provided by [[Kin Y. Li]] in 2001,&lt;ref name=liVLC/&gt; and the editors of the Amer. Math. Monthly in 2002.&lt;ref name=kimberlingX1153/&gt;&lt;ref name=lamoen2002/&gt;

==Properties==

The center of the van Lamoen circle is point &lt;math&gt;X(1153)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Clark Kimberling]]'s [[Kimberling center|comprehensive list]] of [[triangle center]]s.&lt;ref name=kimberlingX1153/&gt;

In 2003, [[Alexey Myakishev]] and [[Peter Y. Woo]] proved that the converse of the theorem is nearly true, in the following sense: let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be any point in the triangle's interior, and &lt;math&gt;AA'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;CC'&lt;/math&gt; be its [[cevian]]s, that is, the [[line segment]]s that connect each vertex to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and are extended until each meets the opposite side.  Then the circumcenters of the six triangles &lt;math&gt;APB'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;APC'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BPC'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; BPA'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CPA'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;CPB'&lt;/math&gt; lie on the same circle if and only if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the centroid of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; or its [[orthocenter]] (the intersection of its three [[altitude (triangle)|altitudes]]).&lt;ref name=makwooVLC/&gt;  A simpler proof of this result was given by [[Nguyen Minh Ha]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=haVLC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12662">In [[mathematics]], a '''vector measure''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a [[family of sets]] and taking [[vector space|vector]] values satisfying certain properties. It is a generalization of the concept of finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], which takes [[nonnegative]] [[real number|real]] values only.

==Definitions and first consequences==
Given a [[field of sets]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Banach space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a '''finitely additive vector measure''' (or '''measure''', for short) is a function &lt;math&gt;\mu:\mathcal {F} \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that for any two [[disjoint set]]s &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; one has

: &lt;math&gt;\mu(A\cup B) =\mu(A) + \mu (B).&lt;/math&gt;

A vector measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''countably additive''' if for any [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(A_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of disjoint sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; such that their union is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; it holds that

: &lt;math&gt;\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) =\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[series (mathematics)|series]] on the right-hand side convergent in the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the Banach space &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proved that an additive vector measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;  is countably additive if and only if for any sequence  &lt;math&gt;(A_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; as above one has

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i\right)\right\|=0, \qquad\qquad (*)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is the norm on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;

Countably additive vector measures defined on [[sigma-algebra]]s are more general than finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s, finite [[signed measure]]s, and [[complex measure]]s, which are [[countably additive function]]s taking values respectively on the real interval &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty), &lt;/math&gt; the set of [[real number]]s, and the set of [[complex number]]s.

==Examples==
Consider the field of sets made up of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; together with  the family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Lebesgue measurable set]]s  contained in this interval. For any such set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, define

: &lt;math&gt;\mu(A)=\chi_A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt; Depending on where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is declared to take values, we get two different outcomes.

* &lt;math&gt;\mu,&lt;/math&gt; viewed as a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; to the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;-space]] &lt;math&gt;L^\infty([0, 1]),&lt;/math&gt; is a vector measure which is not countably-additive.
* &lt;math&gt;\mu,&lt;/math&gt; viewed as a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; to the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;L^1([0, 1]),&lt;/math&gt; is a countably-additive vector measure.

Both of these statements follow quite easily from the criterion (*) stated above.

==The variation of a vector measure==
Given a vector measure &lt;math&gt;\mu:\mathcal{F}\to X,&lt;/math&gt; the '''variation'''  &lt;math&gt;|\mu|&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;|\mu|(A)=\sup \sum_{i=1}^n \|\mu(A_i)\|&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[supremum]] is taken over all the [[partition of a set|partitions]]

: &lt;math&gt;A=\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i&lt;/math&gt;

of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into a finite number of disjoint sets, for all &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is the norm on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;

The variation of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely additive function taking values in &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty].&lt;/math&gt; It holds that

: &lt;math&gt;\|\mu(A)\|\le |\mu|(A)&lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;|\mu|(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, the measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is said to be of '''bounded variation'''. One can prove that if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a vector measure of bounded variation, then &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is countably additive if and only if &lt;math&gt;|\mu|&lt;/math&gt; is countably additive.

==Lyapunov's theorem==
In the theory of vector measures, ''[[Alexey Lyapunov|Lyapunov]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'s theorem&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' states that the range of a ([[atom (measure theory)|non-atomic]]) vector&amp;nbsp;measure is [[closed set|closed]] and [[convex set|convex]].&lt;ref name="KluvanekKnowles"&gt;[[Igor Kluvánek|Kluvánek, I.]], Knowles, G., ''Vector Measures and Control Systems'', North-Holland Mathematics Studies&amp;nbsp;'''20''', Amsterdam, 1976.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concept of a convex&amp;nbsp;set (i.e., a set containing the segment connecting any two of its points) had repeatedly been placed at the center of economic&amp;nbsp;theory before&amp;nbsp;1964. It appeared in a new&amp;nbsp;light with the introduction of integration&amp;nbsp;theory in the study of economic&amp;nbsp;competition: If&lt;!-- original "if" inconsistent with our capitization  --&gt; one associates with every&amp;nbsp;agent of an economy an arbitrary&amp;nbsp;set in the commodity&amp;nbsp;space and ''if one averages those individual&amp;nbsp;sets'' over a collection of insignificant agents, ''then the resulting set is necessarily convex''. [Debreu appends this footnote: "On this direct consequence of a theorem of A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Lyapunov, see {{harvtxt|Vind|1964}}."] But explanations of the &lt;!-- three --&gt; ... functions of prices &lt;!-- taken as examples --&gt; ... can be made to rest&amp;nbsp;on the ''convexity of sets derived by that averaging&amp;nbsp;process''. ''Convexity'' in the commodity&amp;nbsp;space ''obtained by aggregation'' over a collection of insignificant&amp;nbsp;agents is an insight that economic&amp;nbsp;theory owes &lt;!-- in its revealing clarity --&gt; ... to integration&amp;nbsp;theory.

==Career==
On 29 April 1876, Mollison was elected a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[Clare College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotchmen at Cambridge University |work=The Dundee Courier &amp; Argus |issue=7103 |date=1 May 1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an examiner for the [[University of St Andrews]] between 1876 and 1880.&lt;ref name="Year Book" /&gt; He was a mathematics [[lecturer]] at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] from 1877 to 1882, and at Clare College from 1882.&lt;ref name="WWW" /&gt; In addition to his college teaching, he was a private tutor or "coach" in mathematics.&lt;ref name="CAA" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Mollison was married to Ellen Mayhew. Together they had one son and one daughter. His wife died in 1917, and he provided the endowment for the [[Mayhew Prize]], a mathematics prize awarded by the University of Cambridge, in her honour.&lt;ref name="WWW" /&gt; His son, William Mayhew Mollison, was a distinguished ear, nose and throat surgeon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mollison, William Mayhew (1878 - 1967) |url=https://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/client/en_GB/lives/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ASSET$002f0$002f340476/one?qu=Mollison%2C+William+Mayhew&amp;te=ASSET |website=Plarr's Lives of the Fellows |publisher=The Royal College of Surgeons of England |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en |date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[Patrick Mollison]], a noted haematologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Professor Patrick Mollison |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9023652/Professor-Patrick-Mollison.html |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casio AX-120V.JPG|thumb|An [[electronic calculator]] with '''zero suppression''', showing 123 instead of 000000000123]]'''Zero suppression''' is the removal of [[redundancy (information theory)|redundant]] [[zeroes]] from a number. This can be done for storage, page or display space constraints or formatting reasons, such as making a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] more legible.&lt;ref name=bldr/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;

==Examples==
*00049823 → 49823
*7.678600000 → 7.6786
*0032.3231000 → 32.3231
*2.45000×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; → 2.45×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
*0.0045×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; → 4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

One must be careful; in [[physics]] and related disciplines, trailing zeros are used to indicate the [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] of the number, as an error of ±1 in the last place is assumed. Examples:
* 4.5981 is 4.5981&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.0001
* 4.59810 is 4.5981&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.00001
* 4.598100 is 4.5981&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.000001{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Data compression==
It is also a way to store a large array of numbers, where many of the entries are zero.  By omitting the zeroes, and instead storing the indices along with the values of the non-zero items, less space may be used in total.  It only makes sense if the extra space used for storing the indices (on average) is smaller than the space saved by not storing the zeroes. This is sometimes used in a [[sparse array]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Example:
*Original array: 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
*Pairs of index and data: {2,1}, {5,2}, {6,5}, {10,4}
