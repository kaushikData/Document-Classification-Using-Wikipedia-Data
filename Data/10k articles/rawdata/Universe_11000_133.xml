At least 9 people were detained by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/26/us-china-sinopec-blasts-idUSBRE9AP02N20131126|title=Police detain nine after Qingdao oil blasts|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-350031120.html|title=22 Killed in Chinal Oil Pipe Explosion|agency=[[Fars News Agency]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events Leading to Accident ==

*The pipeline ruptured and leaked for about 15 minutes onto a street and into the sea before it was shut off.
*Hours later, as workers cleaned up the spill, the oil caught fire and exploded in two locations
*Oil had seeped into underground utility pipes, which could have been a factor in the blasts
*Oil also caught fire as it spread over the sea

== Findings ==

*Energy Pipeline networks and cities expanding rapidly bringing them closer – This provides opportunity for thieves and also leaving lines dangerously close to general public
*No nationwide database for pipelines
*In effective investigation procedures - Pipeline investigation was completed in September 2013 – but after the explosion the effectiveness of Pipeline investigation remains questionable
*[[Sinopec]] completed QHSE checks across all its facilities and found 8000 safety problems ranging from Oil and Gas Well management through to standards at rented oil storage facilities
*Subsequent nationwide pipeline safety check found similar corrosion problems throughout the nation’s pipeline network

'''Alcator C-Mod''' was a [[tokamak]] (a type of [[Magnetic confinement fusion|magnetically confined fusion]] device) that operated between 1991 and 2016 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) [[MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center|Plasma Science and Fusion Center]] (PSFC).  Notable for its high toroidal magnetic field (of up to 8 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]]), Alcator C-Mod holds the world record for volume averaged plasma pressure in a magnetically confined fusion device.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Until its shutdown in 2016, it was one of the major fusion research facilities in the United States.

Alcator C-Mod was the third of the Alcator ('''''Al'''to '''Ca'''mpo '''Tor'''o'', High Field Torus) tokamak series, following Alcator A (1973–1979) and Alcator C (1978–1987). It was the largest fusion reactor operated by any university and was an integral part of the larger Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

== History ==

=== Alcator A ===
In the late 1960s, magnetic-confinement fusion research at MIT was carried out on small-scale "table-top" experiments at the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory for Electronics]] and the [[Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory]]. At this time, the [[Soviet Union]] was developing a tokamak (though this was unknown in the United States), and [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] (PPPL) was developing the [[stellarator]].

[[Bruno Coppi]] was working at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]] and was interested in the basic plasma physics problem of plasma resistivity at high values of the [[streaming parameter]], as well as the behavior of magnetically confined plasmas at very high field strengths (≥&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;T). In 1968, Coppi attended the third [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research at [[Novosibirsk]]. At this conference, Soviet scientists announced that they had achieved electron temperatures of over 1000&amp;nbsp;eV in a tokamak device ([[T-3 (tokamak)|T-3]]).

This same year, Coppi was named a full professor in the [[MIT Physics Department|MIT Department of Physics]]. He immediately collaborated with engineers at the [[Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory]], led by Bruce Montgomery, to design a compact (0.54&amp;nbsp;m major radius), high-field (10&amp;nbsp;T on axis) tokamak which he titled '''Alcator'''. The name is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] of the Italian '''''Al'''to '''Ca'''mpo '''Tor'''o'', which means "high-field torus". With the later construction of Alcator C and then Alcator C-Mod, the original Alcator was [[retronym|retroactively renamed]] to Alcator A.

Alcator was approved by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) in 1970 and was first operated in 1972. Performance problems (poor-quality vacuum and arcing in toroidal field magnets) led to the rebuilding of the machine in 1973–1974 with a new vacuum vessel, with scientific results beginning in 1974. Alcator A was powered by the Bitter Laboratory's 32&amp;nbsp;MW DC [[motor-generator]]s and was the first tokamak in the world to use an air-core transformer for ohmic current drive and heating.

=== Alcator B and C ===
The success of Alcator A led to the conceptual design, beginning in 1975, of a larger machine called Alcator B. However, the motor-generators used for Alcator A were not powerful enough to drive the new machine, necessitating the purchase and installation of new power supplies, a cost that the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA) was unwilling to fund. ERDA was, however, enthusiastic about building another Alcator, and a solution was found: a 225&amp;nbsp;MVA alternator was donated to MIT by [[Consolidated Edison|Con Ed]] from a plant on the East River in New York City. The conceptual design was changed to accommodate the different power supply, and the project was renamed to Alcator C.

Alcator C was officially authorized in 1976. This same year, the [[MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center|Plasma Fusion Center]] (now the Plasma Science and Fusion Center) was spun off from the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory. Construction of Alcator C proceeded rapidly and initial tests were conducted at the end of 1977. The alternator arrived from Con Ed in early 1978 (its transport was complicated by the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|blizzard of 1978]]) and was incorporated into the system in the summer of 1978. Scientific operations began in September of that year.

Alcator C was a larger machine (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.64&amp;nbsp;m) and operated at a higher field (''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;T) than Alcator A. With the addition of 4&amp;nbsp;MW of [[Lower hybrid oscillation|lower hybrid heating]] in 1982, electron temperatures over 3.0&amp;nbsp;keV were reached. While Alcator C did not originally have the energy confinement time expected, due to the onset of ion temperature gradient turbulence at high values of &lt;math&gt;\eta = \text{d} \ln T / \text{d} \ln n&lt;/math&gt;, pellet fueling was used to produce peaked density profiles and values of the [[Lawson criterion|''n''τ product]] of over 0.8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; were achieved in 1983.

=== Unfunded ideas and the C-Mod proposal ===
Several ideas for new devices and upgrades at the PSFC were never funded. From 1978 to 1980, a design activity was carried out for Alcator&amp;nbsp;D, a larger version of Alcator&amp;nbsp;C that would allow for more heating power, and possibly even deuterium–tritium (D–T) operation. This design was never formally proposed to the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), but continued to evolve under Coppi's direction, eventually becoming the Italian–Russian [[IGNITOR]] device planned for construction at [[TRINITY]] near [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast|Troitsk]], Russia.

In 1982, another more ambitious device called Alcator DCT was conceived. This machine would have superconducting coils producing 7&amp;nbsp;T on axis. 4&amp;nbsp;MW of lower hybrid current drive would drive a steady-state plasma with 1.4&amp;nbsp;MA plasma current. As this design was similar to the French [[Tore Supra]], a joint French–American workshop was held in [[Cadarache]] in 1983 to compare the two designs and exchange ideas. Alcator DCT was formally proposed to the DOE in late 1983 but was not funded.

At that time, the budget for magnetic fusion energy research in the United States had been increasing year-over-year, reaching a peak of $468.4&amp;nbsp;million in fiscal 1984. That year, the PSFC was notified that for a time, budgets would be falling, and DOE policy would be to only fund upgrades to existing devices, not new machines. Thus, design work was begun on a copper-coil machine which would reuse some of the power supplies from Alcator&amp;nbsp;C, allowing the team to pitch it as a "modification" to Alcator&amp;nbsp;C. The conceptual design was completed and '''Alcator C-Mod''' was formally proposed to DOE in late 1985. The project was approved and construction was authorized in 1986.

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Alcator C-Mod Tokamak Interior.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the tokamak showing the molybdenum armor tiles on the wall. Three Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating antennas are visible – two on the left with two copper straps each, and the four-strap “field-aligned” antenna (installed 2011) at right.]]

=== Heating and current drive ===
Alcator C-Mod uses [[ion cyclotron resonance|ion cyclotron range frequencies (ICRF) heating]] as its primary auxiliary heating source. The source frequency is 80&amp;nbsp;MHz and the standard minority heating scenarios are D(H) for 4.4–6.9 T and D(3He) for high field operation (7.3–8.0 T).&lt;ref name=wuk/&gt; A minority species (Hydrogen or He3) is indicated, and ICRH scenarios use a two-component plasma.
       
Absorption efficiency varies with the minority concentration. It is also possible to transition between minority and mode conversion (MC) heating by varying the minority species concentration. The relative H fraction &lt;math&gt;\eta_H = n_H/(n_H+n_D)&lt;/math&gt; can be scanned from roughly 2–30% via gas puffing and measured using passive charge exchange.&lt;ref name=wuk/&gt; The relative He3 fraction &lt;math&gt;\eta_{He3} = n_{He3}/n_e&lt;/math&gt; concentration can also be scanned from roughly 2–30% via gas puffing. Phase contrast imaging (PCI) can be used to measure the mode converted waves directly in the plasma.

==== Minority heating ====
Minority heating is the most common scenario used at C-Mod. The ICRF heating system operates at 80&amp;nbsp;MHz in D(H) plasmas. This frequency corresponds to on-axis minority fundamental cyclotron resonance of protons at 5.3&amp;nbsp;T and absorbing fast waves by hydrogen minority species in a deuterium plasma. It can be very efficient (typical single pass absorption in C-Mod is 80–90% for minority concentrations of 5–10%).&lt;ref name=por/&gt; Minority heating at 80&amp;nbsp;MHz and 7.9&amp;nbsp;T in a deuterium majority plasma is achieved using the He3 minority resonance (on-axis), but single pass absorption with He3 minority ions in deuterium tends to be much lower than for protons&lt;ref name=por/&gt; (e.g. the minority heating scenario at 5.3–5.4 T).

==== Mode conversion heating ====
Mode conversion of a fast magnetosonic wave to an ion cyclotron wave and ion Bernstein wave in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) can be used to heat electrons. Mode conversion heating is done at C-Mod using the ICRF in D(3He) plasmas.&lt;ref name=wuk/&gt;

==== Lower hybrid current drive ====
Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) (based on [[Lower hybrid oscillation]]) is used to supplement the current driven by the Ohmic [[transformer]]. The LHCD system is capable of delivering 1.0+ MW of [[microwave]] power (planned upgrade to 2&amp;nbsp;MW or more with addition of a second antenna in 2013{{Update inline|date=October 2015}}) to the plasma at 4.6&amp;nbsp;GHz. Power is provided by 250&amp;nbsp;kW [[klystron]] microwave amplifiers manufactured by CPI, Inc. Non-[[Electromagnetic induction|inductive]] operation for up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;s pulses at 500&amp;nbsp;kA was achieved. Lower hybrid waves are launched preferentially in the direction opposite the plasma current (i.e. in the direction of electron travel) and deposit energy on electrons moving at approximately three times the [[thermal velocity]] via [[Landau damping]]. A major area of LHCD research has been in the area of current drive at the high densities (n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) required for a fusion power plant.

== 2013-2016 ==
Alcator C-Mod was slated to shut down in October 2013. However, the 2014 Congressional omnibus spending bill explicitly specified operation of the experiment, providing $22&amp;nbsp;million. The experimental operation was restarted in February 2014.

Funding was once again extended for FY 2015, although the omnibus bill that provided the funding explicitly stated that no funding would be provided beyond FY 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/fusion_budget_2015|title=Fusion Budget 2015: The Omnibus bill passed, Fusion budget lives to fight another year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusionfuture.org/|title=Information about FY2013 budget and Alcator C-Mod shutdown|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304185900/http://www.fusionfuture.org/|archivedate=2012-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Alcator C-Mod set a world record for plasma pressure in a magnetically confined fusion device, reaching 2.05 atmospheres – a 15 percent jump over the previous record of 1.77 atmospheres (also held by Alcator C-Mod).  This record plasma had a temperature of 35 million degrees C, lasted for 2 seconds, and yielded 600 trillion fusion reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/renewable-energy-ecology/fusion-energy-record-pressure-16102016|title=New record gets us closer to fusion energy|last=ANDREI|first=MIHAI|date=2016-10-17|work=|newspaper=ZME Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run involved operation with a toroidal magnetic field of 5.7 tesla. It reached this milestone on its final day of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/nuclear-fusion-record/45932|title=Under pressure: New world record set on path to nuclear fusion|last=Franco|first=Michael|date=October 14, 2016|website=newatlas.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of operations at the end of September 2016, the facility has been placed into safe shutdown, with no additional experiments planned at this time. There is a wealth of data archived from the more than 20 years of operations, and the experimental and theoretical teams continue to analyze the results and publish them in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/topics/alcator-c-mod-tokamak&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alcator C-Mod plasma pressure record of 2.05 atmosphere will likely hold for some time.  The only machine currently under construction that is predicted to break this record is the [[ITER]] tokamak in France. ITER is not expected to be fully operational until 2032, meaning that Alcator C-Mod's record will hold for 15 years unless another new device is constructed before then.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2016/alcator-c-mod-tokamak-nuclear-fusion-world-record-1014|title=New record for fusion|date= October 14, 2016|publisher= Plasma Science and Fusion Center|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''energy crisis in [[Armenia]]''', popularly known as the '''dark and cold years''' ({{lang-hy|Մութ ու ցուրտ տարիներ}}), refers to the energy crisis in Armenia during the 1990s, when the newly-independent Armenia's population lived in shortage of energy and basic consumer goods. Although it only lasted 3-4 years, it left a deep impact and impression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-01-24/news/1993024018_1_pipeline-azerbaijanis-armenia|title=Explosion of pipeline plunges Armenia into cold and dark|last=|first=|date=23 January 1993|work=|newspaper=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|access-date=2016-12-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local people have dubbed the years from 1992 to 1995 in different ways, such as "hungry", "cold", and "bad", but the most common title used is "the dark."

During this period, the population of [[Armenia]] and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] had to make do with well water, candles, and cut wood for their needs. Many creative solutions came to exist to deal with the severe lack of electricity (1-2 hours a day) and lack of other basic resources.

== The Energy Crisis ==
On 20 February 1988, the [[Karabakh movement]] officially started as the Supreme Council of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]], which was ethnically Armenian, voted to request to transfer its jurisdiction from [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On 7 December of the same year, an earthquake of 6.9 magnitude occurred centered in the town of Spitak in Armenia, leaving 25,000 people dead and 500,000 people homeless. The [[Metsamor NPP]], which was 100 km away from the epicenter of the earthquake, had had a safe shutdown, and had no damages according to the authorities and the [[IAEA]]. However, due to the panic that was raised afterwards and protests by the [[Green party of Armenia]], it was officially decided to shut down both units of Metsamor, the only nuclear power plant of Armenia providing about 36% of the electricity needs of the country at the time. Unit 1 of ANPP was shut down in February 1989 and Unit 2 followed in March 1989.&lt;ref name="daly"/&gt;

Armenian independence from the Soviet Union came on September 21, 1991, when the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|war over Nagorno-Karabakh]] was in full fledge. Armenia's energy supply during the Soviet Union was designed as an integrated part of the [[Trans-Caucasus electrical grid]]. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and because of the lack of internal energy supply, Armenia faced a critical situation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Turkey and Azerbaijan closed their borders with Armenia, putting a fuel embargo on the country. Azerbaijan blocked a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan which was flowing through Azerbaijan, effectively cutting off about 90% of the natural gas supply of the country.&lt;ref name="daly"/&gt; During the clash, which lasted until May 1994, Azerbaijan blockaded roads, rail lines and energy supplies, leading to severe energy shortages in Armenia.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt;

Attempt was made to direct gas pipelines from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to Armenia. However, Georgia's internal conflicts lent themselves to failure of the project on multiple occasions. From late January to mid-March 1993, Azerbaijani saboteurs blew up the gas pipeline that was crossing Marneuli, a region of Georgia populated with Azerbaijani, seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=TED Case Studies: Armenia and Nuclear|date=1995|accessdate=2017-02-25|url=http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/armenia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With thermal and nuclear power stations unable to function, Armenia was left to rely almost entirely on its hydro power resources, at a great environmental expense to one of the country’s greatest natural resources, [[Lake Sevan]].&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/01/30/armenias-good-life-lost-to-misery-darkness-cold/52d00f30-29bb-4508-9fba-bf543000e8ea/|title=ARMENIA'S 'GOOD LIFE' LOST TO MISERY, DARKNESS, COLD|last=Shapiro|first=Margaret|date=30 January 1993|work=|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the issue of providing daily subsistence to the public besides energy, as the whole country was short of bread. People had to wait in queues for a very long time, because there was no bread, and sometimes the queues could last for a few days. Many basic necessities such as sugar and eggs were also in scarcity.
By the winter of 1994-95, Yerevan residents had access to electricity for only 1-2 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hetq.am/eng/news/62353/armenia-the-dark-years-of-independence.html|title=Armenia: The Dark Years of Independence - Hetq - News, Articles, Investigations|last=Haroutounian|first=Vrej|date=1 September 2015|work=|access-date=2016-12-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia’s Aging Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant Alarms Caucasian Neighbors|author=John Daly|date=2011-10-03|accessdate=2016-02-25|url=http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Armenias-Aging-Metsamor-Nuclear-Power-Plant-Alarms-Caucasian-Neighbors.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each district had its own set time for electricity availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/01/30/armenias-good-life-lost-to-misery-darkness-cold/52d00f30-29bb-4508-9fba-bf543000e8ea/|title=Armenia's 'Good Life' Lost to Misery, Darkness, Cold|last=Shapiro|first=Margaret|date=30 January 1993|work=|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
The energy crisis ended when [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] Unit 2 was brought back online in October 1995, making it the only reactor in the world that was restarted after closing. The restart of the NPP increased the electricity available to the public to 10-12 hours a day.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; The electricity supply then increased to 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. The bombing of pipelines by Azerbaijanis coming from Georgia also stopped afterwards as it did not have the same effect as before, since [[Armenia]] was not as reliant on the pipeline system anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Sargsyan, Gevorg; Hankinson, Denzel; Balabanyan, Ani (2006).

The World Bank. Retrieved 11 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, other [[power plants]], such as [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant]], [[Vorotan Cascade]] and [[Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade]], provided daily load capacity, while [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] provided base load capacity. [[Thermal power plants]] operated to provide electricity in winter when electricity demand was peak, as it was quite a cold winter in [[Armenia]]. Although these times have passed, Armenia still relies on imported resources like gas and oil, which had collapsed the whole electricity production system in the 1990s. All the imported gas and oil is supplied from Russia via Georgia. Only a small amount of gas is supplied by Iran.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gharabegian, Areg (8 October 2006). "[http://www.gab-ibn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Ar11-Electricity-Production-In-Armenia.pdf Electricity Production In Armenia"] (PDF). reporter.am. Retrieved 11 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Armenian electricity system reached 3914 MW of installed (full) capacity. However, only 2845 MW (73%) is currently operating. Electricity is mainly produced from 3 sources: nuclear (34%), thermal (32%) and hydro (34%). Over the past few years this number has increased as many new [[power plants]] have been constructed. Currently, Gas-powered turbines provide 25% of Armenia's electricity. These turbines not only produce a large amount of electricity, but they are also very efficient, which in turn has reduced the price for 1 kWh from 400 AMD to 160-170 AMD. There are also a few small power plants with a capacity of 50MW. One is [[Yerevan Thermoelectric Plant]], which produces electricity mainly for [[Nairit Chemical Plant]]. The other is [[Vanadzor Thermoelectric Plant]], which is not currently operational, but will operate for [[Vanadzor Chemical Plant]] when it opens. [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] produces approximately 440MW of electricity at full capacity, but only 1 of the units (the 2nd unit) is operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/armenia.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Armenia - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest portion of electricity production comes from [[hydro power plant|hydropower plants]]. The largest hydropower plants in Armenia are [[Sevan-Hrazdan]] and Vorotan cascades, which can produce up to 960 MW of electricity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Armenian electricity sector was in a real crisis from 1990-1995, but people were able to survive in such conditions, and now have a reliable electricity supply system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.am.undp.org/content/armenia/en/home/ourwork/environmentandenergy/successstories/in-armenia--energy-efficiency-is-heating-homes-and-warming-lives.html|title=In Armenia, energy efficiency is heating homes and warming lives|website=UNDP in Armenia|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://survinat.com/2014/01/dark-years-survival-during-the-energy-crisis-the/|title="DARK YEARS": survival during the energy crisis.

The '''BFG''' is a fictional [[weapon]] found in many video game titles, mostly in [[first-person shooter]] series such as ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]''.

The abbreviation BFG stands for "Big Fucking Gun" as described in [[Tom Hall]]'s original ''Doom'' design document and in the user manual of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. The ''[[Quake II]]'' manual says it stands for "Big, Uh, Freakin' Gun". These euphemistic labels imply the more profane name of the BFG, "Big Fucking Gun".&lt;ref&gt;"BFG9000." Doom Wiki. N.p., 1 Dec. 2005. Web. 29 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the name used in the ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' motion picture is "Bio Force Gun". The versions found in the ''Doom'' games are called "BFG 9000" and those in ''Quake'' "BFG 10K".

==Appearances==
===''Doom''===
The first appearance of the weapon is the press beta release of ''Doom''. In that version, the BFG 9000 released a cloud of 80 small plasma balls (randomly green or red) per shot.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described the BFG 9000 in the first commercial ''Doom'' game as "the Ultimate Weapon".&lt;ref name="walker199403"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Bryan |date=March 1994 |title=Hell's Bells And Whistles |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=116 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large energy weapon that fires giant balls of green [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The most powerful weapon in the game, it causes major damage to most types of enemies and can clear an entire room of foes in one use. A direct hit from it is often an instant kill. The player is unaffected by the splash damage, which makes it possible to use the BFG 9000 safely in close quarters, unlike some of the other powerful weapons. In the first ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', the weapon can only be picked up in the third and fourth episodes. The BFG 9000 also appears virtually unchanged in ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Final Doom]]'', ''[[Doom 64]]'', and ''[[Doom RPG]]''.

The BFG's internal game mechanics are two-fold: the actual projectile deals a huge amount of damage, but after that, a large dose of damage is dealt in a cone facing away from the player who fired the shot; this increases the weapon's devastating area-of-effect. One peculiar quirk about the internal workings of the game code is that it remembers the direction the player fired the shot in, but not the position, meaning that the player is allowed to move far away even into an entirely different room, and still deal damage to whoever is in that room depending on the timing of the projectile's impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/bfgfaq/|title=The BFG Faqs|date=August 15, 1999|accessdate=July 17, 2016|author=Tony Fabris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===
In ''[[Doom 3]]'', the BFG 9000 is a charged weapon: holding down the trigger causes the weapon to accumulate energy before release, resulting in a more powerful shot. Overcharging the BFG too much will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.

''[[Quake II]]'' and ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' pay homage to the BFG 9000 with a pair of weapons both called the BFG10K. The ''Quake II'' version fires a slow plasma glob that fires rays at any enemies in range and [[Line of sight (gaming)|line-of-sight]]. The ''Quake III Arena'' version of the BFG fire a series of fast plasma orbs, and acts quite like the Rocket Launcher ([[rocket jumping]] can also be done with the BFG10K). BFG10K from ''Quake III'' also appears in ''[[OpenArena]]'' (different look, but same behavior) and ''[[Quake Live]]'' (with slightly modified characteristics). ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' also pays homage to the BFG 9000 with a weapon known as the "Authority Pulse Cannon", which fires "BFG Rounds".

In the [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' movie]], the "bio force gun" fires a bright blue projectile which appears to burst on impact and spray a [[causticity|caustic]] substance over its target and the surrounding area.

The BFG makes a return in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]], but unlike in its first two appearances, it follows the mechanics of its ''Quake II'' rendition, firing a projectile that shoots beams at enemies. The game itself doesn't resolve the acronym "BFG" either in-game or in its codex entries, although one challenge in the game's final campaign level involving the BFG is called "Big [REDACTED] Gun" as a nod to the original vulgar name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjoRosqiOV8|title=Doom: A Sneak Peek at the FINAL Level|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BFG will make a return in 2019's ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' as the BFG 10000, a massive version of the BFG on Mars's moon, Phobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//https://www.vgr.com/the-bfg-10000-of-doom-eternal-is-massive/|title=The BFG 10000 Of DOOM Eternal Is Massive|work=[[VGR (website)|VGR]]|date=August 14, 2018|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''board foot''' or '''board-foot''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] for the [[volume]] of [[lumber]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is the volume of a one-foot length of a board one foot wide and one [[inch]] thick.

Board foot can be abbreviated FBM (for "foot, board measure"), BDFT, or BF. Thousand board feet can be abbreviated as MFBM, MBFT, or MBF. Similarly, million board feet can be abbreviated as MMFBM, MMBFT, or MMBF.

One board foot equals:
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1 in
* 12 in × 12 in × 1 in
* 30.48&amp;nbsp;cm × 30.48&amp;nbsp;cm × 2.54&amp;nbsp;cm

* ≈ 2.36 [[liter]]s
* ≈ 0.00236 [[cubic meter]]s or [[stere]]s
* 1/1980 [[Petrograd Standard]] of board

Board foot is the unit of measure for rough lumber (before drying and planing with no adjustments) or planed/surfaced lumber. An example of [[Plane (tool)|planed]] lumber is [[softwood]] 2 × 4 lumber one would buy at a large [[lumber retailer]]. The 2 × 4 is actually only {{convert|1+1/2| × |3+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} but the dimensions for the lumber when purchased wholesale could still be represented as full 2 × 4 lumber, although the "standard" can vary between vendors. This means that [[Real versus nominal value#Engineering|nominal]] lumber includes air space around the physical board when calculating board feet in some situations, while the true measurement of "board feet" should be limited to the actual dimensions of the board.

For [[Plane (tool)|planed]] lumber, board feet refer to the [[Real versus nominal value#Engineering|nominal]] thickness and width of [[lumber]], calculated in principle on its size before drying and planing. Actual length is used.

See [[dimensional lumber]] for a full discussion of the relationship of actual and nominal dimensions. Briefly, for softwoods, to convert [[Real versus nominal value#Engineering|nominal]] to actual, subtract {{frac|4}} inch for dimensions under {{convert|2|in|mm}}; subtract {{frac|2}} inch for dimensions under {{convert|8|in|mm|0}}; and subtract {{frac|3|4}} inch for larger measurements. The system is more complicated for [[hardwood]]s.

An [[Essex table]] is a tabulation of the number of board feet in lumber of varying dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Essex+table |title=Essex table &amp;#124; Define Essex table at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bullet Group''' ('''SL2S J08544-0121''') is a newly merging [[group of galaxies]], a merger between two galaxy groups to form a new larger one, that recently had a high speed collision between the two component groups. The group exhibits separation between its [[dark matter]] and [[baryonic matter]] components, and the galaxies occurring in two clumps, while the gas expanding into a billowing cloud encompassing all three clumps. As of 2014, it is one of the few galaxy clusters known to show separation between the dark matter and baryonic matter components. The group is named after the [[Bullet Cluster]], a similar merging [[galaxy cluster]], except on a smaller scale, being of groups instead of clusters.&lt;ref name=2014MNRAS.442L..76G&gt;{{cite journal |title= Dark matter-baryons separation at the lowest mass scale: the Bullet Group |display-authors= 6 |author= F.

[[File:CMCLagerhuelsen.jpg|thumb|CMC shaft sleeves]]

'''Ceramic matrix composites''' ('''CMCs''') are a subgroup of [[composite material]]s as well as a subgroup of [[ceramic]]s. They consist of ceramic [[fibre]]s embedded in a ceramic matrix. The matrix and fibres can consist of any ceramic material, whereby [[carbon]] and [[carbon fibre]]s can also be considered a ceramic material.

==Introduction==
The motivation to develop CMCs was to overcome the problems associated with the conventional technical ceramics like alumina, silicon carbide, [[aluminium nitride]], [[silicon nitride]] or [[zirconia]] – they fracture easily under mechanical or thermo-mechanical loads because of cracks initiated by small defects or scratches. The crack resistance is – like in glass – very low. To increase the crack resistance or [[fracture toughness]], particles (so-called monocrystalline ''whiskers'' or ''platelets'') were embedded into the matrix. However, the improvement was limited, and the products have found application only in some ceramic cutting tools. So far only the integration of long multi-strand fibres has drastically increased the crack resistance, [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]] and [[thermal shock]] resistance, and resulted in several new applications. The reinforcements used in ceramic matrix composites (CMC) serve to enhance the fracture toughness of the combined material system while still taking advantage of the inherent high strength and Young’s modulus of the ceramic matrix.  The most common reinforcement embodiment is a continuous-length ceramic fiber, with an elastic modulus that is typically somewhat higher than the matrix.  The functional role of this fiber is (1) to increase the CMC stress for progress of micro-cracks through the matrix, thereby increasing the energy expended during crack propagation; and then (2) when thru-thickness cracks begin to form across the CMC at a higher stress (proportional limit stress, PLS), to bridge these cracks without fracturing, thereby providing the CMC with a high ultimate tensile strength (UTS).   In this way, ceramic fiber reinforcements not only increase the composite structure’s initial resistance to crack propagation, but also allow the CMC to avoid abrupt brittle failure that is characteristic of monolithic ceramics.  This behavior is distinct from the behavior of ceramic fibers in polymer matrix composites (PMC) and metal matrix composites (MMC), where the fibers typically fracture prior to the matrix due to the higher failure strain capabilities of these matrices.  

[[Carbon]] (C), special [[silicon carbide]] (SiC), [[alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[mullite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fibres are most commonly used for CMCs. The matrix materials are usually the same, that is  C, SiC, alumina and mullite. Recently  [[Ultra-high-temperature ceramics]] (UHTCs) were investigated as ceramic matrix in a new class of CMC so-called [[Ultra high temperature ceramic matrix composite|Ultra-high Temperature Ceramic Matrix Composites]] (UHTCMC) or Ultra-high Temperature Ceramic Composites (UHTCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoli|first=L.|last2=Sciti|first2=D.|title=Efficacy of a ZrB 2 –SiC matrix in protecting C fibres from oxidation in novel UHTCMC materials|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2016.09.104|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=113|pages=207–213|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2016.09.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoli|first=L.|last2=Vinci|first2=A.|last3=Silvestroni|first3=L.|last4=Sciti|first4=D.|last5=Reece|first5=M.|last6=Grasso|first6=S.|title=Rapid spark plasma sintering to produce dense UHTCs reinforced with undamaged carbon fibres|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2017.05.029|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=130|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2017.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galizia|first=Pietro|last2=Failla|first2=Simone|last3=Zoli|first3=Luca|last4=Sciti|first4=Diletta|title=Tough salami-inspired C f /ZrB 2  UHTCMCs produced by electrophoretic deposition|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.047|journal=Journal of the European Ceramic Society|volume=38|issue=2|pages=403–409|doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinci|first=Antonio|last2=Zoli|first2=Luca|last3=Sciti|first3=Diletta|last4=Melandri|first4=Cesare|last5=Guicciardi|first5=Stefano|title=Understanding the mechanical properties of novel UHTCMCs through random forest and regression tree analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2018.02.061|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=145|pages=97–107|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2018.02.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, CMC names include a combination of ''type of fibre/type of matrix''. For example, ''C/C'' stands for carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon ([[carbon/carbon]]), or ''C/SiC'' for carbon-fibre-reinforced silicon carbide. Sometimes the manufacturing process is included, and a C/SiC composite manufactured with the liquid [[polymer]] infiltration (LPI) process (see below) is abbreviated as ''LPI-C/SiC''.

The important commercially available CMCs are C/C, C/SiC, SiC/SiC and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. They differ from conventional ceramics in the following properties, presented in more detail below:

*[[elongation (materials science)|Elongation]] to rupture up to 1%
*Strongly increased [[fracture toughness]]
*Extreme [[thermal shock]] resistance
*Improved dynamical load capability
*[[Anisotropy|Anisotropic]] properties following the orientation of fibers

==Manufacture==
The manufacturing processes usually consist of the following three steps:
#Lay-up and fixation of the fibres, shaped as the desired component
#Infiltration of the matrix material
#Final [[machining]] and, if required, further treatments like [[coating]] or impregnation of the intrinsic [[porosity]].

The first and the last step are almost the same for all CMCs:
In step one, the fibres, often named rovings, are arranged and fixed using techniques used in fibre-reinforced plastic materials, such as lay-up of [[fabric]]s, filament winding, [[braiding]] and [[knotting]]. The result of this procedure is called ''fibre-preform'' or simply ''preform''.

For the second step, five different procedures are used to fill the ceramic matrix in between the fibres of the preform:
#Deposition out of a gas mixture
#[[Pyrolysis]] of a pre-ceramic polymer
#[[Chemical reaction]] of elements
#[[Sintering]] at a relatively low temperature in the range 1000–1200&amp;nbsp;°C
#[[Electrophoresis|Electrophoretic]] deposition of a ceramic powder

Procedures one, two and three find applications with non-oxide CMCs, whereas the fourth one is used for oxide CMCs; combinations of these procedures are also practised.  The fifth procedure is not yet established in industrial processes. All procedures have sub-variations, which differ in technical details. All procedures yield a porous material.

The third and final step of [[machining]] – [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[drilling]], [[lapping]] or [[milling machine|milling]] – has to be done with diamond tools. CMCs can also be processed with a [[water jet cutting|water jet]], [[laser cutting|laser]], or [[ultrasonic machining]].

===Ceramic fibres===
[[File:CMC3DStruktur.JPG|thumb|Micrograph of a SiC/SiC ceramic composite with a woven three-dimensional fibre structure]]

Ceramic fibres in CMCs can have a [[polycrystalline]] structure, as in conventional ceramics. They can also be [[amorphous]] or have [[inhomogeneous]] [[chemical composition]], which develops upon pyrolysis of organic [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]s. The high process temperatures required for making CMCs preclude the use of organic, [[metallic fiber|metallic]] or [[glass (fibre)|glass fibres]]. Only fibres stable at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C can be used, such as fibres of alumina, mullite, SiC, zirconia or carbon. Amorphous SiC fibres have an elongation capability above 2% – much larger than in conventional ceramic materials (0.05 to 0.10%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. R. Cooke|title=Inorganic fibres- A Literature Review|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=74|year=1991|pages=2959–2978|doi=10.1111/j1151-2916.1991.tb04289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this property of SiC fibres is that most of them contain additional elements like [[oxygen]], [[titanium]] and/or [[aluminium]] yielding a [[tensile strength]] above 3 GPa. These enhanced elastic properties are required for various three-dimensional fibre arrangements (see example in figure) in [[textile]] fabrication, where a small bending radius is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.

====Matrix deposition from a gas phase====
[[Chemical vapour deposition]] (CVD) is well suited for this purpose. In the presence of a fibre preform, CVD takes place in between the fibres and their individual filaments and therefore is called [[chemical vapour infiltration]] (CVI). One example is the manufacture of C/C composites: a C-fibre preform is exposed to a mixture of [[argon]] and a hydrocarbon gas ([[methane]], [[propane]], etc.) at a pressure of around or below 100 kPa and a temperature above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. The gas decomposes depositing carbon on and between the fibers. Another example is the deposition of silicon carbide, which is usually  conducted from a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and methyl-[[trichlorosilane]] (MTS, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; it is also common in [[silicone]] production). Under defined condition this gas mixture deposits fine and crystalline silicon carbide on the hot surface within the preform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R. Naslain |author2=F.

This CVI procedure leaves a body with a porosity of about 10–15%, as access of reactants to the interior of the preform is increasingly blocked by deposition on the exterior.

====Matrix forming via pyrolysis of C- and Si-containing polymers====
[[Hydrocarbon]] polymers shrink during [[pyrolysis]], and upon [[outgassing]] form carbon with an amorphous, glass-like structure, which by additional heat treatment can be changed to a more [[graphite]]-like structure. Other special polymers, where some carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms, the so-called polycarbo[[silane]]s, yield amorphous silicon carbide of more or less [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] composition. A large variety of such SiC-, SiNC-, or SiBNC-producing [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] already exist and more are being developed. To manufacture a CMC material, the fibre preform is infiltrated with the chosen polymer. Subsequent [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] and pyrolysis yield a highly porous matrix, which is undesirable for most applications. Further cycles of polymer infiltration and pyrolysis are performed until the final and desired quality is achieved. Usually five to eight cycles are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G.

The process is called ''liquid polymer infiltration'' (LPI), or ''polymer infiltration and pyrolysis'' (PIP). Here also a porosity of about 15% is common due to the shrinking of the polymer. The porosity is reduced after every cycle.

====Matrix forming via chemical reaction====
With this method, one material located between the fibres reacts with a second material to form the ceramic matrix. Some conventional ceramics are also manufactured by [[chemical reaction]]s. For example, reaction-bonded [[silicon nitride]] (RBSN) is produced through the reaction of silicon powder with nitrogen, and porous carbon reacts with silicon to form [[reaction bonded silicon carbide]], a silicon carbide which contains inclusions of a silicon phase. An example of CMC manufacture, which was introduced for the production of ceramic [[disc brake|brake discs]], is the reaction of [[silicon]] with a porous preform of C/C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. Krenkel|title=Cost Effective Processing of CMC Composites by Melt Infiltration (LSI-Process)|journal=Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings|volume=22|year=2008|page=chapter 52|doi=10.1002/9780470294680.ch52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process temperature is above 1414&amp;nbsp;°C, that is above the [[melting point]] of silicon, and the process conditions are controlled such that the carbon fibres of the C/C-preform almost completely retain their mechanical properties. This process is called ''liquid silicon infiltration'' (LSI). Sometimes, and because of its starting point with C/C, the material is abbreviated as ''C/C-SiC''. The material produced in this process has a very low porosity of about 3%.

====Matrix forming via sintering====
This process is used to manufacture oxide fibre/oxide matrix CMC materials. Since most ceramic fibres can not withstand the normal [[sintering]] temperatures of above 1600&amp;nbsp;°C, special [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] liquids are used to infiltrate the preform of oxide fibres. These precursors allow sintering, that is ceramic-forming processes, at temperatures of 1000–1200&amp;nbsp;°C. They are, for example, based on mixtures of alumina powder with the liquids tetra-ethyl-ortho[[silicate]] (as Si donor) and aluminium-[[butyl]]ate (as Al donor), which yield a mullite matrix. Other techniques, such as [[sol-gel]] chemistry, are also used. CMCs obtained with this process usually have a high porosity of about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. A. Simon|title=Progress in Processing and Performance of Porous-Matrix Oxide/Oxide Composites|journal=International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology|volume=2|year=2005|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7402.2005.02016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.

====Matrix formed via electrophoresis====
In the [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] process, electrically charged particles dispersed in a special liquid are transported through an [[electric field]] into the preform, which has the opposite electrical charge polarity. This process is under development, and is not yet used industrially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=E. Stoll |author2=P. Mahr |author3=H. G. Krueger |author4=H. Kern |author5=R.

==Properties==
[[File:CMCRissbruecke.jpg|thumb|Scheme of crack bridges at the crack tip of ceramic composites.]]

===Mechanical properties===

====Basic mechanism of mechanical properties====
The high fracture toughness or crack resistance mentioned above is a result of the following mechanism: under load the ceramic matrix cracks, like any ceramic material, at an elongation of about 0.05%. In CMCs the embedded fibres bridge these cracks (see picture). This mechanism works only when the matrix can slide along the fibres, which means that there must be a weak bond between the fibres and matrix. A strong bond would require a very high elongation capability of the fibre bridging the crack, and would result in a brittle fracture, as with conventional ceramics. The production of CMC material with high crack resistance requires a step to weaken this bond between the fibres and matrix. This is achieved by depositing a thin layer of pyrolytic carbon or boron nitride on the fibres, which weakens the bond at the fibre/matrix interface (sometimes "interface"), leading to the [[fibre pull-out]] at crack surfaces, as shown in the [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] picture at the top of this article. In oxide-CMCs, the high porosity of the matrix is sufficient to establish the weak bond.

====Properties under tensile and bending loads, crack resistance====
[[File:CMC SENB.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Curves of toughness measurements &lt;ref&gt;M. Kuntz, ''Ceramic Matrix Composites'', cfi/Bericht der DKG, vol. 49, No. 1, 1992, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; of various ceramic composites and SiSiC&lt;br /&gt;'''Legend:''' SiSiC: conventional [[SiSiC]], SiCSiC(CVI) and CSiC(CVI): SiC/SiC and C/SiC manufactured in CVI processes, CSiC(95) und CSiC(93): C/SiC manufactured by the LPI-method, Ox(PP): oxide ceramic composite, CSiC(Si): C/SiC manufactured via the LSI process.]]

The influence and quality of the fibre interface can be evaluated through mechanical properties.
Measurements of the crack resistance were performed with notched specimens (see figure) in so-called single-edge-notch-bend (SENB) tests. In [[fracture mechanics]], the measured data (force, geometry and crack surface) are normalized to yield the so-called [[stress intensity factor]] (SIF), K&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt;. Because of the complex crack surface (see figure at the top of this article) the real crack surface area can not be determined for CMC materials. The measurements therefore use the initial notch as the crack surface, yielding the ''formal SIF'' shown in the figure. This requires identical geometry for comparing different samples. The area under these curves thus gives a relative indication of the energy required to drive the crack tip through the sample (force times path length gives energy). The maxima indicate the load level necessary to propagate the crack through the sample. Compared to the sample of conventional SiSiC ceramic, two observations can be made:
*All tested CMC materials need up to several orders of magnitude more energy to propagate the crack through the material.
*The force required for crack propagation varies between different types of CMCs.

In the table, CVI, LPI, and LSI denote the manufacturing process of the C/SiC-material. Data of the oxide CMC and SiSiC are taken from manufacturer data sheets. Tensile strength of SiSiC and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were calculated from measurements of elongation to fracture and [[Young's modulus]], since generally only bending strength data are available for those ceramics. Averaged values are given in the table, and significant differences, even within one manufacturing route, are possible.

[[File:CMCDehnungsverlauf.jpg|thumb|380px|right|Stress-strain curve of a tensile test for CVI-SiC/SiC.]]
Tensile tests of CMCs usually show nonlinear stress-strain curves, which look as if the material deforms plastically. It is called ''quasi-[[plasticity (physics)|plastic]]'', because the effect is caused by the microcracks, which are formed and bridged with increasing load. Since the [[Young's modulus]] of the load-carrying fibres is generally lower than that of the matrix, the slope of the curve decreases with increasing load.

Curves from bending tests look similar to those of the crack resistance measurements shown above.

The following features are essential in evaluating bending and tensile data of CMCs:
*CMC materials with a low matrix content (down to zero) have a high [[tensile strength]] (close to the tensile strength of the fibre), but low [[flexural strength|bending strength]].
*CMC materials with a low fibre content (down to zero) have a high bending strength (close to the strength of the monolithic ceramic), but no elongation beyond 0.05% under tensile load.

The primary quality criterion for CMCs is the crack resistance behaviour or fracture toughness.

====Other mechanical properties====
In many CMC components the fibres are arranged as 2-dimensional (2D) stacked [[Plain weave|plain]] or [[satin weave]] [[fabric]]s. Thus the resulting material is [[anisotropic]] or, more specifically, [[orthotropic material|orthotropic]]. A crack between the layers is not bridged by fibres. Therefore, the interlaminar [[shear strength]] (ILS) and the strength perpendicular to the 2D fiber orientation are low for these materials. [[Delamination]] can occur easily under certain mechanical loads. Three-dimensional fibre structures can improve this situation (see micrograph above).

The [[compressive strength]]s shown in the table are lower than those of conventional ceramics, where values above 2000 MPa are common; this is a result of porosity.

[[File:CMCLowCycleFatigueSiCSiC.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Strain controlled LCF-test for a CVI-SiC/SiC-specimen.]]
The composite structure allows high dynamical loads. In the so-called low-[[fatigue (material)|cycle-fatigue]] (LCF) or high-cycle-fatigue (HCF) tests the material experiences cyclic loads under tensile and compressive (LCF) or only tensile (HCF) load. The higher the initial stress the shorter the lifetime and the smaller the number of cycles to rupture. With an initial load of 80% of the strength, a SiC/SiC sample survived about 8 million cycles (see figure).

The [[Poisson's ratio]] shows an anomaly when measured perpendicular to the plane of the fabric, because interlaminar cracks increase the sample thickness.

===Thermal and electrical properties===
The thermal and electrical properties of the composite are a result of its constituents, namely fibres, matrix and pores as well as their composition. The orientation of the fibres yields anisotropic data. Oxide CMCs are very good [[electrical insulator]]s, and because of their high porosity their [[thermal insulation]] is much better than that of conventional oxide ceramics.

The use of carbon fibres increases the [[electrical conductivity]], provided the fibres contact each other and the voltage source. Silicon carbide matrix is a good thermal conductor. Electrically, it is a [[semiconductor]], and its [[electrical resistance|resistance]] therefore decreases with increasing temperature. Compared to (poly)crystalline SiC, the amorphous SiC fibres are relatively poor conductors of heat and electricity.

'''Comments for the table:''' (p) and (v) refer to data parallel and vertical to fibre orientation of the 2D-fiber structure, respectively. LSI material has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] because of its low porosity – an advantage when using it for brake discs. These data are subject to scatter depending on details of the manufacturing processes.

Conventional ceramics are very sensitive to [[thermal stress]] because of their high Young's modulus and low elongation capability. Temperature differences and low [[thermal conductivity]] create locally different elongations, which together with the high Young's modulus generate high stress. This results in cracks, rupture and brittle failure. In CMCs, the fibres bridge the cracks, and the components show no macroscopic damage, even if the matrix has cracked locally. The application of CMCs in brake disks demonstrates the effectiveness of ceramic composite materials under extreme thermal shock conditions.

===Corrosion properties===
Data on the [[corrosion]] behaviour of CMCs are scarce except for [[oxidation]] at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. These properties are determined by the constituents, namely the fibres and matrix. Ceramic materials in general are very stable to corrosion. The broad spectrum of manufacturing techniques with different sintering additives, mixtures, glass phases and porosities are crucial for the results of corrosion tests. Less [[impurity|impurities]] and exact [[stoichiometry]] lead to less corrosion. Amorphous structures and non-ceramic chemicals frequently used as sintering aids are starting points of corrosive attack.&lt;ref&gt;F. Schröder (ed.): ''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, 8th edition, Silicon, suppl. vol. B3, Silicon Carbide, Part 2'', Springer Verlag, 1986, pp. 322–397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Lavrenko: ''Corrosion of High-Performance Ceramics'', Springer-Verlag, 1992 {{ISBN|3-540-55316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Alumina
Pure alumina shows excellent corrosion resistivity against most chemicals. Amorphous glass and silica [[phase (matter)|phases]] at the grain boundaries determine the speed of corrosion in concentrated [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|base]]s and result in [[creep (deformation)|creep]] at high temperatures. These characteristics limit the use of alumina. For molten metals, alumina is used only with gold and platinum.

;Alumina fibres
These fibres demonstrate corrosion properties similar to alumina, but commercially available fibres are not very pure and therefore less resistant. Because of creep at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C, there are only few applications for oxide CMCs.

;Carbon
The most significant corrosion of carbon occurs in presence of [[oxygen]] above about 500&amp;nbsp;°C. It burns to form [[carbon dioxide]] and/or [[carbon monoxide]]. It also oxidises in strong oxidizing agents like concentrated [[nitric acid]]. In molten metals it dissolves and forms metal [[carbide]]s. Carbon fibres do not differ from carbon in their corrosion behaviour.

;Silicon carbide
Pure silicon carbide is one of the most corrosion-resistant materials. Only strong bases, oxygen above about 800&amp;nbsp;°C, and molten metals react with it to form carbides and [[silicide]]s.
The reaction with oxygen forms SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereby a surface layer  of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; slows down subsequent oxidation (''[[Passivation (chemistry)|passive oxidation]]''). Temperatures above about 1600&amp;nbsp;°C and a low [[partial pressure]] of oxygen result in so-called ''active oxidation'', in which CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and gaseous SiO are formed causing rapid loss of SiC. If the SiC matrix is produced other than by CVI, corrosion-resistance is not as good. This is a consequence of porosity in the amorphous LPI, and residual silicon in the LSI-matrix.

;Silicon carbide fibres
Silicon carbide fibres are produced via pyrolysis of organic polymers, and therefore their corrosion properties are similar to those of the silicon carbide found in LPI-matrices. These fibres are thus more sensitive to bases and oxidizing media than pure silicon carbide.

==Applications==
CMC materials overcome the major disadvantages of conventional technical ceramics, namely brittle failure and low fracture toughness, and limited thermal shock resistance. Therefore, their applications are in fields requiring reliability at high-temperatures (beyond the capability of metals) and resistance to corrosion and wear. These include:
*[[Heat shield]] systems for [[space vehicle]]s, which are needed during the [[re-entry]] phase, where high temperatures, [[thermal shock]] conditions and heavy vibration loads take place.
*Components for high-temperature [[gas turbine]]s such as [[combustion chamber]]s, [[guide vane|stator vanes]] and [[turbine blade]]s.
*Components for [[gas burner|burners]], [[flame holder]]s, and hot gas ducts, where the use of oxide CMCs has found its way.
*[[disc brake|Brake disks]] and brake system components, which experience extreme thermal shock (greater than throwing a glowing part of any material into water).
*Components for [[slide bearing]]s under heavy loads requiring high corrosion and wear resistance.

In addition to the foregoing, CMCs can be used in applications, which employ conventional ceramics or in which metal components have limited [[service life|lifetimes]] due to corrosion or high temperatures.

===Developments for applications in space===
During the re-entry phase of space vehicles, the heat shield system is exposed to temperatures above 1500&amp;nbsp;°C for a few minutes. Only ceramic materials are able to survive such conditions without significant damage, and among ceramics only CMCs can adequately handle thermal shocks. The development of CMC-based heat shield systems promises the following advantages:
*Reduced weight
*Higher load carrying capacity of the system
*Reusability for several re-entries
*Better steering during the re-entry phase with CMC flap systems

[[File:ISS Crew Return Vehicle.jpg|thumb|NASA-space vehicle X-38 during a test flight]]
In these applications the high temperatures preclude the use of oxide fibre CMCs, because under the expected loads the creep would be too high. Amorphous silicon carbide fibres lose their strength due to re-[[crystallization]] at temperatures above 1250&amp;nbsp;°C. Therefore, carbon fibres in a silicon carbide matrix (C/SiC) are used in development programs for these applications. The European program HERMES of [[ESA]], started in the 1980s and for financial reasons abandoned in 1992, has produced first results. Several follow-up programs focused on the development, manufacture, and qualification of nose cap, leading edges and steering flaps for the [[NASA]] space vehicle [[X-38]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Pfeiffer: ''Ceramic Body Flap for X-38 and CRV''. 2nd International Symposium on Atmospheric Re-entry Vehicles and Systems, Arcachon, France, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Pfeiffer, K. Peetz: ''All-Ceramic Body Flap Qualified for Space Flight on the X-38''. 53rd International Astronautical Congress, Houston, Texas, US, October 2002, Paper IAF-02-I.6.b.01&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CMC-X38-Bodyflaps.jpg|thumb|350px|Pair of steering flaps for the NASA-space vehicle X-38. Size: 1.5×1.5×0.15 m, mass: 68 kg each, various components are mounted using more than 400 CVI-C/SiC screws and nuts.]]

This development program has qualified the use of C/SiC bolts and nuts,&lt;ref&gt;H. Lange, M. Dogigli, M. Bickel: ''Ceramic Fasteners for High Temperature Applications''. 5th International Conference on Joining: Ceramics, Glas and Metal, Jena, May 1997, DVS-Berichte Band 184, Deutscher Verlag für Schweißtechnik, p. 55, {{ISBN|3-87155-489-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bearing system of the flaps. The latter were ground-tested at the DLR in Stuttgart, Germany, under expected conditions of the re-entry phase: 1600&amp;nbsp;°C, 4 [[tonne]]s load, oxygen partial pressure similar to re-entry conditions, and simultaneous bearing movements of four cycles per second. A total of five re-entry phases was simulated.&lt;ref&gt;M. Dogigli, H. Weihs, K. Wildenrotter, H. Lange: ''New High-Temperature Ceramic Bearing for Space Vehicles''. 51st International Astronautical Congress, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, October 2000, Paper IAF-00-I.3.04&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, oxidation protection systems were developed and qualified to prevent burnout of the carbon fibres. After mounting of the flaps, mechanical ground tests were performed successfully by NASA in Houston, Texas, US. The next test – a real re-entry of the unmanned vehicle X-38 – was cancelled for financial reasons. One of the [[space shuttle]]s would have brought the vehicle into orbit, from where it would have returned to the Earth.

These qualifications were promising for only this application. The high-temperature load lasts only around 20 minutes per re-entry, and for reusability, only about 30 cycles would be sufficient. For industrial applications in hot gas environment, though, several hundred cycles of thermal loads and up to many thousands hours of lifetime are required.

Developed by [[Thales Alenia Space]], the IXV is scheduled to make its first flight in 2014 on the fourth [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] mission (VV04) over the Gulf of Guinea. More than 40 European companies contributed to its construction.

===Developments for gas turbine components===
The use of CMCs in gas turbines permit higher turbine inlet temperatures, which improves turbine efficiency. Because of the complex shape of stator vanes and turbine blades, the development was first focused on the combustion chamber. In the US, a combustor made of SiC/SiC with a special SiC fiber of enhanced high-temperature stability was successfully tested for 15,000 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

The engine collaboration between [[General Electric]] and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] studied the use of CMC stator vanes in the hot section of the F136 [[turbofan]] engine, an engine which failed to beat the Pratt and Whitney F-135 for use in the [[Joint Strike Fighter]].
The engine joint venture, [[CFM International]] is using CMCs to manufacture the high temperature turbine shrouds.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Guy, Hot blades, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, April 27-May 10, 2015, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; General Electric is using CMCs in combustor liners, nozzles, and the high temperature turbine shroud for its upcoming GE9X engine.&lt;ref name=Flight30May2017&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-after-six-years-777x-engine-starts-certif-437466 |title= After six years, 777X engine starts certification tests |date= 30 May 2017 |work= Flightglobal |author= Stephen Trimble}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMC parts are also being studied for stationary applications in both the cold and hot sections of the engines, since stresses imposed on rotating parts would require further development effort.

===Application of oxide CMC in burner and hot gas ducts===
Oxygen-containing gas at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C is rather corrosive for metal and silicon carbide components. Such components, which are not exposed to high mechanical stress, can be made of oxide CMCs, which can withstand temperatures up to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C. The gallery below shows the [[flame holder]] of a [[crisp bread]] [[bakery]] as tested after for 15,000 hours, which subsequently operated for a total of more than 20,000 hours.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.C.

Flaps and ventilators circulating hot, oxygen-containing gases can be fabricated in the same shape as their metal equivalents. The lifetime for these oxide CMC components is several times longer than for metals, which often deform. A further example is an oxide CMC lifting gate for a sintering furnace, which has survived more than 260,000 opening cycles.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.C. Pritzkow: ''Oxide-Fibre-Reinforced Ceramics''. cfi/Ber.

===Application in brake disk===
[[Carbon/carbon]] (C/C) materials have found their way into the [[disk brake]]s of [[sports car|racing cars]] and [[aeroplane]]s, and C/SiC brake disks manufactured by the LSI process were qualified and are commercially available for [[luxury vehicle]]s. The advantages of these C/SiC disks are:
*Very little wear, resulting in lifetime use for a car with a normal driving load of 300,000&amp;nbsp;km, is forecast by manufacturers.
*No [[brake fade|fading]] is experienced, even under high load.
*No surface [[humidity]] effect on the friction coefficient shows up, as in C/C brake disks.
*The corrosion resistance, for example to the road salt, is much better than for metal disks.
*The disk mass is only 40% of a metal disk. This translates into less unsprung and rotating mass.

The weight reduction improves shock absorber response, road-holding comfort, agility, fuel economy, and thus driving comfort.&lt;ref&gt;W. Krenkel, R. Renz, ''CMCs for Friction Applications'', in Ceramic Matrix Composites, W. Krenkel editor, Wiley-VCH, 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-527-31361-7}}, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

The SiC-matrix of LSI has a very low porosity, which protects the carbon fibres quite well. Brake disks do not experience temperatures above 500&amp;nbsp;°C for more than a few hours in their lifetime.  Oxidation is therefore not a problem in this application. The reduction of manufacturing costs will decide the success of this application for middle-class cars.

===Application in slide bearings===
[[File:CMCGleitlager.jpg|thumb|Components for a ceramic slide bearing; the picture shows a sintered SiC-bearing for a hydrostatic slide bearing and a CVI-SiC/SiC-shaft sleeve shrink-fitted on metal, a system tested with liquid oxygen as lubricant.]]

Conventional SiC, or sometimes the less expensive [[SiSiC]], have been used successfully for more than 25 years in [[plain bearing|slide]] or journal bearings of [[pump]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Bartz (ed.): [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xYUXYsonToC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Keramiklager, Werkstoffe – Gleit- und Wälzlager – Dichtungen'']. Handbuch der Tribologie und Schmierungstechnik. Vol. 12. Expert Verlag, Renningen 2003. {{ISBN|3-8169-2050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pumped liquid itself provides the [[lubricant]] for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low [[friction coefficient]]s are the basis of this success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100–350&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance – for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft sleeve material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80&amp;nbsp;°C as lubricant.&lt;ref name="Gaffal"&gt;K. Gaffal, A.-K. Usbeck, W. Prechtl: ''Neue Werkstoffe ermöglichen innovative Pumpenkonzepte für die Speisewasserförderung in Kesselanlagen''. VDI-Berichte Nr. 1331, VDI-Verlag, Düsseldorf, 1997, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;
The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in [[Watt|W]]/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.

In [[boiler feedwater pump]]s of [[power station]]s,&lt;ref name="Gaffal" /&gt; which pump several thousand cubic meters of hot water to a level of 2000 m, and in tubular casing pumps &lt;ref&gt;W. Kochanowski, P. Tillack: ''New Pump Bearing Materials Prevent Damage to Tubular Casing Pumps''. VDI-Berichte Nr. 1421, VDI-Verlag, Düsseldorf, 1998, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; for [[water supply|water works]] or sea water [[desalination]] plants (pumping up to 40,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to a level of around 20 m) this slide bearing concept, namely SiC/SiC shaft sleeve and SiC bearing, has been used since 1994. A picture of such shaft sleeves is shown at the top of this article.

This bearing system has been tested in pumps for [[liquid oxygen]], for example in oxygen [[turbopump]]s for thrust engines of space rockets, with the following results. SiC and SiC/SiC are compatible with liquid oxygen. In an auto-[[making fire|ignition]] test according to the French standard NF 28-763, no auto-ignition was observed with powdered SiC/SiC in 20 bar pure oxygen at temperatures up to 525&amp;nbsp;°C. Tests have shown that the friction coefficient is half, and wear one fiftieth of standard metals used in this environment.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Bozet, M. Nelis, M. Leuchs, M.

A hydrostatic bearing system (see picture) has survived several hours at a speed up to 10,000 revolutions per minute, various loads, and 50 cycles of start/stop transients without any significant traces of wear.&lt;ref&gt;M.

[[File:Grand Tour Charabancs.jpg|thumb|right|Charabancs on the "Grand Tour" connecting the [[Corris Railway]] to the [[Talyllyn Railway]], passing [[Tal-y-llyn Lake]] around 1900]]
A '''charabanc''' or "char-à-banc" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ær|ə|b|æ|ŋ|k}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|char-à-banc}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often pronounced "sharra-bang" in colloquial British English) is a type of [[horse-drawn vehicle]] or early [[coach (vehicle)|motor coach]], usually open-topped, common in [[UK|Britain]] during the early part of the 20th century. It has "benched seats arranged in rows, looking forward, commonly used for large parties, whether as public conveyances or for excursions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Char-à-banc|volume=5|page=855}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was especially popular for sight-seeing or "[[day-tripper|works outings]]" to the country or the seaside, organised by businesses once a year. The name derives from the [[French language|French]] ''char à bancs'' ("carriage with wooden benches"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-cha1.htm World Wide Words: Charabanc]&lt;/ref&gt; the vehicle having originated in [[France]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9022495 charabanc - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vehicle has not been common on the roads since the 1920s, a few signs survive from the era; a notable example at [[Wookey Hole]] in [[Somerset]] warns that the road to the neighbouring village of [[Easton, Somerset|Easton]] is unsuitable for charabancs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This road is not suitable for charabancs|author=[[Flickr]]|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ilike/2443295369/|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word 'charabanc' was in common usage until the middle of the 20th century but was deleted as obsolete from the pocket edition of the [[Collins English Dictionary|Collins Dictionary]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2028769/Aerodrome-charabanc-obsolete-scrapped-Collins-Dictionary.html|title=Use them or lose them! Aerodrome and charabanc become obsolete as they are scrapped from dictionaries  |last=Bates|first=Claire|date=22 August 2011|work=The Daily mail|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is in common usage especially in [[Northern England]] in a jocular way referring to works outings by coach.

In [[Australia]] a modern similar type of bus or motorcoach, with two lateral doors for each row of seats, survived up to the 1970s and was referred to as '''side loader bus'''; but all or most of them were not open-topped. One such a bus based in [[Echuca]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], has been restored and is used at the Port of Echuca on some public holidays and special events.

Buses with similar arrangement of doors and seats are a common equipment for the [[antiriot]] squads of many [[police]] forces, as the arrangement lends itself to the squad exiting the vehicle quickly.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Introduced in the 1840s as a French sporting vehicle, the ''char à bancs'' was popular at race meetings and for hunting or shooting parties. It could be pulled by a [[Four-in-hand (carriage)|four-in-hand]] team of horses or a pair in pole gear. It had two or more rows of crosswise bench seats, plus a slightly lower rear seat for a groom, and most also had a slatted trunk for luggage. Initially used by the wealthy, they were later enlarged with more seats for school or works excursions and tourist transport, as a cheaper version of the tourist coach. The first charabanc in Britain was presented to [[Queen Victoria]] by [[Louis Philippe of France]] and is preserved in the [[Royal Mews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = D. J. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Discovering Horse-drawn Vehicles | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 1994 | location =  | nopp =  | pages = 85–86 | url =  | isbn = 0-7478-0208-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[First World War]], motor charabancs were used mainly for day trips, as they were not comfortable enough for longer journeys, and were largely replaced by motor buses in the 1920s.
[[File:Charabanc.jpg|thumb|Motorised charabanc, early 1920s.]]

The charabanc of the 1920s tended to last only a few years. It was normal at the time for the body to be built separately to the motor [[chassis]] and some were fitted in summer only; a second goods body would be fitted in its place in winter to keep the vehicle occupied.

Charabancs were normally open top, with a large canvas folding hood stowed at the rear in case of rain, much like a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] motor car. If rain started, this had to be pulled into position, a very heavy task, and it was considered honourable for the male members of the touring party to assist in getting it into position. The side windows would be of [[mica]] (a thin layer of quartz-like stone).

The charabanc offered little or no protection to the passengers in the event of an overturning accident, they had a high [[centre of gravity]] when loaded (and particularly if overloaded), and they often traversed the steep and winding roads leading to the coastal villages popular with tourists. These factors led to fatal accidents which contributed to their early demise.

===In Northern England===
Factory day outings (annual works trips) in the 19th and early 20th century were quite common for workers, especially for those from the northern weaving [[mill town]]s of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] during the [[wakes week]]s. The 1940s and 1950s were relatively hard times due to national recovery being slow after the [[Second World War]]; rationing was still evident and annual holidays had not really become established for poorer workers such as weavers and spinners, so a day's outing to the seaside was a rare treat and all that some workers with large families could afford. "Charabanc trips" were usually only for adults, again due to finance. Occasionally the mill owner would help to pay for these outings, but this was not always the case.

The charabancs, or coaches, were pretty basic vehicles; noisy, uncomfortable and often poorly upholstered with low-backed seats and used mainly for short journeys to the nearest resort town or the [[horse racing|races]]. Some [[working men's club]]s also organised days out and these trips were often subsidised by the clubs themselves from membership subscriptions that had been paid throughout the year. A few pence a week would be paid to a club or mill trip organiser and marked down in a notebook. This would be paid out to the saver on the day of the trip as spending money on the day. This day out would often be the highlight of the year for some workers and the only chance to get away from the [[smog]] and grime of the busy mill towns.

Later, in the late 1960s and 1970s, as the mills prospered and things improved financially, the annual "[[wakes week]]" took over and a one-week mass exodus from northern mill towns during the summer months took precedence over the charabanc trips, and a full week's holiday at a [[holiday camp]] or in a seaside [[boarding house]] for the full family became the norm, instead of a single day out.

==Cultural references==

The French ''char à banc'' appears in Leo Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina'' [1877] in Part 6, Chapter 17 in the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation [2000].

The charabanc is notably mentioned in [[Dylan Thomas]]'s short story "A Story", also known as "The Outing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqCCNrkh7aMC ''The Collected Stories'', by Dylan Thomas.] New Directions Publishing, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In this piece the young Thomas unintentionally finds himself on the annual men's charabanc outing to [[Porthcawl]]. Within the story the charabanc is referred to as a 'chara' in colloquial [[Welsh English]].

''[[Cider with Rosie]]'' by [[Laurie Lee]] features a 1917 charabanc outing from rural [[Gloucestershire]] to [[Weston-super-Mare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.theatreroyal.org/peo/site/whats_on/index.php?nav=details&amp;sc=11370 Stage adaptation of Cider with Rosie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517013147/http://secure.theatreroyal.org/peo/site/whats_on/index.php?nav=details&amp;sc=11370 |date=17 May 2010 }} at the [[Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vince Hill]]'s ''A Day at the Seaside'' begins with the line "Climb up little darling, into the charabanc".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505095518/http://www.vincehill.co.uk/replies.htm Vince Hill replies to correspondence]&lt;/ref&gt; The song, written by [[Les Vandyke]], came fifth in the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963 Song for Europe]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vince-hill-mn0000211996 All Music biography of Vince Hill, by Dave Thompson]&lt;/ref&gt;

A char-a-banc also figures prominently in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story "The Village that Voted the Earth Was Flat" (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/8324 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818155311/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/8324/ |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Char-a-bancs are mentioned in [[Dorothy Edwards]]' book ''[[The Witches and the Grinnygog]]'' in the chapter entitled "Mrs. Umphrey's Ghost Story".  In it, Mrs. Umphrey tries to reassure the ghost of Margaret that the char-a-bancs are not the chariots of devils.

"[[Peaches (The Stranglers song)|Peaches]]", a single by [[the Stranglers]] makes reference to a charabanc, with vocalist [[Hugh Cornwell]] explaining to the listener how he will be stuck on a beach "the whole summer" after missing a charabanc.

In [[Agatha Christie]]'s "The Dead Harlequin", from ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' series, the young artist Frank Bristow reacts angrily to the older Colonel Monkton's dismissive (and presumably snobbish) attitude towards charabancs and their use in tourism. They are also mentioned in the story "Double Sin" when the motor coach Poirot and Hastings are traveling on stops for lunch at  Monkhampton. "...in a big courtyard, about twenty char-a-bancs were parked--char-a-bancs which had come from all over the country."

Charabancs appeared several times in John Le Carre's ''[[The Little Drummer Girl]]''.

The [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] song "Wond'ring Again" by [[Ian Anderson]] uses the term: "Incestuous ancestry's charabanc ride..." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrolyrics.com/wondring-again-lyrics-jethro-tull.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Small Faces]]' 1968 album ''[[Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]]'', the title character of the ''Happiness Stan'' suite of songs taking up side 2 lives in a Charabanc, described in characteristic fashion by narrator [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] as "a four wheeled fillolop out the backgrove".  On the 1968 performance by the band of the suite on [[BBC2]]'s ''[[Colour Me Pop]]'', Unwin renders this section as "an ancient [[Victoriana]] Charabanc - and this was the old type, sit-up-and-beg, rotate fit a poppy with solid wheels." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Tz-qBV-lA&amp;t=622s Stanley Unwin, narration of Happiness Stan, Colour Me Pop BBC2 21 June 1968.

The charabanc appears in [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s [[Little Women]]. Mr Lawrence, the March's wealthy neighbour, lends it to the March girls. Jokingly, they call it the "cherry bounce".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">'''Charge control''' is a technology that lets an [[electric utility]] control, in real time, the charging of a ''gridable'' (plug-in) vehicle, such as a [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) or a [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Through charge control, the utility is able to postpone charging of the vehicle during time of [[peak demand]]. Additionally, this technology may enable the owner and the power company to track the vehicle's usage and performance, while on the road and while [[Battery charger|charging]].

== Charge control advantages ==
* During times of peak demand, the electric utility prefers to reduce the demand, rather than turning on additional (dirtier and more expensive) power plants. In places that subscribe to [[smart power grid]] services, the electric utility shuts off appliances such as air conditioners until the peak demand is over. Similarly, charge control allows the electric utility to postpone charging until the peak demand is over. Charge control is not as far reaching as [[V2G]] (a technology that allows the power company to buy energy back from a plug-in car) but is very effective because it is less expensive to implement than V2G.
* The hardware used in charge control also monitors the vehicle (when driving or when plugged-in). As a side benefit, that information is available, through the web, to both the electric utility and the owner, for the purpose of tracking and optimizing the performance of the vehicle.
* Eventually, the electric utility may offer better pricing to owners of charge control equipped vehicles.

== Comparison to V2G ==
In both V2G and charge control, the electric utility can control the power flow between a plug-in vehicle and the power grid. However, in charge control power only flows from the grid to the vehicle, while in [[V2G]] power can flow in both directions.

== Peak load leveling ==
Disabling charging in charge control vehicles helps balance the loading on the power grid by "valley filling" (charging at night when demand is low) and "peak shaving" (not charging when demand is high). It can enable [[electric utility|utilities]] new ways to provide [[regulation service]]s (keeping voltage and frequency stable).

The '''Chiahui Power Plant''' ({{zh|c=嘉惠電廠|p=Jiāhuì Diànchǎng}}) is a [[gas-fired power plant]] in Songshan Village, [[Minxiong, Chiayi|Minxiong Township]], [[Chiayi County]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/chia_hui/ |title=Chia-Hui Gas-Fired Power Station |publisher=Power Technology |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpower.co.jp/english/news_release/news/news031215.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industcards.com/cc-taiwan.htm |title=cc-taiwan |publisher=Industcards.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090718114018/http%3A//www.industcards.com/cc%2Dtaiwan.htm# |archive-date=2009-07-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftis.org.tw/water/2012sw/history/97/ecom12.htm|title=CHIAHUI Power Co., Ltd.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The construction of the power plant began in January 2002 and the commercial operation was expected to be started in March 2004. However, the project was completed ahead of schedule and the commissioning of the plant was done in December 2003. The project is the first [[independent power producer]] project in Taiwan.

==Ownership==
[[Asia Cement Corporation]] and its affiliates owns 59% of equity share, while [[J-Power]] owns 40%. The remaining 1% share is owned by other private shareholders.

==Generation units==
The power plant consists of multiple-shaft [[combined cycle]] unit with one [[steam turbine]]-[[electric generator|generator]], three [[gas turbine]] generators and three [[heat recovery steam generator]]s, designed for [[natural gas]] firing. The gas turbine generators came fromm [[General Electric]] with F-class technology and was shipped in 2002. Each has 18-stage axial compressor and 3-stage turbine. It also features a cold-end drive and axial exhaust.

==Function==
The power plant is designed for [[load following power plant|intermediate load operation]] with daily startup and shutdown to sell power to match the power dispatch schedule of [[Taipower]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gibsin.com.tw/old/Case-ChiahuiCPP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The whole generated electricity is sold to Taipower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/chia_hui/|title=Chia-Hui Gas-Fired Power Station|work=Power Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Chiahui Power Plant is accessible west from [[Minxiong Station]] of [[Taiwan Railways Administration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6154">[[File:Triode schematic labeled.svg|thumb|[[Schematic symbol]] used in [[circuit diagram]]s for a vacuum tube, showing control grid]]

The '''control grid''' is an [[electrode]] used in amplifying [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves]] (vacuum tubes) such as the [[triode]], [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]], used to control the flow of electrons from the [[cathode]] to the [[plate electrode|anode]] (plate) electrode.  The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode.  The control grid was invented by [[Lee De Forest]], who in 1906  added a grid to the [[Fleming valve]] ([[thermionic diode]]) to create the first [[amplifier|amplifying]] vacuum tube, the [[Audion]] ([[triode]]).

== Operation ==
In a valve, the hot cathode emits negatively charged [[electron]]s, which are attracted to and captured by the anode, which is given a positive voltage by a power supply.  The control grid between the cathode and anode functions as a "gate" to control the current of electrons reaching the anode.  A more negative voltage on the grid will repel the electrons back toward the cathode so fewer get through to the anode.  A less negative, or positive, voltage on the grid will allow more electrons through, increasing the anode current.  A given change in grid voltage causes a proportional change in plate current, so if a time-varying voltage is applied to the grid, the plate current waveform will be a copy of the applied grid voltage. 

A relatively small variation in voltage on the control grid causes a significantly large variation in anode current.  The presence of a resistor in the anode circuit causes a large variation in voltage to appear at the anode.  The variation in anode voltage can be much larger than the variation in grid voltage which caused it, and thus the tube can amplify, functioning as an [[amplifier]].

== Construction ==
[[Image:Triode-english-text.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a modern low-power triode vacuum tube.  The glass and outer electrodes are shown partly cut away to reveal the construction.  ]]

The grid in the first triode valve consisted of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode.  This quickly evolved into a helix or cylindrical screen of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself.  [[Molybdenum]] [[alloy]] with a [[gold]] plating is frequently used.  It is wound on soft [[copper]] sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place.  A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).

== Effects of grid position ==

By placing the control grid closer to the filament/cathode relative to the anode, a greater [[amplifier|amplification]] results.  This degree of amplification is referred to in valve data sheets as the [[amplification factor]], or "mu".  It also results in higher [[transconductance]], which is a measure of the anode current change versus grid voltage change.  The [[noise figure]] of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure.  Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver.

== Multiple control grids ==

A valve can contain more than one control grid.  The [[hexode]] contains two such grids, one for a received signal and one for the signal from a local oscillator.  The valve's inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals.  This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in [[superheterodyne]] receivers.

== Grid variations ==

A variation of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch.  This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14178/css/14178_74.htm Variable mu valves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310142129/http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14178/css/14178_74.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the [[grid bias]] changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device.  This variation usually appears in the [[pentode]] form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu pentode or remote-cutoff pentode.

One of the principal limitations of the triode valve is that there is considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (C&lt;sub&gt;ag&lt;/sub&gt;). A phenomenon known as the [[Miller Effect]] causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of C&lt;sub&gt;ag&lt;/sub&gt; and amplification factor of the valve.  This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when C&lt;sub&gt;ag&lt;/sub&gt; is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency.  These effects can be overcome by the addition of a [[screen grid]], however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this 'parasitic capacitance' so low that triodes operating in the upper [[very high frequency]] (VHF) bands became possible.  The [[Mullard]] [[EC91]] operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitiance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer's literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area.  However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have C&lt;sub&gt;ag&lt;/sub&gt; of only 1 or 2fF, around a thousand times less. 'Modern' pentodes have comparable values of C&lt;sub&gt;ag&lt;/sub&gt;. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in 'grounded-grid' configuration, a circuit arrangement which prevents Miller feedback.

{{Other uses|Substance control (disambiguation)}}
A '''controlled substance''' is generally a drug or chemical whose manufacture, possession, or use is regulated by a government, such as [[illegal drugs|illicitly used drugs]] or [[prescription medication]]s that are designated by law. Some [[Treaty|treaties]], notably the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] provide internationally agreed upon "schedules" of controlled substances, which have been incorporated into national laws.

Some precursor chemicals used for the production of illegal drugs are also controlled substances in many countries, even though they may lack the pharmacological effects of the drugs themselves. Substances are classified according to schedules and consist primarily of potentially psychoactive substances. The controlled substances do not include many prescription items such as antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/index.html Controlled Substance Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws and enforcement ==
In the [[United States]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] is the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] agency responsible for suppressing illegal drug use and distribution by enforcing the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which regulates both the drugs themselves and certain precursors.  Some [[U.S. state|U.S. states]] have additional restrictions for substances which might or might not be regulated by the federal government. During the [[Obama Administration]], the federal government also voluntarily suspended enforcement of federal laws restricting [[marijuana]] where people were operating in compliance with state law.

Some states in the U.S. have statutes against health care providers self-prescribing and/or administering substances listed in the Controlled Substance Act schedules. This does not forbid licensed providers from self-prescribing medications not on the schedules.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term "[[Controlled Drug in the United Kingdom|'''controlled drug'''"]] (CD) is used for substances governed by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/controlled-substances answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Other national [[Drug prohibition law|drug prohibition laws]] include the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] ([[Canada]]) and the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1975]] ([[New Zealand]]), among many others.

In thermodynamics, the '''cryoscopic constant''', K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, relates [[molality]] to [[freezing point depression]] (which is a [[colligative property]]). It is the ratio of the latter to the former:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot b&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[van 't Hoff factor]], the number of particles the solute splits into or forms when dissolved. 
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the [[molality]] of the solution.

Through [[cryoscopy]], a known constant can be used to calculate an unknown [[molar mass]]. The term "cryoscopy" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] and means "freezing measurement." Freezing point depression is a [[colligative property]], so &lt;math&gt;\Delta T &lt;/math&gt; depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved, not the nature of those particles. Cryoscopy is related to [[ebullioscopy]], which determines the same value from the [[ebullioscopic constant]] (of [[boiling point elevation]]).

The K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for water is 1.853 [[kelvin|K]]·kg/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Diphosphorus tetroxide''',  or '''phosphorus tetroxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] of [[phosphorus]] and [[oxygen]]. It has the empirical [[chemical formula]] {{chem2|P2O4}}. Solid diphosphorus tetroxide (also referred to as phosphorus(III,V)-oxide) consists of variable mixtures of the mixed-valence oxides P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiley.com/college/math/chem/cg/sales/voet.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alberts B.|year=2002|title= Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Ed.|publisher= [[Garland Science]]|isbn=0-8153-4072-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volet-Volet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Voet D., Voet J.

== Preparation ==
Phosphorus tetroxide is obtainable by thermal decomposition of [[phosphorus trioxide]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4 \ P_2O_3 \rightleftharpoons  2 \ P + 3 \ P_2O_4}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;[[Phosphorus trioxide]] [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] above 210°C to form [[phosphorus]] and phosphorus tetroxide&lt;/small&gt;.

In addition, [[phosphorus trioxide]] can be converted into phosphorus tetroxide by controlled [[oxidation]] with oxygen in [[carbon tetrachloride]]  solution.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book|author=Atkins P.,  de Paula J.|year=2006|title=Physical chemistry, 8th Ed.|publisher= [[W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">[[File:RNDZ-1-110.jpg|thumb|upright|High-voltage disconnector.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], a '''disconnector''', '''disconnect switch''' or '''isolator switch''' is used to ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for service or maintenance.  Such switches are often found in [[electrical distribution]] and [[industry|industrial]] applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair.  High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as [[circuit breaker]]s, [[transformer]]s, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be operated either manually or automatically.

[[File:Masttrenner_Koessnach_Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|Medium-voltage disconnector]]
Unlike [[load switch]]es and [[circuit breaker]]s, disconnectors lack a mechanism for suppression of [[electric arc]]s, which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically interrupted. Thus, they are off-load devices, with very low [[breaking capacity]], intended to be opened only after current has been interrupted by some other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked).

Disconnectors have provisions for a [[lockout-tagout]] so that inadvertent operation is not possible. In high-voltage or complex systems, these locks may be part of a [[Trapped_key_interlocking|trapped-key interlock system]] to ensure proper sequence of operation.  In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to [[ground (electricity)|earth]] the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter-connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated.

A '''switch disconnector''' combines the properties of the disconnector and the load switch,{{refn|{{cite web | url = http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/disconnectors-load-switches-switch-disconnectors-cbs#3 | title = 
Differences between disconnectors, load switches, switch disconnectors and circuit breakers
 | author = Edvard Csanyi | website = Electrical Engineering Portal | date = 2014-06-20 | accessdate = 21 January 2016 }}}} so it provides the safety isolation function while being able to make and break nominal currents.

== Types of disconnectors ==
Disconnectors can be classified into various types based upon there constructional features and mounting arrangement. The major types of disconnectors are:

* Centre-break disconnectors
* Double-break disconnectors
* Pantograph disconnectors
* Horizontal break knee disconnectors

These are selected based upon the sub-station layout, clearances available and space constrains.

==Integrated disconnecting switch==
In a [[circuit breaker#Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)|disconnecting circuit breaker]] the disconnectors are integrated in the breaking chamber, which eliminates the need for separate disconnectors. The intention of this combined device is to decrease maintenance and increase [[availability]] and [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. The usage of this device instead of a disconnector is limited due to the fact that the open gap is not clearly visible and many doubts in term of safety arise during maintenance activities. Where it is adopted the earthing switch must be used and the performance must be increased by the typical value.

The open-air disconnecting switches typically need maintenance every five years (every two years under very polluted conditions), while circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applications of Disconnecting Circuit Breakers, Michael Faxå, p. 1-2 |url=http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/td2006/Papers/TD06_525.pdf |accessdate=11 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516021322/http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/td2006/Papers/TD06_525.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sometimes '''dynamic strain aging''' is used interchangeably with the [[Portevin–Le Chatelier effect]] (or serrated yielding), dynamic strain aging refers specifically to the microscopic mechanism that induces the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect. This [[Strengthening mechanisms of materials|strengthening mechanism]] is related to [[solid solution strengthening|solid-solution strengthening]] and has been observed in a variety of [[Cubic crystal system|fcc and bcc]] substitutional and interstitial alloys, metalloids like silicon, and ordered intermetallics within specific ranges of temperature and [[strain rate]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Mesarovic, Sinisa (1995)"Dynamic Strain Aging and Plastic Instabilities." '''J. Mech. Phys. Solids 43''':671–701 No. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of mechanism==
In materials, the motion of [[dislocation]]s is a discontinuous process. When dislocation meets obstacles (like forest dislocations) they are temporary arrested for a certain time. During this time solutes (such as interstitial particles) diffuse around the dislocations further strengthening the obstacles held on the dislocations. Eventually these dislocations will overcome these obstacles with sufficient stress and will quickly move to the next obstacle where they are stopped and the process can repeat.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Van Den Beukel, A. (1975)"Theory of the Effect of Dynamic Strain Aging on Mechanical Properties".''' Phys. Stat. Sol. (a) 30 197''':&lt;/ref&gt; This process's most well-known manifestations are [[Lüders band]]s and the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect. Though the mechanism is known to affect materials without these physical observations.&lt;ref Name="three"&gt;Atkinson, JD and Yu, J.(1997) "The Role of Dynamic Strain-Aging in the Environment Assisted Cracking observed in Pressure Vessel Steels". '''Fatigue Fracture Eng. Mater. Struct. Vol.20 No. 1''':1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material property effects==
Although serrations in the [[stress–strain curve]] caused by the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect are the most visible effect of dynamic strain aging, other effects may be present when this effect is not seen.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Often when serrated flow is not seen, dynamic strain aging is marked by a lower strain rate sensitivity. That becomes negative in the Portevin–Le Chatelier regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hahner, Peter (1996)"On the physics of the Portevin- Le Chatelier effect part 1: the Statistics of dynamic strain aging" '''Materials Science and Engineering A207''':&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic strain aging also causes a plateau in the strength, a peak in flow stress&lt;ref&gt;Mannan, S.L.(1993) "Role of dynamic stain aging on low cycle fatigue". '''Material Science vol 16 no 5''':561–582&lt;/ref&gt; a peak in [[work hardening]], a peak in the [[Grain boundary strengthening|Hall–Petch constant]], and minimum variation of [[ductility]] with temperature.&lt;ref name=Samuel96&gt;Samuel, K.G, Mannan, S.L, Rodriguez, P (1996) "Another Manifestation of Dynamic Strain Ageing" '''Journal of Material Science Letters 15''':1697-1699&lt;/ref&gt; Since dynamic strain aging is a hardening phenomenon it increases the strength of the material.&lt;ref name=Samuel96 /&gt;

==Material specific example of dynamic strain aging==
Dynamic strain aging has been shown to be linked to these specific material problems:
*Decrease the fracture resistance of Al–Li alloys.&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Decrease [[Fatigue (material)|low cycle fatigue]] life of austenitic stainless steels and super-alloys under test conditions which are similar to the service conditions in liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactors in which the material is used.&lt;ref&gt;2) Mannan, S.L., "Role of dynamic stain aging on low cycle fatigue" Material Science vol 16 no 5 December 1993 p561-582&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduce fracture toughness by 30–40% and shorten the air fatigue life of RPC steels and may worsen the cracking resistance of steels in aggressive environments. The susceptibility of RPC steels to environment assisted creating in high temperature water coincides with DSA behavior&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, JD and Yu, J. "the Role of Dynamic Strain-Aging in the environmental assisted cracking observed in Pressure Vessel Steels" Fatigue Fractur Engeg. Materis Struct. Vol. 20 No. 1 pp1-12 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
*PLC specific problems like blue brittleness in steel, loss of ductility and bad surface finishes for formed Aluminum Magnesium alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Abbadi, M., Hahner, P., Zeghloul, A., "On the characteristic of Portevin-Le Chatelier band in aluminum alloy 5182 under stress controlled and strain-controlled tensile testing" Materials Science and Engineering A337, 2002, p 194-201&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17115">In [[solid state physics]] the '''electron heat capacity''' or '''electronic specific heat''' describes the contribution of electrons to the [[heat capacity]]. 
Heat is transported by [[phonon]]s and by free electrons in solids. For pure metals, however, the electronic contributions dominate in the [[thermal conductivity]]. In impure metals, the electron mean free path is reduced by collisions with impurities, and the phonon contribution may be comparable with the electronic contribution.

== Introduction ==

Although the [[Drude model]] was fairly successful in describing the electron motion within metals, it has some erroneous aspects: it predicts the [[Hall coefficient]] with the wrong sign compared to experimental measurements, the assumed additional electronic heat capacity to the lattice [[heat capacity]], namely &lt;math&gt; \frac{3}{2} k_{B} &lt;/math&gt; per electron at elevated temperatures, is also inconsistent with experimental values, since measurements of metals show no deviation from the [[Dulong-Petit law]]. The observed electronic contribution of electrons to the heat capacity is usually less than one percent of &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2} k_{B} &lt;/math&gt;. This problem seemed insoluble prior to the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. This paradox was solved by [[Sommerfeld]] after the discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], who recognised that the replacement of the [[Boltzmann distribution]] with the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] was required and incorporated it in the [[free electron model]].

== Derivation for the electron heat capacity within the free electron model ==

=== Internal energy ===
When a metallic system is heated from absolute zero, not every electron gains an energy &lt;math&gt; k_{B}T &lt;/math&gt; as [[equipartition]] dictates. Only those electrons in [[atomic orbitals]] within an energy range of &lt;math&gt; \frac{3}{2} k_{B}T &lt;/math&gt; of the [[Fermi level]] are thermally excited. Electrons, in contrast  to a classical gas, can only move into free states in their energetic neighbourhood.
The one-electron energy levels are specified by the [[wave vector]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; through the relation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(k)=\hbar^2k^2/2m&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the electron mass. This relation separates the occupied energy states from the unoccupied ones and corresponds to the spherical surface in [[Reciprocal space|'''k'''-space]]. As &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; the [[ground state]] distribution becomes:

&lt;math&gt;f = \begin{cases}
  1 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon_f&lt;\mu, \\
  0 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon_f&gt;\mu. \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]]
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the energy level corresponding to the [[ground state]]
*&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the ground state energy in the limit &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, which thus still deviates from the true [[ground state]] energy.

This implies that the ground state is the only occupied state for electrons in the limit &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;f=1&lt;/math&gt; takes the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] into account. The [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a system within the free electron model is given by the sum over one-electron levels times the mean number of electrons in that level:

&lt;math&gt;U=2\sum_k \epsilon(\mathbf{k})f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reduced internal energy and electron density ===
Using the approximation that for a sum over a smooth function &lt;math&gt;F(k)&lt;/math&gt; over all allowed values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for finite large system is given by:

&lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{k})=\frac{V}{8\pi^3}\sum_k F(\mathbf{k})\Delta \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the system

For the reduced internal energy &lt;math&gt;u=U/V&lt;/math&gt; the expression for &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;u=\int \frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}\epsilon(\mathbf{k})f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

and the expression for the electron density &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{N}{V}&lt;/math&gt;  can be written as:

&lt;math&gt; n=\int\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals above can be evaluated using the fact that the dependence of the integrals on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be changed to dependence on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; through the relation for the electronic energy as described by the free electron model &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(k)=\hbar^2k^2/2m&lt;/math&gt; which yields for an arbitrary function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;  \int\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}G(\epsilon(\mathbf{k})) = \int_0^\infty \frac{k^2dk}{\pi^2}G(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))= \int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)G(\epsilon)  &lt;/math&gt;

with  &lt;math&gt;D(\epsilon) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{m}{\hbar^2\pi^2}\sqrt{\frac{2m\epsilon}{\hbar^2}} &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon&gt;0, \\
  0 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon&lt;0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
which is known as the density of levels or density of states per unit volume such that &lt;math&gt;D(\epsilon) d \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the total number of states between &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon+ d\epsilon &lt;/math&gt; . Using the expressions above the integrals can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
u&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)\epsilon f(\epsilon) \\
n&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)f(\epsilon) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These integrals can be evaluated for temperatures that are small compared to the [[Fermi temperature]] by applying the [[Sommerfeld expansion]] and using the approximation that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; differs from &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;T=0&lt;/math&gt; by terms of order &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;. The expressions become:

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
u&amp;=\int_0^{\epsilon_f} \epsilon D(\epsilon)d\epsilon + \epsilon_f  \Big (   (\mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_BT)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)\Big )  + \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_BT)^2 D(\epsilon_f)+ \mathcal{O}(T^4) \\
n&amp;=\int_0^{\epsilon_f} D(\epsilon)d\epsilon +  \Big (   (\mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_BT)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)\Big )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state configuration the first terms (the integrals) of the expressions above yield the internal energy and electron density of the ground state. The expression for the electron density reduces to &lt;math&gt;( \mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_BT)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this into the expression for the internal energy, one finds the following expression:

&lt;math&gt;u=u_0+\frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_BT)^2D(\epsilon_f) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Electron heat capacity === 
The contributions of electrons within the free electron model is given by:

&lt;math&gt;C_v=\Big ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial T} \Big )_n = \frac{\pi^2}{3} k_B^2TD(\epsilon_f)&lt;/math&gt;, for free electrons : &lt;math&gt; C_V = C_v / n = \frac{\pi^2}{2} \frac{k_B^2T}{\epsilon_f} &lt;/math&gt;

Compared to the classical result &lt;math&gt; C_V=\frac{3}{2}k_B&lt;/math&gt; it can be concluded that this result is depressed by a factor of &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi^2}{3} \frac{k_BT}{\epsilon_f} &lt;/math&gt; which is at room temperature of order of magnitude &lt;math&gt;10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. This explains the absence of an electronic contribution to the heat capacity as measured experimentally.

Note that in this derivation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt; which is known as the [[Fermi energy]]. In this notation, the electron heat capacity becomes:

&lt;math&gt;C_v= \frac{\pi^2}{3} k_B^2TD(E_f)&lt;/math&gt; and for free electrons : &lt;math&gt; C_V = \frac{\pi^2}{2}k_B \Big( \frac{k_BT}{E_f} \Big ) = \frac{\pi^2}{2} k_B\Big( \frac{T}{T_f} \Big ) &lt;/math&gt; using the definition for the [[Fermi energy]] with &lt;math&gt; T_f &lt;/math&gt; the [[Fermi temperature]].

== Comparison with experimental results for the heat capacity of metals ==

For temperatures below both the [[Debye temperature]]  &lt;math&gt;T_D&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Fermi temperature]]  &lt;math&gt;T_F&lt;/math&gt; the heat capacity of metals can be written as a sum of electron and [[phonon]] contributions that are linear and cubic respectively: &lt;math&gt;C_V=\gamma T +AT^3&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficient &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated and determined experimentally. Some values are tabulated below:

The free electrons in a metal do not usually lead to a strong deviation from the [[Dulong–Petit law]] at high temperatures. Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is linear in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is linear in &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt;, at low temperatures the lattice contribution vanishes faster than the electronic contribution and the latter can be measured. The deviation of the approximated and experimentally determined electronic contribution to the heat capacity of a metal is not too large. A few metals deviate significantly from this approximated prediction.  Measurements indicate that these errors are associated with the electron mass being somehow changed in the metal, for the calculation of the electron heat capacity the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of an electron should be considered instead. For Fe and Co the large deviations are attributed to the partially filled [[d-shells]] of these [[transition metals]], whose d-bands lie at the [[Fermi energy]].
The [[alkali metal]]s are expected to have the best agreement with the free electron model since these metals only one s-electron outside a closed shell. However even sodium, which is considered to be the closest to a free electron metal, is determined to have a &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; more than 25 per cent higher than expected from the theory.

Certain effects influence the deviation from the approximation:
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with the periodic potential of the rigid crystal lattice is neglected.
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with phonons is also neglected. This interaction causes changes in the effective mass of the electron and therefore it affects the electron energy.
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with themselves is also ignored. A moving electron causes an inertial reaction in the surrounding electron gas.

== Heat capacity of superconductors ==

[[Superconductivity]] occurs in many metallic elements of the periodic system and also in alloys, [[intermetallic]] compounds, and doped [[semiconductors]]. This effect occurs upon cooling the material. The [[entropy]] decreases on cooling below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; for [[superconductivity]] which indicates that the superconducting state is more ordered than the normal state. The entropy change is small, this must mean that only a very small fraction of electrons participate in the transition to the superconducting state but, the electronic contribution to the heat capacity changes drastically. There is a sharp jump of the heat capcacity at the critical temperature while for the temperatures above the critical temperature the heat capacity is linear with temperature.

=== Calculation of the electron heat capacity for a superconductor ===
The calculation of the electron heat capacity for super conductors can be done in the [[BCS theory]]. The entropy of a system of [[fermionic]] [[quasiparticles]], in this case [[Cooper pairs]], is:

&lt;math&gt; S(T)=-2k_B \sum_k[f_k ln f_k +(1-f_k) ln(1-f_k)] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] &lt;math&gt; f_k=\frac{1}{e^{\beta \omega_k}+1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\omega_k=\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
* &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_k=E_K-\mu=\hbar^2\mathbf{k}^2/2m -\mu &lt;/math&gt; is the particle energy with respect to the [[Fermi energy]] 
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_k(T) =-\sum_{kk'}u_{k'}v_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; the energy gap parameter where &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the probability that a [[Cooper pair]] is occupied or unoccupied respectively.

The heat capacity is given by &lt;math&gt; C_v(T)=T\frac{\partial S(T)}{\partial T}=T\sum_k \frac{\partial S}{\partial f_k}\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial T} &lt;/math&gt;.
The last two terms can be calculated:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial f_k} &amp;=-2k_B ln \frac{f_k}{1-f_k}=2\frac{1}{T} \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}\\
\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial T} &amp;= \frac{1}{k_B T^2} \frac{e^{\beta \omega_k}}{(e^{\beta \omega_k}+1)^2}\Big ( \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}-T\frac{\partial}{\partial T} \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2} \Big ) \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in the expression for the heat capacity and again applying that the sum over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; in the reciprocal space can be replaced by an integral in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; multipied by the [[density of states]] &lt;math&gt; D(E_f)&lt;/math&gt; this yields:

&lt;math&gt; C_v(T)=\frac{2D(E_f)}{k_B T^2}\int^\infty_{-\infty} \left[ \frac{e^{\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}}}{(e^{\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}}+1)^2} \Big ( \epsilon_k^2 + \Delta_k(T)^2 -\frac{T}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \Delta_k(T)^2 \Big ) \right] d\epsilon_k&lt;/math&gt;

=== Characteristic behaviour of the electron heat capacity for superconductors ===
To examine the typical behaviour of the electron heat capacity for species that can transition to the superconducting state, three regions must be defined:

# Above the critical temperature&lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; 
# At the critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T=T_c &lt;/math&gt; 
# Below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt;

==== Electron heat capacity for superconductors for &lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
For &lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt; \Delta_k(T)=0 &lt;/math&gt; and the electron heat capacity becomes:

&lt;math&gt;  C_v(T)=\frac{4D(E_f)}{k_B T^2}\int^\infty_{-\infty}\frac{e^{\beta \epsilon}}{(e^{\beta \epsilon}+1)^2} \epsilon^2 d\epsilon=\frac{\pi^2}{3}D(E_f)k_B^2T &lt;/math&gt;

This is just the result for a normal metal derived in the section above, as expected since a [[superconductor]] behaves as a normal conductor above the critical temperature.

==== Electron heat capacity for superconductors for &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
For &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; the electron heat capacity for super conductors exhibits an exponential decay of the form:
&lt;math&gt; C_v(T)\approx e^{-\beta \Delta_k(0)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Electron heat capacity for superconductors for &lt;math&gt; T=T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
At the critical temperature the heat capacity is discontinuous. This discontinuity in the heat capacity indicates that the transition for a material from normal conducting to superconducting is a [[second order phase transition]].

More recent research has found that since both the Fermi function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the electronic density of states &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary with &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Pengfei|last2=Zhang|first2=Yuwen|year=2016|title=Continuum-atomistic simulation of picosecond laser heating of copper with electron heat capacity from ab initio calculation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261416300100|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=648|pages=109–113|doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2016.02.003|arxiv=1602.01180|bibcode=2016CPL...648..109J}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more exact expression for &lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt; is the following equation at given &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_e = \frac{1}{V_c} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left({\partial D\over\partial T_e}f + D{\partial f\over\partial T_e}\right)\epsilon d\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Coal==
{{Main |Coal mining in Poland }}

In 2009 Poland produced 78 [[megatonne]]s (Mt) of hard coal and 57 Mt of [[Lignite|brown coal]].

=== Coal and the environment===
Coal mining has far-reaching effects on local water resources. Coal mining requires large amounts of water. Mining activities have dropped the water level of Lake [[Ostrowskie Lake|Ostrowskie]] by almost two meters in the [[Kuyavia]]–[[Pomerania]] and the lakes in the [[Powidz Landscape Park]]. According to Poznań's [[Poznań University of Agriculture|University of Agriculture]], the water drainage in the [[Kleczew]] brown coal mining areas has formed craters in the area.&lt;ref name="truecost" /&gt;

===Coal and the public===
In April 2008, five thousand people demonstrated in [[Kruszwica]] to protect cultural heritage and the nature reserve at Lake [[Gopło]]. This was the first protest of its kind in the country's history. [[Gopło Landscape Park|Gopło Millennium Park]] (''Nadgoplański Park Tysiąclecia'') is protected by the European Union's [[Natura 2000]] program and includes a major [[bird sanctuary]]. The [[Tomisławice, Łódź Voivodeship|Tomisławice]] [[Open-pit mining|opencast mine]] (less than 10 kilometers away from the Kruszwica mine) was due to open in 2009.&lt;ref name="truecost" /&gt;

=== Coal and business===
The [[Bełchatów Power Station]] in the [[Łódź]] region supplies almost 20% of Poland's energy. It is the largest brown coal power plant in Europe.

== Electricity ==
In 2008, a net 143 TWh of electricity were produced in coal-based power plants.&lt;ref name="IEA2010" /&gt;

==Renewable energy==
A binding European Union resolution, the [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009]], stipulates a 15% [[renewable energy]] target for total energy use in Poland by  2020. According to the Polish [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]], the 2020 figure is set to exceed this target by 0.5% at 15.5% of overall energy use, broken down as 19.1% of total electricity consumption, 17% in the heating and cooling sector, and 10.1% in the transport sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/national-action-plans|title=National action plans - Energy - European Commission|website=Energy|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2014 - 2015 renewable energy provided around 10% of total primary energy supply in Poland as well as around 13% of total electricity generation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/energy-policies-of-iea-countries---poland-2016-review.html|title=Publication: Energy Policies of IEA Countries - Poland 2016 Review|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of year end 2014 Poland had achieved an 11.45% share of renewable energy use as a percentage of overall energy usage. The overall 2014 share breaks down as 13.95% of the heating and cooling sector, 12.40% of the electricity sector and 5.67% of the transport sector.

=== Sources ===

==== Biomass and waste ====
As of 2015 Biomass and waste was the largest source of renewable energy in Poland providing an estimated 8.9% of total primary energy supply (TPES) in that year and an estimated 6.1% of electricity generation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solid biomass is the most important source by volume, providing fuel for heat and power plants or consumed directly for industrial or household heat requirements. Biogasses are also used in heat and power plants as well whilst waste is mainly used as a fuel in industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2014 0.7 Mtoe of biofuels were used in transport, 81% as biodiesel and 19% as biogasoline, making up 5% of the total energy consumption in the transport sector in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wind power is estimated to have provided 6.6% of total electricity generation in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Polish [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan|NREAP]] plan is targeting 6,700 MW of wind power by 2020 whilst EWEA's 2009 forecast suggests a higher wind capacity of 10–12&amp;nbsp;GW is possible.&lt;ref name="EWEA2050" /&gt;

The Polish government had plans to reach 2,000 MW in [[wind power]] capacity and a 2.3% share of wind generation in domestic energy consumption by 2010.&lt;ref name="GWEC2006" /&gt; By the end of 2010, the capacity stood at 1,107&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="ewea0" /&gt; If Poland had the same wind power density as [[Wind power in Denmark|Denmark]], there would have been 23&amp;nbsp;GW of wind power by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="ewea" /&gt;

The '''Eolica Cogealac Wind Farm''' is a proposed wind power project in [[Cogealac]], [[Constanţa County]], [[Romania]]. It will consist of eleven individual wind farms connected together. It will have 224 individual [[wind turbine]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edch.ch/projects/descriptions.shtml Eolica Dobrogea to build wind farm in the Dobrogea Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210014204/http://edch.ch/projects/descriptions.shtml |date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a nominal output of around 2 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] which will deliver up to 448 MW of power, enough to power over 300,000 homes, with a capital investment required of approximately US$600 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7292">The '''Export Land Model''', or Export-Land Model, refers to work done by Dallas geologist Jeffrey Brown, building on the work of others, and discussed widely on [[The Oil Drum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoildrum.com/tag/export_land_model Export Land Model discussion archive]. TheOilDrum.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  It models the decline in [[petroleum|oil]] [[export]]s that result when an exporting nation experiences both a [[peak oil|peak in oil production]] and an increase in domestic oil [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  In such cases, exports decline at a far faster rate than the decline in oil production alone.

The Export Land Model is important to petroleum importing nations because when the rate of global petroleum production peaks and begins to decline, the petroleum available on the world market will decline much more steeply than the decline in total production.

== Theory ==

As world oil exports approach (or pass) a global peak, the [[price of oil|price of exported]] oil increases and further stimulates domestic [[economic growth]] and oil consumption in Export-Land countries, creating a [[positive feedback]] process between declining exports and higher prices.  Eventually, however, the level of export decline outpaces the increasing oil price, slowing domestic growth.  In some cases, an Export Land eventually becomes a net importer.  It is unlikely that an Export Land would constrain domestic consumption to help importing countries.  In fact, many oil exporting countries [[Gasoline_usage_and_pricing#Countries_with_subsidised_gasoline|subsidize domestic consumption]] below price levels defined by the world [[Financial market|market]].

== Hypothetical example ==
Given a [[hypothetical]] oil producing country (known by the model as an Export Land) that produces {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, consumes {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, and exports {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} to oil consuming countries around the world, the model would be applied as such (illustrated in the graph above):
:Export Land hits the point of Peak Oil production, and over a five-year period production drops by 25%.   Over the same time period, Export Land's consumption increases by 20% to 1.2 mbpd.  This causes Export Land's net exports over the five-year period to fall from 1 mbpd to 0.3 mbpd, a decrease of 70% -- resulting from a combination of increasing domestic consumption in Export Land and a 25% drop in production.  Counter-intuitively, the fractional decline in exports is much greater than the sum of the fractional increase in domestic consumption and the fractional decline in production.

Several real-world nations exhibit the characteristics of the Export Land Model as pictured in the image gallery above.  These four nations exhibit increasing domestic consumption along with declining production.  Indonesia has already shifted from oil exporter to oil importer while Egypt is hovering on the brink.  Malaysia and Mexico also have the hallmarks of the Export Land Model.

Within 5 years, Mexico (the second biggest exporter of oil to the US) may become a net oil importer.  Other nations where this may soon happen include Iran, Algeria and Malaysia.&lt;ref name=krauss1207&gt;{{cite news
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/business/worldbusiness/09oil.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin
|work=[[The New York Times]]
|author=Clifford Krauss
|title=Oil-Rich Nations Use More Energy, Cutting Exports
|date=2007-12-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent report from [[CIBC World Markets]] also indicates that as much as 40% of [[Saudi Arabia]]'s expected production increases will be offset by rising internal demand by 2010, and [[Iran]]ian exports will decline by more than 50% for similar reasons.  This report indicates that similar market pressures could reduce net worldwide oil exports by {{convert|2.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} (about 3%).&lt;ref name="krauss1207"/&gt;

Nations may also reach their peak of oil production without fitting the Export Land model.  For example, the United Kingdom began importing oil in 2006, after decades of exporting, due to declining production.  But as domestic consumption in the UK has remained essentially unchanged for the last 20 years, their rising import levels essentially match their falling production levels.  Similarly, Norway's exports began declining in 2001, but at the same rate as their production because their domestic consumption was also not growing.  Unlike many exporters, these two countries don't subsidize local market oil price and have high fuel prices by world standards,&lt;ref&gt;[Gas price from around the world http://www.dailyfueleconomytip.com/oil-prices/gas-prices-from-around-the-world-2/]&lt;/ref&gt; thus one of the premises of the export land model (that domestic consumption should not be affected by world market price){{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;!-- this might very well be true, but where is it stated? --&gt; does not apply to those countries.

{{Other uses}}
'''Freezing''' is a [[phase transition]] in which a [[liquid]] turns into a [[solid]] when its [[temperature]] is lowered below its freezing point. In contrast, '''solidification''' is a similar process where a liquid turns into a solid, not by lowering its temperature, but by increasing the pressure that it is under.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=I haven't encountered such a definition of solidification in chemistry, but perhaps it's defined that way in geosciences or somewhere else?}} Despite this technical distinction, the two processes are very similar and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature; however, certain substances possess differing solid–liquid transition temperatures. For example, [[agar]] displays a [[Hysteresis#Liquid-solid phase transitions|hysteresis]] in its [[melting point]] and freezing point. It melts at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) and solidifies from 32&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C (89.6&amp;nbsp;°F to 104&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml |title=All About Agar |publisher=Sciencebuddies.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603081846/http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml| archivedate= 3 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystallization==
{{main|Crystallization}}
Most liquids freeze by [[crystallization]], formation of [[crystal|crystalline solid]] from the uniform liquid. This is a first-order thermodynamic [[phase transition]], which means that as long as solid and liquid coexist, the temperature of the whole system remains very nearly equal to the [[melting point]] due to slow removal of heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor. Because of the [[latent heat of fusion]], the freezing is greatly slowed down and the temperature will not drop anymore once the freezing starts but will continue dropping once it finishes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Crystallization consists of two major events, [[nucleation]] and [[crystal growth]]. Nucleation is the step wherein the molecules start to gather into clusters, on the [[nanometer]] scale, arranging in a defined and periodic manner that defines the [[crystal structure]]. The crystal growth is the subsequent growth of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical cluster size.

==Supercooling==
{{main|Supercooling}}
[[File:SuperCool 2009-01-02.ogv|thumb|Rapid formation of ice crystals in supercool water (home freezer experiment)]]
In spite of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], crystallization of pure liquids usually begins at a lower temperature than the [[melting point]], due to high [[activation energy]] of [[Nucleation#Homogeneous nucleation|homogeneous nucleation]]. The creation of a nucleus implies the formation of an interface at the boundaries of the new phase.  Some energy is expended to form this interface, based on the [[surface energy]] of each phase. If a hypothetical nucleus is too small, the energy that would be released by forming its volume is not enough to create its surface, and nucleation does not proceed. Freezing does not start until the temperature is low enough to provide enough energy to form stable nuclei. In presence of irregularities on the surface of the containing vessel, solid or gaseous impurities, pre-formed solid crystals, or other nucleators, [[Nucleation#Heterogeneous nucleation|heterogeneous nucleation]] may occur, where some energy is released by the partial destruction of the previous interface, raising the supercooling point to be near or equal to the melting point. The melting point of [[water]] at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F, 273.15&amp;nbsp;K), and in the presence of [[Nucleation|nucleating substances]] the freezing point of water is close to the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can [[Supercooling|supercool]] to &amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°C (&amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°F, 233&amp;nbsp;K) before freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1082 | author=Lundheim R. | title=Physiological and ecological significance of biological ice nucleators | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume=357 | issue=1423 | year=2002 | pages=937–943  | url = |  pmid=12171657 | pmc=1693005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1098/rsta.2002.1141 | author=Franks F. | title=Nucleation of ice and its management in ecosystems | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume=361 | issue=1804 | year=2003 | pages=557–574  | format = [[PDF]]  | url = http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1804/557.long | pmid = 12662454 |bibcode = 2003RSPTA.361..557F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under high pressure (2,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s) water will supercool to as low as &amp;minus;70&amp;nbsp;°C (&amp;minus;94&amp;nbsp;°F, 203&amp;nbsp;K) before freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Homogeneous nucleation of supercooled water: Results from a new equation of state | first1=CA | last1=Jeffery | first2=PH | last2=Austin | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | volume=102 | issue=D21 | pages= 25269–25280 |year= November 1997 | doi=10.1029/97JD02243 | bibcode=1997JGR...10225269J | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | citeseerx=10.1.1.9.3236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exothermicity==
{{main|Enthalpy of fusion}}
Freezing is almost always an [[exothermic]] process, meaning that as liquid changes into solid, heat and pressure are released. This is often seen as counter-intuitive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-an-exothermic-rea What is an exothermic reaction?] ''Scientific American'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt; since the temperature of the material does not rise during freezing, except if the liquid were [[supercooled]]. But this can be understood since heat must be continually removed from the freezing liquid or the freezing process will stop. The energy released upon freezing is a [[latent heat]], and is known as the [[enthalpy of fusion]] and is exactly the same as the energy required to [[melting|melt]] the same amount of the solid.

Low-temperature [[helium]] is the only known exception to the general rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Atkins |first=Peter |last2=Jones |first2=Loretta |year=2008 |title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |isbn=0-7167-7355-4 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helium-3]] has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. [[Helium-4]] also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be ''added'' to these substances in order to freeze them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ott |first=J. Bevan |last2=Boerio-Goates |first2=Juliana |year=2000 |title=Chemical Thermodynamics: Advanced Applications |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-530985-6 |pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vitrification==
{{main|Glass transition}}
Certain materials, such as [[glass]] and [[glycerol]], may harden without crystallizing; these are called [[amorphous solid]]s. Amorphous materials, as well as some polymers, do not have a freezing point, as there is no abrupt phase change at any specific temperature. Instead, there is a gradual change in their [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties over a range of temperatures. Such materials are characterized by a [[glass transition]] that occurs at a [[glass transition temperature]], which may be roughly defined as the "knee" point of the material's density vs. temperature graph. Because vitrification is a non-equilibrium process, it does not qualify as freezing, which requires an equilibrium between the crystalline and liquid state.

==Expansion==
Some substances, such as [[water]] and [[bismuth]], expand when frozen.

==Freezing of living organisms==
{{Main|Cryobiology}}
Many living organisms are able to tolerate prolonged periods of time at temperatures below the freezing point of water.  Most living organisms accumulate [[cryoprotectant]]s such as [[Antifreeze protein|anti-nucleating proteins]], polyols, and glucose to protect themselves against [[Frost#Effect on plants|frost damage]] by sharp ice crystals. Most plants, in particular, can safely reach temperatures of &amp;minus;4&amp;nbsp;°C to &amp;minus;12&amp;nbsp;°C. Certain [[bacteria]], notably ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]'', produce specialized proteins that serve as potent ice nucleators, which they use to force ice formation on the surface of various fruits and plants at about &amp;minus;2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Maki LR, Galyan EL, Chang-Chien MM, Caldwell DR | title=Ice nucleation induced by ''Pseudomonas syringae'' | journal=Applied Microbiology  | volume=28 | issue=3 | year=1974 | pages=456–459 |pmid=4371331 | pmc=186742 | last2=Galyan | last3=Chang-Chien | last4=Caldwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; The freezing causes injuries in the epithelia and makes the nutrients in the underlying plant tissues available to the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Zachariassen KE, Kristiansen E | title=Ice nucleation and antinucleation in nature | journal=Cryobiology | volume=41 | issue=4 | year=2000 | pages=257–279 |pmid=11222024  | doi=10.1006/cryo.2000.2289| last2=Kristiansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
Three species of bacteria, ''[[Carnobacterium pleistocenium]]'', as well as ''[[Chryseobacterium greenlandensis]]'' and ''[[Herminiimonas glaciei]]'', have reportedly been revived after surviving for thousands of years frozen in ice.

===Plants===
Many plants undergo a process called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]], which allows them to survive temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°C for weeks to months.

===Animals===
The nematode ''[[Haemonchus contortus]]'' can survive 44 weeks frozen at [[liquid nitrogen]] temperatures. Other nematodes that survive at temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°C include ''[[Trichostrongylus colubriformis]]'' and ''[[Panagrolaimus davidi]]''. Many species of reptiles and amphibians survive freezing.  See [[cryobiology]] for a full discussion.

Human [[gametes]] and 2-, 4- and 8-cell [[embryos]] can survive freezing and are viable for up to 10 years, a process known as [[cryopreservation]].

Experimental attempts to freeze human beings for later revival are known as [[cryonics]].

==Food preservation==
{{main|Frozen food}}
Freezing is a common method of [[food preservation]] that slows both food decay and the growth of [[micro-organism]]s.  Besides the effect of lower temperatures on [[reaction rate]]s, freezing makes water less available for [[bacteria]]l growth.

'''The GREEN cell shipping concept''' is a new concept for powering merchant shipping vessels using [[containerized]] power units and a global logistics chain to manage these containers. GREEN cell stands for Global Renewable Electrical Energy Network cell. The concept resulted from a [[thought experiment]] process involving engineers working for the [[ABB Group]] that took place on March 13, 2009 in Oslo, Norway. The concept was subsequently introduced in an ABB magazine, and remains under development, as part of an [[open innovation]] process.

==Background==
The propulsion of merchant ships is responsible for approximately 4% of global carbon-dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/03/travelsenvironmentalimpact.transportintheuk |title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output from shipping twice as much as airlines |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=The Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London | first=John | last=Vidal | date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry itself estimated its carbon footprint at 3.3% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D26046/4-7.pdf |title=PREVENTION OF AIR POLLUTION FROM SHIPS: Second IMO GHG Study 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=International Maritime Organization }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry responded officially as early as 2003 by calling for measures to limit or reduce the emissions from international shipping.&lt;ref&gt;I{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:97wgHcYZVQ4J:www.imo.org/includes/blastData.asp/doc_id%3D9905/963.pdf+resolution+A.963(23)&amp;hl=en |title=Resolution A.963(23) IMO POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATED TO THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM SHIPS |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=International Maritime Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to envision solutions to this challenge, a team of engineers and consultants associated with ABB set up a thought experiment that would pose the question: "How could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels?" The core team consisted of three electrical engineers: Jaakko Aho, Jukka Varis and Klaus Vänska, all of Finland. This group laid down a core set of design principles around fossil-free marine propulsion, and described a hypothetical system that was later called the GREEN Cell shipping concept.

==The GREEN Cell==
The GREEN Cell is at the core of the shipping concept. Each GREEN cell is envisaged as a container-sized source of electricity, based on inherent chemical energy ([[Battery (electricity)|battery]]), in addition to [[solar energy]] and [[wind energy]]. Each cell provides electricity to the ship's network. The electrical power potential of each GREEN cell depends on the sum of the power in the battery, the size of solar panel area obtained, the efficiency of the solar panel and the efficiency of the wind power system.

===Solar power===
Initial designs for a GREEN cell proposed that each GREEN Cell opens two doors length-wise, thus covering neighboring containers as well. The inside of the doors, and much of the exposed surface of the container are mounted with solar panels. Thus, a typical container ship could cover its entire surface with solar energy panels. One GREEN Cell produces as much as {{convert|1000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of solar panel surface area. This equates to roughly 12&amp;nbsp;kW. 100 such containers could thus conceivably produce 1.2 MW. Alternate calculations show that such a system would retrieve 500 Watts per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Multiplied by the approximately 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of surface area on a large container ship like [[Emma Maersk]] would give 10 MW of solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.abb.com/global/scot/scot293.nsf/veritydisplay/e42b092600731c32c12575e600374e5e/$File/Generations1.2009_web-version.pdf |title=How could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels? |accessdate=2009-08-24 |publisher=ABB Marine |pages=36–41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707073619/http://library.abb.com/global/scot/scot293.nsf/veritydisplay/e42b092600731c32c12575e600374e5e/$File/Generations1.2009_web-version.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
An extendable vertical-axis windmill emerges from one side of the container. A vertical-axis [[windmill]] is preferred as it introduces less resistance to the forward motion of the ship and disturbs ship stability less than horizontal-axis windmills.

===Stored chemical power===
The battery of the GREEN cell takes up the remainder of the space in the container. Designers describe the potential battery as either an optimised lithium-ion battery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.abb.com/global/scot/scot293.nsf/veritydisplay/e42b092600731c32c12575e600374e5e/$File/Generations1.2009_web-version.pdf |title=How could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels? |accessdate=2009-08-24 |publisher=ABB Marine |pages=36–41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707073619/http://library.abb.com/global/scot/scot293.nsf/veritydisplay/e42b092600731c32c12575e600374e5e/$File/Generations1.2009_web-version.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sodium-sulfur one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/environment/2007-07-04-sodium-battery_N.htm |title=New battery packs powerful punch |accessdate=2009-08-24 |publisher=USA Today | first=Paul | last=Davidson | date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The GREEN Cell network==
===GREEN Cell ships===
Like a ship that takes refrigerated containers, a GREEN Cell-equipped ship would have an electrical connection to a number of
containers. In this case, instead of feeding electricity to the refrigerated units, the ship would pull power from the containers. The GREEN Cell ship carries as many as several hundred GREEN Cells, adding weight to the ship and subtracting from available cargo space. Conversely, the GREEN Cell ship forgoes a typical diesel engine (weighing roughly 75 tons), a frequency converter (weighing roughly 25 tons) and petroleum fuel tanks (as much as 3000 tons).

===GREEN Cell hubs===
A network of floating power stations placed along major trade routes either recharge a ship’s GREEN Cells, or simply switch them out (like a traditional container port). These create electricity from green sources like wave power generators, wind turbines, a flywheel-driving water density column, solar panels and current-driven turbines.

===Shoreside GREEN Cell centres===
Container terminals carry a large supply of ready-to-go GREEN Cells. These switch out GREEN Cells on ships just like a container port
unloads and reloads a container ship. Thus the GREEN Cell system serves both deepsea merchant marine traffic and coastal cabotage.

{{for|the English bicycle pioneer|George Singer (cycle manufacturer)}}
'''George John Singer''' (1786–1817) was an English early pioneer of electrical research, noted for his publications and for lectures delivered privately and at the [[Russell Institution]].

==Biography==
George John Singer was son of Thomas Singer, and younger brother of [[Samuel Weller Singer]]. In early life he was engaged in his mother's business of artificial-flower making. Every spare moment, however, he devoted to scientific study, more particularly to the investigation of [[electricity]] and [[electromagnetism]], then little known. He was a friend of and worked with [[Andrew Crosse]], another early electrical pioneer.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Frank A. J. L. |title=Singer, George John (1786–1817), electrical researcher |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25638|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer built, almost unassisted, a large room at the back of his mother's house in Prince's Street, [[Cavendish Square]], where he gave courses of lectures on electricity and kindred subjects. Among his audience were [[Michael Faraday]] and [[Francis Ronalds|Sir Francis Ronalds]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Carlyle | first =E. I.. | title =Singer, George John (1786–1817), electrician | work = [[Dictionary of National Biography]] Vol. LII | publisher =Smith, Elder &amp; Co.  | year =1897 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/25638 | accessdate = 2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Singer published ''Elements of Electricity and Electro-chemistry'', London, 1814, a work of considerable contemporary importance, which was translated into French (Paris, 1817), into Italian (Milan, 1819), and into German (Breslau, 1819). He also contributed several papers to the ''Philosophical Magazine'' from 1813 to 1815, of which a list is given in Ronalds's ''Catalogue of Books on Electricity, Magnetism'', &amp;c.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Singer made almost the whole of his apparatus himself, and introduced several enhancements. He invented an improved gold-leaf [[electrometer]] that was used widely for many years. A key feature was a new mode of [[insulator (electricity)|insulating]] the wire connected to the leaves through the cap of the bottle, which he announced in 1811 and described in his book. Ronalds later put on record that the idea for the insulation was his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=104|issue=7|pages=1489|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer died, unmarried, of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], induced by overwork, on 28 June 1817, at his mother's house.

He lived in the Old House now known as Coundon Court Academy.

'''Karapınar Renewable Energy Resource Area''' ({{lang-tr|Karapınar Yenilenebilir Enerji Kaynak Alanı}}, YEKA) is a proposed [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Konya Province]], central Turkey.

To be built at the YEKA area of [[Karapınar]] district in Konya Province, the plant will have 1,000 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] installed power.&lt;ref name="iik"/&gt; With this capacity, it will be one of the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest solar power plant of its kind]].&lt;ref name="ds1"/&gt; The project includes annual production of 500 [[nominal power (photovoltaic)|MWp]] [[Solar panel|photovoltaic solar module]]s and a [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] Center.&lt;ref name="iik"/&gt;

The tender for the construction was won on March 20, 2017 by a consortium of the Turkish [[Kalyon Group]] and South Korea's [[Hanwha]], which offered the lowest [[Kilowatt hour|kW·h]]-price with 6.99 US cent valid for an energy purchase term of 15 years. The amount of the investment is expected to exceed US$1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; It is planned that more than 1,500 people will be employed in the project.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt; The start of the energy production is scheduled for the end of 2018.&lt;ref name="ds1"/&gt; When completed, the solar power station will annually generate 1,700 GW·h of electrical energy, sufficient to supply 600,000 households.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;

They appear to "radiate" from a certain point in the sky (the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]]) and vary in the speed, frequency and brightness of the meteors. As of March 2016, there are 95 known meteor showers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515004182 The established meteor showers as observed by CAMS] Icarus, Volume 266, 1 March 2016, Pages 331-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note:''' Dates are accurate for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Meteor Shower Calendar|url=http://imo.net/files/meteor-shower/cal2017.pdf|publisher=International Meteor Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates will 'move' based upon the year in the Leap year cycle. Also, this list includes showers with radiants in both the northern and southern hemispheres. There is some overlap, but generally showers whose radiants have positive declinations are best seen from the northern hemisphere, and those with negative declinations are best observed from the southern hemisphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">'''Maypan''' is an [[F1 hybrid]] [[coconut]] [palm] that was developed by the Research Department of the Coconut Industry Board of Jamaica to be resistant to [[Lethal Yellowing]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avxl82.dsl.pipex.com/CICLY/main.html Centre for Information on Coconut Lethal Yellowing (CICLY)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605224039/http://www.avxl82.dsl.pipex.com/CICLY/main.html |date=2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created experimentally in 1962 by cross pollinating two varieties of ''Cocos nucifera'' and, after extensive disease exposure and yield performance trials, was named and released in 1974 when a suitable method of mass controlled pollination had been devised.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, H.C. &amp; Romney, D.H. (1974) Maypan: an F1 hybrid coconut variety for commercial production in Jamaica. World Crops 26, 110-111. (Reprinted: The Farmer 79(3) 57-60, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Dwarf''x''Tall'' hybrid,&lt;ref name&gt;P.K. Thampan. 1981. Handbook on Coconut Palm. Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Malayan Dwarf]] seed parents, grown in an isolated seed garden and kept constantly emasculated, are regularly pollinated by blowing a mixture of talc and [[pollen]] collected from selected palms of a variety known locally as [[Panama Tall]]. This combination gives the Maypan an LY disease resistance approaching that of the Malayan Dwarf and much of the windstorm tolerance of the Panama Tall. It grows to approximately 18 meters in height. The LY resistance of the Maypan, of both of its parents, and of other coconut varieties generally, has been called into question since the 1990s but Maypan, and F1 hybrids using the same types of parents, are still the planting material of choice in the Caribbean and Latin American countries where LY occurs.

'''Mist''' is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Columbia County, Oregon|Columbia County]], [[Oregon]], United States. Formerly called Riverside, the place was renamed in 1888 for the atmospheric conditions of the [[Nehalem River|Nehalem Valley]].&lt;ref name=ogn&gt;{{cite OGN|7th|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first land claims in the area had been made circa 1870.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tracking the Kerry Line: Evidence From a Logging Railroad Camp in the Nehalem Valley, Oregon|author1=Connolly, Thomas J. |author2=Bland, Richard L. |author3=Tonsfeldt, Ward |journal=Journal of Northwest Anthropology|date=Fall 2011|volume=45|issue=22|pages=199–208|url=http://www.northwestanthropology.com/article_files/Final%20with%20Cover.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1538-2834|publisher=Northwest Anthropology|location=Richland, Washington|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Riverside post office was closed in 1975.&lt;ref name=ogn/&gt;
 
On July 6, 2001, the Mist store, which was built in 1874, caught fire and was destroyed. Until then, it was the oldest continuously operating business in Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~jbutts14/mist.html The Nehalem River Highway], Jeffrey Butts&lt;/ref&gt; offering food and hardware and displaying historic newspaper clippings and antique logging equipment on the walls.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Mist is a crossroads community where [[Oregon Route 47]] turns north to [[Clatskanie, Oregon|Clatskanie]], and a pioneer trail (Burn Road) crossed the Nehalem River and went south to [[Vernonia, Oregon|Vernonia]]. It is the eastern terminus of [[Oregon Route 202]]. The Nehalem River valley widens between Mist and [[Jewell, Oregon|Jewell]] and was favored by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the area for hunting; it was later favored by early [[European American]] settlers for agriculture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Although the area is now sparsely settled, it is notable for having the largest operating [[sawmill]] in Columbia County and also geological conditions lending themselves to [[natural gas storage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Mist contains one of the very few, and therefore very valuable, natural gas storage areas in the [[Pacific Northwest]].

'''Oilfield scale inhibition''' is the process of preventing the formation of [[fouling|scale]] from blocking or hindering fluid flow through pipelines, valves, and pumps used in oil production and processing. [[Descaling agent|Scale inhibitors]] (SIs) are a class of specialty chemicals that are used to slow or prevent scaling in water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alzahrani|first=Salem|last2=Mohammad|first2=Abdul Wahab|date=2014-12-01|title=Challenges and trends in membrane technology implementation for produced water treatment: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214714414001093|journal=Journal of Water Process Engineering|volume=4|pages=107–133|doi=10.1016/j.jwpe.2014.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Oilfield scaling is the [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation]] and accumulation of insoluble crystals (salts) from a mixture of incompatible [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] phases in oil processing systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; {{em|Scale}} is a common term in the [[oil industry]] used to describe solid deposits that grow over time, blocking and hindering fluid flow through pipelines, valves, pumps etc. with significant reduction in production rates and equipment damages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Bin|last2=Pan|first2=Kai|last3=Li|first3=Li|last4=Giannelis|first4=Emmanuel P.|last5=Cao|first5=Bing|date=2014-08-15|title=High performance hydrophilic pervaporation composite membranes for water desalination|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916414002793|journal=Desalination|volume=347|pages=199–206|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2014.05.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaling represents a major challenge for [[flow assurance]] in the oil and gas industry. Examples of oilfield scales are calcium carbonate ([[limescale]]), iron sulfides, barium sulfate and strontium sulfate.

== Background ==
[[File:Limescale-in-pipe.jpg|alt=|thumb|Scale build-up effectively decreases pipeline diameter and reduces flow rate]]
The three prevailing water-related problems that upset oil companies today are corrosion, gas hydrates and scaling in production systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Formation, removal, and inhibition of inorganic scale in the oilfield environment|last=W.

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir water has a high composition of dissolved minerals equilibrated over millions of years at constant physicochemical conditions. As the reservoir fluids are pumped from the ground, changes in temperature, pressure and chemical composition shift the equilibria and cause precipitation and deposition of sparingly soluble salts that build up over time with the potential of blocking vital assets in the oil production setups.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Formation, removal, and inhibition of inorganic scale in the oilfield environment|last=Wayne W Frenier, Murtaza Ziauddin, N.

== Types of scales ==
Two main classifications of scales are known; inorganic and organic scales and the two types are mutually inclusive, occurring simultaneously in the same system, referred to as mixed scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mixed scales may result in highly complexly structured scales that are difficult to treat. Such scales require aggressive, severe and sometimes costly remediation techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Paraffin wax]], [[asphaltene]]s and [[Clathrate hydrate|gas hydrates]] are the most often encountered organic scales in the oil industry. This article focuses on the simplest and common form of scales encountered; inorganic scales.

=== Inorganic scale ===
Inorganic scales refer to [[Mineral|mineral deposits]] that occur when the formation water mixes with different [[brine]]s such as injection water. The mixing changes causes reaction between incompatible ions and changes the thermodynamic and equilibrium state of the reservoir fluids. [[Supersaturation]] and subsequent deposition of the inorganic salts occur. The most common types of inorganic scales known to the oil/gas industry are [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]] and [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]]; [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] and [[Chlorite group|chlorites]] are often encountered. 

While, the solubility of most inorganic salts (NaCl, KCl, ...) increases with temperature (endothermic dissolution reaction) , some inorganic salts such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate have also a [[Solubility#Temperature|retrograde solubility]], i.e., their solubility decreases with temperature. In the case of calcium carbonate, it is due to the degassing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whose solubility decreases with temperature as it is the case for most of the gases (exothermic dissolution reaction in water). In the case of calcium sulfate, the reason is that the dissolution reaction of calcium sulfate itself is exothermic and therefore is favored when the temperature decreases (then, the dissolution heat is more easily evacuated, see [[Le Chatelier's principle]]). In other terms, the solubility of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate increases at low temperature and decreases at high temperature, as it is also the case for [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) often referred as a didactic case study to explain the reason of retrograde solubility.

=== Calcium carbonate scale ===
Water, noted for its high solvation power can dissolve certain gases such as carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;. Under the right conditions of temperature and/or pressure, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; molecules react to yield carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) whose solubility increases at low temperature and high pressure.  The slightest changes in pressure and temperature dissolves H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; in water according to equation (3) to form hydronium and bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;) ions.
# CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
# 2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
# Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

The two reactions (2) and (4) describe the equilibrium between bicarbonate ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which are highly soluble in water and calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) salt. According to [[Le Chatelier's principle]], drilling operations and extraction of the oil from the well bore decreases the pressure of the formation and the equilibrium shifts to the right (3) to increase the production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to offset the change in pressure. After years of oil production, wells may experience significant pressure drops resulting in large CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; deposits as the equilibrium shifts to offset the pressure changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sulfate scales ===
Sulfates of Group (II) metal ions (M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), generally decrease in solubility down the group. The most difficult scales to remove are those of Barium sulfate because of its high insolubility forming very hard scale deposits. A general representation of the reaction is summarized in reaction:

5. M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → MSO&lt;sub&gt;4(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

Sulfate scale usually forms when formation water and injected seawater mix together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The relationship between these and the degree of supersaturation is crucial in estimating the amount of sulfate salts that will precipitate in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=I.R.|date=2002-01-01|title=A New Model for Mineral Scale Adhesion|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/74655-MS|journal=International Symposium on Oilfield Scale|language=english|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/74655-ms|isbn=9781555639426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater has a high concentration of sulfate ions and mixing with formation water with lots of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the formation water. Severe problems with sulfate scale are common in reservoirs where seawater has been injected to enhance oil recovery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to its relatively high solubility in water, Calcium sulfate is the easiest sulfate scale to remove chemically as compared to strontium and barium sulfate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scale crystals are initially dispersed in production systems until accumulation of stable crystals of insoluble sulfates and scale growth occur at nucleation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crabtree, M., Eslinger, D., Fletcher, P., Miller, M., Johnson, A., &amp; King, G.|first=|year=1999|title=Fighting Scale- prevention and removal|url=|journal=Oilfield Review|volume=11 |issue=3|pages=30–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uneven pipeline surfaces and production equipment such as pumps and valves cause rapid scale growth to levels that can block pipelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The scaling-tendency of an oil-well can be predicted based on the prevailing conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure, ionic strength and the mole fraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the vapor and aqueous phases.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oddo|first=J.E.|last2=Tomson|first2=M.B.|date=1994-02-01|title=Why Scale Forms in the Oil Field and Methods To Predict It|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/21710-PA|journal=SPE Production &amp; Facilities|language=english|volume=9|issue=01|pages=47–54|doi=10.2118/21710-pa|issn=1064-668X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the saturation index for CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; scale is calculated using the formula;

F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= {[Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;][CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]}/K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;

Where F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the scale saturation ratio, defined as the ratio of the activity product to the solubility product of the salt. Activity is defined as the product of the activity coefficients and the concentrations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The ionic strength is a measure of the concentration of the dissociated ions dissolved in water also called as “total dissolved solids” (TDS).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Scale remediation ==
Different oilfield scale remediation techniques are known but majority are based on three basic themes:
# Sulfate ion sequestering from sea injection waters
# Chemical or mechanical Scale removal/dissolution
# Application of Scale Inhibitors (SIs) for scale prevention
The first two methods may be used for short-term treatment and effective for mild-scaling conditions,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; however, continuous injection or chemical scale squeeze treatment with SIs have been proven over the years to be the most efficient and cost-effective preventative technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laing|first=N.|last2=Graham|first2=G.M.|last3=Dyer|first3=S.J.|date=2003-01-01|title=Barium Sulphate Inhibition in Subsea Systems - The Impact of Cold Seabed Temperatures on the Performance of Generically Different Scale Inhibitor Species|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/80229-MS|journal=International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry|language=english|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/80229-ms|isbn=9781555639556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scale inhibitors ===
[[File:DTPMP.png|thumb|Chemical Structure of Diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene-phosphonic acid)]]

For instance, to bind positively charged ions in the water, anions must be present in the inhibitor molecular backbone structure and vice versa. Group (II) metal ions are commonly sequestered by SIs with the following functionalities;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

- Phosphonate ions (-PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

'''-''' Phosphate ions (-OPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Phosphonate ions (-PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Sulphonate ions (-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Carboxylate ions (-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

A SI with a combination of two or more of these functional groups is more efficient in managing scale problems. Usually the sodium salts of the carboxylic derivatives are synthesized as the anionic derivatives and are known to be the most effective due to their high solubilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interactions of these functional groups tend to prevent the crystal growth sites using dissociated or un-dissociated groups. The dissociation state is determined by the pH of the system, hence knowledge of the pKa values of the chemicals are important for different pH environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=GM Boak, LS Sorbie, KS|year=2003|title=The influence of formation calcium and magnesium on the effectiveness of generically different barium sulphate oilfield scale inhibitors|url=|journal=SOC PETROLEUM ENG|volume=18|pages=28–44|via=Science Citation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the inhibition efficiency of the SI depends on its compatibility with other production chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=T.A.|last2=Bourne|first2=H.M.|last3=Bolton|first3=J.R.|date=1993-01-01|title=Examining the Potential for Corrosion Inhibitor and Scale Inhibitor Compatibility in a Multifunctional Squeeze Strategy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/25167-MS|journal=SPE International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry|language=english|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/25167-ms|isbn=9781555634926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental considerations ==
Generally, the environmental impacts of SIs are complicated further by combination of other chemicals applied through exploratory, drilling, well-completion and start-up operations. Produced fluids, and other wastes from oil and gas operations with high content of different toxic compounds are hazardous and harmful to human health, water supplies, marine and freshwater organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.offshore-environment.com/drillwastestream.html|title=Drilling Waste Streams from Offshore Oil and Gas Installations|website=www.offshore-environment.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oilfield water technology.|last=Davies|first=Michael ; P.

Efforts to develop more [[environmentally friendly]] SIs have been made since the late 1990s and an increasing number of such SIs are becoming commercially available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent environmental awareness over the past 15 years has resulted in the production and application of more environmentally friendly SIs, otherwise called 'Green Scale Inhibitors' (GSI).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boak|first=Lorraine S.|last2=Sorbie|first2=Ken|date=2010-11-01|title=New Developments in the Analysis of Scale Inhibitors|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/130401-PA|journal=SPE Production &amp; Operations|language=english|volume=25|issue=04|pages=533–544|doi=10.2118/130401-pa|issn=1930-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; These GSIs are designed to have reduced bio-accumulating and high biodegradability properties and therefore reduce pollution of the waters around oil production systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Phosphate ester]] SIs, commonly employed for treating calcium carbonate scales are known to be environmentally friendly but poor inhibition efficiency.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Myles M.|last2=Sorhaug|first2=Eyvind|last3=Marlow|first3=David|date=2012-11-01|title=Red vs. Green Scale Inhibitors for Extending Squeeze life--A Case Study From the North Sea, Norwegian Sector--Part II|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/140752-PA|journal=SPE Production &amp; Operations|language=english|volume=27|issue=04|pages=404–413|doi=10.2118/140752-pa|issn=1930-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Release of SIs containing Nitrogen and Phosphorus distorts the natural equilibrium of the immediate water body with adverse effects on aquatic life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Otto Redlich''' (November 4, 1896 – August 14, 1978) was an Austrian [[physical chemist]] and chemical engineer who is best known for his development of equations of state like [[Redlich-Kwong equation]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reif-Acherman | first1 = Simón | title = Otto Redlich: chemist and gentleman from the "old school" | journal = Química Nova | volume = 31 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1590/S0100-40422008000700053 | issue = 7 | pages = 1901–1908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Otto Redlich, 1896–1978: in memory and appreciation | journal = Fluid Phase Equilibria | volume = 12 | pages = 1 | year = 1983 | doi = 10.1016/0378-3812(83)85010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this he had numerous other contributions to science. He won the [[Haitinger Prize]] of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1932.{{sfn|Reif-Acherman|2008|p=1902}}

==Biography==
Redlich was born 1896 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. He went to school in the Döbling district of Vienna. After finishing school in 1915 he joined the Austrian Hungarian Army and served as artillery officer mainly at the Italian front in [[World War I]]. He was wounded and became a prisoner of war in August 1918. He returned to Vienna after the war in 1919. He studied chemistry and received his [[doctorate]] in 1922 for work on the equilibrium of nitric acid, nitrous and nitric oxide. Redlich worked for one year in industry and than joined [[Emil Abel]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. He became lecturer in 1929 and professor in 1937. During this time he developed the [[Teller-Redlich isotopic product rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Redlich | first = O. | year = 1935 | title = Eine allgemeine Beziehung zwischen den Schwingungsfrequenzen isotoper Moleküln (nebst Bemerkungen über die Berechnung harmonischer Kraftkonstanten) | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie]] B | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 371–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaad | first1 = L.J. | last2 = Bytautas | first2 = Laimutis | last3 = Houk | first3 = K.N. | title = Ab initio test of the usefulness of the Redlich-Teller product rule in computing kinetic isotope effects | journal = Canadian Journal of Chemistry | volume = 77 | pages = 875 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1139/cjc-77-5-6-875 | issue = 5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Angus | first1 =W.

Like many other scientist Redlich tried to leave the [[Nazi]] governed Austria.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

With the help of the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]] he was able to emigrate to the United States in December 1938. He gave lectures at several universities and met [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Linus Pauling]]. [[Harold Urey]] helped him to get a position in [[Washington State College]]. In 1945 he left the College and started to work in industry, at Shell Development Co. in [[Emeryville, California]]. He published his paper on the improvement of the  [[Ideal gas law|ideal gas equation]] in 1949, today known as  the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redlich | first1 = Otto | last2 = Kwong | first2 = J.

In 1962 Redlich retired from Shell and received a position at [[University of California at Berkeley]]. He died in California in 1978.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

The '''Palmer drought index''', sometimes called the '''Palmer drought severity index''' and often abbreviated '''PDSI''', is a measurement of dryness based on recent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drought.gov/drought/data-maps-tools/current-conditions Current Palmer Drought Index at National Integrated Drought Information System]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[meteorologist]] Wayne Palmer, who first published his method in the 1965 paper ''Meteorological Drought''&lt;ref name="Palmer1965"&gt;Wayne Palmer, "Meteorological Drought". Research paper no.45, U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, February 1965 (58 pgs). Available online by the [[NOAA]] National Climatic Data Center at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/docs/palmer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for the Office of Climatology of the [[U.S. Weather Bureau]].

The Palmer Drought Index is based on a [[Supply and demand|supply-and-demand]] model of [[soil moisture]]. Supply is comparatively straightforward to calculate, but demand is more complicated as it depends on many factors, not just temperature and the amount of moisture in the soil but also hard-to-calibrate factors including [[evapotranspiration]] and recharge rates. Palmer tried to overcome these difficulties by developing an algorithm that approximated them based on the most readily available data, precipitation and temperature.

The index has proven most effective in determining long-term drought, a matter of several months, but it is not as good with conditions over a matter of weeks. It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of negative numbers; for example, negative 2 is moderate drought, negative 3 is severe drought, and negative 4 is extreme drought. Palmer's algorithm also is used to describe wet spells, using corresponding positive numbers. Palmer also developed a formula for standardizing drought calculations for each individual location based on the variability of precipitation and temperature at that location. The Palmer index can therefore be applied to any site for which sufficient precipitation and temperature data is available.

Critics have complained that the utility of the Palmer index is weakened by the arbitrary nature of Palmer's algorithms, including the technique used for standardization. The Palmer index's inability to account for snow and frozen ground also is cited as a weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Alley, William: The Palmer Drought Severity Index: Limitations and Assumptions, Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology, Vol. 23, pp. 1100–09, July 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palmer index is widely used operationally, with Palmer maps published weekly by the United States Government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. It also has been used by climatologists to standardize global long-term drought analysis. Global Palmer data sets have been developed based on instrumental records beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dai, Aiguo et al.: A Global Dataset of Palmer Drought Severity Index for 1870–2002: Relationship with Soil Moisture and Effects of Surface Warming, Journal of Hydrometeorology, Vol. 5, No. 6, pp. 1117–30, December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[dendrochronology]] has been used to generate estimated Palmer index values for North America for the past 2000 years, allowing analysis of long term drought trends.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, E.R. et al.: Long-Term Changes in the Western United States, [[Science (journal)|Science]], Vol. 306, No. 5698, pp. 1015–18, November 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a means of explaining the late [[Bronze Age collapse]].

In the US, regional Palmer maps are featured on the cable channel [[Weatherscan]].

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3548">'''Rajaolibanda Diversion Scheme''' or '''RDS''' is an irrigation project located across [[River Tungabhadra]] in [[Jogulamba Gadwal district]] of [[Telangana]] , [[Kurnool district]] of [[Andhra pradesh]] and [[Raichur district]] of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-08-04/hyderabad/27210740_1_telangana-region-telangana-rashtra-samithi-k-chandrasekhar-rao|title=TRS chief writes to MPs on Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an inter-state barrage on the Tungabhadra river to supply water to Karnataka, [[Telangana]] and Andhra Pradesh states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindu.com/2003/06/29/stories/2003062904220400.htm|title=The Hindu : AP, Karnataka join hands in Rajolibanda Scheme|website=hindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full reservoir level of this barrage is 332.32 m [[Sea level|MSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://waterresources.kar.nic.in/salient_features_rajolibanda.htm |title=  Salient data of Rajolibanda barrage|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RDS was taken up on river Tungabhadra and the head works and the left bank canal was mostly completed by 1956. In the year 2013, [[Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal]]-2  allocated  four (4) [[tmcft]] water for construction of RDS right bank canal in Kurnool district.

==The Project==
RDS left canal provides irrigation water in  Raichur district and [[Mahbubnagar district]] of Telangana. The [[Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal|Bachawat Tribunal]] had allocated 17.1 tmcft to its left canal of which 15.9 tm cft was exclusively meant for Mahabubnagar district. The RDS left canal has been a source of sorrow to the Mahabubnagar farmers because it is hardly giving them 8 to 10 tmcft against their entitlement of 15.9 tmcft.

The Rajolibanda barrage is not receiving adequate continuous flows due to excessive water utilization in its catchment area in Karnataka. It would be a permanent solution to connect the upstream catchment area (near {{Coord|16|01|00|N|76|32|00|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}} at 475 m MSL) via 20&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel with the [[Narayanpur Dam|Narayanpur reservoir]] which is located across the adjacent [[Krishna River]]. It would also provide additional water to bring more area under irrigation in uplands of Raichur &amp; Mahboobnagar districts and low lands of [[Kurnool district]]. Reliable Krishna river water can be supplied instead of unreliable Tungabhadra river water to the existing Tungabhadra Left bank canal in Raichur district, the existing Rajolibanda left bank canal and the existing 150 years old [[K. C. Canal]]. In addition to taking up Rajolibanda right bank canal construction, a new barrage /weir ( {{Coord|15|51|27|N|77|01|59|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}} ) would be constructed across the Tungabhadra river located upstream of Rajolibanda barrage to divert the augmented Krishna river water for the additional irrigation in Kurnool district. Thus substantial [[Tungabhadra Dam|Tungabhadra reservoir]] water would be saved for utilization in upstream new projects and  reliable water supply is ensured to existing projects.013

'''Rhenium diboride''' (ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a synthetic [[superhard material]].  It was first synthesized in 1962{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0365110X62000298|title=The crystal structure of rhenium diboride|year=1962|last1=La Placa|first1=S. J.|last2=Post|first2=B.|journal=Acta Crystallographica|volume=15|issue=2|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-emerged recently due to hopes of achieving high hardness comparable to that of [[diamond]].&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chung | first = Hsiu-Ying | date = April 20, 2007 | title = Synthesis of Ultra-Incompressible Superhard Rhenium Diboride at Ambient Pressure | journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5823 | pages = 436–9 | doi = 10.1126/science.1139322 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/316/5823/436 | pmid = 17446399 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Weinberger | first2 = M.

The production method of this material does not involve high pressures as with other hard synthetic materials, such as [[cubic boron nitride]], which makes production cheap.  However, rhenium itself is an expensive metal.

The compound is formed from a mixture of [[rhenium]], noted for its resistance to high pressure, and [[boron]], which forms short, strong [[covalent bond]]s with rhenium.

== Synthesis ==
[[File:Rhenium_Diboride.jpg|thumb|left|Rhenium diboride, ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be synthesized by at least three different methods at standard atmospheric pressure: solid-state [[metathesis reaction (chemistry)|metathesis]], melting in an [[electric arc]], and direct heating of the elements.&lt;ref name="Chung" /&gt;

In the metathesis reaction, [[rhenium trichloride]] and [[magnesium diboride]] are mixed and heated in an inert atmosphere and the [[magnesium chloride]] byproduct is washed away. Excess boron is needed to prevent formation of other phases such as Re&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Re&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B.

In the arc-melting method, rhenium and boron powders are mixed and a large electric current is passed through the mixture, also in an inert atmosphere.

In the direct reaction method, the rhenium-boron mixture is sealed in a vacuum and held at a high temperature over a longer period (1000&amp;nbsp;°C for five days).

At least the last two methods are capable of producing pure ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without any other phases, as confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

== Properties ==
The hardness of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits considerable [[anisotropy]] because of its hexagonal layered structure (see structure model), being greatest along the ''c'' axis. In contrast to the [[Mohs hardness scale|scratch hardness test]], its [[Vickers hardness scale|indentation hardness]] (H&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 22 GPa)&lt;ref name=comment&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200801471|title=Is Rhenium Diboride a Superhard Material?|year=2008|last1=Qin|first1=Jiaqian|last2=He|first2=Duanwei|last3=Wang|first3=Jianghua|last4=Fang|first4=Leiming|last5=Lei|first5=Li|last6=Li|first6=Yongjun|last7=Hu|first7=Juan|last8=Kou|first8=Zili|last9=Bi|first9=Yan|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=20|issue=24|pages=4780}}&lt;/ref&gt; is much lower than that of diamond and is comparable to that of [[tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium diboride]] or [[zirconium diboride]].&lt;ref name=comment /&gt;

ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; slowly reacts with water, converting into a hydroxide.

Two factors contribute to the high hardness of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: a high density of [[valence electron]]s, and an abundance of short [[covalent bond]]s.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Electronic, dynamical, and thermal properties of ultra-incompressible superhard rhenium diboride: A combined first-principles and neutron scattering study |author1=W.

The addition of boron requires only a 5% expansion of the rhenium lattice, because the small boron atoms fill the existing spaces between the rhenium atoms. Furthermore, the [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] of rhenium and boron are close enough (1.9 and 2.04 on the [[Electronegativity#Pauling electronegativity|Pauling scale]]) that they form covalent bonds in which the electrons are shared almost equally.

'''SAES Getters S.p.A.''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] joint stock company, established in 1940. It is the [[parent company]] of the SAES [[Industry|industrial]] group, which focusses its business on the production of components and systems in [[advanced material]]s patented by the same company and used in various industrial and medical applications.

== History ==

=== 1940s and 50s ===
[[File:SAES Historical Building Milan.jpg|alt=SAES-Historical-Building-Milan|thumb|S.A.E.S. historical building in Milan.]]

In 1940 the company S.A.E.S. (Società Apparecchi Electrici e Scientifici) was formed in [[Florence]] at the initiative of Ernesto Gabrielli, an engineer from [[Livorno]] and two other [[shareholders]]. The impetus for the foundation of the company was the discovery by Gabrielli of a new method for the production of [[getter]]s, with [[nickel]] lids to protect [[barium]] plastics, in order to prevent the phenomenon of [[oxidation]].
S.A.E.S. initially devoted itself to producing time clocks and a barium-[[magnesium]]-[[aluminium]] [[alloy]]. After a few years, it transferred its headquarters to [[Milan]] and began to produce electrical resistance heaters.

In 1946, the Della Porta and Canale families entered the shareholding structure and in 1949, Paolo della Porta joined the company, subsequently taking over management in 1952. A period began that was distinguished by major innovations, supported by the Research and Development Laboratory, notably the invention of ring-shaped getters in barium-aluminium alloy. The company expanded into Europe, appointing its first agents in [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[England]].

S.A.E.S. continued to invest in scientific research during a period of major change in the electronics sector, characterised by the extensive spread of transistors, to the detriment of vacuum tubes intended for [[radio]] and [[television]] reception and transmission. In 1957 S.A.E.S. filed a patent for getters for television [[cathode tube]]s, first for black and white and then for colour television, launching production on an industrial scale.

=== 1960s and 70s ===
This period was characterised by company consolidations, innovations and commercial successes, including at international level. S.A.E.S. also commissioned its first mass production plant.
At the “3rd Symposium on Residual Gases”, held in Rome in 1967, S.A.E.S. presented a new configuration of getter, consisting of a metallic tape coated with St 101 alloy, obtained from the combination of [[zirconium]] and [[aluminium]]. This technological evolution allowed the company to execute new products with [[Non-Evaporable Getter|non-evaporable getters]] (NEG) and [[Vacuum pump|getter pumps]]. The non-evaporable getter pumps (NEG pumps) are devices which have the same purpose as barium getters but do not require an evaporation process; they have extremely high absorptive capacity and are still used today, in more advanced forms, in applications requiring a high or ultra-high vacuum.

Exploiting its own technological skills in the field of metallurgy, during these two decades, S.A.E.S. developed new alloys (such as the St 707 alloy in [[zirconium]], [[vanadium]] and [[iron]]) and was involved in projects on the catalytic module and purifiers of [[inert gases]].

It also pursued its internationalisation with the creation of subsidiaries with commercial responsibilities in the [[United Kingdom]] (1966), [[United States]] (1969), [[Canada]] (1969) and [[Japan]] (1973). Other commercial representative offices were opened in [[France]] (1978) and in [[Germany]] (1979). In 1977, SAES Getters USA Inc. was founded in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], the first foreign subsidiary with a manufacturing mission for satisfying the growing demand for porous non-evaporable getters from the US military industry.

S.A.E.S. continued to grow by virtue of the progressive launch of new products and the expansion of its production structure, both through the construction of new plants and acquisitions of other companies. In 1978, it had grown to 300 employees, redefined its company structure and changed its name, from S.A.E.S. to SAES Getters.

=== 1980s ===
[[File:SAES-Advanced-Technologies-Avezzano.jpg|alt=SAES Advanced Technologies|thumb|SAES Advanced Technologies' building in Avezzano, Italy.]]

In 1982, a plant was commissioned in [[Nanjing]], in [[China]], for the production of barium getters, the installations for which were supplied directly by SAES Getters.

The objective during this period was the vertical integration of production (or the internal management of all processes), which over the years would become one of the group's strong points. From this perspective, in 1984, SAES Metallurgia was founded in [[Avezzano]] (Province of [[L'Aquila|L’Aquila]]), for the production of barium and barium-aluminium alloy, SAES Engineering, for the execution of instruments and devices necessary for the metallurgical processing of alloys, and SAES Gemedis dedicated to the production of Gemedis (Getter Mercury Dispenser), i.e. alloys containing [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. Over the course of the 1990s, the three companies merged into SAES Advanced Technologies S.p.A., adding to their own portfolio numerous other articles and devices used constantly in Hi-Tech applications requiring a vacuum or ultrahigh vacuum.

In the mid-1980s, SAES Getters concluded two important acquisitions in the United States in the field of barium getters for cathode tubes and created Getters Corporation of America.

In 1986, SAES Getters was listed on the stock exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=29 June 2010 |title=Saes Getters |url=http://argomenti.ilsole24ore.com/saes-getters.html |deadurl= |newspaper=ilsole24ore.com |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Italian |access-date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the financial resources raised allowing it to pursue its acquisitions policy, most notably, towards the end of the decade, the [[California]]n company Cryolab Inc., subsequently renamed SAES Pure Gas Inc., within which it still develops and produces gas purification products, principally for the [[semiconductor]] industry.

In 1989, Massimo della Porta, Paolo's son, began to work for SAES Metallurgia. Over the years, Massimo took on increasingly important roles until he was appointed Chairman of SAES Getters in 2009.

=== 1990s ===
At the start of the 1990s, the entire activity of the group was encompassed in three sectors: barium getters for the television industry, non-evaporable getters,  NEG pumps and metal dispensers for industrial and scientific applications, gas purifiers and analyzers for the semiconductor industry. Over the decade, production companies were established in South Korea and China and commercial companies in [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]].

In 1996, in order to meet the new requirements of the company in the fields of production and research, the new headquarters was inaugurated in Lainate. During the same year, SAES Getters became the first Italian company to be listed on [[Nasdaq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 May 1996 |title=Saes Getters quotata al Nasdaq |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/maggio/24/Saes_Getters_quotata_Nasdaq_co_0_9605246179.shtm|newspaper=corriere.it |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Italian |access-date=15 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the most important equity market in the US for high-tech companies (on which the company remained until 2003, the year in which it requested a delisting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strategic-directions.com/_a/industry-news/?action=2&amp;terms=&amp;sdi=14afea28-747f-4faf-bfbb-59647a8ebf28 |title=SAES Getters to Delist from US Nasdaq Exchange |access-date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 1990s, with the succession of technologies in the field of televisions, SAES Getters, sensing the importance of new market developments, expanded its own field of production and focused on technologies widespread in the flat display sector, in particular, mercury dispensers for backlight lamps for [[LCD]] (Liquid Crystal Display) for [[Computer monitor|monitor]]s and televisions.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, Paolo della Porta was appointed “Entrepreneur of the Year” by [[Ernst &amp; Young]], with this recognition consolidating the image of the company at international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/World-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year---Past-winners/ |title=EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year. Past winners |access-date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, this decade signalled a notable change for the entire company, with its structure reorganised through new acquisitions and company policy evolving significantly, which, characterised by innovation and diversification, focused increasingly on expanding its technology portfolio in advanced materials. This strategy led SAES Getters to specialise in the execution of components and systems for high-tech industrial and medical applications, allowing the company to survive unscathed after the collapse of a number of key markets, such as barium getters for the television industry or back lights for LCD screens. Furthermore, during this period, the company developed highly innovative technologies and processes for the depositing of getters on silicon wafers for so-called [[MEMS]] (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems), miniaturised devices intended for various applications, such as sensors and [[gyroscopes]].

The company entered the [[Shape memory alloys|shape memory alloy]] sector (SMA), becoming a key reference for the sector and the first producer of SMA devices and materials for use in industry. In this way, SAES acquired Memory Metalle GmbH (renamed Memry GmbH in 2010), a German company with metallurgical and application skills relating to SMA in the field of medicine. It also acquired two companies in the United States: Memry Corporation, specialising in the production of SMA devices for medical use and the business division of Special Metal Corporation, dedicated to the production of NiTiNol (renamed SAES Smart Materials). NiTiNol is the commercial name of shape memory alloys used in medicine and the SAES group is one of the major international suppliers of this material. SAES then launched the production of SMA wires and springs for industrial applications at its Italian facilities, with these now concentrated at its headquarters in [[Lainate]].

In this context, in 2011, together with the German company Alfmeier, SAES Getters established the 50-50 joint venture in Germany, Actuator Solutions GmbH, to boost its own competitiveness at international level in the fields of development, production and marketing of SMA-wire-based actuators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=5 July 2011 |title=Saes Getters a braccetto con Alfmeier Prazision |url=http://finanza.repubblica.it/News_Dettaglio.aspx?code=694&amp;dt=2011-07-05&amp;src=TLB |deadurl= |newspaper=repubblica.it |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Italian |access-date=15 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the joint venture won the “German Innovation Award” in the medium-sized company category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=13 July 2014 |title=Actuator Solutions wins German Innovation Award for shape memory devices |url=http://www.asminternational.org/web/ims/news/-/journal_content/56/10180/20073947/NEWS;jsessionid=D695990AAF88DD8853D0EF5E28B49578?p_p_id=webcontentresults_WAR_webcontentsearchportlet_INSTANCE_35iDxUvqEPc6&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=2&amp;p_p_col_count=4 |newspaper=asminternational.org |access-date=15 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is also strengthening its presence in the field of purification, with the acquisition of a division of the company Power &amp; Energy ([[Ivyland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]), with the aim of expanding its production of [[palladium]] membrane purifiers.

At the same time, the Research and Innovation area of the company is developing innovative hybrid technologies, which integrate getter materials into polymer matrices, initially concentrating on the development of dispensable absorbers for organic electronics applications, in particular [[OLED]] (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) light displays and sources. From 2013 onwards, further developments of the polymer technological platform have permitted the group to execute new functional polymer compounds, with the properties of interacting with the gases and optical, mechanical and surface modifying functions, according to the requirements and applications of interest, including implantable medical devices, food packaging and the field of energy storage ([[lithium]] batteries and super condensers).

In 2010, it also established the company ETC, the fruit of a collaboration between [[National Research Council (Italy)|CNR]] and SAES Getters (the majority shareholder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=18 December 2014|title=ETC Srl |url=http://www.ismn.cnr.it/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=418:etc-srl&amp;Itemid=554&amp;lang=it |deadurl= |newspaper=ismn.cnr.it |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Italian |access-date=15 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An innovative research programme was launched within ETC for the development of OLET technology (Organic Light Emitting Transistor).

The group is mainly focused on advanced [[alloys]], advanced [[inorganic]] materials, polymer-matrix composites and thin [[metal]] films.

=== Solid state chemistry ===
SAES Getters exploits [[solid-state chemistry]] to manage multiphase solid-state reactions among one or more solid phases. Evaporable getters, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] dispensers, [[alkali]] metal dispensers are examples of products based on solid-state reactions.

=== Metallurgy ===
The company has been dealing for decades with vacuum metallurgy ([[arc melting]] and [[vacuum induction melting]]) and [[powder metallurgy]] (milling technologies, sieving, powders classification and mixing, screen printing and sintering). In particular, by the available sintering technologies, processes under high vacuum or inert atmosphere and controlled conditions of temperature, time (traditional sintering) and pressure (hot uniaxial pressing and cold isostatic pressing) can be performed allowing to obtain either highly porous either full dense sintered bodies.

=== Shape memory alloys ===
[[Shape-memory alloy|SMA]] are materials that can exhibit the property of remembering their original shape even after being severely deformed. Thanks to their intrinsic shape memory and superelastic effects, they represent an enabling technology for implantable medical devices and actuators. SAES Getters deals with designing new materials on a theoretical level, developing new alloys on an industrial scale as well as modeling and manufacturing new components.

=== Functional Polymer composites chemistry ===
It is a bundle of technologies grown at SAES to develop advanced polymeric materials mainly integrating getter properties but also rapidly expanding towards other functionalities. These materials can be in the form of dispensable polymer composites, functional compounds and functional coatings for a wide variety of applications, from [[consumer electronics]] to implantable [[medical device]]s to [[food packaging]] and special packaging in general.

=== Gas ultra purification ===
The SAES group manages the purification of gases, either under [[ultra-high vacuum]], either at [[atmospheric pressure]]. It deals with enabling the generation of ultra-high pure gases, characterized by impurity concentrations below 1 part-per-billion (ppb).

=== Vacuum science &amp; technology ===
This is the oldest and strongest technology owned by the SAES group, which deals with the design of both ultra-high vacuum pumps and pure metal sources, based on a variety of vacuum gas dynamics codes and on the building of proprietary high-vacuum manufacturing tools, ranging from thin film deposition tools to vacuum reactors.

=== Physical vapour deposition ===
The company developed a range of technologies enabling the deposition of pure metals and alloys on several kinds of substrates. Sputtering is normally used to deposit high surface area getter alloys onto [[silicon wafer]]s, used by the vacuum MEMS industry as cap wafers, to create and maintain a well-defined gas composition inside MEMS cavities.

== Products ==
The SAES group's organizational structure is composed of three units, each of them dedicated to different technologic solutions: Industrial Applications Business Unit, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) Business Unit, Business Development Unit.

=== Industrial Applications Business Unit ===

==== Electronic &amp; Photonic Devices ====
The SAES group provides advanced technological solutions to the electronic devices of a wide range of markets, including the aeronautical, medical, industrial, security, defence and basic research sectors. The products developed in this division include getters of different types and formats, alkaline metal dispensers, [[cathode]]s and materials for thermal management. The offered products are employed in various devices such as [[X-ray]] tubes, [[microwave]] tubes, solid state lasers, electron sources, photomultipliers and [[radiofrequency]] amplification systems.

==== Sensors &amp; Detectors ====
SAES Getters produces getters of different types and formats that are employed in various devices such as night vision devices based on infrared sensors, pressure sensors, gyroscopes for navigation systems and MEMS devices of various nature.

==== Light Sources ====
The company supplies getters and metal dispensers for [[Lamp (electrical component)|lamp]]s.

==== Vacuum Systems ====
The company produces pumps based on nonevaporable getter materials (NEG), which can be applied in both industrial and scientific fields (as an example, in analytical instrumentation, in vacuum systems for research activities and in particle accelerators).

==== Thermal Insulation ====
The solutions for vacuum thermal insulation include NEG products for cryogenic applications, for solar collectors both for home applications and operating at high temperatures and for [[thermos]]. Furthermore, SAES is particularly active in the development of innovative getter solutions for vacuum insulating panels for the [[white goods]] industry.

==== Pure Gas Handling ====
In the microelectronics market, SAES Getters develops and sells advanced gas purification systems for the semiconductors industry and for other industries which use pure gases in their processes. Through the subsidiary SAES Pure Gas, Inc., the group offers a full range of purifiers for bulk gases and special gases.

=== Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) Business Unit ===
The SAES group produces semi-finished products, components and devices in shape memory alloy, and a special alloy made of nickel-titanium (NiTinol), characterized by super-elasticity (a property that allows the material to withstand even large deformations, returning then to its original form) and by the property of assumine predefined forms when subjected to heat treatment.

==== SMA Medical Applications ====
NiTinol is used in a wide range of medical devices, in particular in the cardiovascular field. In fact, its superelastic properties are ideal for the manufacturing of the devices used in the field of non-invasive [[surgery]], such as catheters to navigate within the [[cardiovascular]] system and self-expanding devices (aortic and peripheral stents or heart valves).

==== SMA Industrial Applications ====
The shape memory alloy is used in the production of a variety of devices (valves, proportional valves, actuators, release systems, mini-actuators). The use of SMA devices in the industrial field goes across the board of many application areas such as [[domotics]], the white goods industry, the automotive business and [[consumer electronics]].

=== Business Development Unit ===
The SAES group has developed in the past few years the platform of Functional Polymer Composites, where getter functionalities as well as optical and mechanical features are incorporated into polymer matrices. Originally designed and used for the protection of [[OLED]] (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) displays and lamps, these new materials are now being tailored also for new areas such as [[food packaging]] and implantable medical devices among others.

Relying on the same FPC platform, the group is also active in the field of new generation electrochemical devices for energy storage, such as super-capacitors and [[lithium]] batteries, primarily intended for the market of hybrid and electric engines.

{{Water salinity}}

A '''salt lake''' or '''saline lake''' is a landlocked [[body of water]] that has a [[concentration]] of [[salt]]s (typically [[sodium chloride]]) and other dissolved minerals significantly higher than most [[lake]]s (often defined as at least three [[gram]]s of salt per litre). In some cases, salt lakes have a higher concentration of salt than sea water; such lakes can also be termed ''[[hypersaline lake]]s''. An [[alkalic]] salt lake that has a high content of [[carbonate]] is sometimes termed a ''[[soda lake]]''.

Saline lake classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammer |first=U. T. |title=Saline Lake Ecosystems of the World |location= |publisher=Springer |year=1986 |page=15 |isbn=90-6193-535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:subsaline 0.5–3 [[per mil|‰]]
:hyposaline 3–20 ‰
:mesosaline 20–50 ‰
:hypersaline greater than 50 ‰ 

== Properties ==
Salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake, containing salt or minerals, cannot leave because the lake is [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] (terminal). The water then evaporates, leaving behind any dissolved salts and thus increasing its [[salinity]], making a salt lake an excellent place for salt production. High salinity will also lead to a unique [[Halophile|halophilic]] flora and fauna in the lake in question; sometimes, in fact, the result may be an absence or near absence of life near the salt lake.

If the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated, the lake will eventually disappear and leave a [[dry lake]] (also called playa or salt flat).

Brine lakes consist of water that has reached salt saturation or near saturation ([[brine]]), and may also be heavily saturated with other materials.  

Most brine lakes develop as a result of high evaporation rates in an [[arid]] climate with a lack of an outlet to the ocean. The high salt content in these bodies of water may come from minerals deposited from the surrounding land. Another source for the salt may be that the body of water was formerly connected to the ocean. While the water evaporates from the lake, the salt remains.  Eventually, the body of water will become brine.

Because of the density of brine, swimmers are more [[buoyancy|buoyant]] in brine than in fresh or ordinary salt water.  Examples of such brine lakes are the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

Bodies of brine may also form on the ocean floor at [[cold seep]]s. These are sometimes called brine lakes, but are more frequently referred to as [[brine pool]]s. It is possible to observe waves on the surface of these bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/06mexico/logs/may31/may31.html|title=NOAA Ocean Explorer: Expedition to the Deep Slope: May 31 Log|author=|date=|website=www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man-made bodies of brine are created for edible salt production.  These can be referred to as brine ponds.

'''Wildpoldsried''' is a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]]  in the district of [[Oberallgäu]] in [[Bavaria]] in [[Germany]]. The village has been recognized for its exceptional achievements in renewable energy production and in reducing its carbon footprint.

==History==
The earliest known reference to Wildpoldsried dates to 1392, when it was mentioned in documents relating to the sale of the Cloud Mountain Castle.  Later, it was the seat of the Lower and Upper courts of the Abbey Kempten, a Benedictine Monastery. Secularization took place in 1803, and the municipality was formalized in 1818, in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Bavaria.

==Renewable Energy in Wildpoldsried==
In 1997, people of Wildpoldsried, in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. By 2011, Wildpoldsried produced 321 percent more energy than it needs and generated 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there was a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the village was producing five times the energy it consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, C. (September 17, 2014). [http://www.urbangateway.org/news/german-village-produces-five-times-more-renewable-energy-it-needs German village produces five times more energy than it needs].

A '''wind transducer''' is a device used by sailors to receive a real-time measurement of [[wind speed]] and direction.  A wind transducer is usually mounted on the masthead of a [[sailboat|sailing boat]] and is occasionally used by power boats too. The wind speed and direction measurements are more critical to sailing boats than to power boats. [[Sailors]] rely on the wind speed and direction to help with [[navigation]] and [[pilotage]]. These devices can be calibrated to measure the true wind speed and the apparent wind speed (speed that a sailor would 'feel'). Sailing boats can sail at a maximum of  45 degrees close to the wind and will [[sail]] faster on a reach than when at closest to the wind.

Wind transducers are usually wired to the cock or [[head]], although '[[wireless]]' versions are becoming steadily more popular due to the reduced installation time required.
