'''8974 / X-2159''' is a power [[tetrode]] designed for megawatt power levels in industrial and broadcast applications.

== Specifications ==

The 8974 is an external anode tube made of metal and ceramic. It has an overall height of 23.75 inches (603&amp;nbsp;mm), a diameter of 17.03 inches (433&amp;nbsp;mm), and weighs 175 pounds (80&amp;nbsp;kg). It contains a directly heated thoriated-tungsten filament rated at 16.3 volts at approx. 625 amperes. The anode is designed to dissipate 1.25 megawatts. The tube may be operated as a [[class C amplifier]], where a single tube with an anode voltage of 22.5 kV DC can provide up to 2,158 kilowatts of RF power.&lt;ref&gt;Data sheet for the Eimac 8974 / X-2159&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal construction ==

The thoriated-tungsten filament consists of two independent sections mounted on water-cooled supports. The two filaments may be excited in quadrature to reduce hum contributed by an ac power source. Each filament is rated at a nominal value of 16.3 Volts at approx. 625 Amperes for a total of over 20 kilowatts of filament power required when the tube is in operation.

== History ==
Experimental type X2159 was assigned to the development of a power tetrode by [[Eimac]] (then a division of Varian Associates) on May 28, 1970, and the design engineer was Sterling G. McNees. This electron tube was intended for use in very high power medium-frequency broadcast service and VLF communications equipment and as a pulse modulator (as a switch tube). The EIA ([[Electronic Industries Alliance]]) designation 8974 was assigned to this as it became a standard product. The initial technical data sheet was printed in July 1971.

[[Continental Electronics]] of Dallas, Texas, designed two 8974s (one as PA and the other as modulator) into their D323 series 1 megawatt AM transmitters which were sold primarily into the middle East, where stations were built to cover large geographical areas. The 8974 is still used in the same transmitters {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, over 30 years later.  The 8974 was also used as the basis for the development of several large tetrode switch tubes capable of operating at anode voltage up to 175 kilovolts dc.

== Cooling ==
The anode is cooled by circulated water via two [[flange]]s located at the top of the tube.  The heat is transferred to the outside environment using a [[radiator]], or to a secondary cooling system using a [[heat exchanger]].  Controlling the purity of the water is important to prevent the formation of copper oxide which would reduce the cooling efficiency.  Impurities could also cause [[electrolysis]] which could destroy the cooling passages.&lt;ref&gt;EIMAC Care and Feeding of Power Grid Tubes, 5th edition, 2003, p. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;  The plumbing connections for the water inlet and outlet are made at the anode, where a high DC voltage (up to 22 kV DC) is present.  Forced air is used to provide additional cooling to the filament and grid connections at the bottom of the tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1839">'''Active power filters''' (APF) are filters, which can perform the job of harmonic elimination. Active power filters can be used to filter out harmonics in the [[power system]] which are significantly below the switching frequency of the filter. The active power filters are used to filter out both higher and lower order harmonics in the [[power system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Jinwei, Beihua Liang, Yun Wei Li, and Chengshan Wang|title=Simultaneous Microgrid Voltage and Current Harmonics Compensation Using Coordinated Control of Dual-Interfacing Converters|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |date=7 June 2016|volume=32|issue=4|pages=2647–2660|doi=10.1109/TPEL.2016.2576684|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7484692/|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between active power filters and passive power filters is that APFs mitigate harmonics by injecting active power with the same frequency but with reverse phase to cancel that harmonic, where passive power filters use combinations of [[resistor]]s (R), [[inductor]]s (L) and [[capacitor]]s (C) and does not require an external power source or active components such as transistors. This difference, make it possible for APFs to mitigate a wide range of harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain, S. K., P. Agrawal, and H. O.

In 1959, by international agreement, the definitions of the pound and ounce became standardized in countries which use the pound as a  unit of mass.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt; The '''[[International yard and pound|International Avoirdupois Pound]]''' was then created. It is the everyday system of weights used in the United States. It is still used, in varying degrees, in everyday life in the United Kingdom, Canada, and some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|former British colonies]], despite their [[Metrication|official adoption]] of the [[metric system]].
  
The avoirdupois weight system's general attributes were originally developed for the international wool trade in the [[Late Middle Ages]], when trade was in recovery.{{clarifyme|date=December 2016}} It was historically based on a [[pound (mass)|physical standardized pound]] or "prototype weight" that could be divided into 16 [[ounce]]s.{{efn | School science curricula, especially empirical physical chemistry courses, often introduce students to careful measurements using a [[pan balance]] and standardized weights. These are essentially prototype weight clones.}} There were a number of competing measures of mass, and the fact that the avoirdupois pound had three even numbers as divisors (half and half and half again) may have been a cause of much of its popularity, so that the system won out over systems with 12 or 10 or 15 subdivisions.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt;  The use of this unofficial system gradually stabilized{{efn | Great trade fairs grew up in various sites in Europe, and their regulation and enforcement would act to define such measures.}} and evolved, with only slight changes in the reference standard or in the prototype's actual mass.
 
Over time, the desire not to use too many different systems of measurement allowed the establishment of "value relationships", with other commodities metered and sold by weight measurements such as bulk goods (grains, ores, flax) and smelted metals; so the avoirdupois system gradually became an accepted standard through much of Europe.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt;

In England, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] authorized its use as a standard, and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] acted three times to enforce a common standard, thus establishing what became the Imperial system of weights and measures.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt; Late in the 19th century various governments acted to redefine their base standards on a scientific basis and establish ratio-metric{{clarifyme|date=December 2016}} equations to [[SI]] [[metric system]] standards.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt; They did not always pick the same equivalencies,{{clarifyme|date=December 2016}} though the [[pound (mass) |pound]] remained very similar; these independent legal actions led to small differences in certain quantities, such as the American and Imperial pounds.&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt; 

An alternative system of mass, the [[Troy weight|troy system]], is generally used for precious materials. The modern definition of the avoirdupois pound (1 lb) is exactly {{val|0.45359237|u=}} [[kilogram]]s.&lt;ref name="Standards1959"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sizes/&gt;

Only later did the term become identified with a particular ''system of units'' used to weigh such merchandise. The warfare-impacted{{clarifyme|date=December 2016}} [[orthography]] of the day has left many variants of the term, such as {{lang|xno|haberty-poie}} and {{lang|xno|haber de peyse}}. (The [[Norman language|Norman]] {{lang|xno|peis}} became the [[Standard French|Parisian]] {{lang|frm|pois}}. In the 17th century ''de'' was replaced with ''du''.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/13805?rskey=lyB3yc&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false "avoirdupois, n.".

==History==
 
The rise in use of the measurement system corresponds to the regrowth of trade during the [[High Middle Ages]] after the early [[crusades]], when Europe experienced a growth in towns, turned from the chaos of warlordism to long distance trade, and began annual fairs, tournaments and commerce, by land and sea.  There are two major hypotheses regarding the origins of the avoirdupois system. The older hypothesis is that it originated in France.&lt;ref name="MarshMarsh1912"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Horace Wilmer Marsh|author2=Annie Griswold Fordyce Marsh|title=Constructive text-book of practical mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-AEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=1 January 2012|year=1912|publisher=J. Wiley &amp; sons, inc.|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newer hypothesis is that it is based on the weight system of Florence.&lt;ref name="Standards"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

The avoirdupois weight system is thought to have come into use in England circa 1300. It was originally used for weighing wool. In the early 14th century several other specialized weight systems were used, including the weight system of the [[Hanseatic League]] with a [[Pound (mass)#London pound|16-ounce pound of {{val|7200}} grains]] and an 8-ounce mark. However, the main weight system, used for coinage and for everyday use, was based on the 12-ounce [[Pound (mass)#Tower pound|tower pound]] of {{val|5400}} grains. From the 14th century until the late 16th century, the systems basis, the avoirdupois pound, the prototype for today's [[pound (mass) |international pound]] was also known as the '''wool pound''' or the '''avoirdupois wool pound'''. 
 
The earliest known version of the avoirdupois weight system had the following units: a pound of {{val|6992}} grains, a stone of 14 pounds, a woolsack of 26 stone, an ounce of {{frac|16}} pound, and finally, the ounce was divided into 16 "parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Skinner | first=F.G. | journal=Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science | title=The English Yard and Pound Weight | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/S0950563600000646 | volume=1 | pages=186| issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known occurrence of the word "avoirdupois" (or some variant thereof) in England is from a document entitled [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#Acts of Parliament|''Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris'']] ("Treatise on Weights and Measures"). This document is listed in early statute books under the heading ''31 Edward I'' dated 2 February 1303. More recent statute books list it among [[statutes of uncertain date]]. Scholars nowadays believe that it was probably written between 1266 and 1303.&lt;ref name="ErasmusDalzell2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Desiderius Erasmus|author2=Alexander Dalzell|author3=Charles Garfield Nauert|title=The Correspondence of Erasmus Letters 1658 to 1801: January 1526-March 1527|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXk4nHARNuEC&amp;pg=PA607|accessdate=2 January 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-4831-8|page=607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a royal memorandum, it eventually took on the force of law and was recognized as a statute by King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I.
 
It was repealed by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]]. In the ''Tractatus'', the word "avoirdupois" refers not to a weight system, but to a class of goods, specifically heavy goods sold by weight, as opposed to goods sold by volume, count, or some other method. Since it is written in Anglo-Norman French, this document is not the first occurrence of the word in the English language.&lt;ref name="statutes at large148"&gt;{{cite book|title=The statutes at large: from the ... year of the reign of ... to the ... year of the reign of ..|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=1763|pages=148–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/library/British_law/ponderibus.htm Tractatus de Penderibus et Mensuris]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towards a uniformity of measures===

Three major developments occurred during the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (r. 1327-77). First, a statute known as 14&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Edward III. st. 1. Cap. 12 (1340) "Bushels and Weights shall be made and sent into every County."&lt;ref name="statutes at large227"&gt;{{cite book|title=The statutes at large: from the ... year of the reign of ... to the ... year of the reign of ..|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=1763|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major development is the statute 25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Edward III. st. 5. Cap. 9. (1350) "The Auncel Weight shall be put out, and Weighing shall be by equal Balance."&lt;ref name="statutes at large264"&gt;{{cite book|title=The statutes at large: from the ... year of the reign of ... to the ... year of the reign of ..|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=1763|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[English translation:] so that the Sack of Wooll weigh no more but xxvi. Stones, and every Stone to weigh xiv. l.}}

The third development is a set of 14th-century bronze weights at the Westgate Museum in Winchester, England. The weights are in denominations of 7 pounds (corresponding to a unit known as the clip or wool-clip), 14 pounds (stone), 56 pounds (4 stone) and 91 pounds ({{frac|4}} sack or woolsack).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D=%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=200 A bronze Edward III standard weight of 14lb (1327-1377)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091329/http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D%3D%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=200 |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D=%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=197 A bronze Edward III standard weight of 91lb ({{frac|4}} sack) (1327-1377)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091437/http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D%3D%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=197 |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 91-pound weight is thought to have been commissioned by Edward III in conjunction with the statute of 1350, while the other weights are thought to have  been commissioned in conjunction with the statutes of 1340. The 56-pound weight was used as a reference standard as late as 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Skinner | first=F.G. | journal=Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science | title=The English Yard and Pound Weight | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/S0950563600000646 | volume=1 | pages=185| issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D=%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=198 A bronze Edward III standard weight of 56lb (1327-1377)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094202/http://www.winchestermuseumcollections.org.uk/index.asp?page=item&amp;mwsquery=%7Btotopic%7D%3D%7Bweights%20and%20measures%7D&amp;id=198 |date=May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statute of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (24&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Henry VIII. Cap. 3) made avoirdupois weights mandatory.

In 1588 [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] increased the weight of the avoirdupois pound to {{val|7000}} grains and added the troy grain to the avoirdupois weight system. Prior to 1588, the "part" ({{frac|16}}) was the smallest unit in the avoirdupois weight system. In the 18th century, the "part" was renamed "drachm".

====Post-Elizabethan units====
In the United Kingdom, 14 avoirdupois pounds equals one stone. The quarter, hundredweight, and ton equal respectively, 28&amp;nbsp;lb, 112&amp;nbsp;lb, and 2,240&amp;nbsp;lb in order for [[mass]]es to be easily converted between them and stones. The following are the units in the [[English unit|British]] or [[Imperial unit|imperial]] version of the avoirdupois system:

''Note:'' The plural form of the unit ''stone'' is either ''stone'' or ''stones'', but ''stone'' is most frequently used.

===American customary system===
{{Main article|United States customary units}}
The [[Thirteen colonies|13 British colonies]] in [[North America]] used the avoirdupois system, but continued to use the British system as it was, without the evolution that was occurring in Britain in the use of the [[Stone (Imperial mass)|stone]] unit. In 1824 there was landmark new weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom that the United States did not adopt.

In the United States, quarters, hundredweights, and tons remain defined as 25, 100, and {{val|2000|u=lb}} respectively. The quarter is now virtually unused, as is the hundredweight outside of agriculture and commodities. If disambiguation is required, then they are referred to as the smaller "short" units in the United States, as opposed to the larger British "long" units. Grains are used worldwide for measuring [[gunpowder]] and smokeless powder charges.  Historically, the dram has also been used worldwide for measuring gunpowder charges, particularly for shotguns and [[4 bore|large black-powder rifles]].

The '''brown note''' is a hypothetical [[Infrasound|infrasonic]] frequency that would cause [[human]]s to lose control of their [[bowel]]s due to [[resonance]].  Attempts to demonstrate the existence of a "brown note" using sound waves transmitted through air have failed.

The name is a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the common color of human [[feces]]. Frequencies supposedly involved are between 5 and 9 [[Hertz|Hz]], which is below the lower frequency limit of human hearing. High power sound waves below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz are felt in the body, not heard by the ear as sound.

==Physiological effects of low frequency vibration==
Jürgen Altmann of the [[Dortmund University of Technology]], an expert on [[Sonic weaponry|sonic weapons]], has said that there is no reliable evidence for nausea and vomiting caused by infrasound.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1564 ''The Pentagon considers ear-blasting anti-hijack gun''] — [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

High volume levels at concerts from subwoofer arrays have been cited as causing [[lung collapse]] in individuals who are very close to the subwoofers, especially for smokers who are particularly tall and thin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2004/09/64829 ''Wired. Music Fans, Beware the Big Bass'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, London student Tom Reid died of [[Cardiac dysrhythmia#Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome|sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS)]] after complaining that "loud bass notes" were "getting to his heart". The inquest recorded a verdict of natural causes, although some experts commented that the bass could have acted as a trigger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/805430-loud-bass-music-killed-student-tom-reid ''Loud bass music ‘killed student’ Tom Reid'', Metro, retrieved 18 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Air is a very inefficient medium for transferring low frequency vibration from a transducer to the human body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977JSV....53..605R Tempest, W. ''Infrasound and low frequency vibration'' (1977). Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical connection of the vibration source to the human body, however, provides a potentially dangerous combination. The U.S. space program, worried about the harmful effects of rocket flight on astronauts, ordered vibration tests that used cockpit seats mounted on vibration tables to transfer "brown note" and other frequencies directly to the human subjects. Very high power levels of 160&amp;nbsp;dB were achieved at frequencies of 2–3&amp;nbsp;Hz. Test frequencies ranged from 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz. Test subjects suffered motor ataxia, nausea, visual disturbance, degraded task performance and difficulties in communication. These tests are assumed by researchers to be the nucleus of the current [[urban legend|urban myth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071231012618/http://srforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/mv/tree/27986/261708/72/ ProSoundWeb: ''some effects of low end'' (bulletin board entry by Tom Danley)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080113051923/http://www.danleysoundlabs.com/matterhorn.htm ''The Matterhorn'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The report "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080920193328/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/noise/research/lowfrequency/pdf/lowfreqnoise.pdf A Review of Published Research on Low Frequency Noise and its Effects]" contains a long list of research about exposure to high-level infrasound among humans and animals.  For instance, in 1972, Borredon exposed 42 young men to tones at 7.5&amp;nbsp;Hz at 130&amp;nbsp;dB for 50 minutes. This exposure caused no adverse effects other than reported drowsiness and a slight blood pressure increase.  In 1975, Slarve and Johnson exposed four male subjects to infrasound at frequencies from 1 to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz, for eight minutes at a time, at levels up to 144&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.  There was no evidence of any detrimental effect other than middle ear discomfort. Tests of high-intensity infrasound on animals resulted in measurable changes, such as cell changes and ruptured blood vessel walls.

In February 2005 the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' used twelve [[Meyer Sound]] 700-HP [[subwoofer]]s—a model and quantity that has been employed for major [[Rock music|rock]] concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/brown-note/ |title=Brown Note &amp;#124; MythBusters |publisher=Discovery |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.meyersound.com.au/brownnote.shtm| title=Brown Note| publisher=Meyer Sound| year=2000| accessdate=2006-08-30| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906094120/http://www.meyersound.com.au/brownnote.shtm| archivedate=2006-09-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal operating frequency range of the selected subwoofer model was 28&amp;nbsp;Hz to 150&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.meyersound.com/pdf/products/concert_series/700-hp_ds.pdf# |title=Meyer Sound 700-HP UltraHigh-Power Subwoofer datasheet |access-date=2007-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021075207/http://www.meyersound.com/pdf/products/concert_series/700-hp_ds.pdf# |archive-date=2007-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 12 enclosures at ''MythBusters'' had been specially modified for deeper bass extension.&lt;ref name=Meyer2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meyersound.com/news/2004/brown_note/index.php|title=Meyer Sound Gets Down to Basics in MythBusters Episode|date=September 2004|publisher=Meyer Sound Laboratories|accessdate=September 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081338/http://meyersound.com/news/2004/brown_note/index.php#|archive-date=2011-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Schwenke and John Meyer directed the Meyer Sound team in devising a special test rig that would produce very high sound levels at infrasonic frequencies. The subwoofers' [[Bass reflex|tuning ports]] were blocked and their input cards were altered. The modified cabinets were positioned in an open ring configuration: four stacks of three subwoofers each. Test signals were generated by a SIM 3 audio analyzer, with its software modified to produce infrasonic tones. A [[Brüel &amp; Kjær]] sound level analyzer, fed with an attenuated signal from a model 4189 [[Microphone#Measurement microphones|measurement microphone]], displayed and recorded sound pressure levels.&lt;ref name=Meyer2004/&gt; The hosts on the show tried a series of frequencies as low as 5&amp;nbsp;Hz, attaining a level of 120&amp;nbsp;[[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] at 9&amp;nbsp;Hz and up to 153&amp;nbsp;dB at frequencies above 20&amp;nbsp;Hz, but the rumored physiological effects did not materialize.&lt;ref name=Meyer2004/&gt; The test subjects all reported some physical anxiety and shortness of breath, even a small amount of nausea, but this was dismissed by the hosts, noting that sound at that frequency and intensity moves air rapidly in and out of one's [[lung]]s.  The show declared the brown note myth "busted."

==In fiction==
In the [[comic book]] series ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', the main character, [[Spider Jerusalem]], wields a "Bowel Disruptor" that operates using ultrasonic waves, with varying settings of intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/358446/set-your-bowel-disruptor-to-explosive-diarrhea|title=Set Your Bowel Disruptor To Explosive Diarrhea|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|work=io9|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season 3 episode "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]" (episode 17) of the animated show ''[[South Park]]'' in 2000, the brown note myth is featured prominently; the boys rewrite the music for a worldwide recorder concert to include the brown note (for kids from New York who kept insulting them), with the unintended result that everyone in the world defecates almost simultaneously.

In the season 4 episode "The Curse of Shiva" (episode 13) of ''[[The League]]'', Taco ([[Jon Lajoie]]) has found a use for the thousands of discarded [[vuvuzela]] instruments left over from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by [[South Africa]]. The instruments were tinkered with to produce the brown note with hopes that it could then be sold to the military as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-league-a-krampus-carol-the-curse-of-shiva-89772 AVClub: ''The League: A Krampus Carol / The Curse of Shiva'' (by Margaret Eby)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season 1 episode "Angel Boy" (episode 4) of the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Tim and Eric's Bedtime Stories]]'', the character Scotty sings a note that causes attendees at a birthday party to have intense gastrointestinal distress and defecate uncontrollably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/videos/tim-erics-bedtime-stories/angel-boy/ |title=Angel Boy - Tim &amp; Eric's Bedtime Stories on Adult Swim Video |publisher=Adultswim.com |date=2014-08-26 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season 6 episode "Edie's Wedding" (episode 4) of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', "Doctor" Algernop Krieger builds an ultrasonic weapon which hypothetically produces the brown note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Framke |first=Caroline |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/archer-edies-wedding-214547 |title="Edie's Wedding" · Archer · TV Review Archer: "Edie’s Wedding" · TV Club · The A.V.

'''C.D.V. agar''' is a [[nutrient medium]] prepared using [[Cicer arietinum]] (Bengal gram), [[Daucus carota]] ([[carrot]]) and [[Vigna radiata]] (green gram) by Mr. Vinay J. Rao and Mr. Keshava Murthy P. at [[Surana College]], [[Bangalore]], [[India]] under the guidance of their [[botany]] [[lecturer]]s, Prof. B.R Chandrashekarappa (H.O.D.- Dept. Of Botany), Mrs. Sharada H.C., and with the aid of their classmates from [[Vijaya College, Bangalore]].

So far, CDV agar has been tried only on [[E. coli]]. Attempts will be made to try the medium on other [[organism]]s as well. The [[nutrient]] has been prepared in order to counter the discomfort of using materials such as [[peptone]], [[beef extract]], and [[yeast extract]].

== Abstract ==
As with [[higher organism]]s, [[lower organism]]s also depend on [[nutrition]] for their survival. As a result, many [[microbiologist]]s have proposed various sources of nutrition for proper [[microbe|microbial]] growth. Most nutrient media consist of [[animal product]]s, the use of which is considered [[ethics|unethical]] by some. Here, an attempt has been made to substitute for animal products with some plant products.

The medium was prepared in two sets; one was [[autoclave]]d before pouring, while the other was heated to around 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C to conserve the [[protein]]s, which might have denatured at a higher temperature. The results obtained were very satisfactory; solitary colonies were observed in the [[petri dish|plates]] with the autoclaved [[agar]], while the heated agar gave a larger surface area of E. coli.

The above-mentioned [[plant]]s were taken for this experiment due to their biochemical contents and the contents of ordinary agar. In this recipe, the [[chick pea]] replaces peptone; for a protein source, green gram replaces beef extract; for another protein source, carrot replaces yeast extract. All these plants contain proteins and [[carbohydrate]]s, along with other essential [[biochemical]]s in sufficient amounts.

TEQIP II Sponsored National Conference, organized by Dept. Of [[Biotechnology]], PES Institute Of Technology, Bangalore on 12th-13th Sept 2013.

[[File:Verschiedene Kondensatoren 2.JPG|thumb|right|Some different capacitors for electronic equipment]]
[[Capacitor]]s are manufactured in many forms, styles, lengths, girths, and from many materials. They all contain at least two [[electrical conductor]]s (called "plates") separated by an [[insulator (electricity)|insulating]] layer (called the [[dielectric]]). Capacitors are widely used as parts of [[electrical circuit]]s in many common electrical devices.

Capacitors, together with [[resistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s, belong to the group of "[[passive component]]s" used in [[electronic equipment]]. Although, in absolute figures, the most common capacitors are integrated capacitors (e.g. in [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]]s or [[flash memory]] structures), this article is concentrated on the various styles of capacitors as discrete components.

Small capacitors are used in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers, as components of electric filters and tuned circuits, or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current. Larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights, as parts of some types of electric motors, or for [[power factor]] correction in AC power distribution systems. Standard capacitors have a fixed value of [[capacitance]], but adjustable capacitors are frequently used in tuned circuits. Different types are used depending on required capacitance, working voltage, current handling capacity, and other properties.

== General remarks ==

=== Theory of conventional construction ===

[[Image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|right|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''' and with a separation of '''''d'''''.]]

In a conventional capacitor, the [[electric energy]] is stored [[Static electricity|statically]] by [[Electric charge|charge]] separation, typically [[electrons]], in an [[electric field]] between two [[electrode]] plates. The amount of charge stored per unit voltage is essentially a function of the size of the plates, the plate material's properties, the properties of the [[dielectric]] material placed between the plates, and the separation distance (i.e. dielectric thickness). The potential between the plates is [[Dielectric breakdown|limited by]] the properties of the dielectric material and the separation distance.

Nearly all conventional industrial capacitors except some special styles such as "feed-through capacitors", are constructed as "plate capacitors" even if their electrodes and the dielectric between are wound or rolled. The capacitance formula for plate capacitors is:

: &lt;math&gt;C= \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;.

The capacitance '''''C''''' increases with the area '''''A''''' of the plates and with the [[permittivity]] '''''ε''''' of the dielectric material and decreases with the plate separation distance '''''d'''''. The capacitance is therefore greatest in devices made from materials with a high permittivity, large plate area, and small distance between plates.

=== Theory of electrochemical construction ===

[[File:Electric double-layer (BMD model) NT.PNG|thumb|Schematic of double layer capacitor.&lt;br/&gt; 1. IHP Inner Helmholtz Layer&lt;br/&gt; 2. OHP Outer Helmholtz Layer&lt;br/&gt; 3. Diffuse layer&lt;br/&gt; 4. Solvated ions&lt;br/&gt; '''5. Specifically adsorptive ions (Pseudocapacitance)'''&lt;br/&gt; 6. Solvent molecule.]]

Another type&amp;nbsp;– the [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] capacitor&amp;nbsp;– makes use of two other storage principles to store electric energy. In contrast to ceramic, film, and [[electrolytic capacitors]], [[supercapacitor]]s (also known as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors) do not have a conventional dielectric. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two high-capacity storage principles. These principles are:

* [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] storage within [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layers]] achieved on the [[Phase (matter)|phase]] [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the surface of the [[electrode]]s and the [[electrolyte]] '''(double-layer capacitance)'''; and
* [[electrochemical]] storage achieved by a [[Faradaic current|faradaic]] [[electron]] [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]] by specifically adsorpted [[ion]]s with [[Redox|redox reactions]] '''(pseudocapacitance)'''. Unlike batteries, in these reactions, the ions simply cling to the atomic structure of an electrode without making or breaking chemical bonds, and no or negligibly small chemical modifications are involved in charge/discharge.

The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on electrode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite web |author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A Survey of Electrochemical Supercapacitor Technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |date= 23 June 2003 |accessdate= 2011-06-24 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |archivedate= 22 December 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common capacitors and their names ===

Capacitors are divided into two mechanical groups: Fixed capacitors with fixed capacitance values and variable capacitors with variable (trimmer) or adjustable (tunable) capacitance values.

The most important group is the fixed capacitors. Many got their names from the dielectric. For a systematic classification these characteristics can't be used, because one of the oldest, the electrolytic capacitor, is named instead by its cathode construction. So the most-used names are simply historical.

The most common kinds of capacitors are:

* '''Ceramic capacitors''' have a [[ceramic]] dielectric.
* '''Film''' and '''paper capacitors''' are named for their dielectrics.
* '''Aluminum, tantalum''' and '''niobium electrolytic capacitors''' are named after the material used as the [[anode]] and the construction of the [[cathode]] ([[electrolyte]])
* '''Polymer capacitors''' are aluminum, tantalum or niobium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer as electrolyte
* '''Supercapacitor''' is the family name for:
** '''Double-layer capacitors''' were named for the physical phenomenon of the [[Helmholtz]] double-layer
** '''[[Pseudocapacitor]]s''' were named for their ability to store electric energy electro-chemically with reversible [[Faradaic current|faradaic]] [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]]
** '''Hybrid capacitors''' combine double-layer and pseudocapacitors to increase power density
* '''Silver mica, glass, silicon, air-gap and vacuum capacitors''' are named for their dielectric.

[[Image:Fixed capacitors overview.svg|center|Overview over the most commonly used fixed capacitors in electronic equipment]]

In addition to the above shown capacitor types, which derived their name from historical development, there are many individual capacitors that have been named based on their application. They include:

* [[Film capacitor#Power film capacitors|Power capacitors]], [[motor capacitor]]s, [[AC/AC converter|DC-link capacitors]], [[Film capacitor#Safety and EMI/RFI suppression film capacitors|suppression capacitors]], [[Audio crossover|audio crossover capacitors]], [[Film capacitor#Lighting ballasts|lighting ballast capacitors]], [[snubber capacitor]]s, [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]], [[Decoupling capacitor|decoupling]] or bypassing capacitors.

Often, more than one capacitor family is employed for these applications, e.g. [[Electromagnetic interference|interference suppression]] can use [[Ceramic capacitor#RFI/EMI suppression ceramic capacitor|ceramic capacitors]] or [[Film capacitor#Safety and EMI/RFI suppression film capacitors|film capacitors]].

Other kinds of capacitors are discussed in the [[#Special capacitors]] section.

=== Dielectrics ===

[[File:Fixed capacitors-charge storage principles-2.png|thumb|center|350px|Charge storage principles of different capacitor types and their inherent voltage progression]]

The most common dielectrics are:

* Ceramics
* Plastic films
* [[Oxide]] layer on metal ([[Aluminum]], [[Tantalum]], [[Niobium]])
* Natural materials like [[mica]], [[glass]], [[paper]], [[air]], [[Dielectric gas|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vacuum]]

All of them store their electrical charge statically within an [[electric field]] between two (parallel) electrodes.

Beneath this conventional capacitors a family of electrochemical capacitors called [[Supercapacitor]]s was developed. Supercapacitors don't have a conventional dielectric. They store their electrical charge statically in [[Double layer (interfacial)|Helmholtz double-layers]] and faradaically at the surface of electrodes

* with static [[Double-layer capacitance]] in a [[double-layer capacitor]] and
* with [[pseudocapacitance]] (faradaic charge transfer) in a [[Pseudocapacitor]]
* or with both storage principles together in [[Supercapacitor|hybrid capacitors]].

The most important material parameters of the different dielectrics used and the appr. Helmholtz-layer thickness are given in the table below.

&lt;/center&gt;

The capacitor's plate area can be adapted to the wanted capacitance value. The permittivity and the dielectric thickness are the determining parameter for capacitors. Ease of processing is also crucial. Thin, mechanically flexible sheets can be wrapped or stacked easily, yielding large designs with high capacitance values. Razor-thin metallized sintered ceramic layers covered with metallized electrodes however, offer the best conditions for the miniaturization of circuits with SMD styles.

A short view to the figures in the table above gives the explanation for some simple facts:

* '''[[Supercapacitor]]s''' have the highest capacitance density because of its special charge storage principles
* '''[[Electrolytic capacitor]]s''' have lesser capacitance density than supercapacitors but the highest capacitance density of conventional capacitors because its thin dielectric.
* '''[[Ceramic capacitor]]s''' class 2 have much higher capacitance values in a given case than class 1 capacitors because of their much higher permittivity.
* '''[[Film capacitor]]s''' with their different plastic film material do have a small spread in the dimensions for a given capacitance/voltage value of a film capacitor because the minimum dielectric film thickness differs between the different film materials.

=== Capacitance and voltage range ===

[[File:Kondensatoren-Kap-Versus-Spg-English.svg|center|400px|Capacitance ranges vs. voltage ranges of different capacitor types]]

Capacitance ranges from picofarad to more than hundreds of farad. Voltage ratings can reach 100 kilovolts. In general, capacitance and voltage correlates with physical size and cost.

=== Miniaturization ===

[[File:Capacitor Miniaturizing 1970-2005.png|thumb|Capacitor volumetric efficiency increased from 1970 to 2005 (click image to enlarge)]]

As in other areas of electronics, [[volumetric efficiency]] measures the performance of electronic function per unit volume. For capacitors, the volumetric efficiency is measured with the "CV product", calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage rating (V), divided by the volume. From 1970 to 2005, volumetric efficiencies have improved dramatically.

=== Overlapping range of the applications ===

These individual capacitors can perform their application independent of their affiliation to an above shown capacitor type, so that an overlapping range of applications between the different capacitor types exists.

[[File:Capacitors-Overlapping-Applications.png|center|400px|Comparing the three main capacitor types it shows, that a broad range of overlapping functions for many general-purpose and industrial applications exists in electronic equipment.]]

== Types and styles ==

=== Ceramic capacitors ===
[[File:MLCC-Construction.png|thumb|right|Construction of a '''M'''ulti-'''L'''ayer '''C'''eramic '''C'''apacitor (MLCC)]]
{{Main article|Ceramic capacitor}}

A '''[[ceramic capacitor]]''' is a non-polarized fixed capacitor made out of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and metal in which the ceramic material acts as the dielectric and the metal acts as the electrodes. The ceramic material is a mixture of finely ground granules of [[paraelectric]] or [[ferroelectric]] materials, modified by mixed [[oxides]] that are necessary to achieve the capacitor's desired characteristics. The electrical behavior of the ceramic material is divided into two stability classes:

* [[Ceramic capacitor#Class 1|Class 1]] ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses compensating the influence of temperature in resonant circuit application. Common [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] code abbreviations are [[C0G]]/NP0, P2G/N150, R2G/N220, U2J/N750 etc.
* [[Ceramic capacitor#Class 2|Class 2]] ceramic capacitors with high [[volumetric efficiency]] for buffer, by-pass and coupling applications Common EIA/IEC code abbreviations are: X7R/2XI, Z5U/E26, Y5V/2F4, X7S/2C1, etc.

The great plasticity of ceramic raw material works well for many special applications and enables an enormous diversity of styles, shapes and great dimensional spread of ceramic capacitors. The smallest discrete capacitor, for instance, is a "01005" chip capacitor with the dimension of only 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm × 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm.

The construction of ceramic multilayer capacitors with mostly alternating layers results in single capacitors connected in parallel. This configuration increases capacitance and decreases all losses and parasitic [[inductance]]s. Ceramic capacitors are well-suited for high frequencies and high current pulse loads.

Because the thickness of the ceramic dielectric layer can be easily controlled and produced by the desired application voltage, ceramic capacitors are available with rated voltages up to the 30&amp;nbsp;kV range.

Some ceramic capacitors of special shapes and styles are used as capacitors for special applications, including [[Ceramic capacitor#RFI/EMI suppression ceramic capacitor|RFI/EMI suppression capacitors]] for connection to supply mains, also known as safety capacitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/rfi-safety-rated-xy/|title=Vishay - Capacitors - RFI Safety Rated X/Y|first=|last=Vishay|website=www.vishay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; X2Y® and three-terminal capacitors for bypassing and decoupling applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x2y.com/|title=X2Y Attenuators - Home|website=www.x2y.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murata.com/~/media/webrenewal/products/emc/emifil/knowhow/20to22.ashx|title=Three-terminal Capacitor Structure, Murata|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; feed-through capacitors for noise suppression by low-pass filters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murata.com/products/emc/knowhow/pdf/20to22.pdf|title=Murata, Three-terminal Capacitor Structure, No.TE04EA-1.pdf 98.3.20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ceramic capacitor#Ceramic power capacitors|ceramic power capacitors]] for transmitters and HF applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/22071/geninfo.pdf|title=Vishay, Ceramic RF-Power Capacitors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vishay |url=http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/ceramic-rf-power/ |title=Capacitors - RF Power |publisher=Vishay |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film capacitors ===
{{Main article|Film capacitor}}
[[File:Film-Cap-Pulse-Strength-Versions.svg|thumb|right|Three examples of different film capacitor configurations for increasing surge current ratings]]

[[Film capacitor]]s or plastic film capacitors are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric. The dielectric films are drawn to a thin layer, provided with metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or both sides of the plastic film, resulting in metallized film capacitors or a separate metallic foil overlying the film, called film/foil capacitors.

Metallized film capacitors offer self-healing properties. Dielectric breakdowns or shorts between the electrodes do not destroy the component. The metallized construction makes it possible to produce wound capacitors with larger capacitance values (up to 100&amp;nbsp;µF and larger) in smaller cases than within film/foil construction.

Film/foil capacitors or metal foil capacitors use two plastic films as the dielectric. Each film is covered with a thin metal foil, mostly aluminium, to form the electrodes. The advantage of this construction is the ease of connecting the metal foil electrodes, along with an excellent current pulse strength.

A key advantage of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes on both ends of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal [[ohm]]ic losses ([[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]]) and [[Equivalent series inductance|ESL]]. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents ([[snubber]]s) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.

The plastic films used as the dielectric for film capacitors are [[Polypropylene]] (PP), [[Polyester]] (PET), [[Polyphenylene sulfide]] (PPS), [[Polyethylene naphthalate]] (PEN), and [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] or [[Teflon]] (PTFE). Polypropylene film material with a market share of something about 50% and Polyester film with something about 40% are the most used film materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.&lt;ref&gt;Passive component magazine, Nov./Dec. 2005, F.

Some film capacitors of special shapes and styles are used as capacitors for special applications, including [[Film capacitor#Safety and EMI/RFI suppression film capacitors|RFI/EMI suppression capacitors]] for connection to the supply mains, also known as safety capacitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.com/EN/products_rfi.htm|title=WIMA Radio Interference Suppression (RFI) Capacitors|website=www.wima.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snubber capacitors for very high surge currents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.com/EN/products_snubber.htm|title=WIMA Snubber Capacitors|website=www.wima.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor run capacitors, AC capacitors for motor-run applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motor-runcapacitorsonline.com/|title=Motor-Run Capacitors online|website=www.motor-runcapacitorsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power film capacitors ===
[[File:MKV-Power-Capacitor-Construction.svg|thumb|right| MKV power capacitor, double-sided metallized paper (field-free mechanical carrier of the electrodes), polypropylene film (dielectric), windings impregnated with insulating oil]]

A related type is the [[Film capacitor#Power film capacitors|power film capacitor]]. The materials and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors mostly are similar to those of ordinary film capacitors. However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary film capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.

As modern electronic equipment gained the capacity to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of "electrical power" components, the distinction between the "electronic" and "electrical" power ratings blurred. Historically, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200 volt-amperes.

Film power capacitors mostly use polypropylene film as the dielectric. Other types include metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can be filled with an insulating oil or with [[epoxy resin]] to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.

They find use as converters to change voltage, current or frequency, to store or deliver abruptly electric energy or to improve the power factor. The rated voltage range of these capacitors is from approximately 120&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;AC (capacitive lighting ballasts) to 100&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/PDF/PDF__GeneralTechnicalInformation,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_GeneralTechnicalInformation.pdf|title=Sorry, the requested page could not be found. - TDK Europe - EPCOS|website=www.epcos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrolytic capacitors ===
{{main article|Electrolytic capacitor}}
[[File:E-cap-family-14-02-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Electrolytic capacitors diversification]]
[[Electrolytic capacitor]]s have a metallic anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielectric. The second electrode is a non-solid (wet) or solid electrolyte. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized. Three families are available, categorized according to their dielectric.

* [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s with [[aluminum oxide]] as dielectric
* [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] with [[tantalum pentoxide]] as dielectric
* [[Niobium capacitor|Niobium electrolytic capacitors]] with [[niobium pentoxide]] as dielectric.

The anode is highly roughened to increase the surface area. This and the relatively high permittivity of the oxide layer gives these capacitors very high capacitance per unit volume compared with film- or ceramic capacitors.

The permittivity of tantalum pentoxide is approximately three times higher than aluminium oxide, producing significantly smaller components. However, permittivity determines only the dimensions. Electrical parameters, especially [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], are established by the electrolyte's material and composition. Three general types of electrolytes are used:

* non solid (wet, liquid)—conductivity approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mS/cm and are the lowest cost
* solid manganese oxide—conductivity approximately 100&amp;nbsp;mS/cm offer high quality and stability
* solid conductive polymer ([[Polypyrrole]] or [[PEDOT:PSS]])—conductivity approximately 100...500&amp;nbsp;S/cm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chenxi|first1=Rizee|title=2017 Tendency For Electronic Components Market|url=http://www.wellpcb.com/news/2017-tendency-electronic-components-market.html|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=www.wellpcb.com|publisher=WellPCB|date=15 May 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.

Internal losses of electrolytic capacitors, prevailing used for decoupling and buffering applications, are determined by the kind of electrolyte.

&lt;/center&gt;

The large capacitance per unit volume of electrolytic capacitors make them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical [[electrical network|circuits]], e.g. in [[power supply]] filters for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC power connections or as coupling capacitors in audio amplifiers, for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing large amounts of energy. The relatively high capacitance value of an electrolytic capacitor combined with the very low ESR of the polymer electrolyte of [[polymer capacitor]]s, especially in SMD styles, makes them a competitor to MLC chip capacitors in personal computer power supplies.

Bipolar aluminum electrolytic capacitors (also called Non-Polarized capacitors) contain two anodized aluminium foils, behaving like two capacitors connected in series opposition.

Electrolytic capacitors for special applications include motor start capacitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cde.com/catalogs/PSU.pdf|title=CDE, Motor Start Capacitors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; flashlight capacitors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/catalog/e_pdfs/aluminum/e_CDF.pdf|title=Rubycon, Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors for Strobe Flash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and audio frequency capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftcap.de/index.php/audio-frequency-archiv.html|title=Electrolytic Capacitors - FTCAP GmbH|website=www.ftcap.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercapacitor, sometimes called '''ultracapacitor''' is a generic term for [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s (EDLC), [[pseudocapacitor]]s and hybrid capacitors. They don't have a conventional solid [[dielectric]]. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage principles, both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor:&lt;ref name="Halper"&gt;{{cite techreport|author= Marin S.

* [[Double layer (interfacial)|Double-layer capacitance]] – Storage is achieved by separation of charge in a [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] at the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the surface of a conductor and an electrolytic solution. The distance of separation of charge in a double-layer is on the order of a few [[Angstrom]]s (0.3–0.8&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]). This storage is [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"/&gt;
* [[Pseudocapacitor|Pseudocapacitance]] – Storage is achieved by [[Redox|redox reactions]], electrosorbtion or [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] on the surface of the electrode or by specifically adsorpted [[ion]]s that results in a reversible [[Faradaic current|faradaic]] [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]]. The pseudocapacitance is faradaic in origin.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;

The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on electrode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.&lt;ref name="conway1" /&gt;

Supercapacitors are divided into three families, based on the design of the electrodes:

* '''Double-layer capacitors''' – with [[carbon]] electrodes or derivates with much higher static double-layer capacitance than the faradaic pseudocapacitance
* '''Pseudocapacitors''' – with electrodes out of metal oxides or conducting polymers with a high amount of faradaic pseudocapacitance
* '''Hybrid capacitors''' – capacitors with special and asymmetric electrodes that exhibit both significant double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, such as [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s

Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest [[energy density]] of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 [[farad]]s/1.2 volt,&lt;ref name=Elton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elton-cap.com/products/capacitor-cells/|title=Elton|publisher=|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623101014/http://www.elton-cap.com/products/capacitor-cells/#|archive-date=2013-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with capacitance values up to 10,000 times that of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name="conway1" /&gt; While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their [[power density]] is generally 10 to 100 times greater. Power density is defined as the product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the [[Electric load|load]]. The greater power density results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This makes them well-suited for parallel connection with batteries, and may improve battery performance in terms of power density.

Within electrochemical capacitors, the electrolyte is the conductive connection between the two electrodes, distinguishing them from electrolytic capacitors, in which the electrolyte only forms the cathode, the second electrode.

Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with correct polarity. Polarity is controlled by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied during the manufacturing process.

Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications for power and energy requirements, including:
* Low supply current during longer times for memory backup in ([[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]s) in electronic equipment
* Power electronics that require very short, high current, as in the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]]system in [[Formula 1]] cars
* Recovery of braking energy for vehicles such as buses and trains

Supercapacitors are rarely interchangeable, especially those with higher energy densities. IEC standard 62391-1 ''Fixed electric double layer capacitors for use in electronic equipment'' identifies four application classes:

* Class 1, Memory backup, discharge current in mA = 1 • C (F)
* Class 2, Energy storage, discharge current in mA = 0.4 • C (F) • V (V)
* Class 3, Power, discharge current in mA = 4 • C (F) • V (V)
* Class 4, Instantaneous power, discharge current in mA = 40 • C (F) • V (V)
Exceptional for electronic components like capacitors are the manifold different trade or series names used for supercapacitors like: ''APowerCap, BestCap, BoostCap, CAP-XX, DLCAP, EneCapTen, EVerCAP, DynaCap, Faradcap, GreenCap, Goldcap, HY-CAP, Kapton capacitor, Super capacitor, SuperCap, PAS Capacitor, PowerStor, PseudoCap, Ultracapacitor'' making it difficult for users to classify these capacitors.

=== Class X and Class Y capacitors ===

Many safety regulations mandate that Class X or Class Y capacitors must be used whenever a "fail-to-short-circuit" could put humans in danger,
to guarantee [[galvanic isolation#Capacitor|galvanic isolation]] even when the capacitor fails.

[[Lightning strike]]s and other sources cause high voltage surges in mains power.
Safety capacitors protect humans and devices from high voltage surges by shunting the surge energy to ground.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.tecategroup.com/capacitors/applications/ac-safety-capacitors.php "AC Safety Capacitors"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, safety regulations mandate a particular arrangement of Class X and Class Y [[filter capacitor#Mains filtering|mains filtering capacitors]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, any dielectric could be used to build Class X and Class Y capacitors;
perhaps by including an internal fuse to improve safety.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous capacitors ===
Beneath the above described capacitors covering more or less nearly the total market of discrete capacitors some new developments or very special capacitor types as well as older types can be found in electronics.

==== Integrated capacitors ====
* Integrated capacitors—in [[integrated circuits]], nano-scale capacitors can be formed by appropriate patterns of metallization on an isolating substrate. They may be packaged in multiple capacitor arrays with no other semiconductive parts as discrete components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdia.com/index.php?page=our_products&amp;cat_id=2|title=3D Silicon Capacitors|website=www.ipdia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass capacitors—First [[Leyden jar]] capacitor was made of glass, {{as of|2012}} glass capacitors were in use as SMD version for applications requiring ultra-reliable and ultra-stable service.

==== Power capacitors ====
* [[Vacuum capacitor]]s—used in high power [[radio frequency|RF]] transmitters
* [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas filled capacitors—used as capacitance standard in measuring bridge circuits

==== Special capacitors ====
* [[Printed circuit board]]s—metal conductive areas in different layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board can act as a highly stable capacitor in [[Distributed element filter]]s. It is common industry practice to fill unused areas of one PCB layer with the ground conductor and another layer with the power conductor, forming a large distributed capacitor between the layers.
* Wire—2 pieces of insulated wire twisted together. Capacitance values usually range from 3 pF to 15 pF. Used in homemade [[VHF]] circuits for oscillation feedback.

Specialized devices such as built-in capacitors with metal conductive areas in different layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board and kludges such as twisting together two pieces of insulated wire also exist.

Capacitors made by twisting 2 pieces of insulated wire together are called gimmick capacitors.
Gimmick capacitors were used in commercial and amateur radio receivers.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Variable capacitors ===
[[Variable capacitor]]s may have their capacitance changed by mechanical motion. Generally two versions of variable capacitors has to be to distinguished

* Tuning capacitor – variable capacitor for intentionally and repeatedly tuning an oscillator circuit in a radio or another tuned circuit
* Trimmer capacitor – small variable capacitor usually for one-time oscillator circuit internal adjustment

Variable capacitors include capacitors that use a mechanical construction to change the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps. They mostly use air as dielectric medium.

Semiconductive [[Varicap|variable capacitance diodes]] are not capacitors in the sense of passive components but can change their capacitance as a function of the applied reverse bias voltage and are used like a variable capacitor. They have replaced much of the tuning and trimmer capacitors.

== Electrical characteristics ==

=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Capacitor-Series-Equivalent-Circuit-.png|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of a capacitor]]

Discrete capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor. An ideal capacitor only stores and releases electrical energy, with no dissipation. Capacitor components have losses and parasitic inductive parts. These imperfections in material and construction can have positive implications such as linear frequency and temperature behavior in class 1 ceramic capacitors. Conversely, negative implications include the non-linear, voltage-dependent capacitance in class 2 ceramic capacitors or the insufficient dielectric insulation of capacitors leading to leakage currents.

All properties can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed out of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics are defined by:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;insul&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation resistance]] of the dielectric, not to be confused with the insulation of the housing
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR"
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".

Using a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is specified by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/EN 60384-1.

=== Standard capacitance values and tolerances ===
The '''rated capacitance''' C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or '''nominal capacitance''' C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Actual capacitance depends on the measured frequency and ambient temperature. Standard measuring conditions are a low-voltage AC measuring method at a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C with frequencies of

* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 nF:
* 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 μF
* 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for electrolytic capacitors
* 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10 μF

For supercapacitors a voltage drop method is applied for measuring the capacitance value. .

Capacitors are available in geometrically increasing [[Preferred number|preferred values]] ([[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] standards) specified in IEC/EN 60063. According to the number of values per decade, these were called the E3, E6, E12, [[E24 series|E24]] etc. series. The range of units used to specify capacitor values has expanded to include everything from pico- (pF), nano- (nF) and microfarad (µF) to farad (F). Millifarad and kilofarad are uncommon.

The percentage of allowed deviation from the rated value is called [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. The actual capacitance value should be within its tolerance limits, or it is out of specification. IEC/EN 60062 specifies a letter code for each tolerance.

&lt;/center&gt;

The required tolerance is determined by the particular application. The narrow tolerances of E24 to [[E96 series|E96]] are used for high-quality circuits such as precision oscillators and timers. General applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits employ E12 or E6. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]] capacitors mostly have a tolerance range of ±20% and need to conform to E6 (or E3) series values.

=== Temperature dependence ===
Capacitance typically varies with temperature. The different dielectrics express great differences in temperature sensitivity. The temperature coefficient is expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) per degree Celsius for class 1 ceramic capacitors or in % over the total temperature range for all others.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Frequency dependence ===
Most discrete capacitor types have more or less capacitance changes with increasing frequencies. The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and plastic film diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore, their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. This phenomenon for ceramic class 2 and plastic film dielectrics is related to [[dielectric relaxation]] in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles is the reason for the frequency dependence of [[permittivity]]. The graphs below show typical frequency behavior of the capacitance for ceramic and film capacitors.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Frequency dependence of capacitance for ceramic and film capacitors" class="float-right" style="margin:3em"&gt;
File:MLCC-Kap-versus-Frequenz-engl.svg | Frequency dependence of capacitance for ceramic class 2 capacitors (NP0 class 1 for comparisation)
File:Folko-Kurve-C-f-Frequenz-4.png| Frequency dependence of capacitance for film capacitors with different film materials
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, mechanical motion of the [[ion]]s occurs. Their movability is limited so that at higher frequencies not all areas of the roughened anode structure are covered with charge-carrying ions. As higher the anode structure is roughned as more the capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. Low voltage types with highly roughened anodes display capacitance at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz approximately 10 to 20% of the value measured at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.

=== Voltage dependence ===
Capacitance may also change with applied voltage. This effect is more prevalent in class 2 ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of ferroelectric class 2 material depends on the applied voltage. Higher applied voltage lowers permittivity. The change of capacitance can drop to 80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0&amp;nbsp;V. This behavior is a small source of non-linearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can cause distortion (measured using [[Total harmonic distortion|THD]]).

Film capacitors and electrolytic capacitors have no significant voltage dependence.

=== Rated and category voltage ===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category temperature range and applied voltage]]

The voltage at which the dielectric becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and is given by the product of the dielectric strength and the separation between the electrodes. The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the operating voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage. The operating voltage is specified such that the voltage may be applied continuously throughout the life of the capacitor.

In IEC/EN 60384-1 the allowed operating voltage is called "rated voltage" or "nominal voltage". The rated voltage (UR) is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range.

The voltage proof of nearly all capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. Some applications require a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a second "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature range, the "category voltage". The category voltage (UC) is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range.

The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.

=== Impedance ===
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|150px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances X&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance Z and dissipation factor tan δ]]

In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]. In many cases the capacitor is used as a [[decoupling capacitor]] to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for [[capacitive coupling]] of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] is as important as the capacitance value.

The frequency dependent AC resistance is called [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; and is the [[Complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage to the current in an AC circuit. Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits and possesses both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency. This is unlike resistance, which has only magnitude.

: &lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], while the argument &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; gives the phase difference between voltage and current.

In capacitor data sheets, only the impedance magnitude |Z| is specified, and simply written as "Z" so that the formula for the impedance can be written in [[Cartesian plane|Cartesian form]]

: &lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[real part]] of impedance is the resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; (for capacitors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[imaginary part]] is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;.

As shown in a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, the real component includes an ideal capacitor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, an inductance &lt;math&gt;L (ESL)&lt;/math&gt; and a resistor &lt;math&gt;R (ESR)&lt;/math&gt;. The total reactance at the angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; therefore is given by the geometric (complex) addition of a capacitive reactance ([[Capacitance]]) &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and an inductive reactance ([[Inductance]]): &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

To calculate the impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; the resistance has to be added geometrically and then &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The impedance is a measure of the capacitor's ability to pass alternating currents. In this sense the impedance can be used like Ohms law
: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{eff}}{I_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;

to calculate either the peak or the effective value of the current or the voltage.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances

: &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;

have the same value (&lt;math&gt;X_C=X_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the impedance will only be determined by &lt;math&gt;{ESR}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverläufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|right|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency showing the typical form with a decreasing impedance values below resonance and increasing values above resonance. As higher the capacitance as lower the resonance.]]
The impedance specified in the datasheets often show typical curves for the different capacitance values. With increasing frequency as the impedance decreases down to a minimum. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can be passed through the capacitor. At the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], the point of resonance, where XC has the same value than XL, the capacitor has the lowest impedance value. Here only the ESR determines the impedance. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ESL of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes an inductance.

As shown in the graph, the higher capacitance values can fit the lower frequencies better while the lower capacitance values can fit better the higher frequencies.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower frequency range up to about 1&amp;nbsp;MHz due to their large capacitance values. This is the reason for using electrolytic capacitors in standard or [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] behind the [[rectifier]] for smoothing application.

Ceramic and film capacitors are already out of their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel with a ceramic or film capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murata.com/products/emicon_fun/2011/04/cap_en14.html Murata: Basics of capacitors, lesson 2] Includes graph showing impedance as a function of frequency for different capacitor types; electrolytics are the only ones with a large component due to ESR&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new developments are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL). This increases the resonance frequency of the capacitor and, for example, can follow the constantly increasing switching speed of digital circuits. Miniaturization, especially in the SMD multilayer ceramic chip capacitors ([[Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitor|MLCC]]), increases the resonance frequency. Parasitic inductance is further lowered by placing the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side. The "face-down" construction associated with multi-anode technology in tantalum electrolytic capacitors further reduced ESL. Capacitor families such as the so-called MOS capacitor or silicon capacitors offer solutions when capacitors at frequencies up to the GHz range are needed.

=== Inductance (ESL) and self-resonant frequency ===
ESL in industrial capacitors is mainly caused by the leads and internal connections used to connect the capacitor plates to the outside world. Large capacitors tend to have higher ESL than small ones because the distances to the plate are longer and every mm counts as an inductance.

For any discrete capacitor, there is a frequency above DC at which it ceases to behave as a pure capacitor. This frequency, where &lt;math&gt;X_C&lt;/math&gt; is as high as &lt;math&gt;X_L&lt;/math&gt;, is called the self-resonant frequency. The self-resonant frequency is the lowest frequency at which the impedance passes through a minimum. For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the highest frequency at which capacitors can be used as a capacitive component.

This is critically important for [[Decoupling (electronics)|decoupling]] high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on and off. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate value capacitor.

=== Ohmic losses, ESR, dissipation factor, and quality factor ===
The summarized losses in discrete capacitors are ohmic [[Alternating current|AC]] losses. [[Direct current|DC]] losses are specified as "[[leakage current]]" or "insulating resistance" and are negligible for an AC specification. AC losses are non-linear, possibly depending on frequency, temperature, age or humidity. The losses result from two physical conditions:

* line losses including internal supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, line resistance of the electrodes, and in "wet" aluminum electrolytic capacitors and especially supercapacitors, the limited conductivity of liquid electrolytes and
* [[Loss tangent|dielectric losses]] from [[Dipolar polarization|dielectric polarization]].

The largest share of these losses in larger capacitors is usually the frequency dependent ohmic dielectric losses. For smaller components, especially for wet electrolytic capacitors, conductivity of liquid electrolytes may exceed dielectric losses. To measure these losses, the measurement frequency must be set. Since commercially available components offer capacitance values cover 15 orders of magnitude, ranging from pF (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;F) to some 1000&amp;nbsp;F in supercapacitors, it is not possible to capture the entire range with only one frequency. IEC 60384-1 states that ohmic losses should be measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are:

* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 nF:
* 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 μF
* 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for electrolytic capacitors
* 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10 μF

A capacitor's summarized resistive losses may be specified either as ESR, as a [[dissipation factor]](DF, tan δ), or as [[quality factor]] (Q), depending on application requirements.

Capacitors with higher ripple current &lt;math&gt;I_R&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;loads, such as electrolytic capacitors, are specified with [[equivalent series resistance]] ESR. ESR can be shown as an ohmic part in the above vector diagram. ESR values are specified in datasheets per individual type.

The losses of film capacitors and some class 2 ceramic capacitors are mostly specified with the dissipation factor tan δ. These capacitors have smaller losses than electrolytic capacitors and mostly are used at higher frequencies up to some hundred MHz. However the numeric value of the dissipation factor, measured at the same frequency, is independent on the capacitance value and can be specified for a capacitor series with a range of capacitance. The dissipation factor is determined as the tangent of the reactance (&lt;math&gt;X_C - X_L&lt;/math&gt;)&amp;nbsp;and the ESR, and can be shown as the angle δ between imaginary and the impedance axis.

If the inductance &lt;math&gt; ESL &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = ESR \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

Capacitors with very low losses, such as ceramic Class 1 and Class 2 capacitors, specify resistive losses with a [[Q factor#Electrical systems|quality factor]] (Q). Ceramic Class 1 capacitors are especially suitable for LC resonant circuits with frequencies up to the GHz range, and precise high and low pass filters. For an electrically resonant system, Q represents the effect of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and characterizes a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; relative to its center or resonant frequency &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;. Q is defined as the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor.

: &lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{1}{\tan \delta} = \frac{f_0}{B} \ &lt;/math&gt;

A high Q value is for resonant circuits a mark of the quality of the resonance.

=== Limiting current loads ===
A capacitor can act as an AC resistor, coupling AC voltage and AC current between two points. Every AC current flow through a capacitor generates heat inside the capacitor body. These dissipation power loss &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is caused by &lt;math&gt;ESR&lt;/math&gt; and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P = I^2 \cdot ESR&lt;/math&gt;

The same power loss can be written with the dissipation factor &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; P = \frac{U^2 \cdot \tan \delta}{2\pi f \cdot C}&lt;/math&gt;

The internal generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient. The temperature of the capacitor, which is established on the balance between heat produced and distributed, shall not exceed the capacitors maximum specified temperature. Hence, the ESR or dissipation factor is a mark for the maximum power (AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.) a capacitor is specified for.

AC currents may be a:

* ripple current—an effective (RMS) AC current, coming from an AC voltage superimposed of a DC bias, a
* pulse current—an AC peak current, coming from an voltage peak, or an
* AC current—an effective (RMS) sinusoidal current

Ripple and AC currents mainly warms the capacitor body. By this currents internal generated temperature influences the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. Higher temperature lower the voltage proof of all capacitors. In wet electrolytic capacitors higher temperatures force the evaporation of electrolytes, shortening the life time of the capacitors. In film capacitors higher temperatures may shrink the plastic film changing the capacitor's properties.

Pulse currents, especially in metallized film capacitors, heat the contact areas between end spray (schoopage) and metallized electrodes. This may reduce the contact to the electrodes, heightening the dissipation factor.

For safe operation, the maximal temperature generated by any AC current flow through the capacitor is a limiting factor, which in turn limits AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.

==== Ripple current ====
A "ripple current" is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation at a specified temperature. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor. The "rated ripple current" shall not exceed a temperature rise of 3, 5 or 10&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the capacitor type, at the specified maximum ambient temperature.

Ripple current generates heat within the capacitor body due to the ESR of the capacitor. The ESR, composed out of the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength in the dielectric and the losses resulting out of the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte depends on frequency and temperature. For ceramic and film capacitors in generally ESR decreases with increasing temperatures but heighten with higher frequencies due to increasing dielectric losses. For electrolytic capacitors up to roughly 1&amp;nbsp;MHz ESR decreases with increasing frequencies and temperatures.

The types of capacitors used for power applications have a specified rated value for maximum ripple current. These are primarily aluminum electrolytic capacitors, and tantalum as well as some film capacitors and Class 2 ceramic capacitors.

Aluminium electrolytic capacitors, the most common type for power supplies, experience shorter life expectancy at higher ripple currents. Exceeding the limit tends to result in explosive failure.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte are also limited by ripple current. Exceeding their ripple limits tends to shorts and burning components.

For film and ceramic capacitors, normally specified with a loss factor tan δ, the ripple current limit is determined by temperature rise in the body of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Exceeding this limit may destroy the internal structure and cause shorts.

==== Pulse current ====
The rated pulse load for a certain capacitor is limited by the rated voltage, the pulse repetition frequency, temperature range and pulse rise time. The "pulse rise time" &lt;math&gt;dv/dt&lt;/math&gt;, represents the steepest voltage gradient of the pulse (rise or fall time) and is expressed in volts per μs (V/μs).

The rated pulse rise time is also indirectly the maximum capacity of an applicable peak current &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt;. The peak current is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;I_p = C \cdot dv/dt &lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt; is in A; &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in µF; &lt;math&gt;dv/dt&lt;/math&gt; in V/µs

The permissible pulse current capacity of a metallized film capacitor generally allows an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10 K.

In the case of metallized film capacitors, pulse load depends on the properties of the dielectric material, the thickness of the metallization and the capacitor's construction, especially the construction of the contact areas between the end spray and metallized electrodes. High peak currents may lead to selective overheating of local contacts between end spray and metallized electrodes which may destroy some of the contacts, leading to increasing ESR.

For metallized film capacitors, so-called pulse tests simulate the pulse load that might occur during an application, according to a standard specification. IEC 60384 part 1, specifies that the test circuit is charged and discharged intermittently. The test voltage corresponds to the rated DC voltage and the test comprises 10000 pulses with a repetition frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. The pulse stress capacity is the pulse rise time. The rated pulse rise time is specified as 1/10 of the test pulse rise time.

The pulse load must be calculated for each application. A general rule for calculating the power handling of film capacitors is not available because of vendor-related internal construction details. To prevent the capacitor from overheating the following operating parameters have to be considered:

* peak current per µF
* Pulse rise or fall time dv/dt in V/µs
* relative duration of charge and discharge periods (pulse shape)
* maximum pulse voltage (peak voltage)
* peak reverse voltage;
* Repetition frequency of the pulse
* Ambient temperature
* Heat dissipation (cooling)

Higher pulse rise times are permitted for pulse voltage lower than the rated voltage.

Examples for calculations of individual pulse loads are given by many manufactures, e.g. WIMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/pulseselection.htm|title=WIMA|website=www.wima.de|access-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105021729/http://www.wima.de/EN/pulseselection.htm#|archive-date=2012-11-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kemet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kemet.com/Lists/ProductCatalog/Attachments/159/F9000_GenInfo_DCFilm.pdf|title=General Information DC Film Capacitors|website=www.kemet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AC current ====
[[File:Capacitors-AC limiting conditions.png|thumb|right|Limiting conditions for capacitors operating with AC loads]]

An AC load only can be applied to a non-polarized capacitor. Capacitors for AC applications are primarily film capacitors, metallized paper capacitors, ceramic capacitors and bipolar electrolytic capacitors.

The rated AC load for an AC capacitor is the maximum sinusoidal effective AC current (rms) which may be applied continuously to a capacitor within the specified temperature range. In the datasheets the AC load may be expressed as

* rated AC voltage at low frequencies,
* rated reactive power at intermediate frequencies,
* reduced AC voltage or rated AC current at high frequencies.

[[File:Folko-U-eff-f-Frequenz.png|thumb|right| Typical rms AC voltage curves as a function of frequency, for 4 different capacitance values of a 63 V DC film capacitor series]]
The rated AC voltage for film capacitors is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;°K is the allowed limit for safe operation. Because dielectric losses increase with increasing frequency, the specified AC voltage has to be derated at higher frequencies. Datasheets for film capacitors specify special curves for derating AC voltages at higher frequencies.

If film capacitors or ceramic capacitors only have a DC specification, the peak value of the AC voltage applied has to be lower than the specified DC voltage.

AC loads can occur in AC motor run capacitors, for voltage doubling, in [[snubber]]s, lighting ballast and for [[power factor correction]] PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission network stability and efficiency, which is one of the most important applications for large power capacitors. These mostly large PP film or metallized paper capacitors are limited by the rated reactive power VAr.

Bipolar electrolytic capacitors, to which an AC voltage may be applicable, are specified with a rated ripple current.

=== Insulation resistance and self-discharge constant ===
The resistance of the dielectric is finite, leading to some level of [[Direct current|DC "leakage current"]] that causes a charged capacitor to lose charge over time. For ceramic and film capacitors, this resistance is called "insulation resistance R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt;". This resistance is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors.
Insulation resistance must not be confused with the outer isolation of the component with respect to the environment.

The time curve of self-discharge over insulation resistance with decreasing capacitor voltage follows the formula

: &lt;math&gt;u(t) = U_0 \cdot \mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{s}},&lt;/math&gt;

With stored DC voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;and self-discharge constant

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s} = R_\mathrm{ins} \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, after &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;drops to 37% of the initial value.

The self-discharge constant is an important parameter for the insulation of the dielectric between the electrodes of ceramic and film capacitors. For example, a capacitor can be used as the time-determining component for time relays or for storing a voltage value as in a [[sample and hold]] circuits or [[operational amplifier]]s.

Class&amp;nbsp;1 ceramic capacitors have an insulation resistance of at least 10&amp;nbsp;GΩ, while class&amp;nbsp;2 capacitors have at least 4&amp;nbsp;GΩ or a self-discharge constant of at least 100&amp;nbsp;s. Plastic film capacitors typically have an insulation resistance of 6 to 12&amp;nbsp;GΩ. This corresponds to capacitors in the uF range of a self-discharge constant of about 2000–4000&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/insulation.htm|title=WIMA|website=www.wima.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insulation resistance respectively the self-discharge constant can be reduced if humidity penetrates into the winding. It is partially strongly temperature dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. Both decrease with increasing temperature.

In electrolytic capacitors, the insulation resistance is defined as leakage current.

=== Leakage current ===
[[File:Leakage current curves.svg|thumb|right|general leakage behavior of electrolytic capacitors: leakage current &lt;math&gt;I_{leak}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; depending of the kind of electrolyte
{{legend|#ff0000|non solid, high water conent}}
{{legend|#2330ff|non solid, organic}}
{{legend|#2cbc32|solid, polymer}}
]]

For electrolytic capacitors the insulation resistance of the dielectric is termed "leakage current". This [[Direct current|DC current]] is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors. This resistance between the terminals of a capacitor is also finite. R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; is lower for electrolytics than for ceramic or film capacitors.

The leakage current includes all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage. It is also the DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage. It depends on the interval without voltage applied (storage time), the thermic stress from soldering, on voltage applied, on temperature of the capacitor, and on measuring time.

The leakage current drops in the first minutes after applying DC voltage. In this period the dielectric oxide layer can self-repair weaknesses by building up new layers. The time required depends generally on the electrolyte. Solid electrolytes drop faster than non-solid electrolytes but remain at a slightly higher level.

The leakage current in non-solid electrolytic capacitors as well as in manganese oxide solid tantalum capacitors decreases with voltage-connected time due to self-healing effects. Although electrolytics leakage current is higher than current flow over insulation resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non solid electrolytic capacitors takes several weeks.

A particular problem with electrolytic capacitors is storage time. Higher leakage current can be the result of longer storage times. These behaviors are limited to electrolytes with a high percentage of water. Organic solvents such as [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] do not have high leakage with longer storage times.

Leakage current is normally measured 2 or 5 minutes after applying rated voltage.

=== Microphonics ===

All ferroelectric materials exhibit [[piezoelectricity]] a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, these types of capacitors may have electrical effects called [[microphonics]]. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical [[vibration]]s into an undesired electrical signal ([[Noise (electronics)|noise]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/62/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Reduced%20Microphonics%20and%20Sound%20Emissions.pdf|title=Capacitors for Reduced Micro phonics and Sound Emission |website=www.kemet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.

In the reverse microphonic effect, varying the electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, turning them into an audio speaker. High current impulse loads or high ripple currents can generate audible sound from the capacitor itself, draining energy and stressing the dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/242F5F2E69DCEC7485256EDF004CA495 Are your military ceramic capacitors subject to the piezoelectric effect?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619003041/http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/242F5F2E69DCEC7485256EDF004CA495 |date=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dielectric absorption (soakage) ===
{{main article|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

In many applications of capacitors dielectric absorption is not a problem but in some applications, such as long-[[time constant|time-constant]] [[integrator]]s, [[sample-and-hold]] circuits, switched-capacitor [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and very low-distortion [[Electronic filter|filter]]s, the capacitor must not recover a residual charge after full discharge, so capacitors with low absorption are specified.&lt;ref&gt;"Understand Capacitor Soakage to Optimize Analog Systems" by Bob Pease 1982 [http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012093202/http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0%2C1570%2C28%2C00.html|date=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf "Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors", by Ken Kundert]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy density ===
The capacitance value depends on the dielectric material (ε), the surface of the electrodes (A) and the distance (d) separating the electrodes and is given by the formula of a plate capacitor:

: &lt;math&gt;C \approx \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The separation of the electrodes and the voltage proof of the dielectric material defines the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. The breakdown voltage is proportional to the thickness of the dielectric.

Theoretically, given two capacitors with the same mechanical dimensions and dielectric, but one of them have half the thickness of the dielectric. With the same dimensions this one could place twice the parallel-plate area inside. This capacitor has theoretically 4 times the capacitance as the first capacitor but half of the voltage proof.

Since the energy density stored in a capacitor is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2,&lt;/math&gt;

thus a capacitor having a dielectric half as thick as another has 4 times higher capacitance but ½ voltage proof, yielding an equal maximum energy density.

Therefore, dielectric thickness does not affect energy density within a capacitor of fixed overall dimensions. Using a few thick layers of dielectric can support a high voltage, but low capacitance, while thin layers of dielectric produce a low breakdown voltage, but a higher capacitance.

This assumes that neither the electrode surfaces nor the permittivity of the dielectric change with the voltage proof. A simple comparison with two existing capacitor series can show whether reality matches theory. The comparison is easy, because the manufacturers use standardized case sizes or boxes for different capacitance/voltage values within a series.

In reality modern capacitor series do not fit the theory. For electrolytic capacitors the sponge-like rough surface of the anode foil gets smoother with higher voltages, decreasing the surface area of the anode. But because the energy increases squared with the voltage, and the surface of the anode decreases lesser than the voltage proof, the energy density increases clearly. For film capacitors the permittivity changes with dielectric thickness and other mechanical parameters so that the deviation from the theory has other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph M. Kerrigan, NWL Capacitor Division [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA07/2_4097.pdf Metallized Polypropylene Film Energy Storage Capacitors For Low Pulse Duty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929102652/http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA07/2_4097.pdf# |date=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the capacitors from the table with a supercapacitor, the highest energy density capacitor family. For this, the capacitor 25&amp;nbsp; F/2.3&amp;nbsp;V in dimensions D × H = 16&amp;nbsp;mm × 26&amp;nbsp;mm from Maxwell HC Series, compared with the electrolytic capacitor of approximately equal size in the table. This supercapacitor has roughly 5000 times higher capacitance than the 4700/10 electrolytic capacitor but ¼ of the voltage and has about 66,000&amp;nbsp;mWs (0.018&amp;nbsp;Wh) stored electrical energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwell.com/products/ultracapacitors|title=Maxwell Ultracapacitors: Enabling Energy's Future|website=Maxwell Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 100 times higher energy density (40 to 280 times) than the electrolytic capacitor.

=== Long time behavior, aging ===
Electrical parameters of capacitors may change over time during storage and application. The reasons for parameter changings are different, it may be a property of the dielectric, environmental influences, chemical processes or drying-out effects for non-solid materials.

==== Aging ====
[[File:Delta-Cap-versus-Zeit-engl.png|thumb|right|Aging of different Class 2 ceramic capacitors compared with NP0-Class 1 ceramic capacitor]]

In [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] Class 2 ceramic capacitors, capacitance decreases over time. This behavior is called "aging". This aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization in the dielectric contribute to the total polarization. Degradation of polarized domains in the dielectric decreases permittivity and therefore capacitance over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=K W|periodical=Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section B|title=Ageing of the Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate Ceramics |volume=69|issue=12|year=1956|pages=1261–1268|language=German|doi=10.1088/0370-1301/69/12/309|last1=Plessner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takaaki Tsurumi &amp; Motohiro Shono &amp; Hirofumi Kakemoto &amp; Satoshi Wada &amp; Kenji Saito &amp; Hirokazu Chazono, Mechanism of capacitance aging under DC-bias field in X7R-MLCCs
Published online: 23 March 2007, # Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10832-007-9071-0?LI=true#page-1]&lt;/ref&gt; The aging follows a logarithmic law. This defines the decrease of capacitance as constant percentage for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;hours at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 100&amp;nbsp;h and 3 times between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 1,000&amp;nbsp;h and so on. Aging is fastest near the beginning, and the absolute capacitance value stabilizes over time.

The rate of aging of Class 2 ceramic capacitors depends mainly on its materials. Generally, the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5% per decade.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher England, Johanson dielectrics, Ceramic Capacitor Aging Made Simple [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/technical-notes/general/ceramic-capacitor-aging-made-simple.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The aging rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.

The aging process of Class 2 ceramic capacitors may be reversed by heating the component above the [[Curie point]].

Class 1 ceramic capacitors and film capacitors do not have ferroelectric-related aging. Environmental influences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can, over a longer period, lead to a small irreversible change in the capacitance value sometimes called aging, too.

The change of capacitance for P&amp;nbsp;100 and N&amp;nbsp;470 Class 1 ceramic capacitors is lower than 1%, for capacitors with N&amp;nbsp;750 to N&amp;nbsp;1500 ceramics it is ≤&amp;nbsp;2%. Film capacitors may lose capacitance due to self-healing processes or gain it due to humidity influences. Typical changes over 2 years at 40&amp;nbsp;°C are, for example, ±3% for PE film capacitors and ±1% PP film capacitors.

==== Life time ====
[[File:Lebensdauer-Testergebnisse-english.png|thumb|right|The electrical values of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte changes over the time due to evaporation of electrolyte. Reaching specified limits of the parameters the capacitors will be count as "wear out failure".]]

Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age as the electrolyte evaporates. This evaporation depends on temperature and the current load the capacitors experience. Electrolyte escape influences capacitance and ESR. Capacitance decreases and the ESR increases over time. In contrast to ceramic, film and electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes, "wet" electrolytic capacitors reach a specified "end of life" reaching a specified maximum change of capacitance or ESR. End of life, "load life" or "lifetime" can be estimated either by formula or diagrams&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Arne Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/1-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Lifetime-Estimation-long-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf Electrolytic Capacitor Lifetime Estimation]&lt;/ref&gt; or roughly by a so-called "10-degree-law". A typical specification for an electrolytic capacitor states a lifetime of 2,000 hours at 85&amp;nbsp;°C, doubling for every 10 degrees lower temperature, achieving lifespan of approximately 15 years at room temperature.

Supercapacitors also experience electrolyte evaporation over time. Estimation is similar to wet electrolytic capacitors. Additional to temperature the voltage and current load influence the life time. Lower voltage than rated voltage and lower current loads as well as lower temperature extend the life time.

=== Failure rate ===
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|The life time (load life) of capacitors correspondents with the time of constant random failure rate shown in the [[bathtub curve]]. For electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte and supercapacitors ends this time with the beginning of wear out failures due to evaporation of electrolyte]]

Capacitors are [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] components with low [[failure rate]]s, achieving life expectancies of decades under normal conditions. Most capacitors pass a test at the end of production similar to a "[[burn in]]", so that early failures are found during production, reducing the number of post-shipment failures.

Reliability for capacitors is usually specified in numbers of [[Failure rate|Failures In Time]] (FIT) during the period of constant random failures. FIT is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, at 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5 U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;). For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, mechanical influences and humidity the FIT can recalculated with terms standardized for industrial&lt;ref&gt;IEC/EN 61709, Electric components. Reliability. Reference conditions for failure rates and stress models for conversion&lt;/ref&gt; or military&lt;ref&gt;MIL-HDBK-217F Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment&lt;/ref&gt; contexts.

== Additional information ==

=== Soldering ===
Capacitors may experience changes to electrical parameters due to environmental influences like soldering, mechanical stress factors (vibration, shock) and humidity. The greatest stress factor is soldering. The heat of the solder bath, especially for SMD capacitors, can cause ceramic capacitors to change contact resistance between terminals and electrodes; in film capacitors, the film may shrink, and in wet electrolytic capacitors the electrolyte may boil. A recovery period enables characteristics to stabilize after soldering; some types may require up to 24 hours. Some properties may change irreversibly by a few per cent from soldering.

=== Electrolytic behavior from storage or disuse ===
Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are "aged" during manufacturing by applying rated voltage at high temperature for a sufficient time to repair all cracks and weaknesses that may have occurred during production. Some electrolytes with a high water content react quite aggressively or even violently with unprotected aluminum. This leads to a "storage" or "disuse" problem of electrolytic capacitors manufactured before the 1980s. Chemical processes weaken the oxide layer when these capacitors are not used for too long. New electrolytes with "inhibitors" or "passivators" were developed during the 1980s to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Stevens, T. R. Marshall, A. C. Geiculescu M., C. R. Feger, T. F. Strange, Carts USA 2006, [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTS06/5_2zxm.pdf The Effects of Electrolyte Composition on the Deformation Characteristics of Wet Aluminum ICD Capacitors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126154124/http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTS06/5_2zxm.pdf# |date=2014-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Berduque, Zongli Dou, Rong Xu, BHC Components Ltd (KEMET), [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/9A3F15E8C67C5305852576F80076DBA3/$file/2009-10%20CARTS%20-%20Al-Electrolytic%20Corrosion%20of%20Al%20in%20Ethylen-Glycol%20Electrolytes.pdf pdf Electrochemical Studies for Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitor Applications: Corrosion Analysis of Aluminium in Ethylene Glycol-Based Electrolytes]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2012 the standard storage time for electronic components of two years at room temperature substantiates (cased) by the oxidation of the terminals will be specified for electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes, too. Special series for 125&amp;nbsp;°C with organic solvents like [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] are specified up to 10 years storage time ensure without pre-condition the proper electrical behavior of the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay BCcomponents, Revision: 10-May-12, Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, paragraph "Storage"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf# |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For antique radio equipment, "pre-conditioning" of older electrolytic capacitors may be recommended. This involves applying the operating voltage for some 10 minutes over a current limiting resistor to the terminals of the capacitor. Applying a voltage through a safety resistor repairs the oxide layers.

=== IEC/EN standards ===

=== Markings ===

==== Imprinted ====
Capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. If they are large enough the capacitor is marked with:

* manufacturer's name or trademark;
* manufacturer's type designation;
* polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;
* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)

Polarized capacitors have polarity markings, usually "−" (minus) sign on the side of the negative electrode for electrolytic capacitors or a stripe or "+" (plus) sign, see [[#Polarity marking]]. Also, the negative lead for leaded "wet" e-caps is usually shorter.

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10&lt;sup&gt;Z&lt;/sup&gt; pF), the letters J, K or M indicate the tolerance (±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively) and VOLTS V represents the working voltage.

Examples:

* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 1&amp;nbsp;µF (K = ±10%) with a working voltage of 330&amp;nbsp;V.
* 473M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 47&amp;nbsp;nF (M = ±20%) with a working voltage of 100&amp;nbsp;V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): µ47 = 0,47 µF, 4µ7 = 4,7 µF, 47µ = 47 µF

The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.

* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, "1208" is "2012, week number 8".
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: "R" = 2003, "S"= 2004, "T" = 2005, "U" = 2006, "V" = 2007, "W" = 2008, "X" = 2009, "A" = 2010, "B" = 2011, "C" = 2012, "D" = 2013, etc. Month codes are: "1" to "9" = Jan. to Sept., "O" = October, "N" = November, "D" = December. "X5" is then "2009, May"

For very small capacitors like MLCC chips no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

====Colour coding====
{{Main article|Electronic color code}}
{{as of|2013}} Capacitors do not use color coding.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Aluminum e-caps with ''non-solid'' electrolyte have a polarity marking at the cathode (''minus'') side. Aluminum, tantalum, and niobium e-caps with ''solid'' electrolyte have a polarity marking at the anode (''plus'') side. Supercapacitors are marked at the ''minus'' side.

==Market segments==
Discrete capacitors today are industrial products produced in very large quantities for use in electronic and in electrical equipment. Globally, the market for fixed capacitors was estimated at approximately US$18 billion in 2008 for 1,400 billion (1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors|title=Electronic Capacitors market report - HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared|website=business.highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market is dominated by ceramic capacitors with estimate of approximately one trillion (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) items per year.&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;J. Ho, T. R. Jow, S. Boggs, [http://www.ifre.re.kr/board/filedown.php?seq=179 Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed estimated figures in value for the main capacitor families are:

* [[Ceramic capacitor]]s—US$8.3 billion (46%);
* [[Electrolytic capacitor|Aluminum electrolytic capacitors]]—US$3.9 billion (22%);
* [[Film capacitor]]s and Paper capacitors—US$2.6 billion, (15%);
* [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]]—US$2.2 billion (12%);
* [[Super capacitor]]s ([[Double-layer capacitor]]s)—US$0.3 billion (2%); and
* Others like [[silver mica capacitor|silver mica]] and [[Vacuum variable capacitor|vacuum capacitors]]—US$0.7 billion (3%).

All other capacitor types are negligible in terms of value and quantity compared with the above types.

A '''copiotroph''' is an [[organism]] found in environments rich in [[nutrient]]s, particularly [[carbon]]. They are the opposite to [[oligotroph]]s, which survive in much lower carbon concentrations.

Copiotrophic organisms tend to grow in high [[organic matter|organic]] substrate conditions. For example, copiotrophic organisms grow in  [[Sewage treatment#Surface-aerated basins (lagoons)|Sewage lagoons]]. They grow in organic substrate conditions up to 100x higher than oligotrophs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10398">'''Cryogenic fuels''' are [[fuel]]s that require storage at extremely low temperatures in order to maintain them in a liquid state. These fuels are used in machinery that operates in space (e.g. rocket ships and satellites) because ordinary fuel cannot be used there, due to absence of an environment that supports [[combustion]] (on Earth,  oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere, whereas in human-explorable space, oxygen is virtually non-existent) and space is a vacuum. [[Cryogenic]] fuels most often constitute [[liquification|liquefied]] [[gas]]es such as [[liquid hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="Cryogenic Engine"&gt;{{Cite web |title=How does cryogenic engine work |author=Shimpi, Nikhil |date=2014 |url=https://www.quora.com/How-does-cryogenic-engine-work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[rocket engine]]s use [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]], the practice of circulating their cryogenic fuel around the [[nozzle]]s before the fuel is pumped into the [[combustion chamber]] and ignited. This arrangement was first suggested by [[Eugen Sänger]] in the 1940s. The [[Saturn V]] rocket that sent the first manned missions to the Moon used this design element, which is still in use today.

Quite often, [[liquid oxygen]] is mistakenly called cryogenic ''fuel'', though it is actually an [[oxidizer]] and not a fuel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Russian aircraft manufacturer [[Tupolev]] developed a version of its popular [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]] design but with a cryogenic fuel system, designated the [[Tu-155]]. Using a fuel referred to as [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG), its first flight was in 1989.

== Operation ==
Cryogenic fuels can be placed into two categories: inert and flammable or combustible. Both types exploit the large liquid to gas volume ratio that occurs when liquid transitions to gas phase. The feasibility of cryogenic fuels is associated with what is known as a high mass flow rate.&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-08024-8"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regulation, the high-density energy of cryogenic fuels is utilized to produce thrust in rockets and controllable consumption of fuel. The following sections provide further detail.

===Inert===
These types of fuels typically use the regulation of gas production and flow to power pistons in an engine. The large increases in pressure are controlled and directed toward the engine's pistons. The pistons move due to the mechanical power transformed from the monitored production of gaseous fuel. A notable example can be seen in [[Peter Dearman]]'s liquid air vehicle. Some common inert fuels include:
* [[Liquid nitrogen]]
* [[Liquid air]]
* [[Liquid helium]]
* Liquid neon

===Combustible===
These fuels utilize the beneficial liquid cryogenic properties along with the flammable nature of the substance as a source of power. These types of fuel are well known primarily for their use in rockets including the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]. Some common combustible fuels include:
* [[Liquid hydrogen]]
* Liquid natural gas (LNG)
* Liquid methane

==Engine combustion==
Combustible cryogenic fuels offer much more utility than most inert fuels can. Liquefied natural gas, as with any fuel, will only combust when properly mixed with right amounts of air. As for LNG, the bulk majority of efficiency depends on the methane number, which is the gas equivalent of the octane number.&lt;ref name="Statoil LNG Combustion"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Combustion characteristics of LNG |author=Øyvind Buhaug |date=2011-09-21 |work=LNG Fuel Forum |url=http://www.glmri.org/downloads/lngMisc/Combustion%20Characteristics%20of%20LNG-Oyvind%20Buhaug-21%20Sept%202011-II.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is determined based on the methane content of the liquefied fuel and any other dissolved gas, and varies as a result of experimental efficiencies.&lt;ref name="Statoil LNG Combustion"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Combustion characteristics of LNG |author=Øyvind Buhaug |date=2011-09-21 |work=LNG Fuel Forum |url=http://www.glmri.org/downloads/lngMisc/Combustion%20Characteristics%20of%20LNG-Oyvind%20Buhaug-21%20Sept%202011-II.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximizing efficiency in combustion engines will be a result of determining the proper fuel to air ratio and utilizing the addition other hydrocarbons for added optimal combustion.

==Production efficiency==
Gas liquefying processes have been improving over the past decades with the advent of better machinery and control of system heat losses. Typical techniques take advantage of the temperature of the gas dramatically cooling as the controlled pressure of a gas is released. Enough pressurization and then subsequent depressurization can liquefy most gases, as exemplified by the [[Joule-Thomson effect]].&lt;ref name="LNG Liquefaction"&gt;{{Cite web |title=LNG liquefaction technologies move toward greater efficiencies, lower emissions |author=Oil and Gas Journal |date=2002-08-09 |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-100/issue-33/processing/lng-liquefaction-technologies-move-toward-greater-efficiencies-lower-emissions.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquefied natural gas===
While it is cost effective to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 percent of the gas gets consumed during the process.&lt;ref name="LNG Need to Know"&gt;{{Cite web |title=All you need to know about LNG |author=Bill White |date=2012-10-02 |work=THe Oil Drum |url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-LNG.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal process contains four stages of [[propane refrigeration]] and two stages of ethylene refrigeration. There can be the addition of an additional [[refrigerant]] stage, but the additional costs of equipment are not economically justifiable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing. The optimized process incorporates optimized heat recovery along with the use of pure refrigerants. All process designers of liquefaction plants using proven technologies face the same challenge: to efficiently cool and condense a mixture with a pure refrigerant. In the optimized Cascade process, the mixture to be cooled and condensed is the feed gas. In the propane mixed refrigerant processes, the two mixtures requiring cooling and condensing are the feed gas and the mixed refrigerant. The chief source of inefficiency lies in the heat exchange train during the liquefaction process.&lt;ref name="LNG Plant Efficiency"&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Fresh look at LNG Process Efficiency |author=Weldon Ransbarger |date=2007 |work=LNG Industry |url=http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/Documents/SMID_016_WeldonsPaperLNGIndustry.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Benefits===
* Cryogenic fuels are environmentally cleaner than gasoline or [[fossil fuels]].  Among other things, the [[greenhouse gas]] rate could potentially be reduced by 11–20% using LNG as opposed to gasoline when transporting goods.&lt;ref name="What are the Benefits of LNG"&gt;{{Cite web |title=What are the Benefits of LNG |year=2015 |url=http://www.lngmasterplan.eu/lng/benefits-of-lng}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Along with their eco-friendly nature, they have the potential to significantly decrease transportation costs of inland products because of their abundance compared to that of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="What are the Benefits of LNG"&gt;{{Cite web |title=What are the Benefits of LNG |year=2015 |url=http://www.lngmasterplan.eu/lng/benefits-of-lng}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cryogenic fuels have a higher mass flow rate than fossil fuels and therefore produce more [[thrust]] and power when combusted for use in an engine.  This means that engines will run farther on less fuel overall than modern [[gas engine]]s.&lt;ref name="Cryo basics"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cryogenic advantage |author=Ramachandran, R. |date=2014-02-07 |work=Frontline |url=http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/cryogenic-advantage/article5596577.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cryogenic fuels are [[non-pollutants]] and therefore, if spilled, are no risk to the environment. There will be no need to clean up hazardous waste after a spill.&lt;ref name="Methane Fuel"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Liquid Methane Fuel Characterization and Safety Assessment Report |author=Cryogenic Fuels, Inc. |date=1991-12-16 |work=Metropolitian Transit Authority |url=http://www.cryogenicfuelsinc.com/includes/Liquid%20Methane%20Safety%20Report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential drawbacks===
* Some cryogenic fuels, like LNG, are naturally combustible. Ignition of fuel spills could result in a large explosion.  This is possible in the case of a car crash with an LNG engine.&lt;ref name="Methane Fuel"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Liquid Methane Fuel Characterization and Safety Assessment Report |author=Cryogenic Fuels, Inc. |date=1991-12-16 |work=Metropolitian Transit Authority |url=http://www.cryogenicfuelsinc.com/includes/Liquid%20Methane%20Safety%20Report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cryogenic storage tanks must be able to withstand high pressure. High-pressure [[propellant tank]]s require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and practicality.&lt;ref name="Advantages and Disadvantages"&gt;{{Cite web |title=What are the advantages and Disadvantages of a Cryogenic Engine |author=Asogekar, Nikhil. |date=2015-03-06 |work=Quora |url=https://www.quora.com/What-are-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-cryogenic-engine }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Despite [[non-toxic]] tendencies, cryogenic fuels are denser than air. As such, they can lead to [[asphyxiation]]. If leaked, the liquid will boil into a very dense, cold gas and if inhaled, could be fatal.&lt;ref name="Canadian Centre for Occupational Health &amp; Safety"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cryogenic Liquids-Hazards|author=Asogekar, Nikhil. |date=2015-12-02 |work=CCOHS |url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/cryogenic/cryogen1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyaphide''', P≡C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is the phosphorus analogue of [[Cyanide|cyanide]]. It is not known as a discrete salt, however, ''[[In silico]]'' measurements reveal that the -1 charge in this ion is location mainly on carbon (0.65), as opposed to phosphorus.

[[File:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]], illustrating a low degree of ionization (i.e. a partially ionized gas) ]]

The '''degree of ionization''' (also known as ''ionization yield'' in the literature) refers to the proportion of neutral particles, such as those in a [[gas]] or aqueous solution, that are ionized to charged particles. For [[electrolyte]]s, it could be understood as a capacity of acid/base to ionize itself. A low degree of ionization is sometimes called ''partially ionized'' (also ''weakly ionized''), and a high degree of ionization as ''fully ionized''.&lt;!--'When polar covalent substance which doesn't contain ions in its pure state forms, it produces ions as soon as it dissolves into water which is called ionization or degree of ionization.' - I'm guessing that this should read 'When a polar covalent substance (which doesn't contain ions in its pure state) dissolves in water, it immediately produces ions; this is called ionization or degree of ionization.'. But so what? It is not relevant to this paragraph, but possibly to the one below. If this the only way that ionization occurs, fine, otherwises we should make it clear that it is an example. I'm no chemist, but given the description of 'degree of ionization' above, the last part about ionization being the same thing is clearly wrong!--&gt;

Ionization refers to the process whereby an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] loses one or several [[electron]]s from its [[atomic orbital]], or conversely gains an additional one, from an incoming [[Free particle|free]] [[electron]] (electron attachement). In both cases, the atom or molecule is no more a [[neutral particle]] and becomes a [[charge carrier]]. If the species has lost one or several electrons, it becomes positively charged and is called a positive [[ion]], or [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]]. On the contrary, if the species has gained one or several additional electrons, it becomes [[Electric charge|negatively charged]] and is called a negative ion, or [[Ion#Anions and cations|anion]]. Individual free electrons and ions in a plasma have very short lives typically inferior to the [[microsecond]], as ionization and [[Plasma recombination|recombination]], [[Excited state|excitation]] and [[Vibrational energy relaxation|relaxation]] are collective continuous processes.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0471078289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry usage==

The '''degree of dissociation''' ''α'' (also known as degree of ionization), is a way of representing the strength of an acid. It is defined as the ratio of the number of ionized molecules and the number of molecules dissolved in water. It can be represented as a decimal number or as a percentage. One can classify strong acids as those having ionization degrees above 30%, weak acids as those with ''α'' below 30%, and the rest as moderate acids, at a specified molar concentration.

==Physics usage==
{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}
In [[gases]], the degree of ionization &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; refers to the proportion of neutral particles that are ionized into charged particles:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ion density and &lt;math&gt;n_n&lt;/math&gt; the neutral density (in particles per cubic meter). It is a dimensionless number, most of the time expressed as a percentage.

In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei}&lt;/math&gt; is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} = \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.

The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &gt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1980" /&gt;

A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &lt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular case of fully ionizes gases are very hot [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear plasmas]], such as plasmas artificially produced in [[nuclear explosion]]s or naturally formed in our Sun and all stars in the universe. Stars contain largely hydrogen and helium gases, that are ''fully ionized'' into electrons, protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and helium ions (He&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;). Equations to characterize such very hot, fully ionized thermonuclear plasmas in the presence of stellar magnetic fields can be approximated to [[Magnetohydrodynamics#Ideal and resistive MHD|ideal magnetohydrodynamics]] laws with high [[magnetic Reynolds number]].

==History==
Ionized matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or [[Crookes tube]]), and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").&lt;ref&gt;Crookes presented a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html] [http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the [[Crookes tube]] "[[cathode ray]]" matter was subsequently identified by English physicist [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J.J. Thomson]] in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;Announced in his evening lecture to the [[Royal Institution]] on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', 44, 293 [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/thomson1897.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and dubbed "plasma" by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1928,&lt;ref name="langmuir1928"&gt;I. Langmuir, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PhRv...33..195T&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c29098 Oscillations in ionized gases]," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.'', vol. 14, p. 628, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because it reminded him of a [[blood plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;G. L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2930">'''Diffusion Capacitance''' is the [[capacitance]] due to transport of [[charge carrier]]s between two terminals of a device, for example, the diffusion of carriers from anode to cathode in forward bias mode of a [[diode]] or from emitter to baseforward-biased [[p-n junction|junction]]  for a [[transistor]].  In a [[semiconductor device]] with a current flowing through it (for example, an ongoing transport of charge by [[diffusion]]) at a particular moment there is necessarily some charge in the process of transit through the device. If the applied voltage changes to a different value and the current changes to a different value, a different amount of charge will be in transit in the new circumstances. The change in the amount of transiting charge divided by the change in the voltage causing it is the diffusion capacitance. The adjective "diffusion" is used because the original use of this term was for junction diodes, where the charge transport was via the diffusion mechanism. See [[Fick's laws of diffusion]].

To implement this notion quantitatively, at a particular moment in time let the voltage across the device be &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume that the voltage changes with time slowly enough that at each moment the current is the same as the DC current that would flow at that voltage, say &lt;math&gt;I=I(V)&lt;/math&gt; (the ''[[quasistatic approximation]]'').  Suppose further that the time to cross the device is the '''forward transit time''' &lt;math&gt;{\tau}_F&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the amount of charge in transit through the device at this particular moment, denoted &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

::&lt;math&gt;Q=I(V){\tau}_F &lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently, the corresponding diffusion capacitance:&lt;math&gt;C_{diff} &lt;/math&gt;. is

::&lt;math&gt;C_{diff} =\begin{matrix}\frac{dQ}{dV}\end{matrix}=\begin{matrix}\frac{dI(V)}{dV}\end{matrix} {\tau}_F &lt;/math&gt;.

In the event the quasi-static approximation does not hold, that is, for very fast voltage changes occurring in times shorter than the transit time &lt;math&gt;{\tau}_F &lt;/math&gt;, the equations governing time-dependent transport in the device must be solved to find the charge in transit, for example the [[Boltzmann equation]]. That problem is a subject of continuing research under the topic of non-quasistatic effects. See Liu

== Origin and effect ==
Downcycling can help to keep materials in use, reduce consumption of [[raw materials]], and avoid the energy usage, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, [[air pollution]], and [[water pollution]] of primary production and resource extraction. 
[[File:Downcycling of steel, recovered from scrap cars but only deemed reusable in the construction sector.svg|thumb|Downcycling of steel from scrap cars into buildings. Vehicle steel scrap, which is contaminated with other metals, is often remelted into construction steel that can contain up to 0.4% of copper.&lt;ref name=Savov2003 /&gt;]]

The term ''downcycling'' was first used by Reiner Pilz in an interview by Thornton Kay in SalvoNEWS in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salvoweb.com/files/sn99sm24y94tk181119.pdf Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. "Recycling, he said, "I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is [[upcycling]] where old products are given more value not less." He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg while just down the road a load of similar blocks was scrapped. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''downcycling'' was also used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''.
&lt;ref  name=CradletoCradle/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; As we have noted, most recycling is actually ''downcycling''; it reduces the quality of a material over time. When plastics other than those found in soda and water bottles are recycled, they are mixed with different plastics to produce a hybrid of lower quality, which is then molded into something amorphous and cheap, such as a park bench or a speed bump... Aluminum is another valuable but constantly downcycled material. The typical soda can consists of two kinds of aluminum: the walls are composed of aluminum, manganese alloy with some magnesium, plus coatings and paint, while the harder top is aluminum magnesium alloy. In conventional recycling these materials are melted together, resulting in a weaker—and less useful—product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Similar operations ==
Downcycling is related to but different from 'open-loop recycling'. While downcycling implies quality loss the term open-loop recycling denotes a situation where the secondary material is used in a different product system than the original material; it thus comprises both upcycling and downcycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38498 ISO 14044:2006] (ISO)&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed discussion on the relation between downcycling, open loop recycling and their [[environmental impact]] is provided by Geyer et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geyer|first=R.|last2=Kuczenski|first2=B.| last3=Henderson|first3=A.|date=2016|title=Common Misconceptions about Recycling. |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=20|issue=5|pages= 1010–1017|doi=10.1111/jiec.12355}}&lt;/ref&gt; They write that "Poor product design and EOL management can lead to recycled materials of poor quality, which, in turn, limits the applications these materials can be used in." They also argue that "closed-loop recycling neither intrinsically displaces more primary material owing to multiple loops (quantity argument) nor per se generates higher environmental benefits on a unit basis (quality argument)." The reason for their argument lies in the necessity to include the product system of the target application, in which the recycled material is used or not, into the assessment of overall primary material demand and environmental impact.

'''''Energy Matters''''' was the title of a magazine published by students at the [[University of Cambridge]] between November 1980 and June 1984.  Its objective, outlined in the editorial to the first edition,&lt;ref name="Matters that Matter"&gt;"Matters that Matter", ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.1, Michaelmas 1980, p.3, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt; was to provide facts, details and opinions relating to energy, in a way accessible to interested students.

"Energy Matters" was notable in a number ways.  Its dispassionate and technical approach to this controversial topic was possibly unprecedented at a British University, at a time when many student publications were highly partisan on the issue.  It was an independent undergraduate student magazine wholly funded (initially) by a University department, an unusual and possibly unique arrangement in the UK.&lt;ref name="Matters that Matter"/&gt;  It received endorsement from the British Royal Family, a significant and unusual gesture at the time for a magazine dealing with political matters.  It was where a number of subsequently famous journalists and academics showed their first public work.

The magazine was founded at a time of high public interest in [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|energy issues]], due to the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil crisis]] and the [[Three Mile Island accident]] the previous year, and to a wave of public interest in [[energy conservation]] stimulated by environmental concerns.  The topic had become highly political; for example a debate took place in the [[Cambridge Union Society]] (the University's debating club) in November 1980 under the title "This House Believes Britain's Dependence on Nuclear Power will Result in Disaster", opposed by  [[Bernard Jenkin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stop Press with Varsity'', 7 November 1980, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the magazine was founded by two undergraduates at the [[Cambridge University Engineering Department]], Richard Davies and Andrew Bud.  They secured funding from the Engineering Department which agreed to supply materials and printing services.&lt;ref name="Matters that Matter"/&gt;  The first edition ran to 52 pages, and 500 copies were distributed free throughout the University immediately after the Union Society debate.&lt;ref name="Matters that Matter"/&gt;  Thanks to the support of one of the Department's professors, Sir [[William Hawthorne]], an expert in energy conservation, the magazine carried an introduction specially provided by HRH the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] (see image).

The magazine was well received and a team of volunteer student journalists created the second edition, published in April 1981, catalogued as {{ISSN|0260-809X}}.&lt;ref name="Issue 2"&gt;''Energy Matters'' Issue no.2, Lent/Easter 1981, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;  This ran to 100 pages, and the printing of 1000 copies entirely blocked the Engineering Department's reprographic department for three weeks, driving the in-house printer to the edge of despair. Regretfully, the Department withdrew its logistical support.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cinderella Syndrome", ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.2 Lent/Easter 1981 p.4, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, commercial sponsorship was sought and successfully raised from the energy industry.  Funding came from the oil industry, the electricity and nuclear sectors and several University departments,&lt;ref name="Acknowledgments"&gt;"Acknowledgements", ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.3 Michaelmas 1981 p.2, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine was commercially printed. Under new editors Helen Field and Anne Pudsey-Dawson, the third edition appeared in November 1981.&lt;ref name="Acknowledgments"/&gt;

Although interest in the magazine amongst students beyond the science and engineering faculties was limited, it attracted considerable attention in Whitehall and within the industry.  Dozens of copies were requested by these institutions.  As a result, the magazine's editors were able to secure interviews with [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet ministers]] &lt;ref&gt;"On the Energy Tightrope: an interview with Secretary of State David Howell" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.2 Lent/Easter 1981 p.56, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Merlyn Rees on Energy" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.31, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt; and heads of the nationalised energy industries and trades unions.&lt;ref&gt;"King Arthur : an interview with Arthur Scargill" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.5, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Decisions, Decisions: An interview with Glyn England, Chairman of the CEGB" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.6 Easter 1983 p.41, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;  As a spin-off, a number of branded seminars were organised at the University, featuring leaders of the energy industry.&lt;ref&gt;"Can Big be Beautiful: a report on an Energy Matters Seminar" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.19, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's editorial line was rigorously neutral, and substantial space was given to the thoughts of leading anti-nuclear campaigners, proponents of conservation and evangelists of [[combined heat and power]].&lt;ref name="Issue 2"/&gt;

By 1984, the magazine's editor Roger Tredre merged it with the activities of the Cambridge student magazine [[Cantab (magazine)|Cantab]], and its main function became to generate advertising revenue to cross-subsidise Cantab.&lt;ref name="Cantab"&gt;[[Cantab (magazine)|Cantab references to Energy Matters]]&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased publication after its seventh edition in summer 1984, its final editors being [[Richard Penty]] (now Professor of [[Photonics]] at [[the University of Cambridge]]) and John Crowther.&lt;ref name="Cantab"/&gt;

Amongst those who worked on the magazine a number subsequently became influential in the fields of journalism or energy policy. The 1983 edition was edited by Vanessa Houlder (currently a leading business journalist on the [[Financial Times]] of London), and included contributions from Mike Grubb (now a senior academic working for the [[Carbon Trust]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Contents" ''Energy Matters'' Issue no.6 Easter 1983 p.1, Cambridge University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eugene Green Energy Standard''' was an [[international standard]] to which national or international [[green electricity]] [[label]]ling schemes could be [[product certification|accredited]] to confirm that they provide genuine environmental benefits. It was designed to encourage the generation and use of additional [[renewable energy]] sources for [[electricity generation]], although the limited use of additional [[natural gas]]-fired [[cogeneration]] plant was also supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/mdb/docs/10_Eugenestandard.pdf Eugene Standard - Technical Document], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially funded in part through the EU's clean-e programme, but also including some participants from outside Europe, the Eugene standard was formally discontinued after February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok-power.de/downloads/EUGENE_dismantling_2009-02-02.pdf Eugene Standard - Letter from Board about dismantling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070628/http://www.ok-power.de/downloads/EUGENE_dismantling_2009-02-02.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, ''Eugene'', accessed 2010-02-26&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dismantling==
On 2 February 2009, EUGENE’s General Assembly voted in favour of its dismantling. It was agreed that the members and board would continue to work together to promote green energy in Europe, but that the EUGENE standard and the association (ASBL) under Belgian law would cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok-power.de/downloads/EUGENE_dismantling_2009-02-02.pdf Eugene Standard - Letter from Board about dismantling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070628/http://www.ok-power.de/downloads/EUGENE_dismantling_2009-02-02.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, ''Eugene'', accessed 2010-02-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==The standard==
The standard confirmed that energy supplied under the accredited schemes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;id=19 Vision], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is produced from genuinely sustainable energy sources.
*Will result in a real increase in renewable generation beyond the requirements imposed by government ('additionality').
*That the demand from consumers is matched by renewable generation.

Two variations of the standard, 'gold' and 'silver', differentiated between schemes depending on the additionality of new renewable energy supplied. The development of the standard was aided by the [[European Union]]'s  CLEAN-E initiative during 2005 and 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;id=62 CLEAN-E project has supported Eugene], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/projects/altener_en.htm Intelligent Energy Europe], ''[[European Commission]]'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accredited energy labels==
National energy labels formerly accredited by EUGENE included:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;id=32 Certify your product], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation also recommends certain other national schemes that are progressing towards accreditation, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenpowergroup.org/pdf/euge_6.pdf The Eugene Standard], ''WWF European Climate Change &amp; Energy Unit'', published 2006-05-31, accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no Eugene accredited scheme in the [[United Kingdom]].  The UK's energy regulator ([[Ofgem]]) published guidelines in February 2009 that broadly followed the EUGENE standard, requiring matching and additionality through carbon savings, although allowing the latter to be met through energy efficiency or offsetting, as well as through new renewables schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/Policy/Documents1/Green%20supply%20guidelines%20final%20proposals%20open%20letter.pdf Final Green Supply Guidelines] ''Ofgem'', accessed 2010-02-26&lt;/ref&gt;  These were implemented in February 2010 in the UK's [http://www.greenenergyscheme.org/ Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme].

The Eugene Standard had also been adopted in [[Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/?inc=news&amp;id=45 Eugene Standard adopted in Chile], ''Eugene'', published 2004, accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt; while a pilot scheme is in progress in [[France]].

==The Eugene Network==
The standard was managed by the Eugene Network (formerly the '''Eu'''ropean '''G'''reen '''E'''lectricity '''Ne'''twork), an international membership-based [[non-profit organization]]. The Network aimed to coordinate and harmonise [[green energy]] labelling nationally and internationally, promote the adoption of the Eugene Standard as the basis for national and international green [[energy market]]s, and encourage consumers and suppliers to choose credible [[green energy]] products. Formal discussions on the Eugene standard first took place in 2000, led by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], and it was officially launched on June 24, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=5671 WWF launches European green energy standard], ''Edie'', published 2002-06-26, accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt; The Eugene Network was legally established in 2003 and the first national energy labels were accredited in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;id=25 History], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Full voting membership of the Network was open to 'citizen organisations pursuing not for profit activities with the objectives of promoting green electricity but with no direct interests in the generation and supply of energy services'. Organisations outside this scope but which do 'have a commitment and interest in creating a viable [[green energy]] market' were able to become non-voting associate members or supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;id=22 Membership], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2007, the members of the Eugene Network were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/index.cfm?inc=art&amp;id=17 List of members], ''Eugene'', accessed 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] placed an oil embargo on nations perceived as assisting Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKie|first=James|date=1975|title=The United States|jstor=20024363|journal=Daedalus|volume=104|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the embargo, [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] established the Federal Energy Office (FEO) in December 1973, which was tasked with coordinating the American response to the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=106773|title=Richard Nixon: Executive Order 11748—Federal Energy Office|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1974, the FEO was superseded by the FEA under the ''Federal Energy Administration Act'' of 1974 and {{Executive Order|11790}}. The FEA was tasked with managing fuel allocation, pricing regulation, and energy data collection and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4199|title=Richard Nixon: Statement About the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA) was created by the [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] and managed the energy [[research and development]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, and [[naval reactors]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/ERDA%20History.pdf|title=A History of the Energy Research and Development Administration|last=Buck|first=Alice|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1975, [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] directed the FEA to change petroleum pricing regulations such that [[crude oil]] prices would rise gradually. Additionally, subject to congressional review, the FEA could now remove refined petroleum products from pricing controls. By June 1967, [[fuel oil]], middle distillates, [[naphtha]], and gas oils were no longer under pricing controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/FEA%20History.pdf|title=The Federal Energy Administration|last=Anders|first=Roger|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Energy Administration Act created the first U.S. agency with the primary focus on energy and mandated it to collect, assemble, evaluate, and analyze energy information. It also provided FEA with data collection enforcement authority for gathering data from energy producing and major consuming firms. Section 52 of the FEA Act mandated establishment of the National Energy Information System to "contain such energy information as is necessary to carry out the Administration’s statistical and forecasting activities."

The [[Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977]] created the [[United States Department of Energy]] (USDOE), which merged ERDA and FEA under USDOE. It also created the [[Energy Information Administration]] as the primary Federal Government authority on energy statistics and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ppotpus/4732130.1977.002?view=toc|title=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Jimmy Carter- 1977 Book II|last=Carter|first=Jimmy|publisher=University of Michigan Library|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=1584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy, Announcement No. 1, September 28, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fornello inv.3916 IF 77656.jpg|thumb|300px|Furnace in fire clay.]]
'''Fire clay''' is a range of [[refractory]] [[clay]]s used in the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s, especially [[fire brick]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines fire clay very generally as a "mineral aggregate composed of hydrous silicates of aluminium (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·2SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with or without free silica."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document| title=Calciners and Dryers in Mineral Industries | type=Background Information for Proposed Standards | id=EPA-450/3-85-025a | publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | year=1985 | pages=3–48| postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
High-grade fire clays can withstand temperatures of 1,775&amp;nbsp;°C (3,227&amp;nbsp;°F), but to be referred to as a "fire clay" the material must withstand a minimum temperature of {{convert|1515|°C|F}}.&lt;ref name=MZ&gt;[http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/fire-clay.html Minerals Zone, World Mineral Exchange.] Retrieved 2011-6-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire clays range from ''[[flint clay]]s'' to ''plastic fire clays'', but there are ''semi-flint'' and ''semi-plastic'' fire clays as well. Fire clays consist of natural [[argillaceous]] materials, mostly [[Kaolinite]] group clays, along with fine-grained [[micas]] and [[quartz]], and may also contain [[organic compound|organic]] matter and [[sulphur]] compounds.

Fire clay is resistant to high temperatures, having [[fusion point]]s higher than {{convert|1,600|°C|F}}; therefore it is suitable for lining [[furnace]]s, as fire brick, and for manufacture of utensils used in the [[metalworking]] industries, such as [[crucible]]s, [[saggar]]s, [[retort]]s and [[glassware]]. Because of its stability during firing in the [[kiln]], it can be used to make complex items of pottery such as pipes and sanitary ware.

==Chemical composition==
The chemical composition typical for fire clays are 23-34% [[aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 50-60% [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 6-27% [[loss on ignition]] together with various amounts of [[iron(III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Calcium oxide|CaO]], [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]], [[Potassium oxide|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[Sodium oxide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] and [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=MZ /&gt; Chemical analyses from two 19th-century sources, shown in table below, are somewhat lower in alumina&lt;ref name="Thorpe1"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''Friction modifiers''' are added to [[lubricants]] in order to reduce [[friction]] and [[wear]] in machine components. They are particularly important in the boundary [[lubrication]] regime, where they can prevent solid surfaces from coming into direct contact, substantially reducing [[friction]] and [[wear]].

Several classes of friction modifier additives exist, the main examples being organic friction modifiers (OFMs), oil-soluble organo-[[molybdenum]] additives, functionalized [[Polymer|polymers]], and dispersed [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spikes|first=Hugh|date=2015-10-01|title=Friction Modifier Additives|journal=Tribology Letters|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1007/s11249-015-0589-z|issn=1023-8883|hdl=10044/1/25879}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Gérard Mestrallet''' (born 1 April 1949 in) is the chairman of the board of directors of [[Engie]] and former CEO (from July 2008 to May 2016).&lt;ref name="Engie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pr-engie-ag-2016.pdf |title=Engie press release |publisher=Engie.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the chairman of [[Suez Environnement|Suez]].&lt;ref name="gdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdfsuez.com/en/group/governance/board-of-directors/biographies/biographies#mestrallet |title=GDF board biography |publisher=Gdfsuez.com |date= |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He received degrees from [[Institut d'études politiques de Toulouse|Sciences Po Toulouse]], the [[Ecole polytechnique]], [[École nationale de l'aviation civile]] and the [[École nationale d'administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=4773588&amp;ticker=GSZ:FP |title=List of Public Companies Worldwide, Letter - Businessweek - Businessweek |publisher=[[Investing.businessweek.com]] |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his studies, he joined the Treasury. From September 1982 and July 1984 he was the technical advisor in charge of industrial affairs under the Minister of Economics and Finance (during the time of Jacques Delors)

In 1984, he started working as a special advisor for Suez, known today just as Suez.&lt;ref name="Gerard Mestrallet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerard-mestrallet.dirigeants-entreprise.com/gdf-suez/gerard-mestrallet/ |title=Gerard Mestrallet|publisher=DIRIGEANTS ENTREPRISE|date=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been its Chairman and CEO since 2001.He was named Deputy Delegate General for Industrial Affairs in June 1986. In July 1987, he was General Director of the European Court of Human Rights, an affiliate of the Compagnie financière de Suez. In January 1991 he started as the Deputy Director General of the company, but a month later he became the Managing Director and Chairman of the Management Committee of the Société General de Belgique, to ensure its refocusing and development.

He was appointed as a member of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Chief Executive's Council of International Advisers]] in the years of 1998-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200311/06/1106201.htm |title=Hong Kong |publisher=Info.gov.hk |date=2003-11-06 |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the President of {{Interlanguage link multi|Paris Europlace|fr}}. He is also the President of the [[Fondation Agir Contre l'Exclusion]] (FACE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondationface.org/faceframe/face-presentation-compositionbureau.php |title=FACE leadership |publisher=Fondationface.org |date= |accessdate=12 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202091632/http://www.fondationface.org/faceframe/face-presentation-compositionbureau.php |archivedate=2 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 he took a position as the head of Suez and since then he has worked for Suez while focusing on three businesses: energy, water, and waste &lt;ref name="edubourse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edubourse.com/guide/biographies.php?bio=gerard-mestrallet |title=Gerard Mestrallet|publisher=Fondationface.org |date=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the instigator of the reconciliation between Suez and the Lyonnaise des Eaux. The Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux was started in 1997, at which time Mestrallet became the chairman of its executive board while Jérôme Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise, became the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref name="Gerard Mestrallet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edubourse.com"/&gt; However, the group soon went back to its original name, Suez and in 2003 its leaders made a proposition to shareholders to change the association of the company by becoming an LP with a board of directors and Gerard Mestrallet as the CEO.&lt;ref name="Gerard Mestrallet"/&gt;

in July 2008, he was appointed CEO of [[Engie]].

In 2014, his retirement cap of 21 million euros was a controversy in the media due to GDF-Suez’s record losses for 2013 and its effort to prepare a savings plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2014/10/23/20005-20141023ARTFIG00310-polemique-autour-de-la-retraite-chapeau-du-pdg-de-gdf-suez.php|title=Polémique autour de la retraite-chapeau du PDG de GDF Suez|publisher=Le Figaro|date=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2016, he became chairman of the board of directors of the group, with [[Isabelle Kocher]] appointed as CEO, as planned for months&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/isabelle-kocher-to-head-engie-1452763955 Isabelle Kocher to Head Engie], Inti Laundauro, Wall Street Journal. Retrieved January 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ion wind''', '''ionic wind''', '''coronal wind''' or '''electric wind''' is the airflow induced by electrostatic forces linked to [[corona discharge]] arising at the tips of some sharp conductors (such as points or blades) subjected to high voltage relative to ground. Ion wind is an [[electrohydrodynamics|electrohydrodynamic]] phenomenon. Ion wind generators can also be considered [[electrohydrodynamic thruster]]s.

The term “ionic wind” is considered a [[misnomer]] due to misconceptions that only positive and negative ions were primarily involved in the phenomenon. A 2018 study found that electrons play a larger role than the negative ions during the negative voltage period. As a result, the term “electric wind” has been suggested as a more accurate terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-ionic.html|title=What causes ionic wind?|last=Zyga|first=Lisa|date=February 7, 2018|work=Phys.org|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon is now used in an [[MIT ionic wind plane]], the first solid state plane, developed in 2018.

In 2018, researchers from South Korea and Slovenia used [[Schlieren photography]] to experimentally determine that electrons, in addition to ions, play an important role in generating ionic wind. The study was the first to provide direct evidence that the [[Electrohydrodynamics|electrohydrodynamic]] force responsible for the ionic wind is caused by a charged particle drag that occur as the electrons and ions push the neutral particles away.

In 2018, a team of [[MIT]] researchers built and successfully flew the first-ever prototype plane propelled by ionic wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2018/first-ionic-wind-plane-no-moving-parts-1121|title=MIT engineers fly first-ever plane with no moving parts|last=Chu|first=Jennifer|date=November 21, 2018|work=MIT News|access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
Net electric charges on conductors, including local charge distributions associated with dipoles, reside entirely on their external surface (see [[Faraday cage]]), and tend to concentrate more around sharp points and edges than on flat surfaces. This means that the [[electric field]] generated by charges on a sharp [[conductive]] point is much stronger than the field generated by the same charge residing on a large smooth spherical conductive shell. When this [[electric field strength]] exceeds what is known as the corona discharge inception voltage (CIV) gradient, it ionizes the air about the tip, and a small faint purple jet of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] can be seen in the dark on the conductive tip. Ionization of the nearby air molecules result in generation of [[ionization|ionized]] air molecules having the same polarity as that of the charged tip. Subsequently, the tip repels the like-charged ion cloud, and the ion cloud immediately expands due to the repulsion between the ions themselves. This repulsion of ions creates an electric "wind" that emanates from the tip, which is usually accompanied by a hissing noise due to the change in air pressure at the tip. An opposite force acts on the tip that may recoil if not tight to ground.

A [[vaneless ion wind generator]] performs the inverse function, using ambient wind to move ions, which are collected yielding electrical energy.

'''Joseph Barker Stearns''' was the [[inventor]] of the [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] system of [[telegraph]]y.

==Biography==
Stearns was the son of Edward Ray and Eliza Tyler Barker Stearns of [[Weld, Maine]]. As a youth, he worked on a farm.  He studied telegraphy at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],  where he became manager of the office. From 1855 to 1869, he was superintendent of the Fire Alarm Telegraph Company of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and was the first to take out patents on the use of reversed currents in connection with the [[fire alarm]] signal system.

He was president of Franklin Telegraph Co., from 1869 to 1871, during which time he invented the first practical system of duplex telegraphy which was successfully applied to the English, French and Belgian lines. Two years later this system was used for the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] cables. He sold rights under his duplex patents to the Western Union Telegraph and Cable Companies, receiving large royalties for the use of his inventions from governments in [[England]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[Russia]] and [[India]], and several [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]] companies. From 1879 to 1880, he was employed as engineer by the Mexican Telegraph Company in making, laying, and putting into operation the cables of that company between [[Galveston, Texas]], and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. In 1881, he performed a similar service for the Central and South American Telegraph Company, whose cables extended from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mexico to [[Callao]], [[Peru]], in all between 4,000 and 5,000 miles. This work he completed in 1882.

He retired from active business in 1885 and settled in [[Camden, Maine]]. There he had a library of 10,000 volumes, and a collection of [[Chiriquí Province]] pottery, which was exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He also had a collection of carved [[ivory|ivories]] which was exhibited at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].  He died in Camden.

==Family==
He had eight children. He got married on January 8, 1853, to Lois M. Brooks of [[Putney, Vermont]] (born June 4, 1827; died July 29, 1861, in South Boston), then married Frances Amanda Edmonds of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] (born January 16, 1838) on June 6, 1866.

==Honors==
In 1872, the [[American Institute of the City of New York|American Institute]] of New York awarded him the Great Medal of Honor for the invention of the duplex telegraph.

[[File:'69 Fiat 850 Coupe, example of Kammback.jpg|thumb|Kammback on a 1969 Fiat 850 Coupe]]

A '''Kammback''' — also known as "Kamm tail" or "K-tail" — is an [[:Category:Automotive styling features|automotive styling feature]] where the rear of the car slopes downwards before being abruptly cut off with a vertical surface. The purpose of a Kammback is to minimise aerodynamic drag while maintaining a practical shape for a vehicle. The Kammback is named after German aerodynamicist [[Wunibald Kamm]] for his work developing the design in the 1930s.

The Kammback was originally used on sports cars and racing cars to improve performance at high speeds, and has been more recently used by hybrid vehicles to reduce fuel consumption.

== Origins ==

As the speed of cars increased during the 1920s and 1930s, designers began to pay more attention to [[automotive aerodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hucho |first=Wolf-Heinrich |title=Aerodynamics of Road Vehicles: from fluid mechanics to vehicle engineering |publisher=[[Butterworths]] |year=1987 |pages=19–20 |isbn=978-0-408-01422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[Paul Jaray]] patented a car based on a tear-drop profile (i.e. a rounded nose and long tapering tail) to minimise the [[aerodynamic drag]] created at higher speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coachbuilt.com/des/j/jaray/jaray.htm |title=Paul Jaray 1889-1974 |publisher=Coachbuilt.com |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziemnowicz"&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Ziemnowicz |year=2004 |url=http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/80-AMXitems/Information/production/KammbackStory.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120415182304/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/80-AMXitems/Information/production/KammbackStory.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 |title=The Origin of the Kammback Design |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Streamliner#Production vehicles|streamliner]] vehicles of the mid 1930s — such as the [[Tatra 77]], [[Chrysler Airflow]] and [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] — were designed according to this philosophy.

However, the long tail was not a practical shape for a car, so automotive designers were looking for other solutions. In 1935, the German aircraft designer [[Georg Hans Madelung]] showed alternatives to minimise drag without a long tail.&lt;ref name="gowns"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowans |first=Alan |title=Learning To See: Historical perspective on modern popular/commercial arts |publisher=Popular Press 1 |year=1981 |page=360 |isbn=978-0-87972-182-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, a similar theory was applied to cars, when Baron Reinhard Koenig-Fachsenfeld developed a smooth roofline but with an abrupt end at a vertical surface, which was effective in achieving low amounts of drag similar to a fully streamlined body.&lt;ref name="Ziemnowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eckermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eckermann |first=Erik |last2=Albrecht | first2=Peter L. |title=World History of the Automobile |publisher=SAE International |year=2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Kammback |pages=115–117 |isbn=978-0-7680-0800-5 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ludvigsen |first=Karl  |title=Automobile Aerodynamics: Form and Fashion |journal=[[Automobile Quarterly]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked on an aerodynamic design for a bus, and Koenig-Fachsenfeld patented the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2007/0808/1186424868676.html |last=Montgomery |first=Bob |title=Designing a spin for the tail end of things |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2011 |format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig-Fachsenfeld began working under [[Wunibald Kamm]] at Stuttgart University, investigating vehicle shapes that would "provide a good compromise between everyday utility (e.g. vehicle length and interior dimensions) and an attractive drag coefficient".&lt;ref name="Ziemnowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eckermann"/&gt; In addition to aerodynamic efficiency, Wunibald Kamm also emphasized vehicle stability in his design.&lt;ref name="eckermann"/&gt; He proved mathematically and empirically the effectiveness of the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bush |first=Donald J. |title=The streamlined decade |publisher=George Braziller |year=1975 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-8076-0793-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1938 Kamm produced the first prototype to use a Kammback, based on a [[BMW 328]].&lt;ref name="popular mechanics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor |first=Rich |title=Searching for the Perfect .10 |journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] |page=158 |date=September 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Kamm+tail+design |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kammback, along with other aerodynamic modifications, gave the prototype a drag coefficient of 0.25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2004/041203mcd-history3/ |last=Ihrig |first=Ron |title=Part 3: Production, Physics, Politics - Only the Strong Survive - German Design History |journal=[[Car Design News]] |date=3 December 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722035745/http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2004/041203mcd-history3/ |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mass-produced cars that used Kammback principles were the 1949–1951 [[Nash Motors#Introduction of the Nash Airflyte|Nash Airflyte]] in the U.S. and the 1952–1955 [[Borgward Hansa 2400]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="eckermann"/&gt;

== Aerodynamic theory ==
The ideal shape to minimize drag is a teardrop. However researchers including Kamm found that abruptly cutting off the tail resulted in minimal increase in drag.&lt;ref name="Ziemnowicz"/&gt; The reason for this is that a turbulent [[wake#Wake effects caused by viscosity|wake region]] forms behind the vertical surface at the rear of the car. This wake region mimics the effect of the tapered tail in that air in the free stream does not enter this region (avoiding [[Flow separation|boundary layer separation]]), therefore smooth airflow is maintained which minimises drag.&lt;ref name="popular mechanics"/&gt;

Kamm's design is based on the tail being truncated at the point where the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] area is 50% of the car's maximum cross section,&lt;ref name="Ziemnowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://autorepair.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-513.htm |title=Kamm Back |publisher=Auto Repair About |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Kamm found represented a good compromise—by that point the turbulence typical of flat-back vehicles had been mostly eliminated at typical speeds.

== Usage ==
[[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right| 1964-1969 [[Ford GT40]] ]]
[[File:Citroen CX rear.jpg|thumb|1974-1985 [[Citroën CX]] ]]

[[File:2009 Toyota Prius (ZVW30R) liftback (2011-12-06) 02.jpg|thumb|right| 2009-2015 [[Toyota Prius]] ]]

Initially, the Kamm tail was used on sportscars and racing cars. The design had a resurgence in the early 2000s as a method to reduce fuel consumption in [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s.

Several cars have been marketed as Kammbacks, despite the profile not adhering to aerodynamic philosophy of a Kammback. These models include the 1971–1977 [[Chevrolet Vega]] Kammback wagon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FGU5qHJY-y4C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Vega+Kammback+wagon |page=221 |last=Stevenson |first=eon |title=American automobile advertising, 1930-1980: an illustrated history |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |year=2008 |isbn= 9780786452316 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1981–1982 [[AMC Eagle]] Kammback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://amceaglesden.com/history1981/ |title=History of the 1981 AMC Eagle |publisher=AMC Eagle Den |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/03/10/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-1981-1982-amc-eagle-series-50-kammback/ |title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – 1981-1982 AMC Eagle Series 50 Kammback |first=Kurt |last=Ernst |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |last2=Miller |first2=Moss |title=Driving the new AMC Eagles |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=September 1980 |volume=154 |issue=4 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FGU5qHJY-y4C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Vega+Kammback+wagon |page=221 |last=Stevenson |first=eon |title=American automobile advertising, 1930-1980: an illustrated history |publisher=McFarland |year=2008 |isbn= 9780786452316 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[AMC AMX-GT]] and the [[Pontiac Firebird]]–based "Type K" concept cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FUhWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=AMX-GT+kamm |page=99 |title=Kamm Tail AMX |journal=[[Car and Driver]] |volume=14 |year=1968 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&amp;pg=PA1965&amp;dq=1968+AMC+AMX+GT+show+car |page=23 |title=AMC Muscle Cars |first=Larry G. |last=Mitchell |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2000 |isbn=9780760307618 |quote=...with a chopped-off rear end that was known as a Kamm-back. |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-camaro-and-pontiac-firebird-concept-cars1.htm |author=Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird Concept Cars |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://autos.yahoo.com/news/pontiac-kammback-innovation-vs-convention-193019846.html;_ylt=A0LEV1IOLoNTqXUAPzRXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBybnV2cXQwBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkAw– |publisher=Boldride |first=Bill |last=Wilson |title=The Pontiac Kammback: Innovation vs. Convention |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pontiac Trans Am Greats: We Shall Never Pass This Way Again |first=Matt |last=Stone |date=August 2009 |journal=[[Motor Trend]] |url= http://www.motortrend.com/features/archive/112_0910_pontiac_trans_am_greats/#ixzz32p7C1Jv5 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">'''Land for Wildlife''' is a program sponsored by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Department of Sustainability and Environment]] in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It was established in November 1981 to support private landholders and managers who voluntarily provide and enhance habitat for native wildlife on their properties within the state.  Many non-landholder volunteers also participate in the scheme, which is coordinated by departmental extension officers.  By doing so they are contributing to the maintenance and restoration of native [[biodiversity]].  The scheme was largely instigated by [[Ellen McCulloch]] and [[Reg Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Anon (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; two prominent members of the community group [[Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia]] (then the Bird Observers Club - now merged with [[BirdLife Australia]]), with which it continues to have a cooperative relationship.&lt;ref name=lfw&gt;Land for Wildlife.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits of full registration of a property in the scheme include on-site visits to provide advice and answer questions about how to manage the land to contribute to biodiversity conservation, participation in field and neighbourhood days, open-properties and information sessions, a regular newsletter, specialist information and a Land for Wildlife sign.  It does not alter the legal status of a property in any way and landholders may withdraw from the scheme at any time.&lt;ref name=lfw/&gt;

As of 2012 there were over 5,700 participating properties, with about 15,000 people involved in the program.  The area of wildlife habitat being managed on the properties totals more than 560,000 hectares (4% of private land in Victoria), and includes [[grassland]]s, [[heath]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[forest]]s and [[freshwater]] [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref name=lfw/&gt;

The Victorian Land For Wildlife program allows interstate agencies (government and non-government) to deliver the scheme under an agreement in which the original aims and objectives are maintained.

'''''Erika''''' was the name of a [[oil|tanker]] built in 1975 and last chartered by [[Total S.A.|Total-Fina-Elf]]. It sank off the coast of [[France]] in 1999, causing a major environmental disaster.

== Background ==

Erika was one of eight sister ships built in [[Japan]]. Despite having 10% less steel than many other tankers of similar size, Erika was very popular amongst shipping companies because of its relative inexpensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/correspondent/883110.stm | work=BBC News | title=The scandal of the Erika | date=August 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sinking ==

On December 8, 1999, she sailed out of [[Dunkerque]], bound for [[Livorno]] and with a cargo of around 31,000 tons of [[heavy fuel oil]].

As she entered the [[Bay of Biscay]], the Erika ran into a heavy storm. On December 12, 1999, she broke in two and sank, releasing thousands of tons of oil into the sea, killing marine life and polluting shores around [[Brittany]], [[France]].

According to the official inquiry by the Dunkerque Tribunal, the Principal Shareholder of Tevere Shipping is Giuseppe Savarese, owner of the Erika since 1996. Savarese lives in London and was personally responsible for finance, administration, legal, commercial, hull and machinery insurance and P&amp;I insurance matters.

The Erika's technical and maritime management company was Panship, a Ravenna-based corporation incorporated in 1997. The Pollara and Vitiello families each own 50 percent. The company did not employ a specialist in naval architecture or vessel strength which is typical for such companies. With regards to maintenance, Panship defined the scope and nature of maintenance work in addition to creating and evaluating calls for bids for such work. All decisions were submitted to Giuseppe Savarese. Erika's was registered under a Maltese flag.The Classification Society for classed the Erika was RINA or the Foundation Registro Italiano Navale ed Aeronautica, based in Genoa. Malta like most Flag States delegates compliance with International Safety Management Code of International Maritime Organization to Classification Societies such as RINA. RINA issued all safety certificates for the Erika.

List of Certificates issued for the Erika by RINA:

*International Load Line Certificate - Dated December 16, 1998 valid until August 31, 2003
*Safety Construction Certificate - Dated December 16, 1998 valid until August 31, 2003
*International Pollution Certificate - Dated December 16, 1998 valid until August 31, 2003
*Safety Equipment Certificate - Dated December 16, 1998 valid until August 14, 2000
*Radio Certificate - Dated November 23, 1999 valid until March 31, 2000

Total said that the classification society, [[Registro Italiano Navale]] had reported that the tanker was in good condition, and that it routinely requires certificates of good condition for vessels more than 20 years old.

The accident triggered new EU-legislation as regard to transport by sea.

On January 16, 2008, Total SA, Giuseppe Savarese (the shipowner), Antonio Pollara (the handler) and RINA (the expert company) were sentenced in solidum to pay indemnities of €192 million ($280 million USD), plus individual  penalties. The judgement, while recognizing the risks inherent to oceangoing vessels, reckons Total SA was "guilty of imprudence", from the fact that Total SA did not take into account "the age of the ship", (nearly 25 years), and "the discontinuity of its technical handling and maintenance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/info/energie/300233996.htm {{fr}} Erika : amende maximale pour les coupables, dont Total]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, Total SA lost their appeal to overturn the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english.rfi.fr/environment/20100330-total-loses-erika-oil-spill-appeal&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''magic number''' is a term in [[economics]] that denotes the price of [[crude oil]] (measured in dollars per [[barrel]]) at which a crude oil exporting economy runs a deficit.

Some countries support almost all spending from income derived from oil exports. As the price of oil drops, these countries take in less [[revenue]] from oil. The magic number denotes the point at which the revenue from oil is no longer sufficient to pay for spending. Mathematically, this can be expressed by the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Q \times P &gt; S&lt;/math&gt;

where Q is the quantity of oil exported, P is the price, and S is spending. The magic number is the value of P at which this inequality no longer holds true - that is, that the economy runs a deficit. 

PFC Energy publishes the magic number for all the [[OPEC]] nations. 

"[[Qatar]] is at $21 a barrel, because it brings in much more oil money than it spends. [[Saudi Arabia]]'s break-even point is at $49 a barrel. And [[Venezuela]] is at $58, second only to [[Nigeria]]'s $65."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/30/venezuela_magic_number Chavez puts Venezuela's future on oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520011400/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/30/venezuela_magic_number |date=2011-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

She was born in South Africa, in Pretoria. She became an [[NGO]] worker in community-based natural resource management, in [[Namibia]]. Since 1983, in the northeast of Namibia, with Garth Owen-Smith, they have been fighting against endemic illegal hunting, which has decimated species such as black rhinos and desert elephants, and for the economic and social development of local populations. Through their actions, poaching is better controlled. Game guards are designated by the rural community. Other natural resources, such as palm trees, thatch grass, plant dyes and water lilies, are monitored.&lt;ref name=AfricaPens&gt;{{cite book |title =African Pens 2011 : New Writing from Southern Afric | last1= Coetzee |first1=J.

They are one of the few African groups that use red ochre, as a full-body make-up called [[otjize]]. The Himba originally belonged to the group of the [[Herero people|Herero]].

In [[physics]] (in particular in [[statistical mechanics]]), the '''Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution''' is a particular [[probability distribution]] named after [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. 

It was first defined and used for describing particle [[speed]]s in [[ideal gas|idealized gases]], where the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, except for very brief [[collision]]s in which they exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment. 
The term "particle" in this context refers to gaseous particles only ([[atoms]] or [[molecules]]), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="StatisticalPhysics"&gt;''Statistical Physics'' (2nd Edition), F. Mandl, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{isbn|9780471915331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The energies of such particles follow what is known as  [[Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics]], and the statistical distribution of speeds is derived by equating particle energies with [[kinetic energy]].

Mathematically, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is the [[chi distribution]] with three [[degrees of freedom]] (the components of the [[velocity]] vector in [[Euclidean space]]), with a [[scale parameter]] measuring speeds in units proportional to the square root of &lt;math&gt;T/m&lt;/math&gt; (the ratio of temperature and particle mass).&lt;ref&gt;University Physics – With Modern Physics (12th Edition), H.D. Young, R.A. Freedman (Original edition), Addison-Wesley (Pearson International), 1st Edition: 1949, 12th Edition: 2008, {{isbn|978-0-321-50130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a result of the [[kinetic theory of gases]], which provides a simplified explanation of many fundamental gaseous properties, including [[pressure]] and [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, {{isbn|3-527-26954-1}} (Verlagsgesellschaft), {{isbn|0-89573-752-3}} (VHC Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies fundamentally to particle velocities in three dimensions, but turns out to depend only on the speed (the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the velocity) of the particles. 
A particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another.
The kinetic theory of gases applies to the classical [[ideal gas]], which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., [[van der Waals interaction]]s, [[vortex|vortical flow]], [[special relativity|relativistic]] speed limits, and [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[exchange interaction]]s) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell–Boltzmann form. 
However, [[rarefied]] gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. 
Ideal [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], which are ionized gases of sufficiently low density, frequently also have particle distributions that are partially or entirely Maxwellian.&lt;ref&gt; N.A. Krall and A.W. Trivelpiece, Principles of Plasma Physics, San Francisco Press, Inc., 1986, among many other texts on basic plasma physics &lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;See:
*  Maxwell, J.C. (1860 A): ''Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part I. On the motions and collisions of perfectly elastic spheres.  The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', 4th Series, vol.19, pp.19-32. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53795#page/33/mode/1up]

Boltzmann later, in the 1870s, carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution.

== Distribution function ==
Assuming the system of interest contains a large number of particles, the fraction of the particles within an infinitesimal element of three-dimensional velocity space, &lt;math&gt;d^3v&lt;/math&gt;, centered on a velocity vector of magnitude &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;f(v) d^3v&lt;/math&gt;, in which 

:&lt;math&gt; f(v) ~\mathrm{d}^3v = \left(\frac{m}{2 \pi kT}\right)^{3/2}\,  e^{- \frac{m|v|^2}{2kT}} ~\mathrm{d}^3v, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the particle mass and &lt;math&gt;kT&lt;/math&gt; is the product of [[Boltzmann's constant]] and [[thermodynamic temperature]].

[[Image:MaxwellBoltzmann-en.svg|right|thumb|340px|The speed probability density functions of the speeds of a few [[noble gas]]es at a temperature of 298.15&amp;nbsp;K (25&amp;nbsp;°C). The ''y''-axis is in s/m so that the area under any section of the curve (which represents the probability of the speed being in that range) is dimensionless.]]
One can write the element of velocity space as d&lt;math&gt;^3v&lt;/math&gt; = d&lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;d&lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;d&lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;, for velocities in a standard Cartesian coordinate system, or as d&lt;math&gt;^3v&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt;d&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;d&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; in a standard spherical coordinate system, where d&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an element of solid angle. Here &lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt; is given as a probability distribution function, properly normalized so that &lt;math&gt;\int f(v)&lt;/math&gt;d&lt;math&gt;^3v&lt;/math&gt; over all velocities equals one.  In plasma physics, the probability distribution is often multipled by the particle density, so that the integral of the resulting distribution function equals the density. 

Undergraduate students are likely to work with the Maxwellian distribution function for particles moving in only one direction. If this direction is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then one has 
:&lt;math&gt; f(v_x) ~\mathrm{d}v_x = \left(\frac{m}{2 \pi kT}\right)^{1/2}\,  e^{- \frac{mv_x^2}{2kT}} ~\mathrm{d}v_x, &lt;/math&gt; 
which can be obtained by integrating the three-dimensional form given above over &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;.

Recognizing the symmetry of &lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt;, one can integrate over solid angle and write a probability distribution of speeds as the function&lt;ref&gt;[[Harald J. W. Mueller-Kirsten|H.J.W. Müller-Kirsten]] (2013), ''Basics of Statistical Physics'', 2nd ed., [[World Scientific]], {{isbn|978-981-4449-53-3}}, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f(v) ~\mathrm{d}v= \left(\frac{m}{2 \pi kT}\right)^{3/2}\, 4\pi v^2 e^{- \frac{mv^2}{2kT}} ~\mathrm{d}v, &lt;/math&gt;

This [[probability density function]] gives the probability, per unit speed, of finding the particle with a speed near &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This equation is simply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (given in the infobox) with distribution parameter &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{kT/m}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is equivalent to the [[chi distribution]] with three degrees of freedom and [[scale parameter]] &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{kT/m}&lt;/math&gt;.

The simplest [[ordinary differential equation]] satisfied by the distribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;k T v f'(v)+f(v) (m v^2-2 kT)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(1)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi }} e^{-\frac{m}{2 k T}} \left(\frac{m}{k T}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

or in unitless presentation:

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 x f'(x)+\left(x^2-2 a^2\right) f(x)=0, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(1)=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi }} e^{-\frac{1}{2 a^2}}}{a^3}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--Note that a distribution (function) is not the same as the probability. The distribution (function) stands for an average number, as in all three kinds of statistics (Maxwell–Boltzmann, [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]], [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac]]).--&gt; 
With the [[Darwin–Fowler method]] of mean values the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is obtained as an exact result.{{huh|date=June 2018}}

==Typical speeds==
The [[expectation value|mean]] speed &lt;math&gt; \langle v \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, 
most probable speed ([[Mode (statistics)|mode]]) {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, 
and root-mean-square speed  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\langle v^2 \rangle}&lt;/math&gt; 
can be obtained from properties of the Maxwell distribution.

This works well for nearly [[ideal gas|ideal]], [[noble gas|monatomic]] gases like [[helium]], but also for [[Molecule|molecular gas]]es like diatomic [[oxygen]]. 
This is because despite the larger [[heat capacity]] (larger internal energy at the same temperature) due to their larger number of [[Equipartition theorem|degrees of freedom]],  their [[Translation (physics)|translational]] [[kinetic energy]] (and thus their speed) is unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;

{{unordered list
|1= The most probable speed, {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the speed most likely to be possessed by any molecule (of the same mass {{mvar|m}}) in the system and corresponds to the maximum value or [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of {{mvar|f(v)}}.  To find it, we calculate the [[derivative]] {{mvar|df/dv}}, set it to zero and solve for {{mvar|v}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df(v)}{dv} = -8\pi \left(\frac{m}{2 \pi kT}\right)^{3/2}\ v\ e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}} \left(\frac{mv^2}{2kT}-1\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with the solution:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{mv_p^2}{2kT} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt { \frac{2kT}{m} } = \sqrt { \frac{2RT}{M} }&lt;/math&gt;
(the second solution &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; representing the "least probable speed").

{{mvar|R}} is the [[gas constant]] and {{mvar|M}} is molar mass of the substance, and thus may be calculated as a product of particle mass, {{math|''m''}}, and [[Avogadro constant]], {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M = m N_a&lt;/math&gt;

For diatomic nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the primary component of [[air]])&lt;ref&gt;The calculation is unaffected by the Nitrogen being diatomic. Despite the larger [[heat capacity]] (larger internal energy at the same temperature) of diatomic gases relative to monatomic gases, due to their larger number of [[Equipartition theorem|degrees of freedom]],  &lt;math&gt;{{3RT}\over{M_m}}&lt;/math&gt; is still the mean [[Translation (physics)|translational]] [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] energy. Nitrogen being diatomic only affects the value of the molar mass {{mvar|M}} {{=}} {{val|28|u=g/mol}}.
See e.g. K. Prakashan, ''Engineering Physics'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6C0R1qpAk7EC&amp;pg=SA2-PA278 2.278].&lt;/ref&gt; 
at [[room temperature]] ({{val|300|u=K}}), this gives 
:&lt;math&gt;v_p \approx  \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot{}8.31\ \text{J}\cdot{}\text{mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}\ 300\ \text{K}}{0.028\ \text{kg}\cdot{}\text{mol}^{-1}}} \approx  422\ \text{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;
|2= The mean speed is the [[expected value]] of the speed distribution, setting &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1}{2a^2}=\frac{m}{2kT}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v \rangle = \int_0^{\infty} v \, f(v) \, dv&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; =  4 \pi \left (\frac{b}{ \pi  } \right )^\frac{3}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} v^3\ e^{-bv^{2}}dv\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = 4 \pi \left (\frac{b}{  \pi } \right )^\frac{3}{2}  \frac{1}{2b^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi b}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt { \frac{8kT}{\pi m}}= \sqrt { \frac{8RT}{\pi M}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} v_p  &lt;/math&gt;

|3= The mean square speed &lt;math&gt;\langle v^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the second-order [[Moment (mathematics)|raw moment]] of the speed distribution. The "root mean square speed" &lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm{rms}&lt;/math&gt;  is the square root of the mean square speed, corresponding to the speed of a particle with median [[kinetic energy]], setting &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1}{2a^2}=\frac{m}{2kT}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{\langle v^2 \rangle} = \left(\int_0^{\infty} v^2 \, f(v) \, dv  \right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formula rendered as PNG instead of HTML. Please don't remove it.--&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left( 4 \pi \left (\frac{b}{  \pi } \right )^\frac{3}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty}  v^4\ e^{-bv^2}dv\right)^{1/2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left(4 \pi \left (\frac{b}{\pi}\right )^\frac{3}{2} \frac{3}{8}  \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{b^5}} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \frac{3}{2b} \right)^{1/2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt { \frac{3kT}{m}}= \sqrt { \frac{3RT}{M} } = \sqrt{ \frac{3}{2} } v_p  &lt;/math&gt;
}}

In summary, the typical speeds are related as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;v_p \approx 88.6\%\ \langle v \rangle  &lt; \langle v \rangle &lt; 108.5\%\  \langle v \rangle \approx v_\mathrm{rms}. &lt;/math&gt;

The root mean square speed is directly related to the [[speed of sound]] {{mvar|c}} in the gas, by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{3}}\ v_\mathrm{rms}  = \sqrt{\frac{f+2}{3f}}\ v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{f+2}{2f}}\ v_p ,&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1 + \frac{2}{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], 
{{mvar|f}} is the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of the individual gas molecule. 
For the example above, diatomic nitrogen (approximating [[air]]) at {{val|300|u=K}}, &lt;math&gt;f = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Nitrogen at room temperature is considered a "rigid" diatomic gas, with two rotational degrees of freedom additional to the three translational ones, and the vibrational degree of freedom not accessible.&lt;/ref&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\frac{7}{15}}v_\mathrm{rms} \approx 68\%\ v_\mathrm{rms} \approx 84\%\ v_p  \approx 353\ \mathrm{m/s}, &lt;/math&gt;
the true value for air can be approximated by using the average molar weight of [[Atmospheric chemistry|air]] ({{val|29|u=g/mol}}), yielding 
{{val|347|u=m/s}} at {{val|300|u=K}} (corrections for variable [[humidity]] are of the order of 0.1% to 0.6%).

==Derivation and related distributions==
===Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics===
{{main|Maxwell–Boltzmann_statistics#Derivations|Boltzmann distribution}}
The original derivation in 1860 by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was an argument based on molecular collisions of the [[Kinetic theory of gases]] as well as certain symmetries in the speed distribution function; Maxwell also gave an early argument that these molecular collisions entail a tendency towards equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Maxwell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gyenis | first1 = Balazs | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2017.01.001 | title = Maxwell and the normal distribution: A colored story of probability, independence, and tendency towards equilibrium | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 57 | pages = 53–65 | year = 2017| arxiv = 1702.01411 | bibcode = 2017SHPMP..57...53G }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Maxwell, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in 1872&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L., "Weitere studien über das Wärmegleichgewicht unter Gasmolekülen." ''Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche Classe'', '''66''', 1872, pp. 275–370.&lt;/ref&gt; also derived the distribution on mechanical grounds and argued that gases should over time tend toward this distribution, due to collisions (see [[H-theorem]]). He later (1877)&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L., "Über die Beziehung zwischen dem zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen Wärmetheorie und der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung respektive den Sätzen über das Wärmegleichgewicht." ''Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Classe''. Abt. II, '''76''', 1877, pp. 373–435. Reprinted in ''Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen'', Vol. II, pp. 164–223, Leipzig: Barth, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; derived the distribution again under the framework of [[statistical thermodynamics]]. The derivations in this section are along the lines of Boltzmann's 1877 derivation, starting with result known as [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] (from statistical thermodynamics). Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics gives the average number of particles found in a given single-particle [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]], under certain assumptions, the logarithm of the fraction of particles in a given microstate is proportional   to the ratio of the energy of that state to the temperature of the system:
:&lt;math&gt;-\log \left(\frac{N_i}{N}\right) \propto \frac{E_i}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
The assumptions of this equation are that the particles do not interact, and that they are classical; this means that each particle's state can be considered independently from the other particles' states. Additionally, the particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="StatisticalPhysics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{isbn|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This relation can be written as an equation by introducing a normalizing factor:

\frac{N_i} N = \frac{\exp(-E_i/kT) } { \sum_j \exp(-E_j/kT) }&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where:
* {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the expected number of particles in the single-particle microstate {{mvar|i}},
* {{mvar|N}} is the total number of particles in the system,
* {{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}  is the energy of microstate {{mvar|i}},
* the sum over index {{mvar|j}} takes into account all microstates, 
*{{mvar|T}} is the equilibrium temperature of the system,
*{{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].
The denominator in Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is simply a normalizing factor so that the ratios &lt;math&gt;N_i:N&lt;/math&gt;  add up to unity — in other words it is a kind of [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] (for the single-particle system, not the usual partition function of the entire system).

Because velocity and speed are related to energy, Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be used to derive relationships between temperature and the speeds of gas particles. All that is needed is to discover the density of microstates in energy, which is determined by dividing up momentum space into equal sized regions.

===Distribution for the momentum vector===

The potential energy is taken to be zero, so that all energy is in the form of kinetic energy.
The relationship between [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy and momentum]] for massive non-[[special relativity|relativistic]] particles is

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the square of the momentum vector 
'''p'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;]. We may therefore rewrite Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{N_i}{N} = 
\frac{1}{Z} 
\exp \left[
-\frac{p_{i, x}^2 + p_{i, y}^2 + p_{i, z}^2}{2mkT}
\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], corresponding to the denominator in Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}). Here ''m'' is the molecular mass of the gas, ''T'' is the thermodynamic temperature and ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]].  This distribution of &lt;math&gt;N_i:N&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[probability density function]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&lt;/sub&gt; for finding a molecule with these values of momentum components, so:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{p} (p_x, p_y, p_z) 
\propto
\exp \left[
-\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}
\right]&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The [[normalizing constant]]  can be determined by recognizing that the probability of a molecule having ''some'' momentum must be 1.  
Integrating  the exponential in ({{EquationNote|4}}) over all ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; yields a factor of 
:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \exp \left[ -\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}\right] dp_x\ dp_y\ dp_z  = {(\sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{2mkT})^3}&lt;/math&gt;

So that the normalized distribution function is:
{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=
&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{p} (p_x, p_y, p_z) =
\left( 2 \pi mkT \right)^{-3/2}
\exp \left[
-\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2mkT}
\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4|ref=6}}

The distribution is seen to be the product of three independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] variables &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt;, with variance &lt;math&gt;mkT&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally, it can be seen that the magnitude of momentum will be distributed as a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{mkT}&lt;/math&gt;.
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the momentum (or equally for the velocities) can be obtained more fundamentally using the [[H-theorem]] at equilibrium within the [[Kinetic theory of gases]] framework.

===Distribution for the energy===

The energy distribution is found imposing
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  f_E(E) dE = f_p(\textbf p) d^3 \textbf p,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;d^3 \textbf p&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal phase-space volume of momenta corresponding to the energy interval &lt;math&gt;dE&lt;/math&gt;.
Making use of the spherical symmetry of the energy-momentum dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E=| \textbf p|^2/2m&lt;/math&gt;,
this can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;dE&lt;/math&gt; as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  d^3 \textbf p = 4 \pi | \textbf p |^2 d |\textbf p| = 4 \pi m \sqrt{2mE} dE.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
Using then ({{EquationNote|8}}) in ({{EquationNote|7}}), and expressing everything in terms of the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
  f_E(E) dE = \frac{1}{(2\pi m k T)^{3/2}} e^{-E/kT} 4 \pi m \sqrt{2mE} dE = 2 \sqrt{\frac{E}{\pi}} \left( \frac{1}{kT} \right)^{3/2} \exp\left(\frac{-E}{kT} \right) dE
&lt;/math&gt;
and finally

{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=
&lt;math&gt;f_E(E) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{E}{\pi}} \left( \frac{1}{kT} \right)^{3/2} \exp\left(\frac{-E}{kT} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4|ref=9}}

Since the energy is proportional to the sum of the squares of the three normally distributed momentum components, this distribution is a [[gamma distribution]]; in particular, it is a [[chi-squared distribution]] with three degrees of freedom.

By the [[equipartition theorem]], this energy is evenly distributed among all three degrees of freedom, so that the energy per degree of freedom is distributed as a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
f_\epsilon(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon= \sqrt{\frac{1 }{\pi \epsilon kT}}~\exp\left[\frac{-\epsilon}{kT}\right]\,d\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the energy per degree of freedom. At equilibrium, this distribution will hold true for any number of degrees of freedom. For example, if the particles are rigid mass dipoles of fixed dipole moment, they will have three translational degrees of freedom and two additional rotational degrees of freedom. The energy in each degree of freedom will be described according to the above chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the total energy will be distributed according to a chi-squared distribution with five degrees of freedom. This has implications in the theory of the [[specific heat]] of a gas.

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution can also be obtained by considering the gas to be a type of [[gas in a box|quantum gas]] for which the approximation ''&amp;epsilon; &gt;&gt; k T'' may be made.

===Distribution for the velocity vector===

Recognizing that the velocity probability density ''f''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the momentum probability density function by

:&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{v} d^3v = f_\mathbf{p} \left(\frac{dp}{dv}\right)^3 d^3v
&lt;/math&gt;

and using '''p''' = m'''v''' we get

{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=
&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{v} (v_x, v_y, v_z) =
\left(\frac{m}{2 \pi kT} \right)^{3/2}
\exp \left[-
\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2kT}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4}}

which is the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution. The probability of finding a particle with velocity in the infinitesimal element [''dv''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''dv''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''dv''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;] about velocity '''v'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;] is

:&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{v} \left(v_x, v_y, v_z\right)\, dv_x\, dv_y\, dv_z.
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the momentum, this distribution is seen to be the product of three independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] variables &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;, but with variance &lt;math&gt;\frac{kT}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.  
It can also be seen that the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity
[''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;] is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:

:&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathbf{v} \left(v_x, v_y, v_z\right) = f_v (v_x)f_v (v_y)f_v (v_z)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the distribution for a single direction is

:&lt;math&gt;
f_v (v_i) =
\sqrt{\frac{m}{2 \pi kT}}
\exp \left[
\frac{-mv_i^2}{2kT}
\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Each component of the velocity vector has a [[normal distribution]] with mean &lt;math&gt;\mu_{v_x} = \mu_{v_y} = \mu_{v_z} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{v_x} = \sigma_{v_y} = \sigma_{v_z} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;, so the vector has a 3-dimensional normal distribution, a particular kind of [[multivariate normal distribution]], with mean &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\mathbf{v}} = {\mathbf{0}} &lt;/math&gt; and standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathbf{v}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Distribution for the speed===
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the speed follows immediately from the distribution of the velocity vector, above.  Note that the speed is

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[volume element]] in [[spherical coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt; dv_x\, dv_y\, dv_z = v^2 \sin \theta\, dv\, d\theta\, d\phi = v^2   dv\,  d\Omega&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate]] angles of the velocity vector. [[Spherical_coordinate_system#Integration_and_differentiation_in_spherical_coordinates|Integration]] of the probability density function of the velocity  over the solid angles &lt;math&gt;d\Omega&lt;/math&gt; yields an  additional factor of &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt;.
The speed distribution with substitution of the speed for the sum of the squares of the vector components:
{{Equation box 1 |indent=: |equation=
&lt;math&gt;
f (v) =
\left(\frac{2}{\pi} \right)^{1/2}
\left(\frac{m}{ kT} \right)^{3/2}
v^2
\exp \left[-
\frac{mv^2}{2kT}
\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Pennyland houses early 1980s.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Pennyland houses, early 1980s]]
The '''Pennyland project''' was one of a series of [[low-energy building]] experiments sparked by the [[1973 oil crisis]]. It involved the construction of an estate of 177 houses in the '''[[Great Linford#Civil parish|Pennyland]]''' area of [[Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire#Ceremonial County|Buckinghamshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. It compared possible future UK building efficiency standards with newly introduced [[Denmark|Danish]] ones.

Although identical externally, half the Pennyland houses (Area 1) were built to the proposed 1982 UK [[Energy efficiency in British housing|Building Regulations]] energy efficiency standards. The other half (Area 2) were built to the much more demanding 1977 Danish ''BR77'' standard. (In Europe, BR77 and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] ''SBN-80'' standards set the benchmark for [[low energy building|low-energy housing]] at the time.)

Sponsored by the UK Department of Energy, Department of Environment and [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation]], and using the technical expertise of the [[Open University]] Energy Research Group, the houses were constructed during 1979 and 1980.

For comparison, two additional groups of control houses, already built in 1978, were studied on an adjoining site at Neath Hill. A further group, the [[Linford low energy houses]] were built to the Pennyland Area 2 standards and used for more detailed tests.

==Design==
The Pennyland estate was laid out to take advantage of [[passive solar building design|solar gain]]. The majority of houses faced south with the main living rooms located on the south side. They were designed with an insulated [[cavity wall]] with a poured [[concrete]] inner leaf to provide [[thermal mass]]. This had the added benefit of increasing airtightness. Nearly all were fitted with conventional radiator central heating systems.

Several levels of insulation, heating system efficiency and passive solar design were compared:

At Neath Hill most houses featured 
*conventional 'heavyweight' gas boilers
*50&amp;nbsp;mm roof insulation
*no cavity wall insulation
*Single glazing
*No floor edge insulation
*No special passive solar measures

About 20 of the Neath Hill houses were retrofitted with foam cavity fill wall insulation.

The Pennyland Area 1 houses featured:
*low thermal capacity gas boilers
*80&amp;nbsp;mm loft insulation
*50&amp;nbsp;mm cavity wall insulation
*Single glazing
*No floor edge insulation
*Passive solar layout and features

The Pennyland Area 2 houses (almost Danish BR77 standards) featured:
*low thermal capacity gas boilers
*150&amp;nbsp;mm loft insulation
*100&amp;nbsp;mm cavity wall insulation
*Double glazing
*25&amp;nbsp;mm insulation under the edge of the floor slab
*Passive solar layout and features
 
==Lessons learned==
The houses were monitored over the winters of 1981 and 1982 with energy and internal temperatures being measured in a large sample of houses on a weekly average basis. More detailed monitoring on an hourly basis was carried out on the Linford houses.

Among the lessons learned were:
*Overall the Pennyland Area 2 houses demonstrated a halving in gas consumption for space and water heating compared to the 'normal' Neath Hill houses.
*The low thermal capacity gas boilers showed large energy savings compared to the conventional 'heavyweight' type.
*The poured concrete construction used at Pennyland made the houses extremely airtight.
*The overall package of energy conservation measures had a payback time of only four years.
*The passive solar features were popular, but the energy savings were modest and their use constrained estate layout. The savings were limited by the use of net curtains and privacy considerations.
*The Pennyland houses suffered from minor mould growth in kitchens and bathrooms; a downside of the good airtightness.

==Impact==
The short payback times encouraged Milton Keynes Development Corporation to introduce its own Building Regulation standards for new housing within the city leading to the major 1986 [[Energy World]] demonstration project and exhibition.

The issue of mould growth in air-tight houses has since been tackled by Building Regulation requirements for specific ventilation in kitchens, bathrooms and toilets.

The levels of insulation tested at Pennyland and [[Great Linford]] in the early 1980s were only surpassed in the UK Building Regulation requirements in 2002.

A '''personal transporter''' (also '''electric rideable''', '''personal light electric vehicle''', '''personal mobility device''', etc) is a class of compact, [[electric vehicle|electric]] or [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] [[vehicle]] for transporting an individual at speeds that do not normally exceed {{cvt|25|kph}}. They include electric [[electric skateboard|skateboards]], [[electric kick scooter|kick scooters]], [[self-balancing unicycle]]s and [[Segway PT|Segways]], as well as gasoline-fueled [[motorized scooter]]s or skateboards, typically using [[two-stroke engine]]s of less than {{cvt|49|cc|cuin}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]].&lt;ref name=UK-DOT/&gt;&lt;ref name=VTPU/&gt; Many newer versions use recent advances in [[Electric-vehicle battery|vehicle battery]] and motor-control technologies. They are growing in popularity, and legislators are in the process of determining how these devices should be classified, regulated and accommodated during a period of rapid innovation. 

Excluded from this legal category are [[electric bicycles]] (that are considered to be a type of bicycle), [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|electric motorbikes and scooters]] (that are treated as a type of [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]) and powered mobility aids with 3 or 4 wheels on which the rider sits (which fall within regulations covering powered [[mobility scooter]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raivereniging.nl/ecm/?id=workspace://SpacesStore/4ee4a9c0-3b5a-48f7-9346-ce670f4a0e43 |title=EU regulations for e-bikes, pedelecs and speed pedelecs |website=Bike Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==History==
[[File:Autoped 1919 Ever Ready engine.jpg|thumb|upright|Engine of an [[Autoped]], made 1915-1922 ]]
[[File:Motoboard.jpg|thumb|[[MotoBoard]] combustion engine skateboard, mid 2010s]] 

The first personal transporter was the 1915 [[Autoped]], a stand up scooter with a gasoline engine made from 1915 to 1922. Engine powered scooters and skate boards reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s. 

With the rapid improvements in lithium batteries in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a range of new types of personal transporters appeared, and began to spread into use in urban settings for both recreation and practical transportation. 

[[Dean Kamen]] applied for his first patent for a 'human transporter', the Segway PT, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|5701965|5,701,965 Human transporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by other patent applications prior to its product launch in late 2001 and first deliveries to customers early in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segway.com/patents.pdf |title=Segway Patent Information |publisher=Segway Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|302230|US Patent 302,230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Machrone |first=Bill |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,97229,00.asp |title=Ginger Unveiled-It's a Scooter! |publisher=Extremetech.com |date=3 December 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor Blackwell]] demonstrated a self-balancing unicycle based on the control-mechanism from a Segway PT in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/339.html |title=Journal entry for 25 September 2004 |website=Live Journal |date=25 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source |date=June 2018}} for which he published [[open source]] designs (see [[Eunicycle]]).

In December 2016 ''[[The Verge]]'' magazine suggested that 2017 would be an "important year" for personal electric vehicles of all sizes.&lt;ref name=Verge2017/&gt;

==Terminology==
The terminology for these devices is not yet stable ({{as of|2017}}) as the media and legislators discuss a rapidly emerging potential class of motor vehicle and its relationship to laws relating to other transport devices, including electric bicycles and [[mobility aids]] such as mobility scooters.&lt;ref name=Verge2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=VTPU/&gt; Commonly used terms are used for these new devices include:

==Types of personal transporter==

===Motorized scooter===
[[File:Autoped 1919 Ever Ready 1.jpg|thumb|[[Gasoline]]-fueled {{cvt|155|cc|cuin}} [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Single cylinder engine|single]] [[Autoped]] Ever Ready]]
{{Main|Motorized scooter}}
The earliest example of a motorized scooter, or standing scooter with an internal combustion engine, was the 1915 [[Autoped]], made in the US until 1919 and in Germany until 1922.

===Electric standing scooter===
[[File:Female rider on Egret One eScooter.jpg|thumb|[[Electric kick scooter]] in use]]
{{Main|Motorized scooter}}
An electric standing scooter with a small platform with two or more [[wheel]]s driven by an [[electric motor]] which fold for portablity. 

===Electric skateboard===
{{Main|Electric skateboard}}
An electric skateboard is an electrically powered skateboard controlled by the rider shifting their weight and in some cases also a hand-held throttle.

===Self-balancing scooter===
[[File:Culoz-FR-01-équilibriste aventureux.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[self-balancing scooter|self-balancing hoverboard]]]]
The self-balancing scooter is a category of personal transporter which includes all self-balancing powered portable devices with [[dicycle|two parallel wheels]]; these include the Segway PT, the Segway miniPRO and self-balancing hoverboards.

===Self-balancing unicycle===
[[File:Boy riding Solowheel.jpg|upright=0.9|Boy riding an [[self-balancing unicycle|electric unicycle]]|thumb]]
{{Main|Self-balancing unicycle}}
A self-balancing unicycle is a single-rider electrically powered [[unicycle]] that automatically keeps itself upright using computer-controlled [[gyroscope]]s, [[accelerometer]]s.

===Hybrids===

The [[Onewheel]] has elements of an electric skateboard (it is powered) and a self-balancing unicycle (it has one wheel).

==Concept devices==
The [[Honda UNI-CUB]] and its predecessor the [[Honda U3-X]] are concept seated devices that are fully stable that can travel sideways as well as in the forwards/backwards axis.

==Technology==
===Batteries===
Most devices are powered by rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] vehicle batteries, and often [[List of battery sizes#Cylindrical_lithium-ion_rechargeable_battery|18650-size]] [[lithium iron phosphate|{{chem|LiFePO|4}}]] batteries controlled by complex [[battery management system]]s. [[Lithium polymer battery|Lithium polymer batteries]] are being tested for higher performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lipo-vs-li-ion-electric-skateboard-battery-chemistry/3023 |title=LIPO vs LI-ION - Electric Skateboard Battery Chemistry |website=Electric skateboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many devices now contain one, or sometimes two, batteries in the {{cvt|101|to|160|Wh|lk=on}} range, which fall within the sizes that can be carried on an airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/passenger_info/media/Airline_passengers_and_batteries.pdf |title=Batteries Carried by Airline Passengers - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Before-you-fly/Baggage/Items-that-are-allowed-in-baggage/ |title=Items that are allowed in baggage - Lithium-batteries |publisher=Civil Aviation authority (UK) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines may restrict carrying some devices due to the earlier product defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/small-lithium-battery-powered-vehicles.pdf |title=Small Vehicles Powered by Lithium Batteries – Passenger Provisions Updated February 2016 |publisher=International Air Transport Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, every 100 WHours of capacity will provide 6-7 miles of range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/cool-gadgets/best-electric-skateboard?specs=y&amp;n=0&amp;sort_field=score#compare |title=The 9 Best Electric Skateboards of 2017 |website=TechGearLab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of lithium batteries fell 80% between 2011 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electrek.co/2017/01/30/electric-vehicle-battery-cost-dropped-80-6-years-227kwh-tesla-190kwh/ |title=Electric vehicle battery cost dropped 80% in 6 years down to $227/kWh – Tesla claims to be below $190/kWh |website=Tlectrek}}&lt;/ref&gt; These batteries, which have good [[energy density]], energy-to-mass ratio provide the range, [[torque]], operational life required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.electricunicycles.eu/all_you_need_to_know_about_rechargeable_batteries-c__224 |title=All you need to know about rechargeable batteries |website=Electric Unicycles.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the previously available [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid]], [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|NiMH]] and [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCad]] technologies.

===Brushless motors===
Many of these devices use [[brushless DC electric motor]]s with permanent magnets attached to the moving hub which turns around a fixed [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] which offer high efficiency, good speed-torque characteristics and low weight. This motor is often built into the wheel itself, eliminating gears and drive belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electric-boarding.com/2016/04/11/will-hub-motors-redefine-the-electric-skateboard-industry-or-is-it-just-another-fad/ |title=Will Hub Motors Redefine The Electric Skateboard Industry Or Is It Just Another Fad? |website=Electric boarding |date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many devices have a motor in the 250-500 [[watt]]s range which provides good performance for an adult rider on the flat and on an incline,  with sportier models using motors in excess of 1500 Watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.evolveskateboards.com/pages/comparison-1 |title=Bamboo Series |publisher=Evolve Skateboards|quote=3000 watt high performance custom made sensored dual brush out-runner motors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brushless DC motors, which often have  [[regenerative braking]], also need complex [[motor controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e3bc/86855c1d9ccc15daab8349386f538a692e5b.pdf |title=Regenerative braking in an electric vehicle |website=semanticscholar.org |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal combustion engine===

==International regulation==
[[File:Steh-Elektroroller Nürnberg DSCF2843.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Segway PT|Segways]] in Germany have a red [[tail light]] and a [[vehicle registration plate]] ]]
===Asia===
;China
In [[Hong Kong]], the Transport Department issued a statement saying that under the Road Traffic Ordinance, these self-balancing hoverboards are classified as motor vehicles, since they are mechanically propelled: "Registration and licence is required before any motor vehicle is used on the roads, including private roads. However, since the construction and operation of these motor-driven devices could pose a danger to the users themselves and other road users, they are not appropriate to use on roads, hence they cannot be registered and licensed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/10/22/30-years-on-from-back-to-the-future-present-day-hoverboards-are-outlawed-in-hong-kong/ |title=30 years on from 'Back to the Future', present-day hoverboards are outlawed in Hong Kong |first=Kris |last= Cheng |newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Israel
In 2006, the Segway PT was approved for use on [[sidewalk]]s and other pedestrian designated locations, and on roads without sidewalks, with obstructed sidewalks or sidewalks that lack [[curb cuts]]. The user must be over 16 years old. No license is required. The maximum allowed speed is {{convert|13.5|km/h|abbr=on}}, enforced by electronic restriction put in place by the importer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.gov.il/TeachingCenter/Documents/takanottabura/P230_011.doc |title=Transportation regulations |publisher=rsa.gov.il |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Japan
In a court, Segway PT was classified as a motorcycle, owing to the power output;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=石田真一 |url=http://response.jp/issue/2004/0412/article59422_1.html |script-title=ja:『セグウェイ』は整備不良...50万円の罰金命令 |publisher=Response.jp |accessdate=11 March 2009 |language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no report of registration. Segway Japan, an authorized dealer, sells Segways only to corporations to use in facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20091115x1.html Will Segway sci-fi ever be everyday fact? | The Japan Times Online] 15 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

;Saudi Arabia
In [[Mecca]] they were banned after a video of a pilgrim, using it during [[hajj]] on a hoverboard was posted on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/sometimes-we-should-all-just-step-back-a-little |title=Sometimes we should all just step back a little &amp;#124; The National |website=Thenational.ae |date=2015-09-02 |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Singapore
Devices can be ridden on the sidewalk at speeds of up to {{convert|15|kph|abbr=on}} and cycleways at speeds of up to {{convert|25|kph|abbr=on}} whilst providing pedestrians with the right of way. Devices must be fitted with lights or alternatively the rider must wear a luminous jacket. They are not allowed on the roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stuff.tv/sg/features/all-you-need-know-about-owning-electric-scooter-or-unicycle-in-singapore |title=All you need to know about owning an electric scooter or unicycle in Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 the Land Transport Authority started a 6-month trial where devices were allowed on trains and buses at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/using-e-scooter-trains-buses-smooth-process |title=Using e-scooter on trains, buses smooth process}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) has been in the process of defining a standard for personal transporters, referred to as 'personal light electric vehicle', including both self-balancing vehicles and standing vehicles with maximum speeds of up to {{convert|25|kph|abbr=on}} and is expected to complete its work by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewheels.org/news/656/personal-light-electric-vehicle-plev-standard |title=Personal Light Electric Vehicle (PLEV) standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anec.eu/priorities/traffic |title=Traffic and Mobility|quote=a new work item emerged in the second half of 2013 to work on 'Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs) and self-balancing vehicles', e.g. segways, scooters (without seating position), hoverboards. The standard is expect to be published in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time the some countries have allowed personal transporters to be used on public roads with certain conditions:

;Åland islands
A law revision by the Government of Åland concerning "small electrically powered vehicles" means the Segway PT and all other mainly one person electrical vehicles have been classified as bicycles since March 14, 2012.

;Austria
The type Segway i2 is (width 63&amp;nbsp;cm) narrower than the {{cvt|80|cm}} width limit and has a low-enough maximum speed to come under laws relating to electric bicycles and therefore has to use cycle lanes and paths, otherwise street lanes. The type Segway x2 reaches with its bigger wheels 84&amp;nbsp;cm width and is therefore an electric vehicle, that needs a license and insurance. Neither type may use sidewalks (lengthwise) or pedestrian zones (unless exemption stated).

;Belgium
In Belgium the law was recently adjusted allowing electrical motorized devices to the public road. Art 2.15.2.&lt;ref name=voortbewegingstoestel&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wegcode.be/wetteksten/secties/kb/wegcode/100-art2 |title=Personal mobility device - voortbewegingstoestel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Devices with a max speed of {{convert|18|kph|abbr=on}} can ride on the cycle path. One can also use these devices on sidewalks at walking pace. Devices with a higher maximum speed are subject under the existing rules for motorised vehicles. An insurance and protective wear will be required in any cases.&lt;ref name=BRSI&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brsi.be/en/road-safety/publication-details/new-urban-mobility/ |title=BIVV : New urban mobility}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This link appears to be to a report offering recommendations only. Have it recommendations been acted on? |date=July 2017}}

;Croatia
Use of a Segway PT is allowed within city limits wherever pedestrian and bicycles are allowed, i.e., sidewalks, bicycle paths, parks, etc. Segways can be rented for city tours in cities of [[Zagreb]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Dubrovnik]].

;Czech Republic
{{As of|2016}} devices are allowed on pavements at a speed not exceeding that of pedestrians and on cycling lanes at up to cycling speed. A new clearer framework is being developed by the road police in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibesip.cz/data/web/novela-361-web.pdf |title=Zákon č. 361/2000 Sb., o silničním provozu, byl novelizován zákonem č. 48/2016 Sb. Změny vstupují v účinnost od 20. února 2016 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since the autumn of 2010, the Ministry of Transport enforced the interpretation that a rider on the Segway PT is considered as a pedestrian. The amendment act 48/2016 Sb., in force since 20 February 2016, defined a new strange term "osobní technický prostředek" (= personal technical device/medium) for "personal transporter with selfbalancing device" and "other similar devices". However, the text of the act uses a term "osobní přepravník" ("personal transporter") in that sense instead. Municipality can restrict their traffic by municipal decree, but such a restriction needs to be marked by road signs. Since 21 March 2016, a new ordinance of the Ministry of Transport, 84/2016 Sb., which introduced several new road signs, is in force:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.odok.cz/kpl-detail?pid=KORNA66HZURG |title=An amendment proposal for the ordinance no. 294/2015 Sb. |website=ODok |publisher=Government of the Czech Republic |date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2016, the Prague Council approved a decree (in force since 3 August 2016) that Segways (strictly speaking all "personal transporters" as defined by law) are forbidden in the Prague Conservation Area, [[Prague 7]] and  part of [[Prague 4]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praha.eu/jnp/cz/test/vyhledavani_v_pravnich_predpisech/narizeni_c_14_2016_sb_hl_m_prahy.html Nařízení č. 14/2016 Sb. hl. m.

;Denmark
The Segway PT is classified as a [[moped]] (''knallert''). As such vehicles must be fitted with lights, license plates and mechanical brakes, the Segway is effectively banned from public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Nyheder/Hovedstadsomraadet/2007/08/24/074423.htm | title=Færdselsstyrelse: En Segway er en knallert |accessdate=23 October 2007 |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]] |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trial where the Segway would be classified as a bicycle has been announced running from June 1, 2010 to April 1, 2011. The trial was extended to December 1, 2011, and later to the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.trafikstyrelsen.dk/DA/Presse/Nyhedsarkiv/Syn-og-koeretoejer/2011/12/Forlaengelse-af-forsoeg.aspx | publisher=Færdselstyrelsen |title=Forlængelse af forsøg med elektrisk drevne en-akslede køretøjer | date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Finland
In September 2015 authorities in Finland recommended that personal transporters should be made legal for use on roads, making a distinction between devices with a maximum speed of {{cvt|15|kph}} which would be treated as pedestrians and ones with a maximum speed of {{cvt|25|kph}} which would be treated as bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lvm.fi/-/lightweight-electric-vehicles-to-be-legal-in-road-traffic-796805 |title=Lightweight electric vehicles to be legal in road traffic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segway PTs are classified as low-power mopeds and therefore require license plates, effectively banning the use on public roads. On March 31, 2015, The Ministry of Transport and Communications of Finland started progress to propose changes to law to allow Segways under 25&amp;nbsp;km/h on sidewalks and reclassifying them as bicycles. Like bicycles, Segways would be required to include [[safety reflector]]s and a bell to alert pedestrians and the driver is required to wear a bicycle helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lvm.fi/tiedote/4437033/muutosta-aletaan-valmistella-kevyet-sahkokulkuneuvot-laillisiksi-liikennekaytossa | publisher=Liikenne- ja viestintäministeriö | title=Muutosta aletaan valmistella: Kevyet sähkökulkuneuvot laillisiksi liikennekäytössä | language=fi | date=2015-03-31 | accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany self-balancing hoverboards are not allowed on public streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://self-balancing-board.de/strassenzulassung-self-balancing-board/ |title=Straßenzulassung für das self balancing board?

It is not legal to ride solowheels on public roads (includes sidewalks, parks, forest tracks, etc.) in Germany as of June 2017. Because it is considered as a type of motor vehicle the rider would need a test certificate from the Technical Inspection Agency (Technischer Überwachungsverein) to get an insurance. Additionally, the driver would have to pay taxes according to the certificate. However, the Inspection Agency has no valid classification for it, no certificate can be obtained. Hence, riding a solowheel on public road would mean to ride without certificate, without insurance and to evade taxes. It may have severe penalties (up to one year in prison &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pauly |first1=Bastian |title=YouTuber darkviktory mit illegalem Einrad ertappt |url=http://www.maz-online.de/Brandenburg/Illegalen-Einrad-Fahrern-drohen-harte-Strafen |publisher=Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt;) when a solowheel rider is caught by the police. In contrast, for the Seqway as a two-wheeled vehicle with handlebar, there is a classification which allows to get a certificate and thus, the compulsory insurance.

The Segway PT i2 is generally allowed on bicycle paths and public roads within city limits since July 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ThomasKnauf.de/ginger/Mobilitaetshilfeverordnung.pdf | title=Bundesgesetzblatt: Verordnung über die Teilnahme elektronischer Mobilitätshilfen am Verkehr | date=24 June 2009 | accessdate=29 April 2010 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside city limits, the Segway may not be used on [[Autobahn|federal motorways]], [[Bundesstraße|federal highways]], [[Landesstraße|state roads]], and [[Kreisstraße|district roads]]. Bicycle lanes must be used if present. Riding a Segway on sidewalks and in [[pedestrian zone]]s for city tours requires a special permit. The Segway is classified as an "electronic mobility aid", a new class of vehicle defined specifically for the Segway PT. Segways used on public roads must be equipped with [[Bicycle lighting|front and rear lighting]], [[Bicycle reflector|reflectors]], a bell, and an [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany#Insurance plates|insurance plate]]. The driver must have procured a [[vehicle insurance]] and hold at least an ''M type'' (moped) license.

;Hungary
The ''Központi Közlekedési Főfelügyelet'' (Central Traffic Authority Board) does not consider Segways to be vehicle, and considers [[skateboard]]ers, and people moving luggage trolleys pedestrians.

;Netherlands
In the Netherlands the use of self-balancing hoverboards is illegal on all public roads, it is only allowed on private property. The main reason given is that the vehicle is motorized but has no steering wheel and no place to sit. Therefore, the vehicle does not fall in any category allowed on public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bijzondere-voertuigen/vraag-en-antwoord/hoverboard-op-openbare-weg/ |title=Mag ik met een hoverboard op de openbare weg rijden?

;Norway 
Because of the top speed of 20&amp;nbsp;km/h, the Segway was classified as a moped in Norway. Prior to 2014, there were requirements for registration, insurance, age limit, drivers licenses and helmets to operate a Segway in the country. Therefore, Segways were not originally able to be used legally on public or private roads or on private property in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.no/politidirektoratet/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2005_06/Nyhet_5213.xml |title=Politiet - Segway ulovlig i Norge |accessdate=22 September 2013 |date=8 June 2005 |publisher=Politiet |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930133506/https://www.politi.no/politidirektoratet/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2005_06/Nyhet_5213.xml |archivedate=30 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tnp.no/norway/politics/4008-boxing-and-segways-to-be-legal-in-norway&lt;/ref&gt; Segways became legal in Norway on July 1, 2014 on all public roads with speed limits 20&amp;nbsp;km/h or less, sidewalks and bicycle lanes for ages 16 and older without requiring registration or insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/bil-baat-og-motor/bil-og-trafikk/segway-blir-lov-fra-1-juli/a/23229696/ |title=Segway blir lov fra 1. juli |first=Frank |last=Ertesvåg |website=VG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sweden
It was unlawful to use a Segway PT on any public road or pavement in Sweden until 18 December 2008 when the Segway was re-classified as a ''cykel klass II'' (class 2 bicycle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segway.se/support/regulatory.php |title=Segway &amp;#124; Support &amp;#124; Lagar &amp; regler |publisher=Segway.se |accessdate=11 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308042715/http://www.segway.se/support/regulatory.php |archivedate=8 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/segway-klassad-som-cykel |title=Segway klassad som cykel |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2010 the Segway and similar one person electrical vehicles were re-classified as bicycles.

Every selfbalancing vehicle must be fullredundant. The PT may be used on roads provided that it is equipped with a Swiss Road Kit and a license plate. The Swiss Road Kit has front and back lighting, a battery source, and a license plate holder. Use on sidewalks and pedestrian zones is prohibited. An exception is made for handicapped individuals, who must obtain in advance a special authorization from the Swiss Federal Roads Office. The Segway PT i180 may also be registered for use on specific request. However, the PT i180 must be equipped with a left/right turn indicator system before it may be admitted for road use.

A fact sheet published by the US Justice Department states: "People with mobility, circulatory, respiratory, or neurological disabilities use many kinds of devices for mobility. Some use walkers, canes, crutches, or braces. Some use manual or power wheelchairs or electric scooters. In addition, advances in technology have given rise to new devices, such as Segways that some people with disabilities use as mobility devices, including many veterans injured while serving in the military. And more advanced devices will inevitably be invented, providing more mobility options for people with disabilities."

They did also say that '''our road safety experts in the Centre for Road Safety are currently working with their counterparts across the country on national laws and safety standards for these personal electric transport devices, so we can figure out how and where people can use them safely"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New South Wales Is Another State Where Self-Balancing Scooters Are Banned |url = http://www.autoevolution.com/news/new-south-wales-is-another-state-where-self-balancing-scooters-are-banned-102313.html |website= Autoevolution |accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Hoverboards Illegal in NSW |url = http://www.sydneyobserver.com/2015/11/hoverboards-illegal-in-nsw/ |magazine=[[Sydney Observer Magazine]] |accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states in Australia have yet to make a clear decision or announcement on legality and enforcement, and are relying on existing laws in place.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web |title = Self-Balancing Scooters Shaky Under Australian Law |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/10/03/self-balancing-scooter-australia_n_8211308.html |website= Huffington Post |date = 2015-03-10 |accessdate = 2015-12-08 |first = Josh |last = Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are free to use on private property.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

In Australia laws are determined at the state &amp; territory level, each differing in their adoption of the [[Australian Road Rules]]. It is generally illegal to use Segway PTs in public places and on roads throughout Australia.

In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], use of Segways is illegal on roads and other public places, but, {{As of|2012|6|lc=y}}, was permitted around Canberra's Lake Burley Griffin and other tourist attractions, subject to training, safety equipment and speed limit requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canberra Segway ban lifted |url=http://tourism.act.gov.au/industry-link/2012/06/canberra-segway-ban-lifted/ |date=June 12, 2012 |access-date=2017-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411111448/http://tourism.act.gov.au/industry-link/2012/06/canberra-segway-ban-lifted/# |archive-date=2017-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Review of Segway Use and Commercialisation in the Australian Capital Territory |url=http://www.rego.act.gov.au/assets/PDFs/Segway%20Discussion%20Paper.pdf |accessdate=13 December 2012 |format=Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Segway has been confirmed by the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] as being illegal on both roads and footpaths. "In simple terms, riders are way too exposed to mix with general traffic on a road and too fast, heavy and consequently dangerous to other users on footpaths or cycle paths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/segway-test-ride-a-mock-horse/2008/01/02/1198949941691.html |title=Segway test: ride a mock horse |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this does not render them totally illegal (they may still, for example, be used on private property), their uses are limited enough that they are not sold to the general public.

In [[Queensland]], the use of the Segway became legal on the 1st of August 2013. Queensland transport Minister Scott Emerson noted that it makes sense for Segways to be allowed on public paths across Queensland, given users wear helmets.

In [[Western Australia]], the law enables Electric Personal Transporters (EPT) (Segways) to be used as part of a supervised commercial tour, being run by an operator that holds the appropriate approvals. You may use an EPT on private property. Tour operators should approach the Local Authority where they wish to operate the tour. Local authorities have ultimate responsibility for approving tour operators within their respective areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/pages/StatementDetails.aspx?listName=StatementsBarnett&amp;StatId=7298 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509103749/http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/pages/StatementDetails.aspx?listName=StatementsBarnett&amp;StatId=7298 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 May 2013 |title=Changes to allow limited use of segways |website=Minister for Transport, Western Australia |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/taxis/19073.asp#27055 |title=Electric Personal Transporters (EPT) (Segways) |website=Department of Transport, Western Australia |date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;New Zealand
In New Zealand the Segway PT is classed as a [[mobility device]], in the same category as a mobility scooter or electric wheelchair. Mobility Devices must be ridden on footpaths where possible, at a speed that does not endanger others, and give way to pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Segway NZ [http://www.segway.co.nz/support/regulatory.html "Segway - Support - Regulatory Information"]. Retrieved 28 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling might not be consistently applied: in 2011, police in [[Taupo]] had to stop using Segways because there is no separate vehicle classification that applies to them, requiring their registration as roadworthy in the same manner as cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/20/3117618.htm | title=Police Segways fall foul of NZ law | author=AFP | publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | date=20 January 2011 | accessdate=13 February 2011 | authorlink=Agence France-Presse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photoemission spectroscopy''' ('''PES'''), also known as '''photoelectron spectroscopy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)|file=P04609}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to energy measurement of electrons emitted from solids, gases or liquids by the [[photoelectric effect]], in order to determine the binding energies of electrons in a substance. The term refers to various techniques, depending on whether the [[ionization]] energy is provided by an [[X-ray]] [[photon]], an [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] photon, or an [[ultraviolet]] photon. Regardless of the incident photon beam, however, all photoelectron spectroscopy revolves around the general theme of surface analysis by measuring the ejected electrons.&lt;ref name=Hercules84&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ed061p402 |title= Analytical chemistry of surfaces. Part I. General aspects |date=1984 |last1=Hercules |first1=D. M. |last2=Hercules |first2=S.H. Al |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=61 |pages=402 |bibcode = 1984JChEd..61..402H |issue= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) was developed by [[Kai Siegbahn]] starting in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.105.1676 |title=Precision Method for Obtaining Absolute Values of Atomic Binding Energies |date=1957 |last1=Nordling |first1=Carl |last2=Sokolowski |first2=Evelyn |last3=Siegbahn |first3=Kai |journal=Physical Review |volume=105 |pages=1676 |bibcode = 1957PhRv..105.1676N |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokolowski E. |author2=Nordling C. |author3=Siegbahn K. |journal=Arkiv för Fysik |volume=12 |pages=301 |date=1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to study the energy levels of atomic core electrons, primarily in solids. Siegbahn referred to the technique as "electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis" (ESCA), since the core levels have small [[Chemical shift#Other chemical shifts|chemical shifts]] depending on the chemical environment of the atom that is ionized, allowing chemical structure to be determined. Siegbahn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1981 for this work. XPS is sometimes referred to as PESIS (photoelectron spectroscopy for inner shells), whereas the lower-energy radiation of UV light is referred to as PESOS (outer shells) because it cannot excite core electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Introduction to Photoelectron Spectroscopy |date=1983 |last1=Ghosh |first1=P. K. |publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-06427-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ultraviolet and visible region, the method is usually referred to as photoelectron spectroscopy for the study of gases, and photoemission spectroscopy for solid surfaces.

[[Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) is used to study valence energy levels and chemical bonding, especially the bonding character of molecular orbitals. The method was developed originally for gas-phase molecules in 1961 by [[Feodor Ivanovich Vilesov|Feodor I. Vilesov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vilesov |first1=F. I. |last2=Kurbatov |first2=B. L. |last3=Terenin |first3=A. N. | title=Electron Distribution Over Energies In Photoionization Of Aromatic Amines in Gaseous Phase |journal=Soviet Physics, Doklady |date=1961 |volume=6 |page=490 |bibcode = 1961SPhD....6..490V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1962 by [[David W. Turner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1733134 |title=Determination of Ionization Potentials by Photoelectron Energy Measurement |date=1962 |last1=Turner |first1=D.

Frost, J. H. D. Eland and K. Kimura. Later, [[Richard Smalley]] modified the technique and used a UV laser to excite the sample, in order to measure the binding energy of electrons in gaseous molecular clusters.

[[Two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy]] (2PPE) extends the technique to optically excited electronic states through the introduction of a pump-and-probe scheme.

Extreme-ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (EUPS) lies in between XPS and UPS. It is typically used to assess the valence band structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/aeschlimann/pdf/paper_00000012.pdf |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.025501 |title=Direct Observation of Surface Chemistry Using Ultrafast Soft-X-Ray Pulses |date=2001 |last1=Bauer |first1=M. |display-authors=4 |last2=Lei |first2=C. |last3=Read |first3=K. |last4=Tobey |first4=R. |last5=Gland |first5=J. |last6=Murnane |first6=M. |last7=Kapteyn |first7=H. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=87 |pages=025501 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87b5501B |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611022022/http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/aeschlimann/pdf/paper_00000012.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to XPS, it gives better energy resolution, and compared to UPS, the ejected electrons are faster, resulting in less space charge and mitigated final state effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Corder |first=Christopher |last2=Zhao |first2=Peng |last3=Bakalis |first3=Jin |last4=Li |first4=Xinlong |last5=Kershis |first5=Matthew D. |last6=Muraca |first6=Amanda R. |last7=White |first7=Michael G. |last8=Allison |first8=Thomas K. |date=2018-01-24 |title=Ultrafast extreme ultraviolet photoemission without space charge |eprint=1801.08124 |class=physics.optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=He |first=Yu |last2=Vishik |first2=Inna M. |last3=Yi |first3=Ming |last4=Yang |first4=Shuolong |last5=Liu |first5=Zhongkai |last6=Lee |first6=James J. |last7=Chen |first7=Sudi |last8=Rebec |first8=Slavko N. |last9=Leuenberger |first9=Dominik |date=January 2016 |title=Invited Article: High resolution angle resolved photoemission with tabletop 11 eV laser |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |language=en |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=011301 |doi=10.1063/1.4939759 |pmid=26827301 |issn=0034-6748 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Roberts |first=F.

==Physical principle==
The physics behind the PES technique is an application of the [[photoelectric effect]]. The sample is exposed to a beam of UV or XUV light inducing photoelectric ionization. The energies of the emitted photoelectrons are characteristic of their original electronic states, and depend also on vibrational state and rotational level. For solids, photoelectrons can escape only from a depth on the order of nanometers, so that it is the surface layer which is analyzed.

Because of the high frequency of the light, and the substantial charge and energy of emitted electrons, photoemission is one of the most sensitive and accurate techniques for measuring the energies and shapes of electronic states and molecular and atomic orbitals. Photoemission is also among the most sensitive methods of detecting substances in trace concentrations, provided the sample is compatible with ultra-high vacuum and the analyte can be distinguished from background.

Typical PES (UPS) instruments use helium gas sources of UV light, with photon energy up to 52 eV (corresponding to wavelength 23.7&amp;nbsp;nm). The photoelectrons that actually escaped into the vacuum are collected, energy resolved, slightly retarded and counted, which results in a spectrum of electron intensity as a function of the measured kinetic energy. Because binding energy values are more readily applied and understood, the kinetic energy values, which are source dependent, are converted into binding energy values, which are source independent. This is achieved by applying Einstein's relation &lt;math&gt;E_k=h\nu-E_B&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; term of this equation is due to the energy (frequency) of the UV light that bombards the sample. Photoemission spectra are also measured using [[synchrotron radiation]] sources.

The binding energies of the measured electrons are characteristic of the chemical structure and molecular bonding of the material. By adding a source monochromator and increasing the energy resolution of the electron analyzer, peaks appear with [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) less than 5–8 meV.

The dragon fruit is cultivated in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], and throughout [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] world regions.

== Vernacular names of ''Hylocereus'' ==
These fruits are commonly known in English as "dragon fruit", reflecting its vernacular Asian names. The names ''pitahaya'' and ''pitaya'' derive from Mexico, and ''pitaya roja'' in Central America and northern South America, possibly relating to pitahaya for names of tall cacti species with flowering fruit.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_768_2005-01-11.html|title=Dragon fruit|publisher=National Library Board, Singapore Government|date=2017|accessdate=19 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121174239/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_768_2005-01-11.html|archivedate=21 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==

=== ''Stenocereus'' ===
''[[Stenocereus]]'' fruit (sour pitayas) are a variety that is commonly eaten in the arid regions of the Americas. They are more sour and refreshing, with juicier flesh and a stronger taste. The sour pitaya or ''pitaya agria'' (''[[Stenocereus gummosus|S. gummosus]]'') in the [[Sonoran Desert]] has been an important food source for [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The [[Seri people]] of northwestern Mexico still harvest the fruit, and call the plant ''ziix is ccapxl'' "thing whose fruit is sour". The fruit of related species, such as ''[[Stenocereus queretaroensis|S. queretaroensis]]'' and the dagger cactus (''[[Stenocereus griseus|S. griseus]]''), are also locally important foods. The fruit of the organ pipe cactus (''[[Stenocereus thurberi|S. thurberi]]'', called ''ool'' by the Seris) is the ''pitaya dulce'' "sweet pitaya". It still has a more tart aroma than ''Hylocereus'' fruit, described as somewhat reminiscent of [[watermelon]]; it has some uses in [[traditional medicine]].

=== Dragon fruit ''Hylocereus'' ===
[[File:Dragon fruit.JPG|thumb|upright|Ripe dragon fruit, Vietnam]]
Sweet pitahayas come in three types, all with leathery, slightly leafy skin:
* ''[[Hylocereus undatus]]'' (''Pitaya blanca'' or white-fleshed pitahaya) has pink-skinned fruit with white flesh. This is the most commonly seen "dragon fruit".
* ''[[Hylocereus costaricensis]]'' (''Pitaya roja'' or red-fleshed pitahaya, also known as ''Hylocereus polyrhizus'') has red-skinned fruit with red flesh.

Early imports from [[Colombia]] to [[Australia]] were designated ''[[Hylocereus ocampensis]]'' (supposedly, the red fruit) and ''[[Cereus triangularis]]'' (supposedly, the yellow fruit). It is not quite certain to which species these [[taxa]] refer, though the former is probably the red pitaya.

The fruit normally weighs from {{convert|150 to 600|g}}; some may reach {{convert|1|kg}}.

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Pitaya (seedling).jpg|thumb|right|Pitaya seedling]]
[[File:Lianjiang County - Dongdai Town - Yangguang Dragong Fruit Farm - P1510432.JPG|thumb|A dragon fruit field in China]]

After thorough cleaning of the seeds from the pulp of the fruit, the seeds may be stored when dried. Ideally, the fruit is unblemished and overripe.

Seeds grow well in a compost or potting soil mix – even as a potted indoor plant. Pitaya cacti usually germinate after between 11 and 14 days after shallow planting. As they are cacti, overwatering is a concern for home growers. As their growth continues, these climbing plants will find something to climb on, which can involve putting aerial roots down from the branches in addition to the basal roots. Once the plant reaches a mature 10 pounds in weight, the plant may flower.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}
&lt;!-- This sentence implies that pitaya maturity is measured by the plant's weight. Is that true? If so, why? --&gt;

Commercial plantings can be done at high density with between 1100 and 1350 plants per hectare. Plants can take up to five years to come into full commercial production, at which stage yields of 20 to 30 tons per hectare can be expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amorentia.co.za/dragon-fruit/|title=Dragon Fruit - Amorentia Sweet Dragon Fruit|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitaya flowers bloom overnight and usually wilt by the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles R.|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=978-1-56164-372-1|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They rely on nocturnal [[pollinator]]s such as [[bat]]s or [[moth]]s for fertilization. Self-fertilization will not produce fruit in some species, and while cross-breeding has resulted in several "self-fertile" varieties, cross-pollinating with a second plant species generally increases fruit set and quality. This limits the capability of home growers to produce the fruit. However, the plants can flower between three and six times in a year depending on growing conditions. Like other cacti, if a healthy piece of the stem is broken off, it may take root in soil and become its own plant.

The plants can endure temperatures up to {{convert|40|C|F}} and very short periods of frost, but will not survive long exposure to freezing temperatures. The cacti thrive most in [[hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 10–11, but may survive outdoors in zone 9a or 9b.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/home-garden/article1977019.html|title=Dragon fruit surprisingly easy to grow|publisher=Miami Herald|author=Setzer, Kenneth|date=26 July 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143829/http://www.miamiherald.com/living/home-garden/article1977019.html|archivedate=20 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hylocereus'' has adapted to live in dry tropical climates with a moderate amount of rain. The dragon fruit sets on the cactus-like trees 30–50 days after flowering and can sometimes have 5-6 cycles of harvests per year. In numerous regions, it has escaped cultivation to become a weed and is classified as an [[invasive weed]] in some countries.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

=== Pests and diseases ===
Overwatering or excessive rainfall can cause the flowers to drop and fruit to rot. Also,  extended over-watering can cause maturing fruit to split on the branch. Birds can be a nuisance. The [[bacterium]] ''[[Xanthomonas campestris]]'' causes the stems to rot. ''[[Dothiorella]]'' [[fungi]] can cause brown spots on the fruit, but this is not common. Other fungi known to infect pitaya include ''Botryosphaeria dothidea'', ''Colletotrichum gloesporioides'' and ''Bipolaris cactivora''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valencia-Botín|first1=Alberto J.|last2=Kokubu|first2=Hirotaka|last3=Ortíz-Hernández|first3=Yolanda D.|title=A brief overview on pitahaya (Hylocereus spp.) diseases|journal=Australasian Plant Pathology|date=2013|volume=42|issue=4|pages=437–440|doi=10.1007/s13313-012-0193-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plyscraper''' is a [[skyscraper]] made of wood. They may alternatively be known as [[mass timber]] buildings.  The use of bulk timber gives high fire resistance, as a char layer forms in the event of fire.  They [[carbon sink|lock up carbon]] during construction.  They are inherently resistant to ground movement, due to the properties of the timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraperdictionary.com/?project=plyscraper|title=Skyscraper Dictionary » Plyscraper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plyscrapers|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/07/tall-buildings|website=The Economist|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shadbolt|first1=Peter|title=The skyscrapers made from wood|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/tech/wooden-skyscrapers-plyscraper/|website=CNN|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ravenscroft|first1=Tom|title=Meet the new generation of ‘plyscrapers’|url=http://thespaces.com/2016/02/03/meet-the-new-generation-of-plyscrapers/|website=The Spaces|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plyscrapers on the Rise|url=https://www.forestfoundation.org/woodland-plyscrapers-on-the-rise|website=www.forestfoundation.org|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridgway|first1=Andy|title=Future stuff: Wood|journal=New Scientist|date=October 2014|volume=224|issue=2990|pages=41|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(14)61961-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|accidental power failures|intentionally engineered ones|rolling blackout}}
[[File:Calle Larga at night during power cut.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Vehicle lights provide the only illumination during the [[2009 Ecuador electricity crisis]]]]
A '''power outage''' (also called a '''power cut''', a '''power out''', a '''power blackout''',  '''power failure''' or a '''blackout''') is a short-term or a long-term loss of the [[electric power]] to a particular area.

There are many causes of power failures in an electricity network. Examples of these causes include faults at [[power station]]s, damage to [[Electric power transmission|electric transmission lines]], [[Electrical substation|substations]] or other parts of the [[electricity distribution|distribution]] system, a [[short circuit]], or the overloading of electricity mains.

Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as [[hospital]]s, [[sewage treatment]] plants, [[mining|mines]], shelters and the like will usually have backup power sources such as [[emergency power system|standby generators]], which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as [[telecommunication]], are also required to have emergency power. The [[battery room]] of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]] for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage.

== Types of power outage ==
[[File:PowerOutageBlackout.svg|thumb|Blackout]]
[[File:PowerOutageDropout.svg|thumb|Transient fault]]
Power outages are categorized into three different phenomena, relating to the duration and effect of the outage:
* A permanent fault is a massive loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line. Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared.
* A [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]  is a drop in [[volt]]age in an electrical power supply. The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags.  Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation.
* A blackout is the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur. Blackouts which result from or result in [[power station]]s tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly. Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network.

== Protecting the power system from outages ==
[[File:Crossed wires.JPG|thumb|right|Tree limbs creating a short circuit in electrical lines during a storm. This typically results in a power outage in the area supplied by these lines]]
In [[grid (electricity)|power supply networks]], the power generation and the electrical load (demand) must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components, which can severely damage them. [[Protective relay]]s and [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage.

Under certain conditions, a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a [[cascading failure]] of a larger section of the network. This may range from a building, to a block, to an entire city, to an entire [[electrical grid]].

Modern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure, but it may be unavoidable (see below). Moreover, since there is no short-term economic benefit to preventing rare large-scale failures, researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time, which is only corrected after a major failure occurs.  In a 2003 publication, Carreras and co-authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones.&lt;ref name="ref2003" /&gt;  In that case, the short-term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large-scale blackouts.

The [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] held a hearing in October 2018 to examine "[[black start]]", the process of restoring electricity after a system-wide power loss. The hearing's purpose was for Congress to learn about what the backup plans are in the electric utility industry in the case that the electric grid is damaged. Threats to the electrical grid include cyberattacks, solar storms, and severe weather, among others. For example, the "[[Northeast blackout of 2003|Northeast Blackout of 2003]]" was caused when overgrown trees touched high-voltage power lines. Around 55 million people in the U.S. and Canada lost power, and restoring it cost around $6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/policy/15388-senate-hearing-examines-electric-industrys-ability-to-restore-power-after-system-wide-blackouts/|title=Senate hearing examines electric industry's ability to restore power after system-wide blackouts|last=Dave|first=Kovaleski|date=2018-10-15|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protecting computer systems from power outages ==
Computer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power.  These can include data networking equipment, video projectors, alarm systems as well as computers. To protect computer systems against this, the use of an [[uninterruptible power supply]] or 'UPS' can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time. To protect against surges (events where voltages increase for a few seconds), which can damage hardware when power is restored, a special device called a [[surge protector]] that absorbs the excess voltage can be used.

== Restoring power after a wide-area outage ==
Restoring power after a wide-area outage can be difficult, as power stations need to be brought back on-line. Normally, this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid. In the total absence of grid power, a so-called [[black start]] needs to be performed to [[Bootstrapping#Electric power grid|bootstrap]] the power grid into operation. The means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies, but typically [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] utilities will establish localized 'power islands' which are then progressively coupled together. To maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process, demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored, requiring close coordination between power stations, transmission and distribution organizations.

== Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability ==

=== Self-organized criticality ===
It has been argued on the basis of [[List of power outages|historical data]]&lt;ref name="ref2002a"&gt;[http://www.computer.org/proceedings/hicss/1435/volume2/14350063abs.htm IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and computer modeling&lt;ref name="ref2002b"&gt;[http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/HICSS2002-paper2.pdf Microsoft Word – HICSS2002-paper2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hh2014&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[power grid]]s are [[self-organized criticality|self-organized critical systems]]. These systems exhibit unavoidable&lt;ref name="ref2000"&gt;http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~dobson/PAPERS/carrerasHICSS00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; disturbances of all sizes, up to the size of the entire system.  This phenomenon has been attributed to steadily increasing demand/load, the economics of running a power company, and the limits of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="ref2007"&gt;Dobson et al. Complex systems analysis of series of blackouts: Cascading failure, critical points, and self-organization. Chaos 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point, it generally isn’t economically feasible, causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point.  Conversely, a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system-wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point.  The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures.  Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a [[power law|power-law]] distribution.&lt;ref name=hh2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2007" /&gt;  

Other leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable, but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed.  The [[Electric Power Research Institute]] champions the use of [[smart grid]] features such as power control devices employing [[phasor measurement unit|advanced sensors]] to coordinate the grid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleh|first=M.

[[Cascading failure]] becomes much more common close to this critical point.  The power-law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems.&lt;ref name="ref2007" /&gt;  The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random, unavoidable disturbances due to aging, weather, human interaction etc.   While near the critical point, these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load.  This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system, making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail, igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures.&lt;ref name="ref2007" /&gt;  These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances (cutting back trees, separating lines in windy areas, replacing aging components etc.).  The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify.

=== OPA model ===
In 2002, researchers at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL),  Power System Engineering Research Center of the [[University of Wisconsin]] (PSerc),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Power Systems Engineering Research Center |publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System |year=2014
|url=http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/home/index.aspx |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] proposed a mathematical model for the behavior of electrical distribution systems.&lt;ref name="opa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carreras|first1=B. A.|last2=Lynch|first2=V. E.|last3=Dobson|first3=I.|last4=Newman|first4=D.

This model has become known as the OPA model, a reference to the names of the authors' institutions.
OPA is a cascading failure model.  Other cascading failure models include Manchester, Hidden failure, CASCADE, and Branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.ijepes.2006.03.006| title=Criticality in a cascading failure blackout model| journal=International Journal of Electrical Power &amp; Energy Systems| volume=28| issue=9| pages=627| year=2006| last1=Nedic| first1=Dusko P.| last2=Dobson| first2=Ian| last3=Kirschen| first3=Daniel S.| last4=Carreras| first4=Benjamin A.| last5=Lynch| first5=Vickie E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitigation of power outage frequency ===
The effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental.  Four mitigation methods have been tested using the ''OPA'' blackout model:&lt;ref name="ref2003"&gt;{{cite conference
 | last1=Carreras|first1=B. A.
 | last2=Lynch|first2=V. E.
 | last3=Newman|first3=D. E.
 | last4=Dobson|first4=I.
 | title = [http://www.ece.wisc.edu/~dobson/PAPERS/carrerasHICSS03.pdf Blackout mitigation assessment in power transmission systems]
 | booktitle = 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences
 | place = Hawaii
 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.
* Increase individual power line max load – Shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts.
* Combination of increasing critical number and max load of lines – Shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout.  The resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation.
* Increase the excess power available to the grid – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.

In addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost-benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts, the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above-mentioned mitigation measures.&lt;ref name="ref2003" /&gt;

A complex network-based model to control large [[cascading failure]]s (blackouts) ''using local information only'' was proposed by A. E. Motter.&lt;ref name="Motter2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.098701|title=Cascade Control and Defense in Complex Networks|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=93|issue=9|year=2004|last1=Motter|first1=Adilson E.|arxiv=cond-mat/0401074|bibcode=2004PhRvL..93i8701M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the proposed solutions proposed to reduce the impact of power outage was introduced by M. Saleh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleh|first=M.

The '''Renault Symbol''', or '''Thalia''' in some markets, is a [[subcompact car]] produced by the French automobile manufacturer [[Renault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renault.com/en/Vehicules/renault/Pages/symbol-thalia.aspx |title=Renault Symbol / Thalia |publisher=Renault |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in late 1999, under the '''Clio Symbol''' name, as the [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] version of the second generation [[Renault Clio]], and unlike the hatchback it was marketed only in those countries where saloons were traditionally preferred over hatchbacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/renault-clio-symbolthalia-2000.html |title=Renault Clio Symbol/Thalia 2000 |publisher=Autoevolution |date= |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it was not available in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renault.com/fr/produits/clio_symbol.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205181509/http://www.renault.com/fr/produits/clio_symbol.htm |archivedate=2005-02-05 |title=Clio Tricorps : une petite familiale robuste |publisher=Renault |quote=Clio Tricorps est disponible hors d'Europe occidentale. |language=French |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation has a different design than the third generation Clio and is built on the platform of the first generation car. A third generation has been introduced in late 2012, as a [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the second generation [[Dacia Logan]].

Its key markets are Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]], most notably countries like Turkey, Brazil, Romania, Russia, Algeria, Colombia and Tunisia.&lt;ref name="press_release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renault.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Communiqu%C3%A9%20de%20presse/en-EN/Pieces%20jointes/12267_L65_ph4_DP_Ang_diff_complet.pdf#page=6 |page=6 |title=Press release |publisher=Renault |date=2006-09-04 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; __TOC__{{Clear}}

In Colombia, it was added the [[automatic transmission]] in 2004 to the Symbol ''Expression'', and the new interior of the facelift model was added in 2008, with some differences from the European version, including the location of the electric window controls, the seats and the radio, and it kept the exterior of the phase II Symbol. The ''Alizé'' model included front electric windows and driver airbag; the ''Expression'' included electric mirrors, digital clock, passenger airbag, ABS and foglights. The 2008 model also included a 1.6 litre petrol engine, replacing the 1.4 litre one.

The Nissan Platina was available only with the 1.6 litre 16-valve petrol engine (110&amp;nbsp;hp; 82&amp;nbsp;kW).

In the first half of 2005, minor changes were done to the Renault models. These included clear tail lights and side repeaters, a slightly modified grille and some of the display units passing form analogue to digital.

In the beginning of 2006, an improved version of the sedan was offered in Argentina and Brazil, and from fall in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clio 4 Puertas|url=http://www.renault.com.ar/opencms/SecVehiculos/Automoviles/Clio4Puertas/index.html|publisher=Renault Argentina|accessdate=2011-10-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206192411/http://www.renault.com.ar/opencms/SecVehiculos/Automoviles/Clio4Puertas/index.html|archivedate=2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the exterior, it now had body coloured bumpers, without moldings and regardless of the trim level. The shape of the grille was revised and the boot got a new handle with the Renault logo integrated, similar to the one used on [[Renault Laguna|Laguna]], as well as the new styling of the Renault word. Four new colours were made available and two distinctive new rim designs.

This model was offered in three equipment levels: ''Authentique'', ''Expression'' and ''Dynamique''. 
''Expression'' included driver airbag, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, electric front windows, CD-player and height adjustable steering wheel. ''Dynamique'' added passenger airbag, ABS, rear electric windows, body coloured door handles and alloy rims, although the ABS and passenger airbag were optionals that could be added to the lower levels too. Automatic air conditioning was available as an extra feature.&lt;ref name="autoshow" /&gt;

The second generation uses the running gear of the previous generation car and has a different design than the third generation Clio. The name Clio was dropped in favour to just '''Symbol''', or '''Thalia''' in those markets where this name was used on the previous generation.

It was revealed for the first time in August 2008 at the Moscow International Motor Show and went on sale between September and November. The second generation car is longer than the previous by {{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and has a boot capacity of {{Convert|506|L|cuft}}.&lt;ref name="august_2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renault.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Communiqu%C3%A9%20de%20presse/en-EN/Pieces%20jointes/17545_PR_Reveal_SYMBOL_GB.pdf |title=New Renault Symbol, an elegant three-box saloon with seductive appeal |publisher=Renault |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2011-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323000531/http://www.renault.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Communiqu%C3%A9%20de%20presse/en-EN/Pieces%20jointes/17545_PR_Reveal_SYMBOL_GB.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Symbol was designed jointly by Renault's engineering teams in France, Turkey and Romania, for countries in the Eastern and Central Europe, Russia, Turkey, North Africa and as well the Persian Gulf States. Development of the project (codenamed ''L35'') took 26 months.&lt;ref name="august_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://renaultconcepts.online.fr/news/symbol.htm |title=Nouvelle Symbol : fer de lance des pays émergents |publisher=Renault Concepts |language=French |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main production site remains the [[Oyak-Renault]] plant in [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]], and from 2009 it is also manufactured in [[Santa Isabel, Córdoba|Santa Isabel]], [[Argentina]], for the South American market and only with the 1.6 litre 16-valve engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.renault.com/download/media/specialfile/8149_1_5.aspx |title=Renault launches new Renault Symbol in South America |publisher=Renault |quote=New Renault Symbol will be manufactured for the argentine and brazilian market at the Santa Isabel (Cordoba) plant in Argentina. |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is available in three equipment levels: ''Authentique'', ''Expression'' and ''Privilège''. Features included by ''Authentique'' are driver [[airbag]], [[Tachometer|rev-counter]] or body-coloured front and rear bumpers. ''Expression'' adds hydraulic power steering, [[trip computer]], electric front windows, height adjustable steering wheel and front seats, folding rear bench seat, rear headrests and body-coloured mirrors and electric [[central locking]] with remote control. ''Privilège'' adds electric mirrors, leather-trimmed steering wheel, [[Automotive lighting#Front fog lamps|foglamps]], rear electric windows and [[Compact Disc player|radio-CD player]] with MP3 playback.&lt;ref name="august_2008"/&gt;

In terms of safety, the new Symbol offers driver airbag, passenger airbag, two [[Airbag#Side airbag|lateral airbags]] (depending on version), [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD), anti-intrusion strengthening in front and rear doors, height-adjustable front seatbelts, power steering and rear [[parking sensors]].&lt;ref name="august_2008"/&gt;

In December 2008, the second generation of the Renault Symbol was awarded the "Autobest 2009" prize, by a jury made up of journalists from fifteen countries, mainly emerging markets in Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The 'Autobest 2009' award goes to new Renault Symbol/Thalia|url=http://www.daciagroup.com/en/news/dacia-in-the-news/the-autobest-2009-award-goes-to-new-renault-symbolthalia|work=|publisher=Dacia|accessdate=2014-10-01|date=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also manufactured and sold in Brazil since November 2013, as the Renault Logan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agora bonito, novo Logan parte de R$ 28990|url=http://revistaautoesporte.globo.com/Analises/noticia/2013/11/agora-bonito-novo-renault-logan-parte-de-r-28990.html|publisher=Revista Autoesporte|accessdate=2014-01-12|date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In markets such as Chile it is marketed as the Renault Symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renault.cl/cars/Symbol/home.html|title=Renault - Car Home|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the Renault Symbol began assembly from CKD kits in a new plant in Oran, Algeria.&lt;ref name="media.renault.com"&gt;http://media.renault.com/download/media/specialfile/63217_1_5.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Its production capacity is 25,000 units per year, which may eventually be increased to 75,000 vehicles per year.&lt;ref name="media.renault.com"/&gt;

The model produced for South America (where it is marketed mainly as the Renault Logan) and Turkey and Algeria retains small design differences, both at the exterior and the interior. The interior differs mainly at the central part of the dashboard, whereas the exterior has a different front end design, incorporating the new large Renault badge, a different headlamp configuration and mirror-mounted indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacia.ro/modele-si-preturi/logan/|title=Logan - Dacia|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.renault.com.tr/araclar/binek-araclar/symbol/ozellikler.html|title=Araçlar - Binek Araçlar - Renault Symbol - Özellikler - Renault Türkiye|work=Renault|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renault.cl/cars/Symbol/galeria.html|title=Renault - accessories|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, it is offered with a 1.2-litre 16-valve petrol engine, developing {{convert|55|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|107|Nm|mkgf|1|abbr=on}}, or a 1.5-litre diesel engine, developing {{convert|66|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|Nm|mkgf|1|abbr=on}}. In both cases, they are coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission. It is available in seven colours and two trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdn.renault.com/content/dam/Renault/TR/global-brochures/SYMBOL-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes in three trim levels: Expression, Dynamique and Privilege.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renault.cl/pdf/ficha_Symbol.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facelift===
In the first quarter of 2017, it was facelifted, receiving design modifications to the front and more significantly to the rear  design, but also to the interior, in Turkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=İşte 2017 model yeni Renault Symbol |url=https://www.automagg.com/iste-2017-model-yeni-renault-symbol/ |publisher=automagg |accessdate=5 November 2018 |language=Turkish |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and nearby export markets) and, as well, in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Renault Symbol Fase II en Chile, correcta remodelación |url=https://noticias.autocosmos.cl/2017/01/25/renault-symbol-fase-ii-en-chile-correcta-remodelacion |publisher=Autocosmos Chile |accessdate=5 November 2018 |language=Spanish |date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important addition is the [[automatic manual transmission]], called Easy-R.

The facelifted model is slightly different in terms of design and even equipment from the Renault Logan offered in the rest of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.renault.cl/modelos/pasajeros/symbol/dise%C3%B1o.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.renault.com.ar/autos/automoviles/logan/disenio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rooftop photovoltaic power station''', or '''rooftop PV system''', is a [[photovoltaic system]] that has its [[electricity]]-generating [[solar panel]]s mounted on the rooftop of a residential or commercial building or structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.absoluterv.com/help-and-resources/solar-rooftops/case-solar-energy-parking-lots/ | title=The Case for Solar Energy Parking Lots | publisher=Absolute Steel | date=12 November 2014 | accessdate=15 November 2014 | author=Armstrong, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various components of such a system include [[photovoltaic module]]s, [[Photovoltaic mounting system|mounting systems]], [[Solar cable|cables]], [[solar inverter]]s and other electrical accessories.&lt;ref name="bef"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bef-de.org/fileadmin/files/Our_Topics/Energy/energy_efficient_buildings_in_the_Baltic_States/p2_photovoltaic-power_motiekaitis_lt.pdf |title = Photovoltaic power generation in the buildings. Building integrated photovoltaic–BIPV|publisher = bef-de.org|accessdate = 2011-06-20|work = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooftop mounted systems are small compared to ground-mounted [[photovoltaic power station]]s with capacities in the [[megawatt]] range. Rooftop PV systems on residential buildings typically feature a capacity of about 5 to 20 [[kilowatts]] (kW), while those mounted on commercial buildings often reach 100 kilowatts or more.

== Installation ==

[[File:Googleplex solar power.jpg|thumb|Rooftop PV systems at [[Googleplex]], [[California]]]]

The urban environment provides a large amount of empty rooftop spaces and can inherently avoid the potential land use and environmental concerns. Estimating rooftop solar insolation is a multi-faceted process, as insolation values in rooftops are impacted by the following:
* Time of the year
* [[Latitude]]
* Weather conditions
* Roof slope
* Roof aspect
* Shading from adjacent buildings and vegetation&lt;ref name=greenip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenip.org/files/EPO.SOLAR.doc|title=Energy Resources and Resource Criteria|publisher=greenip.org|accessdate=2011-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828234234/http://www.greenip.org/files/EPO.SOLAR.doc|archivedate=2013-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feed-in tariff mechanism ==

In a [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid connected]] rooftop photovoltaic power station, the generated electricity can sometimes be sold to the servicing electric utility for use elsewhere in the grid.  This arrangement provides payback for the investment of the installer. Many consumers from across the world are switching to this mechanism owing to the revenue yielded.  A [[public utility commission]] usually sets the rate that the utility pays for this electricity, which could be at the retail rate or the lower wholesale rate, greatly affecting solar power payback and installation demand.

The FIT as it is commonly known has led to an expansion in the solar PV industry worldwide. Thousands of jobs have been created through this form of subsidy. However it can produce a bubble effect which can burst when the FIT is removed. It has also increased the ability for localised production and embedded generation reducing transmission losses through power lines.&lt;ref name=bef/&gt;

== Hybrid systems ==
[[File:Onduleur hybride 2.JPG|thumb|right|Rooftop PV hybrid system.]]
A rooftop photovoltaic power station (either on-grid or off-grid) can be used in conjunction with other power components like [[diesel generator]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, batteries etc. These [[solar hybrid power systems]] may be capable of providing a continuous source of power.&lt;ref name=bef/&gt;

== Advantages ==

Installers have the right to feed solar electricity into the public grid and hence receive a reasonable premium tariff per generated kWh reflecting the benefits of solar electricity to compensate for the current extra costs of PV electricity.&lt;ref name=bef/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

An electrical power system containing a 10% contribution from PV stations would require a 2.5% increase in load frequency control (LFC) capacity over a conventional system{{Technical statement|date=December 2015}} - in issue which may be countered by using [[synchronverter]]s in the DC/AC-circuit of the PV system. The break-even cost for PV power generation was in 1996 found to be relatively high for contribution levels of less than 10%. Higher proportions of PV power generation gives lower [[break-even]] costs, but economic and LFC considerations imposed an upper limit of about 10% on PV contributions to the overall power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asano|first1=H. |last2=Yajima|first2=K. |last3=Kaya|first3=Y. |date=Mar 1996|title=Influence of photovoltaic power generation on required capacity for load frequency control|journal=IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion|volume=11|issue=1|pages=188–193 |publisher=IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society|doi=10.1109/60.486595 |issn=0885-8969 |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=486595 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical Challenges ==

There are many technical challenges to integrating large amounts of rooftop PV systems to the power grid. For example: 
*'''Reverse Power Flow''' 
: The electric power grid was not designed for two way power flow at the distribution level. Distribution feeders are usually designed as a radial system for one way power flow transmitted over long distances from large centralized generators to customer loads at the end of the distribution feeder. Now with localized and distributed solar PV generation on rooftops, reverse flow causes power to flow to the substation and transformer, causing significant challenges. This has adverse effects on protection coordination and voltage regulators. 
*'''Ramp rates'''
:Rapid fluctuations of generation from PV systems due to intermittent clouds cause undesirable levels of voltage variability in the distribution feeder. At high penetration of rooftop PV, this voltage variability reduces the stability of the grid due to transient imbalance in load and generation and causes voltage and frequency to exceed set limits if not countered by power controls. That is, the centralized generators cannot [[ramp up|ramp fast enough]] to match the variability of the PV systems causing frequency mismatch in the nearby system. This could lead to blackouts. This is an example of how a simple localized rooftop PV system can affect the larger power grid. The issue is partially mitigated by distributing solar panels over a wide area, and by adding [[Grid energy storage|storage]].

In 2018, the national average cost in the United States, after tax credits, for a 6kW residential system was $3.14, with a typical range of $2.71 to $3.57, according to one commericial website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How much do solar panels cost in the U.S. in 2018? |url=https://news.energysage.com/how-much-does-the-average-solar-panel-installation-cost-in-the-u-s/ |publisher=energysage |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, solar companies used various financing plans for customers such as leases and power purchase agreements. Customers could pay for their solar panels over a span of years, and get help with payments from credits from net metering programs. As of May 2017, installation of a rooftop solar system costs an average of $20,000. In the past, it was more expensive.&lt;ref name="utilitydivewealthy"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.utilitydive.com/news/is-rooftop-solar-just-a-toy-for-the-wealthy/441373/ |title=Is rooftop solar just a toy for the wealthy?|last=Shallenberger|first=Krysti |date=2017-04-27|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2017-05-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utility Dive wrote, "For most people, adding a solar system on top of other bills and priorities is a luxury" and "rooftop solar companies by and large cater to the wealthier portions of the American population."&lt;ref name="utilitydivewealthy" /&gt;

Most households that get solar arrays are "upper middle-income". The average household salary for solar customers is around $100,000.&lt;ref name="utilitydivewealthy" /&gt;

However, "a surprising amount of low-income" customers appeared in a study of income and solar system purchases. "Based on the findings of the study, GTM researchers estimate that the four solar markets include more than 100,000 installations at low-income properties."&lt;ref name="utilitydivewealthy" /&gt;

A report released in June 2018 by the [[Consumer Energy Alliance]] (CEA) that analyzed U.S. solar incentives showed that a combination of federal, state and local incentives, along with the declining net cost of installing PV systems, has caused a greater usage of rooftop solar across the nation. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', "In 2016, residential solar PV capacity grew 20 percent over the prior year, the report said. The average installed cost of residential solar, meanwhile, dropped 21 percent to $2.84 per watt-dc in the first quarter of 2017 versus first quarter 2015."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/reports/13077-government-incentives-for-rooftop-solar-often-greater-than-systems-total-cost-cea-report-finds/|title=Government incentives for rooftop solar often greater than system’s total cost, CEA report finds|last=Galford|first=Chris|date=2018-06-14|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in eight states the group studied, the total government incentives for installing a rooftop solar PV system actually exceeded the cost of doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future prospects ==

The [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission]] of the [[Indian government]] is planning to install utility scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems including rooftop photovoltaic systems with the combined capacity of up to 100 gigawatts by 2022.&lt;ref name=wri&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pdf.wri.org/power_to_the_people.pdf |title=POWER TO THE PEOPLE-Investing in Clean Energy for the Base of the Pyramid in India|publisher=pdf.wri.org |accessdate=2011-06-20|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website has been developed by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)]] in support of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy#Wind and Water Power Technologies Office|Wind and Water Power Technologies Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://renews.biz/34178/global-ocean-energy-database-goes-live/ Global Ocean Energy Database Goes Live]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanenergy-europe.eu/index.php/en/communication/press-corner/69-us-energy-department-launches-new-database-to-support-sustainable-development-of-ocean-energy-resources US Energy Department Launches New Database to Support Sustainable Development of Ocean Energy Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Tethys hosts information and activities associated with two international collaborations known as Annex IV and WREN, formed to examine the environmental effects of marine renewable energy projects and wind energy projects, respectively.

== Content overview ==

As industry, academia, and government seek to develop new renewable energy sources from moving water and wind, there exists an opportunity to gather potential environmental effects of these technologies.  Tethys aims to evaluate and measure these effects to ensure that [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] and [[bird|avian]] animals, [[habitat]]s, and [[ecosystem|ecosystem functions]] are not adversely affected, nor that important ocean and land uses are displaced. While these studies are presently scattered among different organizations, Tethys attempts to create a centralized hub where this information can be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=1056 Tethys: A robust source of information on marine energy, offshore wind projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Each document is labeled with an environmental "stressor", "receptor", and "interaction" which categorize the type of potential harm, the affected area of the environment, and the means by which the potential impact may occur. The categories and the technology types covered are listed below:

== Annex IV ==

Annex IV is a collaborative project among member nations of the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Ocean Energy Systems (OES) to examine environmental effects of ocean energy projects and research. There is currently a wide range of ocean energy technologies and devices in development around the world; the few data that exist on environmental effects of these technologies are dispersed amongst different countries and developers. While the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] is the operating agent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/articles/energy-department-leads-international-efforts-unlock-ocean-energy Energy Department Leads International Efforts to Unlock Ocean Energy]&lt;/ref&gt; currently (as of January 2018) 12 out of 25 national involved in the OES initiative are involved: [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and [[United States|the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocean-energy-systems.org/ocean_energy_in_the_world/ Ocean Energy in the World]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three phases of this initiative:

=== Phase 1: 2010-2013 ===

While encouraging collaboration, products included two international workshops, a report, and a collection of metadata forms on project sites and research studies. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-experts-workshop-2010 first workshop] was held in [[Dublin|Dublin Ireland]] in September 2010, drawing 58 international experts from various backgrounds to identify key interactions between device and environment, look into data collection details, and to scope out case studies for the report. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-experts-workshop-2012 second workshop] was also held in [[Dublin|Dublin Ireland]] in October 2012, drawing 55 international experts from nine countries to review Tethys for content and functionality, to provide feedback on the report, and to guide future Annex IV activities. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Final%20Annex%20IV%20Report%202013%20v2.pdf final report] focused on three case studies:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalmarinerenewable.com/images/pdf/METS_PAPERS_VII/83-Copping.pdf Annex IV - Investigating the Environmental Effects of Wave and Tidal Devices through International Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Interaction of Marine Animals with Turbine Blades
# Effects of Acoustic Output from Tidal and Wave Devices on Marine Animals
# The Environmental Effects of Marine Energy Development on Physical Systems

The metadata collection effort included project sites that were performing environmental baseline studies and/or monitoring studies and relevant research studies that were underway. Over 150 forms were collected, providing details on nearly every project that has been deployed to date and on the most current research being conducted. All of this metadata is hosted in Tethys along with associated reports and publications.

=== Phase 2: 2013-2016 ===

Due to the success of the first phase, a second phase was suggested by all parties involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonwave.org/news/international-journal-marine-energy-highlights-tethys-project/ International Journal of Marine Energy Highlights Tethys Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The primary vision was to identify analysts for each country involved, who could act as representative point of contact for all the Annex IV activities. Activities included maintaining and collecting metadata forms, expanding Tethys to support a community of experts, five international workshops, and a report.

The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/nnmrec-workshop-instrumentation-monitoring-around-marine-renewable-energy-devices first workshop] was held in [[Seattle|Seattle USA]] in June 2013, sponsored by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center, drawing 36 international experts to discuss instrumentation around devices. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-workshop-best-practices-monitoring-environmental-effects-marine-energy-devices second workshop] was held in [[Stornoway|Stornoway UK]] in April 2014, drawing 45 international participants to discuss best practices for monitoring around devices. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-workshop-environmental-monitoring-regulatory-needs-scientific-capabilities third workshop] was held in [[Wolfville|Wolfville Canada]] in November 2014, drawing 25 international participants to identify environmental monitoring, regulatory needs, and scientific capabilities to encourage the progression of the industry. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-workshop-state-science fourth workshop] was held in [[Nantes|Nantes France]] in September 2015, drawing 61 international participants to review the planned state of the science report. The [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/annex-iv-workshop-collision-risk-marine-mammals-and-tidal-turbines fifth workshop] was held in [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh UK]] in February 2016, drawing 40 international participants to examine the collision risk for marine mammals around tidal turbines. These workshops were supplemented with a strong presence at most international conferences on marine renewable energy and the environment.

A thriving international community was fostered through online events such as quarterly webinars and the occasional expert forum, where topical experts from around the world would engage in discussion around controversial subjects. Bi-weekly newsletters and the collection and dissemination of information have also contributed to the international community. The culmination of this phase of Annex IV came with the publication of the [https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/state-of-the-science-2016 2016 State of the Science report],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smruconsulting.com/final-annex-iv-state-science-report/ Final Annex IV State of the Science Report Released Today!]&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed description of the environmental effects of marine renewable energy development around the world, derived from years of international cooperation around these issues. The executive summary of the report is available in seven languages and summaries of each environmental issue is available in English.

=== Phase 3: 2016-2020 ===

Annex IV has been approved for a 4-year extension consisting of three interrelated tracks: (1) information gathering and analysis, (2) information dissemination, and (3) engaging the community to support research and monitoring needs. This phase will continue most ongoing activities, while expanding to engage the regulatory community and address socio-economic issues. The phase will again culminate with a large report and conference partnerships.

== WREN ==

WREN ('''W'''orking Together to '''R'''esolve '''En'''vironmental Effects of Wind Energy), also known as Task 34, was established by the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Wind Committee to address environmental issues associated with commercial development of land-based and offshore wind energy projects. While the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]] is the operating agent, currently (as of January 2018) 11 out of 24 nations involved in IEA Wind are involved: [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and [[United States|the United States]]. There has been two phase of this initiative:

=== Phase 1: 2012-2016 ===

The goal of WREN is to facilitate international collaboration that advances global understanding of environmental effects of offshore and land-based wind energy development, though the formation of a community of practice around research, monitoring and management of the environmental effects of wind energy development. Two key products were developed during phase 1: 1) Tethys was expanded to include land-based wind and host WREN activities and 2) a white paper focused on adaptive management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieawind.org/summary_tasks_web/summary_page_34.html Task 34 - WREN – Working Together to Resolve Environmental Effects of Wind Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 2: 2016-2020 ===

The second phase of WREN will include the expansion of Tethys, development of several white papers, continuation of the webinar series, and outreach and engagement efforts. All these activities are aimed at contributing to supporting the expansion of land-based and offshore wind energy deployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://programme.exordo.com/wwrm2016/delegates/presentation/45/ Expansion of WREN – An International Collaborative Under International Energy Agency Wind]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Additional functionality is regularly added to Tethys in response to peer reviews, surveys, and general comments from users. However, there are primary functions of Tethys that allow users to experience community, search through the data, and learn more about the new and exciting field of renewable energy.

=== Knowledge Base ===

The Knowledge Base is primarily displayed as a table view that utilizes the alphabetical column sorting, facet box selection, and keyword search to allow users to easily sift through the information. Over 3300 media entries relevant to the environmental effects of wind and marine [[renewable energy]] are available, consisting of [[Article (publishing)|journal articles]], [[reports]], [[websites]], [[proceedings|conference papers]], [[presentations]], [[proceedings|workshop articles]], [[thesis|theses]], [[books]], [[book|book sections]], [[video]]s, [[data set|datasets]], [[Article (publishing)|magazine articles]], project site information, and research study information. This is a growing database, where relevant materials that are newly published or discovered will be added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwaveenergy.org/open-wave-energy-project-resource-and-industry/environment.html TETHYS The marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) Environmental Impacts Knowledge Management System]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Map Viewer ===

The interactive Map Viewer shows the locations of geo-tagged project sites, [[research|research studies]], and documents gathered from across the world. More than 2100 items appear on the map, a subset of the information available in the Knowledge Base. Users may interact with the map with zooming and panning functions, facet box selection, and a keyword search. Selecting one of the icons will reveal a specific page with more in-depth information. This is a growing database, where relevant materials that are newly published or discovered will be added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/13/new-tethys-database-offers-real-world-data-guidance-for-responsible-ocean-energy-development/ New Tethys Database Offers Guidance For Responsible Ocean Energy Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connections ===

In an effort to connect members of this growing community, Tethys is meant to act as a hub, providing resources and contacts for those looking for more information. One way is by providing links to similar [[databases]] that may have different approaches to viewing data, or that may provide a different focus on the data collected. Another page lists summaries of the [[Regulation|regulatory frameworks]] in many of the major countries, providing links to agencies and laws rather than going into detail. There is also an extensive database of nearly 1200 organizations involved in marine and wind renewable energy and the environment, providing a list of publications affiliated with the organization and some basic information. Members of the Tethys community that have created a free account also have the ability to share their contact information and interests to with other community members in a searchable table.

=== Broadcasts ===

Tethys also houses [[multimedia]] in the broadcast tab, meant to engage users in the Tethys community. Everything is freely available to the public and easily searchable.
* Environmental Webinars - webinars on environmental effects of marine or wind energy, hosted by US DOE, Annex IV, WREN, and other organizations.
* Conferences and Workshops - presentations, reports, and video from conferences and workshops on environmental effects of marine or wind energy.

Tethys began in 2011 hosted on a [[Semantic MediaWiki]] platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214166913000301 | doi=10.1016/j.ijome.2013.11.004 | volume=3-4 | title=Tethys: Developing a commons for understanding environmental effects of ocean renewable energy | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Marine Energy | pages=41–51 | last1 = Copping | first1 = Andrea | last2 = Smith | first2 = Courtney | last3 = Hanna | first3 = Luke | last4 = Battey | first4 = Hoyt | last5 = Whiting | first5 = Jonathan | last6 = Reed | first6 = Michael | last7 = Brown-Saracino | first7 = Jocelyn | last8 = Gilman | first8 = Patrick | last9 = Massaua | first9 = Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but migrated to [[Drupal]] in early 2013. Drawing on many years of experience and systems development, developers have tailored the website to allow for [[semantic search]]es and the organization of data through tagging individual files, documents, and [[multimedia]] products. Content is regularly monitored and curated, though suggestions from the user community are always welcome.

== Future plans ==

While Tethys is already internationally recognized as a leading resource for information on environmental impacts of offshore [[renewable energy]], upcoming goals are to build a strong community that can address environmental concerns by pooling international experience and information. This will involve activities such as regular [[blogging]], quarterly [[webinars]], online expert forums, [[academic conference|conference]] engagement, and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://tethys.pnnl.gov/about-annex-iv About Annex IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Genius of Birds''''' is a 2016 book by [[Nature writing|nature writer]] [[Jennifer Ackerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jenniferackermanauthor.com/genius-ofbirds/

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

''The Genius of Birds'' highlights new findings and discoveries in the field of [[bird intelligence]]. The book explores birds as thinkers (contrary to the cliché "[[wikt:birdbrain|bird brain]]") in the context of observed behavior in the wild and brings to it the scientific findings from lab and field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=Jennifer |date=12 April 2016 |title=The Genius of Birds |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Press |page= |isbn=1594205213 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New research suggests that some birds, such as those in the family [[Corvidae#Intelligence|corvidae]], can rival primates and even [[human intelligence|humans]] in forms of [[intelligence]]. Much like humans, birds have [[Brain size|enormous brains]] relative to the rest of their bodies.

Ackerman highlights the complex social structures of avian society. They are capable of [[Abstraction|abstract thinking]], problem solving, recognizing faces, gift giving, sharing, grieving, and meaningful communication with humans. Ackerman goes in depth to highlight scientific studies that uncover behavior such as [[Bird_intelligence#Tool_use|tool usage]], speaking in regional accents, navigation, and [[theory of mind]].

==Reception==
The book is a [[New York Times Bestseller]],&lt;ref&gt;

Yuma is the principal city of the Yuma, Arizona, [[Yuma metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which consists of Yuma County. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the 2014 estimated population of the Yuma MSA is 203,247.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2014/index.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2015-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012957/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2014/index.html|archivedate=May 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 85,000 retirees make Yuma their winter residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greateryuma.org/cityofyuma.html?GCCID=e6a74205f313379e0e0fee06668ddc4a |title=City of Yuma |accessdate=2007-06-23 |publisher=Greater Yuma Economic Development Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094622/http://www.greateryuma.org/cityofyuma.html?GCCID=e6a74205f313379e0e0fee06668ddc4a |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuma is located in the [[Sonoran Desert]], [[Yuma Desert]] sub-region.

==History==
[[File:Fort Yuma California 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Yuma, California, circa 1875]]
[[File:YumaLanding1885.jpg|thumb|left|Steamboats on the Colorado River at Yuma, circa 1880]]
[[File:Yuma Crossing and RR bridge in 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Yuma Crossing in 1886.  The railway bridge over the Colorado River was built in 1877.]]
The area's first settlers for thousands of years were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures and historic tribes. Their descendants now occupy the [[Cocopah]] and [[Quechan]] [[Indian reservation|reservations]].

In 1540, Spanish colonial expeditions under [[Hernando de Alarcon]] and [[Melchior Diaz]] visited the area and immediately recognized the natural crossing of the Colorado River as an ideal spot for a city. The [[Colorado River]] narrows to slightly under 1,000 feet wide in one area. Military expeditions that crossed the Colorado River at the [[Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area|Yuma Crossing]] include [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] (1774), the [[Mormon Battalion]] (1848) and the [[California Column]] (1862).

During and after the [[California Gold Rush]] to the late 1870s, the Yuma Crossing was known for its ferry crossings for the [[Southern Emigrant Trail]]. This was considered the gateway to California, as it was one of the few natural spots where travelers could cross the otherwise very wide Colorado River.

===First settlements===

Following the United States establishing [[Fort Yuma]], two towns developed one mile downriver. The one on the California side was called [[Jaeger City, California|Jaeger City]], named after the owner of Jaeger's Ferry, which crossed the river there.  It was for a time the larger of the two, with the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] office and station, two blacksmiths, a hotel, two stores, and other dwellings.&lt;ref name="Lingenfelter"&gt;[http://www.ansac.az.gov/UserFiles/PDF/08182014/X028_FMIBurtellLingenfelterSteamboats/FMI%20Lingenfelter%20Steamboats/Steamboats%20on%20the%20Colorado%20River%201852-1916.pdf Richard E. Lingenfelter, ''Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916,'' University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118031332/http://www.ansac.az.gov/UserFiles/PDF/08182014/X028_FMIBurtellLingenfelterSteamboats/FMI%20Lingenfelter%20Steamboats/Steamboats%20on%20the%20Colorado%20River%201852-1916.pdf |date=2016-01-18 }}, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The other was called '''[[Colorado City, Yuma County, Arizona|Colorado City]].''' Developed on the south side of the river in what is now Arizona by speculator [[Charles Debrille Poston|Charles Poston]], it was the site of the [[custom house]]. When started, it was just north of the border between Mexican-ruled Sonora, Mexico and California.  After the [[Gadsden Purchase]] by the United States, the town bordered on the [[Territory of New Mexico]]. This area was designated as the [[Territory of Arizona]] in 1863.  The Colorado City site at the time was duly registered in [[San Diego]]; both banks of the Colorado River just below its [[confluence]] with the [[Gila River|Gila]] were recognized as being within the jurisdiction of California.  The [[county of San Diego]] collected taxes from there for many years.&lt;ref name="Lingenfelter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/hav1/body.1_div.19.html |title=Chapter Xix. Early Settlements And First Attempts At Organization Of Territory |publisher=Southwest.library.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1853 a smaller settlement, '''[[Arizona City (Yuma, Arizona)|Arizona City]],''' grew up on the high ground across from the fort and was organized under the name of its post office in 1858.  It had adobe dwellings, two stores and two saloons. Colorado City and Jaeger City were almost completely destroyed by the [[Great Flood of 1862]] and had to be rebuilt on higher ground. At that time Colorado City became part of Arizona City.&lt;ref name="Lingenfelter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Edwin Farish, ''History of Arizona, Volume I.'' The Filmer Brothers Electrotype Company, San Francisco, 1915. pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;  It took the name '''Yuma''' in 1873.

===Early development===

From 1854, Colorado City was the major steamboat stop for traffic up and down the Colorado River.  After the 1862 flood, it became part of Arizona City.  The steamboats transported passengers and equipment for the various mines and military outposts along the Colorado; Colorado City was the terminus of wagon traffic up the Gila River into New Mexico Territory.  They offloaded the cargo from ships at the mouth of the Colorado River at [[Robinson's Landing]] and from 1864 at [[Port Isabel, Sonora|Port Isabel]].  From 1864, the [[Yuma Quartermaster Depot]], today a state historic park, supplied all forts in present-day Arizona, as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became a separate territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, replacing [[La Paz, Arizona|La Paz]], the first seat.

The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] bridged the river in 1877, and acquired [[George Alonzo Johnson]]'s [[Colorado Steam Navigation Company]], the only steamboat company on the river.  Yuma became the new base of navigation on the river, ending the need for Port Isabel, which was abandoned in 1879.  The warehouses and shipyard there were moved to Yuma.

==Government==
[[File:City Council of Yuma,AZ, USA.png|thumb|right|A meeting of the City Council of Yuma.]]

===Organization===
The city of Yuma operates as a [[charter city]]  under the Charter of the City of Yuma.&lt;ref name=CHARTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Arizona/yuma/yumacitycodeyumaarizona?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:yuma_az|title=Yuma City Code: Yuma, Arizona|website=American Legal Publishing Corporation |publisher=American Legal Publishing Corporation|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elected government of the city is the City Council which follows the [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council government system]] and whose members include the following:

===Mayor=== 
The Mayor of the City of Yuma acts as the [[chief executive officer]] of the city, and is elected for a period of four years.  The mayor is elected from the city at large. The mayor has the following powers and responsibilities: act as an ex officio chairman of the city council (ensuring that all ordinances thereof are enforced), call and preside over meetings, administer oaths and issue proclamations. The mayor is also recognized as the official head of the city by the courts and has the power to take command of the police and govern the city by proclamation during times of great danger.&lt;ref name=CHARTER /&gt;

===City Council===
The City of Yuma City Council is the governing body of the City of Yuma and is vested with all powers of legislation in municipal affairs. The council is composed of six council members elected from the city at large for four-year terms, as well as the Mayor of Yuma. A deputy mayor is also elected by the Council who shall act as Mayor during the temporary absence of the mayor. 
&lt;ref name=CHARTER /&gt;

===City Administrator===
The City Council appoints a [[City manager|city administrator]] who acts as the [[chief administrative officer]] of the city. The city administrator is directly responsible to the City Council for the administration of all city affairs placed in his charge by the City Charter, or by ordinances passed by the Council. Some of the administrator's duties include: see that all laws and provisions of the City Charter are faithfully executed, prepare and submit the annual budget and capital program to the City Council and keep the City Council fully advised as to the financial condition and future needs of the city.&lt;ref name=CHARTER /&gt;

==Geography==
Yuma is located near the borders of [[California]] to the west and [[Mexico]] to the south, and just west of the [[Gila River]]'s confluence with the [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The city is approximately 60 miles from the [[Gulf of California]] (Sea of Cortez), a branch of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|106.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|106.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.07%) is water.

===Climate===
Yuma is noted for its weather extremes.  Of any populated place in the contiguous United States, Yuma is the driest, the sunniest, and the least humid, has the lowest frequency of precipitation, and has the highest number of days per year&amp;ndash;175&amp;ndash;with a daily maximum temperature of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mean Number of Days Maximum Temperature 90 Deg.

Yuma features a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), with extremely hot summers and warm winters. Atmospheric humidity is usually very low except during what are called "[[Gulf surge]]s", when a maritime tropical air mass from the Gulf of California is drawn northward, usually in connection with the [[North American Monsoon|summer monsoon]] or the passage of a tropical storm to the south.

The sun is said to shine during about 90% of the daylight hours, making Yuma the sunniest place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/s/m/factsheet09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604050938/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/s/m/factsheet09.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual mean sunshine duration of 4,015 h would have been recorded in the desert city.&lt;ref name="Extremes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Osborn | first = Liz | title = Sunniest Places and Countries in the World | publisher = Current Results Nexus | url = http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php | accessdate = February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, Yuma receives {{convert|3.36|in|mm}} of rain annually. Even in the wettest year of 2005, only {{convert|7.39|in|abbr=on}} fell. The driest year at Yuma Airport has been 2007, with only {{convert|0.15|in|abbr=on}} recorded. On average, August and September are the wettest months of the year, while June is the driest.

In 1995, Yuma reached its all-time high of {{convert|124|°F|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellicast.com/Local/History.aspx?location=USAZ0275|title=Intellicast - Yuma Historic Weather Averages in Arizona (85365)|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-6|C|F|abbr=on}} on the Yuma-Mesa area in January 2007.  The temperature fell to {{convert|-6|C|F|abbr=on}} for approximately two hours and harmed many crops grown in and around Yuma. The crop that suffered the most damage was the citrus on the Yuma mesa, most notably the lemon crop. It suffered a 75% to 95% loss of crop and trees, as stated by the Arizona Department of Agriculture in a February 2007 report. On average, the temperature lowers to the freezing mark in less than a quarter of years, and there are 118 days per year that reach or exceed {{convert|100|°F|0}}, usually from April through October. During July and August the temperature fails to reach the century mark on at most, only a few days.

In 1997, the desert city sustained a full [[tropical storm]] after [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Hurricane Nora]] made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at the mouth of the Colorado River and quickly moved due north along it. This rare event cut power to 12,000 customers in Yuma, and dropped {{convert|3.59|in|mm}} of rain at [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma]]. The last time a hurricane had hit near Yuma was in mid-August 1977, when similar falls were recorded.
