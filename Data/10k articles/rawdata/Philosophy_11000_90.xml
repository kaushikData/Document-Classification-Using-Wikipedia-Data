'''Anishinabe Spiritual Centre''' ({{Lang-oj| Wassean-dimi-Kaning}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] centre for [[Ignatian spirituality]] and training in ministry run by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Espanola, Ontario]], specifically for the local [[First Nation]] people in the area. It is situated to the south of Espanola, on the shore of Anderson Lake, just off [[Ontario Highway 6]]. Since it was founded, it has been the only place in northern Ontario that has offered Roman Catholic ministerial training to [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jesuits.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.work.retreat|title = Retreat and Spirituality Centres|date = |accessdate = 9 January 2015|website = Jesuits in English Canada|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
After the [[Second Vatican Council]], there were efforts made in Canada to increase the number of [[permanent deacon]]s. From 1972 until 1979, there was a diaconate training programme, run by the Jesuits, in northern Ontario. It was supported by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie, Ontario|Bishop of Sault Sainte Marie]] [[Alexander Carter]]. It only lasted seven years, because of the fatigue of those travelling round offering training. It was decided that a permanent location was needed for the programme.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.anishinabespiritualcentre.ca/about-the-centre-2/our-history Our history] from AnishinabeSpiritualCentre.ca, retrieved 18 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Money was raised to build a site. Funds came from the Jesuits, and the Roman Catholic dioceses of Sault Sainte Marie, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hearst|Hearst]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Thunder Bay|Thunder Bay]]. The centre was built by volunteers who also created a sawmill on site to help with the construction. It started in 1982. By 1984, the main building and the chapel were completed. In 1985, the remaining outlying buildings were finished. In June 1985, it was opened by [[Alexander Carter|Bishop Carter]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Establishment===
Although its main purpose was to train men for the diaconate. The centre also trained women for the Diocesan Order of Women. Eventually, the Diocesan Order of Women changed to become Diocesan Order of Service, which both men and women could train for. In addition, monthly Ministries weekends are provided at the centre for Roman Catholics across northern Ontario.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

In the 1990s, a group of First Nation people from the centre brought the nearby Heaven's Gate [[Long-distance trail|trail]], back into usage. Originally, it was an old trade route used by their ancestors. It runs 40 kilometres across the spine of the [[La Cloche Mountains|La Cloche Mountain range]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2013/09/28/journey-with-jim-knocking-on-heavens-gate Journey with Jim: Knocking on Heaven's Gate] from ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', 28 September 2013, retrieved 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parishes==

In 1971, the original building was destroyed in a propane tank explosion. The new building, constructed in 1972, was influenced by the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s decrees on [[liturgy]]. It is a round building, with a conical roof; the shape of a teepee. Inside the church, the stations of the cross were painted by [[Leland Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manitoulin-island.com/communities/westbay.html West Bay] from Manitoulin-island.com, retrieved 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/Ontario-s-Places-of-Worship/Inventory/Search-results-details.aspx?ItemID=781 Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church] from [[Ontario Heritage Trust]], retrieved 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelwithachallenge.com/Ontario-Manitoulin-Island.html Manitoulin Island] from TravelWithAChallenge.com, retrieved 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BlackSun.svg|thumb|The "Black Sun" symbol from Wewelsburg castle]]
The '''black sun''' (German {{lang|de|Schwarze Sonne}}) is a symbol employed by the [[SS]] during the [[Nazi era]], and in a post-[[Third Reich]] context by [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and some [[occult]] subcultures, such as [[Satanism]]. The first known occurrence of the symbol is on a green and white mosaic on a floor in [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]] remodeled and expanded under [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig runes]], symbols employed as a logo by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''. All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the "black sun" (and therefore also its name) developed from the influence of a popular German novel first published in 1991.

==Wewelsburg mosaic==
[[File:Schwarze_Sonne_Obergruppenführersaal_(SS_Generals%27_Hall).jpg|thumb|The former SS Generals' Hall (German: ''Obergruppenführersaal'') on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle with the dark green sun wheel mosaic located on the floor in the center of the hall]]
In 1933, [[Heinrich Himmler]] acquired [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]]. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2003: 148-150).&lt;/ref&gt;

A product of Himmler's remodeling, the symbol widely known today as the "Black Sun" consists of twelve circular sig runes on the floor of the structure's north tower (the ''Obergruppenführersaal''). The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative [[Merovingian]] discs dating from the early medieval period (see ''[[Zierscheibe]]''). The objects received notable discourse during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

In 1991, writer [[Russell McCloud]] published the popular novel ''Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo'' (German 'The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') which scholar [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] describes as an "occult-Nazi thriller". In the novel, McCloud links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the occult concept of the black sun, which had been introduced in the 1950s by the [[Landig Group]] as a replacement for the [[swastika]] and as a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the [[Aryan]] race. After the publication of the novel, the Wewelsburg symbol became popularly known as the "Black Sun".&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

==Neo-Nazism, white nationalism, and the alt-right==
The symbol has historically remained prominent in neo-Nazi occult circles, wherein it occurs frequently in print publications and on associated websites.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt; However, the symbol also sees frequent use in many [[neo-Nazi]], [[alt-right]], and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] more generally, as seen, for example, on imagery used by [[Vanguard America]] during the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in August 2017.&lt;ref name="PORTER-2017"&gt;Porter (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Azov Battalion]], a [[National Guard of Ukraine]] regiment widely associated with neofascism, employs the symbol in an official capacity as an emblem element, along with the Wolfsangel.&lt;ref name="LUHN-2014"&gt;Luhn (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by the Church of Satan==
Along with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the [[Wolfsangel]], the [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig rune]], and the [[totenkopf]], the black sun is used by adherents of the [[Church of Satan]] and other [[Satanism|Satanists]]. According to scholar Chris Mathews:

{{quote|In defending their use, Satanists draw attention to their historical origins, as most have origins that precede their Nazi application, some stretching centuries back into the past. [Specifically], they adopt the primary iconography of the SS, the Nazi's own elite order. With these symbols, many of the pre-Nazism connections are questionable. Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is [[Nazi occultism]], for which Nazi Satanic groups and [[Esoteric Nazism|esoteric neo-Nazis]] adopt it.&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp;q=black+sun&amp;chrome_dont_add_custom_search_engines_srsly=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathews (2009: 153)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mathews notes that Satanists sometimes combine Nazi imagery, such as when the Church of Satan's online store sold Wolfsangel rings by presenting them before a Black Sun background. Mathews says, "Despite the systematic exploitation of ambiguity, any denial that Nazi symbols are being used ''as'' Nazi symbols is both disingenuous and unconvincing."&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"/&gt;

==Pop culture==
In 2018, the symbol appeared on merchandise for Colombian pop singer [[Shakira]]'s [[El Dorado World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/shakira-selling-nazi-like-trinket-for-el-dorado-tour/a-44301030 | title=Shakira selling Nazi-like trinket for El Dorado tour | date=19 June 2018 | publisher=Deutsche Welle | accessdate=5 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Live Nation Entertainment]], "The necklace Live Nation designed for Shakira’s ‘El Dorado World Tour’ was based on pre-Colombian imagery ... However, some fans have expressed concern that the design bears an unintentional resemblance to neo-Nazi imagery. We sincerely apologize for this inadvertent similarity and have permanently pulled the item from the tour collection".&lt;ref name="SHAKIRA"&gt;Park (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">In [[epistemology]], the '''coherence theory of truth''' regards [[truth]] as coherence within some specified set of sentences, [[proposition]]s or beliefs. The model is contrasted with the [[correspondence theory of truth]].

A positive tenet is the idea that truth is a property of whole systems of propositions and can be ascribed to individual propositions only derivatively according to their coherence with the whole. While modern coherence theorists hold that there are many possible systems to which the determination of truth may be based upon coherence, others, particularly those with strong religious beliefs hold that the truth only applies to a single absolute system.  In general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within the whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple formal coherence. For example, the coherence of the underlying set of concepts is considered to be a critical factor in judging [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. In other words, the set of base concepts in a [[universe of discourse]] must form an intelligible paradigm before many theorists consider that the coherence theory of truth is applicable.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

In [[modern philosophy]], the coherence theory of truth was defended by [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Millan, ''Friedrich Schlegel and the Emergence of Romantic Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 2012, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; and [[Harold Joachim|Harold Henry Joachim]] (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/joachim/ Harold Henry Joachim (1868—1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/ The Correspondence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily [[Brand Blanshard]] (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt;

==Varieties==
According to one view, the coherence theory of truth regards [[truth]] as coherence within some specified set of sentences, [[proposition]]s or beliefs.&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/ The Coherence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the "theory of knowledge which maintains that truth is a property primarily applicable to any extensive body of consistent propositions, and derivatively applicable to any one proposition in such a system by virtue of its part in the system".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, A. Cornelius (1962), "Coherence Theory of Truth", in Dagobert D. Runes (ed.), ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas like this are a part of the philosophical perspective known as ''[[confirmation holism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. V. Quine|Quine, W. V.]], and Ullian, J. S. (1978), ''The Web of Belief'', Random House, New York, NY, Chapter VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Coherence theories of truth claim that coherence and consistency are important features of a theoretical system, and that these properties are ''sufficient'' to its truth. To state it in the reverse, that "truth" exists only within a system, and doesn't exist outside of a system.

According to another version by [[H. H. Joachim]] (the philosopher credited with the definitive formulation of the theory, in his book ''The Nature of Truth'', published in 1906), truth is a ''systematic coherence'' that involves more than [[logical consistency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/joachim/ Harold Henry Joachim (1868—1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this view, a proposition is true to the extent that it is a necessary constituent of a systematically coherent whole. Others of this school of thought, for example, [[Brand Blanshard]], hold that this whole must be so interdependent that every element in it necessitates and even entails every other element. Exponents of this view infer that the most complete truth is a property solely of a unique coherent system, called the ''absolute'', and that humanly knowable propositions and systems have a degree of truth that is proportionate to how fully they approximate this ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Charles A. (1962), "Truth", in Dagobert D. Runes (ed.), ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ rp|321–322}}

==Criticism==
Perhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is [[Bertrand Russell]]'s.&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; He maintained that since both a belief and its [[negation]] will, individually, cohere with at least one set of beliefs, this means that contradictory beliefs can be shown to be true according to coherence theory, and therefore that the theory cannot work. However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs, but the set of beliefs that people actually hold. The main problem for a coherence theory of truth, then, is how to specify just this particular set, given that the truth of which beliefs are actually held can only be determined by means of coherence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Eduardo Rabossi''' (1930&amp;ndash;2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosopher]] and [[human rights]] activist.

== Biography ==
Eduardo Rabossi was born in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 20, 1930 and graduated in Law at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires|University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) in 1955. Afterwards, he obtained his M.A. on philosophy at [[Duke University]]. The UBA was intervened by the military government in 1966, so he resigned to his work as a teacher and worked in investigations at the Oxford university instead.&lt;ref name="murio" /&gt; 

He is credited as a pioneer of [[analytic philosophy]] in Argentina. He was one of the founders and president of SADAF, the Argentine Society of Analytic Philosophy and the editor of its journal, ''[[Análisis filosófico]]''. He created that organization alongside Genario Carrió, Gregorio Klimovsky and Carlos Alchourrón, after his return from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="murio" /&gt; 

He was designated by President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] member of the [[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|CONADEP]], the national Commission to determine the fate of ''[[desaparecidos]]''. The work was included in the ''Nunca más'' report. He was also appointed Undersecretary of Human Rights. He was also a member of [[APDH]]. He was called as a witness in the [[Trial of the Juntas]], to explain his work for the CONADEP. He also helped Uruguay to clarify the fate of 130 Uruguayan died in Argentina during the [[Dirty War]].&lt;ref name="murio" /&gt; 

He died in [[Cusco|Cuzco]], [[Perú]] on November 11, 2005, while participating in a professional congress.&lt;ref name="murio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/755956-murio-el-filosofo-eduardo-a-rabossi|title= Murió el filósofo Eduardo A.

'''Evolutionary baggage''' is the part of the [[genome]] of a population that was advantageous in past individuals but is disadvantageous under the pressures exerted by [[natural selection]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Appenzeller, T. 1999. "Test tube evolution catches time in a bottle." ''Science.'' 284: 2108-2110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Gene]]s that may have been advantageous in the past may be critically unfit for individuals in today’s environment. Natural selection is not a perfect process; if an organism is “fit enough” to survive a particular environment and reproduce, its genes are passed on to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Thanukos&gt;Thanukos, A. 2008. "Views from understanding evolution: [[parasite]]s and [[pathogen]]s take the leap." ''Evolution:Education and Outreach'' 1:25-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these genes may increase an organism’s fitness while some may even be slightly disadvantageous. This seeming paradox is the origin of evolutionary baggage, which is the collectively inherited traits that evolved in a different environment from the present.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;  In the case of humans, the result is a “[[Paleolithic]]” genome, which is not adapted to today’s environment and is contributing to “diseases of civilization,” including [[atherosclerosis]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;Spotorno, A.E. 2005. "Evolutionary medicine: an emergent basic science." ''Rev. Med. Chile.'' 133:231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other hypotheses link evolutionary baggage to genetic diseases. Since all organisms descended from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], evolutionary baggage can be seen universally among organisms.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;

==Diet==
It is a fundamental biological concept that organisms are most fit if they eat the same diet which their evolution has adapted them to. Throughout history, humans adapted to a diet by living off the land. Today, humans maintain the same genes that have been evolved from our ancestors and adapted to the diet they consumed. This has created a mismatch between the modern diet and lifestyle (which has emerged in evolutionary terms very recently), and the diet and lifestyle to which the human body has slowly adapted to over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=OKeefe&gt;O'Keefe, J.H. and L. Cordain. 2004. "Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer." ''Mayo. Clin. Proc.'' 79: 101-108.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be considered evolutionary baggage because the deviation from the [[Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition|Paleolithic diet]] and lifestyle has led to “diseases of civilization” such as obesity, [[hypertension]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt;

The human body adapted over time to crave [[calorie]]-dense foods and to store energy efficiently because our ancestors did not have abundant food; this is called the [[thrifty gene hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; These adaptations are genetic baggage today, causing humans to store fat efficiently despite abundant food availability. This leads to obesity, which is an important [[risk factor]] for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; However, studies have shown that consuming a [[Paleolithic diet|Paleolithic-type diet]] rich in unprocessed foods and lean protein decreased [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] level while increasing [[glucose]] tolerance.&lt;ref name="pmid19209185"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.4 |title=Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet |year=2009 |last1=Frassetto |first1=L A |last2=Schloetter |first2=M |last3=Mietus-Synder |first3=M |last4=Morris |first4=R C |last5=Sebastian |first5=A |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=947–955 |pmid=19209185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sickle-cell and malaria==
As a recessive gene, Sickle-cell disease is only present if homozygous, with no dominant gene to beat them out. Sickle-cell disease, originating in people living in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, is a [[hereditary]] blood disorder characterized by rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells.. The unusual shape and rigidity of these altered red blood cells reduces a cell’s ability to effectively travel with regular blood flow, occasionally blocking veins and preventing proper blood flow. Life expectancy is shortened for people with sickle-cell disease, though modern medicine has significantly lengthened the life expectancy of someone with this disease. As detrimental as the effects of sickle-cell disease seem, it also offers an unforeseen benefit; humans with the sickle-cell gene show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria, as the abnormal shape of blood cells caused by the disease hinder the malaria parasite’s ability to invade and replicate within these cells.&lt;ref name=Wellems&gt;Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM (September 2009). "The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities". J. Clin. Invest.119 (9): 2496–505.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have the sickle-cell allele, but not have the disease, for example if heterozygous.
	
[[Malaria]], a [[mosquito]]-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals, is a potentially deadly disease that causes fever, fatigue, nausea, muscular pain, coughing, and, in extreme cases, coma and death. Malaria is caused by parasitic [[protozoans]] transferred through mosquito saliva into a person’s circulatory system, where they travel to the liver to mature. Though eliminated in the U.S., there were an estimated 219 million documented cases of malaria in 2010 according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=Nayyar&gt;Nayyar GML, Breman JG, Newton PN, Herrington J (2012). "Poor-quality antimalarial drugs in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa".Lancet Infectious Diseases 12 (6): 488–96.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The correlation between [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[malaria]] is a double-edged sword. Having a sickle-cell allele does limit the life expectancy of a person, however, the presence of sickle-cell genes reduces the detrimental effects of malaria should it be contracted. Natural selection allowed for the spreading of the sickle-cell gene in areas of high numbers of mosquitoes carrying malaria; those that weren't as susceptible to malaria were much more likely to live than those that were. Because malaria is not as prevalent as it once was, the benefits of sickle-cell have since eroded, leaving behind the detrimental effects of the disease.

==Implications==
Evolutionary baggage from our ancestors may be causing disease in individuals today. In our ancestors, these phenotypes conferred selective advantage against harsh climate, [[infectious disease]] and scarce food. However, since these conditions are less common in today’s world, individuals with these [[phenotype]]s are at a selective disadvantage. This disadvantage has major implications in the area of [[health care]] because some of the diseases caused by evolutionary baggage are major contributors to the rising cost of health care in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''Fugara''' ({{lang-ar|فجرا}}), are the central figures of [[Bedouin]] [[shamanism]]. Fugara means 'weak' as these individuals are known to avoid hefty meals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acacialand.com/Shamans.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are masters of desert mysticism and are believed to have access to the spiritual realm. They provide advice, teaching or spiritual insight to entire tribes, along with tending to the sick.

'''Gerald Allan''' "'''Jerry'''" '''Cohen''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|ən}}; 14 April 1941 – 5 August 2009) was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] who held the positions of [[Quain Professor|Quain Professor of Jurisprudence]], [[UCL Law|University College London]] and [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]], [[All Souls College, Oxford]].

== Life and career ==
Born into a communist [[Jew]]ish family in [[Montreal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/ga-cohen-obituary|title=GA Cohen|first=Jane|last=O'Grady|date=10 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen was educated at [[McGill University]], Canada (BA, philosophy and political science) and the [[University of Oxford]] ([[BPhil]], philosophy) where he studied under [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]].

Cohen was assistant lecturer (1963–1964), lecturer (1964–1979) then reader (1979–1984) in the Department of Philosophy at [[University College London]], before being appointed to the Chichele chair at Oxford in 1985.  Several of his students, such as Christopher Bertram, [[Simon Caney]], [[Alan Carter (philosopher)|Alan Carter]], [[Cécile Fabre]], [[Will Kymlicka]], [[John McMurtry]], David Leopold, [[Michael Otsuka]], [[Seana Shiffrin]] and [[Jonathan Wolff (philosopher)|Jonathan Wolff]] have gone on to be important moral and political philosophers in their own right, while another, [[Ricky Gervais]], has pursued a successful career in comedy.

Known as a proponent of [[analytical Marxism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3128-the-labour-theory-of-value-and-the-concept-of-exploitation|title=The Labour Theory of Value and the Concept of Exploitation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding member of the [[September Group]], Cohen's 1978 work ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' defends an interpretation of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]] often referred to as [[technological determinism]] by its critics.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Singer, Peter |title=Marx: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |page=105 |isbn=0-19-285405-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality'', Cohen offers an extensive moral argument in favour of socialism, contrasting his views with those of [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]], by articulating an extensive critique of the [[Lockean]] principle of [[self-ownership]] as well as the use of that principle to defend [[Right-libertarianism|right]] as well as [[Left-libertarianism|left]] [[libertarianism]]. In ''If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?'' (which covers the topic of his [[Gifford Lectures]]), Cohen addresses the question of what [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who subscribe to them.

Cohen was close friends with Marxist political philosopher [[Marshall Berman]].

[[File:Shell game in Berlin.jpg|thumb|[[Shell game]] is a scam portrayed as a guessing game. ]]
A '''guess''' (or an act of '''guessing''') is a swift conclusion drawn from data directly at hand, and held as probable or tentative, while the person making the guess (the '''guesser''') admittedly lacks material for a greater degree of certainty.&lt;ref&gt;James Champlin Fernald, ''English Synonyms and Antonyms'' (1914), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; A guess is also an unstable answer, as it is "always putative, fallible, open to further revision and interpretation, and validated against the horizon of possible meanings by showing that one interpretation is more probable than another in light of what we already know".&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kaplan, ''Ricoeur's Critical Theory'' (2003), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In many of its uses, "the meaning of guessing is assumed as implicitly understood",&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"&gt;Mark Tschaepe, "Gradations of Guessing: Preliminary Sketches and Suggestions", in John R. Shook, ''Contemporary Pragmatism'' Volume 10, Number 2, (December 2013), p. 135-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is therefore often used without being meticulously defined. Guessing may combine elements of [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], and the purely [[random]] selection of one choice from a set of given options. Guessing may also involve the [[intuition]] of the guesser,&lt;ref&gt;Sandra E. Hockenbury, Susan A. Nolan, Don H. Hockenbury, ''Psychology'' (2015), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; who may have a "[[gut feeling]]" about which answer is correct without necessarily being able to articulate a reason for having this feeling.

==Gradations of guessing==
[[File:Adm. Haney flips the coin at the Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|right|Calling a [[coin toss]] to determine which team will take the offense at a sporting event is a paradigm case of a guess that requires minimal consideration of forces influencing the outcome.]]
[[File:Pieczarki marynowane.jpg|thumb|right|The exact number of mushrooms in this jar cannot be determined by looking at it, because not all of the mushrooms are visible. The amount, however, can be guessed or [[estimated]]. ]]
Philosopher Mark Tschaepe, who has written extensively on the [[Science|scientific]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] role of guessing, has noted that there are often-overlooked "gradations" of guessing - that is, different kinds of guesses susceptible to different levels of confidence. Tschaepe defines guessing as "an initial, deliberate originary activity of imaginatively creating, selecting, or dismissing potential solutions to problems or answers to questions as a volitional response to those problems or questions when insufficient information is available to make merely a deduction and/or induction to the solution or answer". He objects to definitions that describe guessing as either forming a "random or insufficiently formed opinion", which Tschaepe deems too ambiguous to be helpful, or "to instantaneously happen upon an opinion without reasoning". Tschaepe notes that in the latter case, the guess might appear to occur without reasoning, when in fact a reasoning process may be occurring so quickly in the mind of the guesser that it does not register as a process.&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt; Tschaepe quotes the description given by [[William Whewell]], who says that this process "goes on so rapidly that we cannot trace it in its successive steps".&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whewell"&gt;[[William Whewell]], ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences: Founded Upon Their History'', Volume 2 (1840), p. 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

A guess that "is merely a hunch or is groundless... is arbitrary and of little consequence [[Epistemology|epistemologically]]".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schiralli, ''Constructive Postmodernism: Toward Renewal in Cultural and Literary Studies'' (1999), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A guess made with no factual basis for its correctness may be called a '''wild guess'''. [[Jonathan Baron]] has said that "[t]he value of a wild guess is l/N + l/N - l/N = l/N", meaning that taking a true wild guess is no different than choosing an answer at random.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Baron]], ''Rationality and Intelligence'' (2005), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[David Stove]] described this process as follows:

{{quote|A paradigm case of guessing is, when captains toss a coin to start a cricket match, and one of them 'calls', say "heads". This cannot be a case of knowledge, scientific knowledge or any other, if it is a case of guessing. If the captain knows that the coin will fall heads, it is just logically impossible for him also to guess that it will. More than that, however: guessing, at least in such a paradigm case, does not even belong on what may be called the epistemic scale. That is, if the captain, when he calls "heads", is guessing, he is not, in virtue of that, believing, or inclining to think, or conjecturing, or anything of that sort, that the coin will fall heads. And in fact, of course, he normally is not doing any of these things when he guesses. He just calls. And this is guessing, whatever else is.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Stove]], ''Popper and After: Four Modern Irrationalists'' (1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In such an instance, there not only is no reason for favoring "heads" or "tails", but everyone knows this to be the case. Tschaepe also addresses the guess made in a coin flip, contending that it merely represents an extremely limited case of guessing a random number. Tschaepe examines such guesses at greater length with the instance of guessing a number between 1 and 100, for which Tschaepe notes that the guesser "has to look for clues that are specific to what or whom is ordering them to guess, as well as possible past scenarios that involved guessing numbers", and once these are exhausted, "there comes a point very early in the process wherein no other clue to an answer exists".&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt; As an exemplary case of guessing that involves progressively more information from which to make a further guess, Tschaepe notes the game of [[Twenty Questions]], which Tschaepe says is "similar to guessing a number that the other person is thinking, but unlike guessing a number as a singular action... allows for combining abductive reasoning with deductive and inductive reasoning".&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt;

An apparently unreasoned guess that turns out to be correct may be called a '''happy guess''',&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt; or a '''lucky guess''',&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Ibe, ''Fundamentals of Applied Probability and Random Processes'' (2014), p. 25, defining a lucky guess in the context of a person making random guesses as "among the questions whose answers she guessed at random".&lt;/ref&gt;  and it has been argued that "a 'lucky guess' is a paradigm case of a belief that does not count as knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Pritchard, Lee John Whittington, ''The Philosophy of Luck'' (2015), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', however, the author has the character, Emma, respond to a character calling a match that she made a "lucky guess" by saying that "a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Austen]], ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As Tschaepe notes, [[William Whewell]] stated that certain scientific discoveries "are not improperly described as happy Guesses; and that Guesses, in these as in other instances, imply various suppositions made, of which some one turns out to be the right one".&lt;ref name="Whewell"/&gt;

By contrast, a guess made using prior knowledge to eliminate clearly wrong possibilities may be called an '''informed guess''' or an '''educated guess'''. Uninformed guesses can be distinguished from the kind of informed guesses that lead to the development of a [[scientific hypothesis]]. Tschaepe notes that "[t]his process of guessing is distinct from that of a coin toss or picking a number".&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt; It has also been noted that "[w]hen a decision must be made, the educated guess of the experts will be the best basis for a decision — an educated guess is better than an uneducated guess".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel E. Wueste, ''Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility'' (1994), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[estimate]] is one kind of educated guess, although often one that involves making a numerical determination, and using some knowledge of known or observable variables to determine the most likely number or range of numbers. A guess, however, may also be purely a matter of selecting one possible answer from the set of possible answers, with little or no basis for making the selection. Another kind of guessing is [[conjecture]], particularly as used in [[mathematics]] to refer to a [[Consequent|conclusion]] or [[proposition]] which appears to be correct based on incomplete information, but for which no [[Formal proof|proof]] has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=JL|title=Shuttling between the particular and the general: reflections on the role of conjecture and hypothesis in the generation of knowledge in science and mathematics.|date=1995|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyKelnvECc4C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22although+counterpoint+between+the+particular+and+the+general%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hIvE9Onw06&amp;sig=U3DTIi0tkie-oZdllilyAT4y1DE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAEwUJeZLazqigK3_IHABQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22although%20counterpoint%20between%20the%20particular%20and%20the%20general%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of guessing==
Tschaepe notes that "guessing has been indicated as an important part of scientific processes, especially with regard to hypothesis-generation".&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt; Regarding scientific hypothesis-generation, Tschaepe has stated that guessing is the initial, creative process involved in abductive reasoning wherein new ideas are first suggested. Following the work of Charles S. Peirce, guessing is "a combination of musing and logical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tschaepe, "Guessing and Abduction" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 50(1) (2014), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

People learn to guess at an early age, and there are many guessing games played by children. In practice, children may find themselves in situations where "guessing is the only strategy they have available to them".&lt;ref name="Zweng"&gt;Harold L. Schoen, Marilyn Zweng, ''Estimation and Mental Computation: 1986 Yearbook' (1986), p. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to cope with these situations, children develop two abilities, "(1) the ability to recognize situations in which guessing is the only reasonable strategy even though it provides no more than a gross estimate; (2) the ability to recognize that different levels of accuracy are possible and acceptable in different situations".&lt;ref name="Zweng"/&gt;

Certain kinds of [[Test (assessment)|exams]], particularly those that involve [[multiple choice]] questions, attempt to penalize exam takers for guessing by giving a small negative score for each wrong answer, so that the average number of correct guesses will be offset by the combined penalty for the average number of incorrect guesses. In such a scenario, however, a guesser who can eliminate one or two wrong answers can still gain overall by guessing from the remaining pool of answers.&lt;ref&gt;Mike McClenathan, ''PWN the SAT: Math Guide: 3rd Edition'' (2014), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|According to [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]], guessing is the end result of a problem, observations of clues, and directedness toward solving the problem. Guessing is the action that brings about “a definite solution” (139). here is a definite process to guessing in Polanyi's account, although he does tend towards Whewell and Hempel in the comparison he makes between discovering hypotheses and Gestalt perception (144).&lt;ref name="Tschaepe"/&gt;}}

Guessing has been asserted to be necessary in [[literary theory]], where "we have to guess the meaning of the text because the author's intention is beyond our reach". Because the reader can never put themselves in exactly the situation the author was in when the text was written, to construe the meaning of the text "is to make a guess".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ricoeur, ''Interpretation Theory: Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning'' (1976), p. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guessing games===
[[File:Game of Charades - 05.jpg|thumb|Game of {{w|Charades}} involves single person acting out a phrase, with the rest of the group guessing the phrase.]]
{{main|riddle}}
A '''guessing game''' is a [[game]] in which the [[Goal|object]] is to use guessing to discover some kind of information, such as a word, a phrase, a title, or the identity or location of an object.&lt;ref name="Literacy"&gt;Vicki Cohen, John Cowen, ''Literacy for Children in an Information Age: Teaching Reading, Writing, and Thinking'' (2007), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word. [[Charades]] is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as ''[[Catch Phrase (game)|Catch Phrase]]'', ''[[Taboo (game)|Taboo]]'', ''[[Pictionary]]'', and similar. The genre also includes many [[game shows]] such as ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' and ''[[$25,000 Pyramid]]''.

Many of the games are played co-operatively. In some games some [[player (game)|player]](s) know the answer, but cannot tell the other(s), instead they must help them to guess it. Guessing games are "readily adaptable for [[classroom]] use", as such a game "creates just enough tension to remain exciting, challenging, and competitive" for children, so long as the teacher designs effective rules "to eliminate unruly or unsportsmanship behavior".&lt;ref name="Literacy"/&gt; It has been noted, however, that children in [[therapy]] may initiate guessing games as a way to avoid talking about distressing issues, and that therapists who are using other kinds of games to facilitate communication should avoid being drawn into them.&lt;ref&gt;Garry L. Landreth, ''Play Therapy: The Art of the Relationship'' (2012), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Error guessing===
In [[software testing]], '''error guessing''' is a [[test method]] in which [[test case]]s used to find [[Computer bug|bug]]s in [[Computer program|program]]s are established based on [[experience]] in prior testing.&lt;ref name="Homes"&gt;Bernard Homès, ''Fundamentals of Software Testing'' (2013), sec. 4.5.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of test cases usually rely on the software tester involved, who uses past experience and [[intuition]] to determine what situations commonly cause software failure, or may cause errors to appear.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Evans, ''Supercomputational Science'' (2012), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical errors include [[Division by zero|divide by zero]], [[null pointer]]s, or invalid [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s. Error guessing has no explicit rules for testing; test cases can be designed depending on the situation, either drawing from functional documents or when an unexpected/undocumented error is found while testing operations.&lt;ref name="Homes"/&gt;

==Social impact of guessing==
A study of guessing in social situations (for example, guessing someone's test score or potential salary) determined that there are situations where it is beneficial to intentionally either overguess (guess a higher amount) or underguess (guess a lower amount).&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Luxi Shen, Christopher K. Hsee, Jiao Zhang, [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/christopher.hsee/vita/Papers/ArtAndScienceOfGuessing.pdf The Art and Science of Guessing], ''Emotion'' (2011), Vol. 11, No. 6, p. 1462–1468.&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that students who knew the score they had received on a test were happier when another person who did not know the score guessed a lower number; the lower guess gave the student the positive feeling of having exceeded expectations.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

'''Haldane's dilemma''' is a limit on the speed of beneficial [[evolution]], first calculated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. 

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to ''The Cost of Natural Selection'' Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J.B.S. | year = | title = The Cost of Natural Selection | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf| journal = J. Genet | volume = 55 | issue = 511–524| page = 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. [[Genetic correlation|Characters that are positively correlated]] at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several [[alleles]] at a single gene.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;ref name="majerus1998"&gt;Majerus, M.E.N. (1998) ''[[Melanism: Evolution in Action]]''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these alleles, "C", is dominant to all the others, and any '''CC''' or  '''Cx''' moths are dark (where "x" is any other allele). Another allele, "c", is recessive to all the others, and '''cc''' moths are light. Against the originally pale [[lichen]]s the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the '''cc''' moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of '''cc''' moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if "ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only &lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived." The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the ''intensity of selection'' regarding "juvenile survival" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as &lt;math&gt;I = \ln (s_0/S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths &lt;math&gt;1-S&lt;/math&gt; for the entire population would have been &lt;math&gt;1-s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence &lt;math&gt;s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if &lt;math&gt;s_0 \approx S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I \approx s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; – since ln(1) = 0.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus is responsible for &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be &lt;math&gt;\prod \left( 1- d_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; of that of the optimal genotype, or &lt;math&gt;\exp \left ( -\sum d_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; nearly, if every &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to &lt;math&gt;\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing to the above, we have that &lt;math&gt;d_i = s_{0i} - S&lt;/math&gt;, if we say that &lt;math&gt;s_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the [[allele]]s in question are ''not'' particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; gene is the sum &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; of all values of &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== A mathematical model of the cost of diploids ==
Let '''A''' and '''a''' be two alleles with frequencies &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation. Their relative fitness is given by&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|-
| width=100 | Genotype
| width=70 | '''AA'''
| width=70 | '''Aa'''
| width=70 | '''aa'''
|-
| Frequency
| &lt;math&gt;p_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2p_nq_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Fitness
| 1
| &lt;math&gt;1 - \lambda K&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 - K&lt;/math&gt;
|}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''AA''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''AA''' ('''A''' dominant), and if λ = 1, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''aa''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''aa''' ('''A''' recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness '''Aa''' is to '''aa'''.

The fraction of selective deaths in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation then is

: &lt;math&gt;d_n = 2\lambda Kp_nq_n + Kq_n^2 = Kq_n[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: &lt;math&gt;D =  K \sum_0^\infin q_n \; [2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n].&lt;/math&gt;

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt; This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt; dq_n=-Kp_n q_n[\lambda + (1-2 \lambda  )q_n ] &lt;/math&gt;
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}{(1 - q)[\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}dq = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{\lambda(1 - 2\lambda)}{\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q}\right]dq.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming λ &amp;lt; 1, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda - (1 - 2\lambda) p_0}{\lambda}\right)\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda}{\lambda}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the last approximation assumes &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{2 - q}{(1 - q)^2} = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{1}{(1 - q)^2}\right]dq = p_0^{-1} - \mbox{ ln } p_0 + O(\lambda K).&lt;/math&gt;

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, "usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation" – the minimum being the population size (= "the number in a generation") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over ''n'' generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/''n'', so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of ''n'' = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of &lt;math&gt;I = 30/300 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Haldane then continues:&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term "Haldane's dilemma" ==
Apparently the first use of the term "Haldane's dilemma" was by palaeontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] in his 1963 paper "Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis".

Van Valen writes:&lt;ref name=VanValen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Valen | first1 = Leigh | year = 1963 | title = Haldane's Dilemma, evolutionary rates, and heterosis | url = | journal = Amer. Nat | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 185–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Haldane (1957 [= ''The Cost of Natural Selection'']) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.&lt;ref name=VanValen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are ''N'' such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

In 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donald |first=Peter |date=1969 |title=" Haldane's dilemma" and the rate of natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=221 | issue = 5183  |page=815 |pmid=5675622 |doi=10.1038/221815a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''''Harzreise im Winter'''''" (‘''Winter Journey in the [[Harz]]''’) is a poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], inspired by his ascent of the [[Brocken]] in the Harz mountains during the winter of 1777.&lt;ref name="MommsenGoethe2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharina Mommsen|author2=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|title=Goethe's Art of Living|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNbnomAZsqMC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2003|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-0339-1|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the summit in the heat of midday, in deep snow, with the landscape below him shrouded in cloud.  The Brocken had always been a place of mystery, connected with witches and devils; where illusions such as the [[Brocken spectre]] might confuse an unwary traveller, and where few ventured by choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jutta|first2=Georg|author1=Assel|author2=Jäger|title=Orte kultureller Erinnerung Brocken (Harz) Goethes Brockenbesteigungen|url=http://www.goethezeitportal.de/wissen/topographische-ansichten/orte-kultureller-erinnerung-brocken-harz-folge-ii-goethes-brockenbesteigungen.html|website=www.goethezeitportal.de|publisher=Goethezeitportal|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de|quote="Letzten Winter hat mir eine Reise auf den Harz das reinste Vergnügen geben. Du weißt, daß so sehr ich hasse, wenn man das Natürliche abenteuerlich machen will, so wohl ist mir's, wenn das Abenteuerlichste natürlich zugeht. Ich machte mich allein auf, etwa den letzten November, zu Pferde, mit einem Mantelsack und ritt durch Schloßen, Frost und Koth auf Nordhausen, den Harz hinein in die Baumannshöhle, über Wernigerode, Goslar auf den hohen Harz, das Detail erzähl' ich Dir einmal, und überwand alle Schwierigkeiten und stand den 8. Dez., glaub ich, Mittags um eins auf dem Brocken oben in der heitersten, brennendsten Sonne, über dem anderhalb Ellen hohen Schnee, und sah die Gegend von Teutschland unter mir alles von Wolken bedeckt, daß der Förster, den ich mit Mühe persuadirt hatte, mich zu führen, selbst vor Verwunderung außer sich kam, sich da zu sehen, da er viel Jahre am Fuße wohnend das immer unmöglich geglaubt hatte. Da war ich vierzehn Tage allein, daß kein Mensch wußte, wo ich war. [...]"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the inspiration and the setting for his poem.

"''Harzreise im Winter''" was the last of Goethe's works in his [[Sturm und Drang]] period, marking the end of a series of long, free-verse poems hymns by the young poet that had begun with ‘''[[Wandrers Sturmlied]]''’, and it is less self-absorbed than his earlier writing. It was first published in 1789 in the eighth volume of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Harzreise im Winter |wslink=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Harzreise_im_Winter |last=Goethe |first=Johann Wolfgang |authorlink=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |coauthors= |year=1789 |publisher=G.

==Creation and publication==
[[File:35 Von Torfhaus zum Brocken Goethe-Gedenkstein 14.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Goethe on the Brocken]]
Goethe wrote the poem during his first trip to the Harz when he spent two weeks on his own, with only local guides to accompany him, from 29 November to 14 December 1777.  During this trip signed himself in hotel guest books as "Johann Wilhelm Weber from Darmstadt". On 16 November he had referred in his diary to a "Project on the Secret Journey", an undertaking that he described on 7 December in a letter to Frau von Stein as a "pilgrimage".{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=348}} On the first of December, several days before the ascent of the Brocken, he had already conceived of the opening words of the poem, “Like the vulture”. The 'pilgrimage' up the Brocken was intended to be the highlight of his trip, but as well as being considered dangerous, the weather conditions made it uncertain,  and he was not able to make the ascent until 10 December. Many years later, in his autobiographical essay “Campaign in France”, he declared that he had seen a vulture "in the gloomy snow-capped clouds that rose from the north" on the [[Ettersberg]], and that he had already begun the poem that day.{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=162}}

The original manuscript of the poem has not survived, so the earliest known version is a transcription by Philipp Seidel, attached to a letter to [[Johann Heinrich Merck]] dated 5 August 1778. Goethe did not include the work in his handwritten collection of texts which he put together in 1777 for [[Charlotte von Stein]]. He edited his early version for the eight volume of his writings in 1789, making some minor changes in the final stanza.{{sfn|Leistner|1996|pp=159–160}}

==Form and themes==
The work consists of 88 lines of [[free verse]], divided into eleven [[stanzas]] of differing lengths.  This was a common [[ode]] arrangement in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Trunz. In: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Goethes Werke, Anmerkungen, Hamburger Ausgabe, Band I, C.H. Beck, München 1998, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains two key elements that were to become central to the discourse of the [[Romantics]] on winter travel – references to frosty, lifeless landscapes, and their intimate connection with the loneliness of the hero who had withdrawn into the wilderness in the face of some kind of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drux|first1=Rudolf|title="Aber abseits wer ist’s?" Goethes Harzreise im Winter und die Rhapsodie des Johannes Brahms  (im Kontext romantischer Winterreisen)|url=http://www.goethezeitportal.de/fileadmin/PDF/db/wiss/goethe/drux_goethes_harzreise_brahms.pdf|website=www.goethezeitportal.de|publisher=Goethezeitportal|accessdate=28 April 2018|quote="Mit seinem hymnischen Gedicht ‘Harzreise im Winter’, in dem Goethe auf seine im Dezember 1777 unternommenen „Ritt“ durch den Harz und die Besteigung des verschneiten Brocken rekurriert, hat er zwei für die romantischen Versionen winterlicher Reisen konstitutive Diskurse vorgeprägt:  Zum einen ist ihnen die Reflexion über ihre poetische Gestaltung eingeschrieben, zum andern vermittelt die Schilderung frostiger und lebloser Landschaften eine (wie auch immer geartete) krisenhafte Situation und melancholisch-weltschmerzliche Stimmung. Diese wird in Goethes Gedicht mit der Frage nach dem einsamen ‚Menschenfeind’ hervorgerufen, der sich in die Öde zurückgezogen hat." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem opens with a stanza in which the poet likens his song to a hovering bird of prey looking down on the earth:{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=160}}{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=50}} The second to fifth stanzas contrast the fate of the lucky and those who struggle against misfortune, illustrating the difference in their experiences in terms of the landscape. Next, the poet's vision passes from the external into the internal perspective, illuminating the distress of the selfish and asking who heals the pain of "the balm that became poison" and of one "who but hate for man / From the fullness of love hath drunk?"{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=160}}{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=51}}

In the following stanza, the song invokes the "Father of Love," who refreshes the heart of the sufferer and clears his "clouded gaze" so that a "thousand springs" are revealed to the "thirsty / in the desert". This plea is extended to the "Brothers of the Hunt" in the eighth stanza,{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=50}} so that they too may be blessed.{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=160}} The tenth stanza then asks for the lonely soul – the poet himself – to be wrapped in "golden clouds" and surrounded by "winter green". After a well-lit and sheltered ascent through "the fords of the night," the poet reaches the "dreaded summit" and gazes in gratitude toward the overawing spectacle of nature.

==Context==
After his Harz journey, Goethe was ready to move on from the unrestrained forms of expression which characterised the [[Sturm und Drang]].{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=273}} Later in life, he distanced himself from the sentiments of his earliest work, including ‘''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''’, seeking measure and order instead.{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=276}} At the time ‘''Harzreise im Winter''’ was written however, ‘''The Sorrows of Young Werther''‘ continued to exert a strong influence on many young men. One of these was Friedrich Victor Leberecht Plessing, the prototype for the unfortunate person referred to in the poem as consumed in bitterness. He had been greatly influenced by Goethe's work and after studying theology and jurisprudence had returned to his parents’ house in Wernigerode, consumed with melancholy. Plessing had written to Goethe asking for advice in 1776, but Goethe had not replied to him. Goethe visited Plessing on his journey to the Harz on 3 December, but was unable to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=E|title=Plessing, Friedrich|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz96347.html|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|publisher=Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 26 (1888)|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=351}}

In his ''Campaign in France'', Goethe later described Plessing's unanswered letter as "the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in its self-tormenting manner.” In addition to Plessing there were others who sought his help, and whom Goethe supported - he said that he had also "imposed" on other young men whom he wanted to help along their way.{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=321}} However, many of those who sought Goethe's help would not have gone along with him on his "path to a purer higher education," and would have held back his own self-development.{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=324}} Indeed, as much as ''Harzreise im Winter'' may allude to his encounter with Plessing, it is Goethe's own self-development that its main topic. He ascends the mountain to consult the oracle about his own fate, in other words to understand whether he is condemned to live the existence of the unfortunate, or whether he is to be redeemed by love.&lt;ref name="Boyle1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Boyle|title=Goethe: The Poet and the Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ci3pUMmWr-kC|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-282981-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the background of his diary entries and letters, this spiritual and redemptive element is shown in a clear light. After the eagerly awaited climb up the Brocken, he wrote: "cheerful, glorious moment, the whole world below in clouds and fog and above, everything cheerful" and added the sentence: "What is man that you are mindful of him?", a quotation from the eighth Psalm which he had written down on the anniversary of his arrival in Weimar.{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=349}}

==Language, imagery and critical appraisal==
The poem is less descriptive than reflective, as the landscape mentioned in the title is only lightly sketched and exists mainly as the framework for an existential experience.{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=160}}

The poem opens with the image of a vulture flying high above the earth. Whether the bird he invokes was specifically a vulture if not is not entirely clear however - in Goethe's time the term “vulture” might encompass different birds of prey such as hawks or buzzards. The vulture was however a bird used in divination by the Romans, as Goethe knew.{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=360}} In this context, the vulture in the first stanza may link with the ideas of the second stanza - "For a God hath / Unto each prescribed / His destined path."{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=350}}

It is this sense of finding one's destined path that rings through the solemn words of the last two stanzas. In the sense of Sturm und Drang, and the urge to deify nature, an encounter with the divine itself takes place, and the successful ascent of the summit becomes a symbolic ascension onto a higher plane of being. The language which conveys this  is reminiscent of Goethe's earlier poem [[Ganymed (Goethe)|Ganymed]];{{sfn|Conrady|2006|p=350}} ("Embrace the embracing! / Upwards to your bosom / loving Father!").{{sfn|Goethe|1998|p=47}}

The critic Albrecht Schöne has linked the evocation of the vulture in the first stanza and its oracular significance with Goethe's governmental activity, about which he still had very mixed feelings at the time. In the opinion of Jochen Schmidt however, the bird of prey is associated with the eagle found in [[Pindar]]'s work. For him, the first stanza refers specifically to the third Nemean [[Ode]] and proclaims Goethe's self-assurance and the complex relationship between poetry and lived experience.{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=162}}

The image of the "thirsty / in the desert" in the seventh stanza is associated with the [[book of Isaiah]].  While the phrases "mysterious-apparent" and "realms and majesty" of the last stanza define the religious quality of the lyric language, they are somewhat detached from their core exegetical meanings in the [[Epistle to the Romans]] and the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] as well as from the [[Temptation of Christ]] in the [[Gospel of St Matthew]].{{sfn|Leistner|1996|p=161}}

Klaus Weimar (1984), Michael Mandelartz (2006) and Sebastian Kaufmann (2010/11) have all developed interpretations of the poem which differ to some degree from the traditional view, with its emphasis on the biographical details of Goethe's life, and suggest that the voice of the poet need not be essentially bound up with Goethe's own.

In 1792, the composer [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] set some of the poem's words to music in his ‘''Rhapsodie (Aus der Harzreise)''’. The chosen text was substantially the same as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' later and more famous composition, the ‘''[[Alto Rhapsody]]''’, with Reichardt setting sixteen lines and Brahms twenty-two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=C|last2=Johns|first2=DC|title=Brahms rhapsodizing: The Alto Rhapsody and its expressive double|journal=Journal of Musicology|date=2012|volume=29|issue=2|doi=10.1525/jm.2012.29.2.191|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt14p9938v/qt14p9938v.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Ernst Barlach]] produced a series of lithographs to illustrate "Harzreise im Winter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ernst Barlach im Mittelpunkt|url=https://www.all-in.de/kempten-allgaeu/c-lokales/ernst-barlach-im-mittelpunkt_a220996|website=www.all-in.de|publisher=Allgäuer Zeitungsverlag GmbH|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Galateo: The Rules of Polite Behavior''''' (''Il Galateo, overo de' costumi''){{refn|group="nb"|Complete title: ''Trattato nel quale, sotto la persona d'un vecchio idiota ammaestrante un suo giovanetto, si ragiona de' modi che si debbono o tenere o schifare nella comune conversazione, cognominato Galateo overo de' costumi''}} by Florentine [[Giovanni Della Casa]] (1503–56) was published in [[Venice]] in 1558. A guide to what one should do and avoid in ordinary social life, this [[courtesy book]] of the Renaissance explores subjects such as dress, table manners, and conversation. It became so popular that the title, which refers to the name of one of the author’s distinguished friends, entered into the Italian language as a general term for social etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galateo|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/galateo/|work=Enciclopedia Treccani|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Della Casa did not live to see his manuscript’s widespread and lasting success, which arrived shortly after its publication. It was translated into French (1562), English (1576), Latin (1580), Spanish (1585), and German (1587), and has been read and studied in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healey|first=Robin Patrick|title=Italian Literature Before 1900 in English Translation|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Della Casa's work set the foundation for modern [[etiquette]] writers and authorities on [[manners]], such as “Miss Manners” [[Judith Martin]], [[Amy Vanderbilt]], and [[Emily Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In the twentieth century, scholars usually situated ''Galateo'' among the courtesy books and conduct manuals that were very popular during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pine-Coffin|first=R. S|title=Galateo: A New Translation.|year=1958|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Castiglione’s celebrated ''Courtier'', other important Italian treatises and dialogues include [[Alessandro Piccolomini]]’s ''Moral institutione'' (1560), [[Luigi Cornaro]]’s  ''Treatise on the Sober Life'' (1558-1565), and [[Stefano Guazzo]]’s ''Art of Civil Conversation'' (1579). 

In recent years, attention has turned to the humor and dramatic flair of Della Casa’s book. It has been argued that the style sheds light on Shakespeare’s comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrapodi|first=Michele|title=Italian Culture in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Michele|first=Laura|title=Shakespeare: Una "Tempesta" Dopo L’altro|year=2005|publisher=Liguori|location=Napoli|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When it first appeared in English translation by Robert Peterson in 1575, it would have been available in book stalls in Shakespeare's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts|year=2001|publisher=Bedford|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Greenblatt, author of ''Will in the World'', writes, "To understand the culture out of which Shakespeare is writing, it helps to read Renaissance courtesy manuals like Baldassare Castiglione’s famous Book of the Courtier (1528) or, still better, Giovanni della Casa’s ''Galateo or, The Rules of Polite Behavior'' (1558, available in a delightful new translation by M.F. Rusnak). It is fine for gentlemen and ladies to make jokes, della Casa writes, for we all like people who are funny, and a genuine witticism produces “joy, laughter, and a kind of astonishment.” But mockery has its risks. It is perilously easy to cross a social and moral line of no return." &lt;ref&gt;New York Review of Books, September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguished historians argue that ''Galateo'' should be read in the context of international European politics, and some contend that the work expresses an attempt to distinguish Italian excellence.  “During the half-century when Italy fell prey to foreign invasion (1494-1559) and was overrun by French, Spanish and German armies, the Italian ruling classes were battered by - as they often envisaged them - "barbarians". In their humiliation and laboured responses, Italian writers took to reflecting on ideals, such as the ideal literary language, the ideal cardinal, ideal building types, and the ideal general or field commander. But in delineating the rules of conduct, dress and conversation for the perfect gentleman, they were saying, in effect, "We are the ones who know how to cut the best figure in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Martines, Times Literary Supplement, August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

A skilled writer in Latin, Della Casa followed [[Erasmus]] in presenting a harmonious and simple morality based on [[Aristotle]]’s ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and notion of the mean, as well as other classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo: A Renaissance Treatise on Manners|year=2001|publisher=CRRS|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His treatise also reveals an obsession with graceful conduct and self-fashioning during the time of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]]: “A man must not be content with doing good things, but he must also study to do them gracefully. Grace is nothing other than that luster which shines from the appropriateness of things that are suitably ordered and well arranged one with the other and together.”  The work has been edited in this light by such distinguished Italian scholars as Stefano Prandi, Emanuela Scarpa, and Giorgio Manganelli.

The work may be read in the context of what [[Norbert Elias]] called the “civilizing process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elias|first=Norbert|title=The Civilizing Process: The History of Manners|year=1969|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally agreed that, given the popularity and impact of ''Galateo'', the cultural elite of the Italian Renaissance taught Europe how to behave. Giulio Ferroni argues that Della Casa “proposes a closed and oppressive conformity, made of caution and hypocrisy, hostile to every manifestation of liberty and originality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferroni|first=Giulio|title=Storia Della Letterature Italiana|year=1991|publisher=Einaudi|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others contend, on the contrary, that the work represents ambivalence, self-control, and a modern understanding of the individual in a society based on civility, [[intercultural competence]] and [[social networking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Harry|title=Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Della Casa addresses gentlemanly citizens who wish to convey a winning and attractive image. With a casual style and dry humor, he writes about everyday concerns, from posture to telling jokes to [[table manners]]. “Our manners are attractive when we regard others’ pleasure and not our own delight,” Della Casa writes.

Unlike [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', the rules of polite behavior in ''Galateo'' are not directed to ideal men in a Renaissance court. Instead, Della Casa observes the ordinary habits of people who do not realize that clipping one’s nails in public is bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Hilary|title=Il Cortegiano and Il Galateo|journal=Modern Language Review|year=1947|volume=42|pages=457–466|doi=10.2307/3716799|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   “One should not annoy others with such stuff as dreams, especially since most dreams are by and large idiotic,” we are advised.

Valentina D’Urso, Professor of Psychology and author of ''Le Buone Maniere'', writes, “The founding father of this literary genre, [Galateo] is an extraordinary read, lively and passionate.  One doesn’t know whether to admire more its rich style or the wisdom of the practical words of advice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Language and Style==

The work was preceded by a short treatise on the same subject in Latin, ''De officiis inter tenuiores et potentiores amicos'' (1546). Latin at the time was the language of learned society, and Della Casa was a first-rate classicist and public speaker. The treatise opens with a Latinate ''conciossiacosaché'', which gained Galateo a reputation for being pedantic and labored. However, [[Giuseppe Baretti]] and poets such as [[Giacomo Leopardi]] ranked Della Casa alongside [[Machiavelli]] as a master of Italian prose style. "Una delle prose più eleganti e più attiche del secolo decimosesto," (one of the most elegant and Attic prose works of the sixteenth century) Leopardi said.  Della Casa’s ''Galateo'' is, in the words of scholar E. H. Wilkins, “still valuable…for the pleasant ease with which most of it is written, and for its common sense, its plentiful humor, and its general amenity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=E. H.|title=History of Italian Literature|year=1954|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Della Casa frequently alludes to [[Dante]] and more often to [[Boccaccio]], whose [[Decameron]] he evidently knew very well and whose style he imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonora|first=Ettore|title=della prosa del Rinascimento. Il boccaccismo del "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|date=luglio–sett 1956|volume=133|issue=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several comments on language in Galateo reflect the Tuscan language model proposed about the same time by Della Casa’s friend [[Pietro Bembo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biow|first=Douglass|title=The culture of Cleanliness in Renaissance Italy|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=2006|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Galateo==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=January 2013}}
In the first chapter it is said that a gentleman should be at all times courteous, pleasant, and in manners beautiful. Although good manners may not appear as important as liberality, constancy, or magnanimity, they are nonetheless a virtue for achieving the esteem of others.  

One must not mention, do, or think anything that invokes images in the mind that are dirty or disreputable. One should not reveal by one's gestures that said person has just returned from the bathroom, do not blow one's nose and look into the handkerchief, avoid spitting and yawning. 

Della Casa tells his reader that outward appearance is very important, so clothes must be tailored and conform to prevailing custom, reflecting one’s social status. 

In Chapter 7, Della Casa deals with a pivotal subject - conversation: you have to talk about topics of interest to all present and show respect to everyone, avoiding anything that is base or petty. 

In Chapter 14 of the way we talk about the places where you are with other people and the first thing that the author discusses types of ceremonies, false flatteries, and fawning behavior. Another matter is whether the ceremonies are made to us: never refuse because it could be taken as a sign of arrogance.

Della Casa returns to illustrate the customs of conversation and public speaking.  Language should, as much as possible, be "orderly and well-expressed" so that the listener is able to understand what the speaker intends. In addition to the clarity of the words used, it is also important that they sound pleasant. Before talking about any topic, it is good to have it formed in your mind. It is not polite to interrupt someone while talking, nor to help him find his words.

In the last three chapters, the author writes about behaviour in general: what you do should be appropriate and done with grace.  A gentleman should never run, or walk too slowly. Della Casa brings us to behavior at the table, such as not scratching, not eating like a pig, not using a toothpick or sharing food.  In Della Casa’s vision, slight slips of decorum become [[taboo]].

==Publication history and reception==

It was probably first drafted during his stay at the Abbey of Saint Eustace at Nervesa, near Treviso, between 1551 and 1555.  ''Galateo'' was first published in Venice, and was edited by Erasmus Gemini in 1558. The first separate publication appeared in Milan a year later. 
The Vatican manuscript (formerly Parraciani Ricci), in Latin with autograph corrections, was edited and published by Gennaro Barbarisi in 1990. The manuscript contains neither the title nor the division into chapters. Many variants in the first edition are attributed to Erasmus Gemini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Benedetto|first=Arnaldo|title=Appunti sul "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|year=1995|volume=172:557-560|pages=481–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Spanish Galateo of Lucas Gracián Dantisco was very influential in the seventeenth century.  In the Enlightenment, the letters of Lord Chesterfield show the influence of Galateo, as does a self-help manuscript of George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookhiser|first=Richard|title=Rules of Civility: The 110 Precepts that Guided Our First President in War and Peace|year=2003|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first American edition was published in Baltimore in 1811, with a short appendix on how to slice and serve meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo, or, A treatise on politeness and delicacy of manners|year=1811|publisher=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">'''Jean-Toussaint Desanti''' (8 October 1914 &amp;ndash; 20 January 2002) was a French educator and philosopher known for his work on both the philosophy of mathematics and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://institutdesanti.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?rubrique2 |title=Une biographie |publisher=L’Institut Desanti|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of Jean-François Desanti and Marie-Paule Colonna,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; he was born in [[Ajaccio]] and studied the [[philosophy of mathematics]] with [[Jean Cavaillès]]. During [[World War II]], he was a member of the [[French Resistance]], associating with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[André Malraux]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1943 with his wife [[Dominique Desanti|Dominique]], remaining a member until 1956. Also in 1956, he published his ''Introduction à l'histoire de la philosophie''.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C92KBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT741 |title=Dictionnaire des Philosophes |pages=741–42 |publisher=Les Dictionnaires d'Universalis |year=2014 |ISBN=2852291185|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desanti taught philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, at the [[Lycée Lakanal]], at the [[École normale supérieure de lettres et sciences humaines|École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]] and at the [[Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; His students included  [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/sc/site.php?bc=40ans&amp;np=PS_270111 |title=Jean-Toussaint Desanti, un rêve de flambeur |publisher=Université Paris Diderot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he published ''Les Idéalités mathématiques, recherches épistémologiques sur le développement de la théorie des fonctions de variables réelles''.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;

According to Etienne Balibar, Desanti's originality is to be found in his choice to set aside the traditional problems of the criteria or the status of mathematical truth, whether in their Platonic (characterized by the demarcation between the certitude proper to ideal objects and the incertitude of sensible objects) or transcendental (characterized by the definition of the a priori forms of consciousness) forms, in order to attend to another question, that of the "mediations" according to which a "naive" or elementary mathematical theory comes to open itself towards its own generalization and consequent re-foundation in more abstract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cirphles.ens.fr/ciepfc/publications/etienne-balibar/article/jean-toussaint-desanti?lang=fr|title=Jean-Toussaint Desanti - Cirphles|website=cirphles.ens.fr|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jodocus Trutfetter''' (also Trutvetter; known also as  ''Jodocus von Eisenach, Jodocus Isenacensis, Justus Trautvetter,  and Doktor Eisenach'' ) (1460 &amp;ndash; 9 May 1519) was a philosopher and theologian at the [[University of Erfurt]], in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. His main works include a textbook on logic, the ''Summule totius logice'', and another on natural philosophy, the ''Summa in totam physicen''. As a supporter of the [[via moderna]], he stressed the need to take both ancient and modern authorities into account. With respect to the subjects of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], categories, and psychology, his views were close to those of [[Jean Buridan]]. On the relationship between theology and philosophy he had a similar position to [[William of Ockham]].

==Biography==
Trutfetter was born in [[Eisenach]] in 1460. He enrolled at the University of [[Erfurt]] on October 18, 1476, and received the degree of Bachelor in 1478 and the degree of Master in 1478. His thinking was influenced by [[John Buridan]]. In 1493 he received the licentiate in theology, followed by Doctor of Theology on 14 October 1504.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">'''Joel Feinberg''' (October 19, 1926 in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] – March 29, 2004 in [[Tucson, Arizona]]) was an [[Americans|American]] political and legal [[philosopher]]. He is known for his work in the fields of [[ethics]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]], [[philosophy of law]], and [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Honderich T. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford Univ. Press, 1995: 270. {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual rights and the authority of the state.&lt;ref&gt;NEW YORK TIMES Monday April 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg was one of the most influential figures in American jurisprudence of the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Harrison, 'In Memoriam: Joel Feinberg'', University of Arizona News, March 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinberg studied at the [[University of Michigan]], writing his dissertation on the philosophy of the Harvard professor [[Ralph Barton Perry]] under the supervision of [[Charles Stevenson]]. He taught at [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[UCLA]] and [[Rockefeller University]], and, from 1977, at the [[University of Arizona]], where he retired in 1994 as Regents Professor of Philosophy and Law.

Feinberg was internationally distinguished for his research in [[ethics|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]] and [[legal philosophy]]. His major four-volume work, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', was published between 1984 and 1988. Feinberg held many major fellowships during his career and lectured by invitation at universities around the world. He was an esteemed and highly successful teacher, and many of his students are now prominent scholars and professors at universities across the US.  His former students include [[Jules Coleman]], [[Russ Shafer-Landau]], and [[Clark Wolf]].

==''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law''==

Feinberg's most important contribution to legal philosophy is his four-volume book, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'' (1984-1988), a work that is frequently characterized as "magisterial."&lt;ref&gt;For example by Dale Jamieson, ''Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle against Climate'' ''Change Failed--and What It Means for Our Future'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 168; R. A. Duff, "Symposium on Criminalization," ''Criminal Law and Philosophy'' (2014), vol. 8, p. 147; Alan Werthheimer, "Liberty, Coercion, and the Limits of the State," in Robert L. Simon, ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to Social and Political Philosophy'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 2002), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg's goal in the book is to answer the question: What sorts of conduct may the state rightly make criminal? [[John Stuart Mill]], in his classic [[On Liberty]] (1859), had given a staunchly "liberal" answer to this question. According to Mill, the only kind of conduct that the state may rightly criminalize is conduct that causes harm to others. Though Feinberg, who had read and re-read Mill's classic text many times,&lt;ref&gt;*[https://philosophy.princeton.edu/content/john-stuart-mills-liberty-underlining-highlighting-and-marginalia-joel-feinberg-now Joel Feinberg’s heavily annotated copy of Mill’s On Liberty can be seen online at the Princeton University Digital Library.]&lt;/ref&gt; shares Mill's liberal leanings, he thinks that liberals can and should admit that certain kinds of non-harmful but profoundly offensive conduct can also properly be prohibited by law. In ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', Feinberg seeks to develop and defend a broadly Millian view of the limits of state power over the individual. In the process, he defends what many would view as characteristically "liberal" positions on topics such as suicide, obscenity, pornography, hate speech, and euthanasia. He also analyzes with great subtlety and skill concepts such as "harm," "offense," "wrong," "autonomy," "responsibility," "paternalism," "coercion," and "exploitation." In a surprising twist, Feinberg concedes in the conclusion to the final volume that liberalism may not be fully defensible.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Feinberg, ''The'' ''Moral Limits of the Criminal Law: Harmless Wrongdoing''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals, he claims, may have to concede that in rare cases it may be legitimate for the government to criminalize certain kinds of moral harms and harmless immoralities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A ride on the bus==

In ''Offense to Others'', the second volume of ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law'', Feinberg offers one of the most famous thought-experiments in recent philosophy: a series of imaginary scenarios he calls "a ride on the bus." Feinberg invites us to imagine a bus ride in which you, a passenger rushing to an important appointment, are confronted by a series of deeply offensive but harmless acts. Some of the acts involve affronts to the senses (e.g., a man scratching his fingernails across a slate). Others involve acts that are deeply disgusting or revolting (e.g., eating various kinds of nauseatingly repulsive things). Still others involve affronts to our religious, moral, or patriotic sensibilities (e.g., overt acts of flag desecration); shocks to our sense of shame or embarrassment (such as acts of public sex); and a wide range of offensive conduct based on fear, anger, humiliation, boredom or frustration. The thought experiment is designed to test the limits of our tolerance for harmless but deeply offensive forms of behavior. More precisely, it raises the question "whether there are any human experiences that are harmless in themselves yet so unpleasant that we can rightly demand legal protection from them even at the cost of other persons' liberties."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Feinberg, ''The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law: Offense to Others''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg argues that even left-leaning, highly tolerant liberals must recognize that some forms of harmless but profoundly offensive conduct can properly be criminalized.

=="Psychological Egoism"==
In a paper prepared in 1958 for the benefit of students at Brown, Feinberg seeks to refute the philosophical theory of [[psychological egoism]], which in his opinion is fallacious.  So far as he can tell, there are four primary arguments for it:

#"Every action of mine is prompted by motives or desires or impulses which are ''my'' motives and not somebody else's."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones 1952, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"[W]hen a person gets what he wants, he characteristically feels pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Often we deceive ourselves into thinking that we desire something fine or noble when what we really want is to be thought well of by others or to be able to congratulate ourselves, or to be able to enjoy the pleasures of a good conscience [...].  Indeed, it is a simple matter to explain away all allegedly unselfish motives [....]"&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;  He quotes [[Lucius F. C. Garvin]] to this effect: "Once the conviction that selfishness is universal finds root in a person's mind, it is very likely to burgeon out in a thousand corroborating generalizations.  It will be discovered that a friendly smile is really only an attempt to win an approving nod from a more or less gullible recording angel; that a charitable deed is, for its performer, only an opportunity to congratulate himself on the good fortune or the cleverness that enables him to be charitable; that a public benefaction is just plain good business advertising.  It will emerge that gods are worshipped only because they indulge men's selfish fears, or tastes, or hopes; that the "golden rule" is no more than an eminently sound success formula; that social and political codes are created and subscribed to only because they serve to restrain other men's egoism as much as one's own, morality being only a special sort of "racket" or intrigue using weapons of persuasion in place of bombs and machine guns.  Under this interpretation of human nature, the categories of commercialism replace those of disinterested service and the spirit of the horse trader broods over the face of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Garvin 1953, p. 512f.&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Psychological egoists often notice that moral education and the inculcation of manners usually utilise what [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] calls the 'sanctions of pleasure and pain.'  Children are made to acquire the civilising virtues only by the method of enticing rewards and painful punishments.  Much the same is true of the history of the race.  People in general have been inclined to behave well only when it is made plain to them that there is 'something in it for them.'  Is it not then highly probable that just such a mechanism of human motivation as Bentham describes must be presupposed by our methods of moral education?"&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinberg observes that such arguments for psychological egoism are rarely mounted on the basis of empirical proof when, being psychological, they very well ought to.  The opening argument he dubs a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]&lt;ref&gt;To his mind, it says nothing more than that all of one's motives and desires are motives and desires, which, while true, is not especially significant.&lt;/ref&gt; from which "nothing whatever concerning the nature of my motives or the objective of my desires can possibly follow [...].  It is not the genesis of an action or the ''origin'' of its motives which makes it a 'selfish' one, but rather the 'purpose' of the act or the ''objective'' of its motives; ''not where the motive comes from'' (in voluntary actions it always comes from the agent) but ''what it aims at'' determines whether or not it is selfish."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly flawed in Feinberg's opinion is the second argument.  Just because all successful endeavour engenders pleasure does not necessarily entail that pleasure is the sole objective of all endeavour.  He uses [[William James]]'s analogy to illustrate this fallacy: although an ocean liner always consumes coal on its trans-Atlantic voyages, it is unlikely that the sole purpose of these voyages is coal consumption.

The third argument, unlike the first two, contains no ''[[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' that Feinberg can see.  He nevertheless adjudges that such a sweeping generalisation is unlikely to be true.

In the final argument, Feinberg sees a paradox.  The only way to achieve happiness, he believes, is to forget about it, but psychological egoists hold that all human endeavour, even that which achieves happiness, is geared towards happiness.  Feinberg poses a [[thought experiment]] in which a character named Jones is apathetic about all but the pursuit of his own happiness.  Because he has no means to achieve that end, however, "[i]t takes little imagination [...] to see that Jones's one desire is bound to be frustrated."&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg 2008, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  To pursue only happiness, then, is to fail utterly to achieve it.

'''John Barnewall''', [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]] (c. 1595 – c. 1650), was a member of the [[aristocracy]] in Ireland who became a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]. He served as a teacher and lecturer both locally and on the Continent. He was the [[Provincial superior|Minister Provincial]] of Ireland during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], due to which position he communicated on Irish affairs with Franciscans on the European mainland, such as the historian, Friar [[Luke Wadding]]. He became involved in the conflict, opposing the [[excommunication]]s issued by the [[papal nuncio]] in 1648. He last appears in documents dated July 1649.

==Biography==

Barnewall was the son of Robert Barnewall, 7th [[Baron Trimlestown]] (died 1639), and a brother of Matthias Barnewall, 8th Baron Trimlestown (died 1667).  His mother  was Genet Talbot, daughter of Thomas Talbot of  [[Dardistown Castle]], County Meath. The family was a significant member of the [[Old English]] gentry in [[The Pale]] of [[County Meath]], having come over from England with King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. One ancestor, [[John Barnewall, 3rd Baron Trimlestown]] (died 1538), was [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]].

John Barnewall went to the Continent and entered the Franciscan Order, going on to receive [[minor orders]] and then the [[subdiaconate]] at [[Mechelin]], in the then-[[Spanish Netherlands]], in December 1617. No documentation survives, but presumably he received further [[Holy Orders]] during the following months. He defended his [[theses]] in [[Scotism|Scotist]] [[theology]] at [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Louvain]] in 1620, and again in 1627. He is believed to have taught as a [[lecturer]] in [[Germany]] in 1637, as well as subsequently at [[Prague]], and at [[Slane]] in [[County Meath]] upon his return to Ireland. Among his students was the historian, Friar [[Peter Walsh (priest)|Peter Walsh]]. A contemporary stated that Barnewall taught [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at Louvain for eight years prior to his election as Minister Provincial of Ireland at [[Quin, County Clare|Quin]], [[County Clare]], on 15 August 1638. 

A letter he wrote to Wadding, dated 1 November 1642, confirms that he was still Minister Provincial at that date. In 1648 he opposed the excommunications issued by [[papal nuncio]], [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]], of the [[Confederate Ireland|members of the Supreme Council of the Confederation of Kilkenny]]. In July 1649 he was at [[Kilkenny]], where he joined by the Franciscan [[custos|guardians]] of his [[ecclesiastical province|province]] in their condemnation of Friar [[Redmond Caron]], who had been appointed [[Canonical visitation|Visitor]] to Ireland by Friar [[Pierre Marchant]], who was a [[Definitor|Definitor General]] of the Order, at the suggestion of [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]]. There are no further known documentary references to Barnewall after this date.

The '''''Journal of Psychology &amp; Theology''''' (JPT) is published by [[Biola University]]'s Rosemead School of Psychology and has been operating continuously since 1973. JPT is a quarterly peer-reviewed journal publishing original research on the integration of psychology and Christian theology.  Empirical studies and theoretical pieces investigating the interrelationships between psychological (e.g., clinical, experimental, industrial/organizational, social, theoretical) and theological topics of study are considered.  Scholarship that explores the application of these interrelationships in a variety of contexts (e.g., mental health counseling, education and training, organizational leadership, churches and other Christian ministry contexts) and/or from an intercultural perspective are encouraged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3521">'''Lilli Alanen''' (née Gullichsen, born Pori, 1941) is a Finnish philosopher and Professor Emeritus of History of Philosophy at Department of Philosophy at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].  She specialises in the history of philosophy — with particular interest in [[René Descartes]] and [[David Hume]] but she has also contributed to [[feminist philosophy]]. She studied philosophy at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, where she was a student of [[Ferdinand Alquié]], and the [[University of Helsinki]], where she was a student of Ingmar Pörn and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]. In the 1980s she taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the USA and in Helsinki before being named professor of philosophy at Uppsala University in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Jarkko S. Tuusvuori "Professori Lilli Alasen vieraana: Kokeillen ja tapellen omille teille", Niin&amp;Nin, 1/2014: https://netn.fi/files/netn141-03.pdf (interview with Alanen in Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt;

In her critically received book&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Sean Crawford, "''Descartes's Concept of Mind'' is a rigorous and imaginative work, and a worthy corrective to the popular image of Descartes's philosophy of mind as narrowly concerned only with the indubitably known immaterial mind of the solitary meditator." ''Metapsychology'', Volume: 8, Number: 36, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; on Descartes (2003), Alanen goes beyond mere history, drawing out the historical antecedents and the intellectual evolution of Descartes' thinking about the mind, showing how his emphasis on the embodiment of the mind has implications far more complex and interesting than the usual dualist account associated with his thinking suggests.

Lilli Alanen is a member of the industrialist [[Ahlström family]]. Her mother was Finnish art collector and patron of the arts [[Maire Gullichsen]] and her father the industrialist Harry Gullichsen. Her siblings are the renowned Finnish architect [[Kristian Gullichsen]] and [[Johan Gullichsen]], a professor of engineering. The family home at [[Noormarkku]] near [[Pori]] is the world-famous modernist house [[Villa Mairea]] designed by architect [[Alvar Aalto]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirsi Gullichsen and Ulla Kinnunen, ''Inside the Villa Mairea'', Alvar Aalto Foundation, Jyväskylä, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 she married the Finnish artist Sakari Alanen (b. 1940), and they have three children. They were divorced in 1989. In 1992 Alanen married the American philosopher Frederick Stoutland (1933–2011).

'''Markus Gabriel''' (born April 6, 1980) is a German philosopher and author at the [[University of Bonn]]. In addition to his more specialized work, he has also written popular books about [[Philosophy|philosophical]] issues.

==Career==
Gabriel was educated in philosophy and Ancient Greek in Germany. After completing his doctorate and [[habilitation]] at [[Heidelberg University]], he held a faculty position at [[New School for Social Research]]. He then came to the [[University of Bonn]], where he holds the Chair for Epistemology, Modern and Contemporary Philosophy and is Director of the International Centre for Philosophy.&lt;ref name=FRIAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Markus Gabriel|url=http://www.frias.uni-freiburg.de/en/people/present-fellows/gabriel|publisher=[[Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies]]|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel has also been a visiting professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;{{cite web|title=Markus Gabriel's Courses|url=https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/courses/368|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

In 2013, Gabriel wrote ''Transcendental Ontology: Essays in German Idealism''. In the [[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]] Sebastian Gardner wrote that the work is "Gabriel's most comprehensive presentation to date, in English, of his reading of German Idealism"&lt;ref name=NDPR/&gt; and notes that "due to its compression of a wealth of ideas into such a short space, the book demands quite a lot from its readers."&lt;ref name=NDPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Sebastian|title=Transcendental Ontology: Essays in German Idealism (review)|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/44925-transcendental-ontology-essays-in-german-idealism/|publisher=[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Gabriel complained that "most contemporary metaphysicians are [sloppy] when it comes to characterizing their subject matter," using words like "the world" and "reality" "often...interchangeably and without further clarifications. In my view, those totality of words do not refer to anything which is capable of having the property of existence."&lt;ref name=3AM&gt;[http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/why-the-world-does-not-exist-but-unicorns-do/ Interview at 3AM Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to explain:

::I try to revive the tradition of metaontology and metametaphysics that departs from Kant. As has been noticed, Heidegger introduced the term metaontology and he also clearly states that Kant’s philosophy is a “metaphysics about metaphysics.” I call metametaphysical nihilism the view that there is no such thing as the world such that questions regarding its ultimate nature, essence, structure, composition, categorical outlines etc. are devoid of the intended conceptual content. The idea that there is a big thing comprising absolutely everything is an illusion, albeit neither a natural one nor an inevitable feature of reason as such. Of course, there is an influential Neo-Carnapian strand in the contemporary debate which comes to similar conclusions. I agree with a lot of what is going on in this area of research and I try to combine it with the metaontological/metametaphysical tradition of Kantian and Post-Kantian philosophy.&lt;ref name=3AM/&gt;

'''''Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why''''' (published as '''''Whose Word Is It?''''' in United Kingdom) is a book by [[Bart D. Ehrman]], a [[New Testament]] scholar at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6301707.html Interview] with Bart Ehrman, Publishers Weekly, January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The book introduces lay readers to the field of [[textual criticism]] of the [[Bible]]. Ehrman discusses a number of textual variants that resulted from intentional or accidental manuscript changes during the [[scriptorium]] era. The book made it to [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060738174/Misquoting_Jesus/index.aspx Publisher's website]. HarperCollins.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Ehrman recounts his personal experience with the study of the Bible and textual criticism. He summarizes the history of textual criticism, from the works of [[Desiderius Erasmus]] to the present. The book describes an [[early Christian]] environment in which [[Development of the New Testament canon|the books that would later compose the New Testament]] were copied by hand, mostly by Christian amateurs. Ehrman concludes that various early scribes [[Textual variants in the New Testament|altered the New Testament texts]] in order to de-emphasize the role of women in the early church, to unify and harmonize the different portrayals of Jesus in the four gospels, and to oppose certain heresies (such as [[Adoptionism]]).

== Reviews and reception ==
[[Alex Beam]] of the ''Boston Globe'', wrote that the book is "a series of dramatic revelations for the ignorant", and that "Ehrman notes that there have been a lot of changes to the Bible in the past 2,000 years.

Jeffrey Weiss of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' wrote, "Whichever side you sit on regarding Biblical inerrancy, this is a rewarding read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00375,1110AFD8AA3D89A0.html | title=Book review: Some ask: Are Bible texts authentic?

And in language accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman explains these procedures and their results. He further explains why textual criticism has frequently sparked intense controversy, especially among scripture-alone Protestants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-11892691.html | title=Ehrman, Bart D.

Charles Seymour of the [[Wayland Baptist University]] in [[Plainview, Texas]] wrote, "Ehrman convincingly argues that even some generally received passages are late additions, which is particularly interesting in the case of those verses with import for doctrinal issues such as women's ordination or the Atonement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-17094344.html | title=Ehrman, Bart D.

Neely Tucker of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the book is "an exploration into how the 27 books of the New Testament came to be cobbled together, a history rich with ecclesiastical politics, incompetent scribes and the difficulties of rendering oral traditions into a written text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html | title=The Book of Bart |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date= March 5, 2006 | first= Neely| last= Tucker| accessdate = 2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Craig Blomberg]], of [[Denver Seminary]] in [[Colorado]], wrote that "Most of ''Misquoting Jesus'' is actually a very readable, accurate distillation of many of the most important facts about the nature and history of textual criticism, presented in a lively and interesting narrative that will keep scholarly and lay interest alike."&lt;ref name="Blombergreview"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverseminary.edu/article/misquoting-jesus-the-story-behind-who-changed-the-bible-and-why/| title=Book review: Misquoting Jesus| publisher=[[Denver Seminary]]| date=March 5, 2006| first=| last=| accessdate=2009-04-06| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425151325/http://www.denverseminary.edu/article/misquoting-jesus-the-story-behind-who-changed-the-bible-and-why/| archivedate=April 25, 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blomberg also wrote that Ehrman "has rejected his evangelicalism and whether he is writing on the history of the transmission of the biblical text, focusing on all the changes that scribes made over the centuries, or on the so-called 'lost gospels' and 'lost Christianities,' trying to rehabilitate our appreciation for [[Gnosticism]], it is clear that he has an axe to grind."&lt;ref name="Blombergreview"/&gt;

In 2007, Timothy Paul Jones wrote a book-length response to ''Misquoting Jesus'', called ''Misquoting Truth: A Guide to the Fallacies of Bart Ehrman's "Misquoting Jesus"''. It was published by [[InterVarsity Press]]. ''[[Novum Testamentum]]'' suggested that ''Misquoting Truth'' was a useful example of how conservative readers are reacting to Ehrman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Notes|journal=[[Novum Testamentum]]|date=2008|volume=50|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the apologist of biblical inerrancy Edward D. Andrews wrote a third edition, 577 pages, in response to Misquoting Jesus, called ''MISREPRESENTING JESUS: Debunking Bart D. Ehrman's "Misquoting Jesus"''. It was published by Christian Publishing House. warning that Ehrman in Misquoting Jesus was misleading readers and distorting the information.

His interpretation of [[history of science]] and philosophy is guided by contemporary debates in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] ([[metaphysics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=273309 See for example his discussion of his methodology in the journal ''Synthesis Philosophica''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Bizri composed commentaries on phenomenology and [[Martin Heidegger]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdn.uclouvain.be/groups/cms-editors-isp/vhousiaux/BHDG-7.pdf] On the impact of Heidegger in the Arab and Muslim world, in "BULLETIN HEIDEGGÉRIEN" 7 (2017), pp. 8-16 {{ISSN|2034-7189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/arhiva/abstract_en.php?editie=PHILOSOPHIA&amp;nr=1&amp;an=2015&amp;id_art=13262 Nader El-Bizri, 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30]&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an expertise in history of philosophy and science in Islamic civilisation, with a special focus on the traditions of polymaths like the optician and geometer [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/nader-el-bizri-ibn-al-haytham-introduction |title=Nader El-Bizri: Ibn al-Haytham – An Introduction |publisher=Muslim Heritage |date=31 December 2005 |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the metaphysician and physician [[Avicenna]] (Abu 'Ali [[Ibn Sina]]), and the tenth-century encyclopaedist thinkers, the [[Brethren of Purity]] ([[Ikhwan al-Safa']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nader El-Bizri|title=Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ: An Islamic Philosophical Fraternity|editor=Houari Touati|journal=Encyclopedia of Mediterranean Humanism|date=2014|url=http://www.encyclopedie-humanisme.com/?Ikhw%C4%81n-al-%E1%B9%A2af%C4%81%CA%BE&amp;var_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Bizri's interpretations of the history of the exact sciences in classical Islamic civilisation have been connected with the legacy of the mathematician, historian and philosopher of science: Roshdi Rashed (Emeritus; ''CNRS'', Paris).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=NvERVsAPgksC&amp;redir_esc=y Refer to his promotion of the works of Roshdi Rashed in Anglophone scholarship in published annotated translations via the academic press Routledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent studies that aim at "renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam", El-Bizri offers critical analyses of the conventions of methodology and historiography that dominate the mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying "Islamic philosophy" from "archival" standpoints, within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies; arguing that these do not usually recognise the fact that "philosophy in Islam" can still be a living intellectual tradition, and that its renewal requires a radical reform in ontology, epistemology and [[cosmology]] within Islamic thought, which have primacy over the emphasis on theories of value, politics and law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/comparativephilosophy/vol1/iss2/5/ Consult his discussion of methods of inquiry in the journal ''Comparative Philosophy''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also embodied in El-Bizri's interpretations of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of Heidegger's critique of the history of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5466-the-phenomenological-quest-betw.aspx This is the basis of his book: ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (SUNY 1999, rep. 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese|size=275|c=內功|p=nèigōng|j=noi6 gong1|hiragana=ないこう|hangul=내공|vie=nội công|l="internal skill"}}'''Neigong''', also spelled ''nei kung'', ''neigung'', or ''nae gong'', refers to any of a set of [[China|Chinese]] [[qigong|breathing]], [[meditation]] and spiritual practice disciplines associated with [[Daoism]] and especially the [[Chinese martial arts]]. Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called "soft style", "internal" or [[neijia]] 內家 Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong 外功 or "external skill" which is historically associated with [[shaolinquan]] or the so-called "hard style", "external" or [[Wàijiā#External styles|wàijiā]] 外家 Chinese martial arts. Both have many different schools, disciplines and practices and historically there has been mutual influence between the two and distinguishing precisely between them differs from school to school. 

There is both martial and non-martial neigong. Well known examples of martial neigong are the various breathing and focus trainings taught in some traditional [[Taijiquan]], [[Baguazhang]] and [[Xingyiquan]] schools. An example of non-martial neigong is the discipline known as [[Daoyin]].

==Neigong and the internal martial arts==
The martial art school of neigong emphasises training the coordination of the individual's body with the [[breath]], known as the harmonisation of the inner and outer energy(內外合一), creating a basis for a particular school's method of utilising power and technique. 

Neigong exercises that are part of the neijia tradition involve cultivating physical stillness and or conscious (deliberate) movement, designed to produce relaxation or releasing of muscular tension combined with special breathing techniques such as the "tortoise" or "reverse" methods. The fundamental purpose of this process is to develop a high level of coordination, concentration and technical skill that is known in the martial arts world as [[neijin]] (內勁). The ultimate purpose of this practice is for the individual to become at one with heaven or the Dao (天人合一). As [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] stated, "Heaven, earth and I are born of one, and I am at one with all that exists (天地與我並生, 萬物與我唯一)".

Martial Nei Gung is about developing internal power. One way to possibly achieve this is to train particular exercises regularly where the breath is matched with movements of blood or to effect the movement of blood throughout the body. Through these exercises it can be possible to move the blood to a particular area during a particular movement to have a particular result. One of the benefits of martial nei gung exercises is the relaxation of blood vessels, nerves, muscles and sinews to help the body move more freely. With the body moving freely and an excess of blood moving to a particular area with little or no effort, the practitioner can possibly develop many benefits. These benefits may include:
* faster recovery from injury to the hands
* an ability to hit with more force
* an ability to move faster (speed is crucial in martial arts)
* the health benefits of being relaxed
* an increase in connection to your legs, spine, arms and head
* increased stamina
* increased athletic ability and health
* regulation of blood pressure
* actually experiencing the channels of the body as they truly are, which can possibly be different from the books
* developing an authentic dan tien that is consciously nourished and deliberately formed which is not defined in the books
* greater sensitivity for sparring and fighting

It is important to understand that anyone looking to learn Nei Gung sincerely, is more likely to learn it from a good teacher of internal martial arts like Hsing-Yi (one of the easiest and most powerful forms of martial cultivation). It is rare to learn authentic Daoist practices from a true master of the subject as quite a lot of the Nei Gung skills are an essential part of a complete system of martial arts. Nei Gung is not a philosophy, but a technique and an art of inner cultivation. There are intellectual guidelines to the practice of Nei Gung, but it is 'Inner Work' which means effort has to be put in to develop real, substantial and testable skills. This is not something that can be imagined or talked about, only from direct experience and hard effort can an understanding of Nei Gung develop. A true practitioner and teacher will take you on a journey growing your inner-world and showing you how to demonstrate the skills you are developing.

==Neigong and meditation==
This type of practice is said to require concentration and internal reflection which results in a heightened self-awareness that increases over time with continued practice. Neigong practitioners report awareness of the mechanics of their [[blood]] circulation, [[peristalsis]], muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, etc. 

What is said to be occurring as the result of continual practice is a type of [[internal alchemy]], that is a refinement and transmutation of the "Three Treasures" or ''San Bao'' (三寳), in Chinese. The Three Treasures are known as [[Jing (TCM)|Jing]] (精), [[Qi]] (氣) and [[Shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|Shen]] (神) and can be loosely translated as Essence, Vitality and [[Spirit]]. 

According to [[Daoist]] doctrine the Three Treasures can be described as three types of energy available to humans. The [[Dao De Jing]] purported to be written by [[Lao zi]] states in chapter 42 that "The Dao (道) gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two ([[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (太極) or [[Yin and Yang]] (陰陽)) and the Two gives birth to the Three (which some interpret to mean Jing 精, Qi 氣 and Shen 神, or sometimes [[Heaven]] Tian 天, [[Earth]] Di 地 and [[Man]] Ren 人) and lastly the Three gives birth to the 10,000 Things (Wanwu 萬物); which is all that exists in heaven and on earth.

Neigong training follows therefore the classical Daoist developmental stages and regards the first two stages as a preparation for the last and final stage:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=XgWxD46GWhoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=neigong&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTuPCU8uDcAhVKUhoKHdyxD2IQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=neigong&amp;f=false Damo Mitchell: Daoist Nei Gong - The Philosophical Art of Change, Singing Dragon, 2011, ISBN 9780857010339, page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert-subject|Spirituality|date=August 2010}}
'''Nāma''' is the [[Sanskrit]] for "[[name]]". Spiritually, it is the principal method or tool of meditation, which is meant to unite the soul with the Supreme Soul.

It is believed that God existed before the creation of the universe. The name of God is therefore beyond the language structure created by mankind. The Nām meaning the name is the internal rhythm,  the internal sound that a man experiences, the true name of God, and thus ultimate [[Japa]], as it is called in Hinduism, or [[Jaap Sahib|Jaap]] in Sikhism.

In [[Thai language|Thai]] ''naam'' (น้ำ) can also mean water, though this is pronounced and spelled differently from ''naam'' (นาม) which is used—directly from [[Pali]]/[[Sanskrit]]—to mean 'name' or 'noun'.

'''Paul Rabinow''' (born June 21, 1944) is Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California]] (Berkeley), Director of the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and former Director of Human Practices for the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC). He is perhaps most famous for his widely influential commentary and expertise on the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].

His major works include ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' (1977 and 2007), ''Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics'' (1983) (with [[Hubert Dreyfus]]), ''The Foucault Reader'' (1984), ''French Modern: Norms and Forms of the Social Environment'' (1989), ''Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology'' (1993), ''Essays on the Anthropology of Reason'' (1996), ''Anthropos Today: Reflections on Modern Equipment'' (2003), and ''Marking Time: On the Anthropology of the Contemporary'' (2007).

==Biographical details==
Rabinow was born in Florida but moved as a small child to New York City.  He lived in Sunnyside, Queens and attended Stuyvessant High School [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIqniwh1U_4].

==Overview==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2012}}
Rabinow is known for his development of an "anthropology of reason". If anthropology is understood as being composed of anthropos + logos, then anthropology can be taken up as a practice of studying how the mutually productive relations of [[knowledge]], thought, and care are given form within shifting relations of power. More recently, Rabinow has developed a distinctive approach to what he calls an "anthropology of the contemporary" that moves methodologically beyond [[modernity]] as an object of study or as a metric to order all inquiries.

Rabinow is well known for conceptual work drawing on French, German and American traditions. He was a close interlocutor of Michel Foucault, and has edited and interpreted Foucault’s work as well as ramifying it in new directions.

Rabinow’s work has consistently confronted the challenge of inventing and practicing new forms of inquiry, writing, and [[ethics]] for the [[human sciences]]. He argues that currently the dominant knowledge production practices, institutions, and venues for understanding things human in the 21st century are inadequate institutionally and epistemologically. In response, he has designed modes of experimentation and collaboration consisting in focused concept work and the explorations of new forms of case-based inquiry.

Rabinow has also devoted a great deal of energy to the invention of new venues, adjacent to the existing university structures, diagnosing the university’s disciplinary organization and career patterns as among the major impediment to 21st century thought. In view of the fact that the organization and practices of the social sciences and humanities in the U.S. university system have changed little in recent decades, they are unlikely to facilitate the composition of contemporary equipment. Rabinow has called for the creation of venues that are adjacent to, but more flexible than, the university and the existing disciplinary structure. He has played leading roles in the design of two such organizations, the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).

The Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory was founded by Paul Rabinow, Stephen Collier, and Andrew Lakoff as part of an effort to create new forms of inquiry in the human sciences. Its aspiration is to create models for new infrastructures, tools of collaboration, and practices of inquiry. The core of the ARC collaboratory is ongoing reflection and communication in a now broadening network of scholars about concept formation and collaboratory work in the human sciences. ARC is a collaboratory for inquiry into contemporary forms of life, labor, and language. ARC engages in empirical study and conceptual work with global reach and long-term perspective. ARC creates contemporary equipment for collaborative work adequate to emergent challenges in the 21st century. ARC’s current concerns focus on interconnections among security, ethics, and the sciences.

==Concept work==
The relation of concepts and cases in Rabinow’s work distinguishes itself from the more common mode of social science work predicated on using examples to test general theories or philosophical practice that seeks analytic clarity about universals or general (often highly abstract) cases. In contrast, Rabinow argues that work on concepts opens up and orients inquiry into the concrete features of distinctive cases, whereas the use of ostensibly timeless theory or universal concepts are unlikely to be very helpful in drawing attention to particularities and singularities. Given this goal, such traditional approaches can function as a real impediment to inquiry. Rabinow defines concept work as “constructing, elaborating and testing a conceptual inventory as well as specifying and experimenting with multi-dimensional diagnostic and analytic frames.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett, “Toward Synthetic Anthropos: Remediating Concepts” online at www.anthropos-lab.net/documents&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, Rabinow’s work continues with appropriate modifications a social scientific tradition stretching from [[Max Weber]] through [[Clifford Geertz]].

Rabinow holds that concepts are tools designed to be used on specified problems and calibrated to the production of pragmatic outcomes both analytic and ethical. As such, concepts must be adjusted to the changing topology of problem spaces. Concept work involves archaeological, genealogical, and diagnostic dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow and Hubert Dreyfus, Michel Foucault, Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982 (2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologically, concept work involves investigating and characterizing concepts as part of a prior repertoire or structured conceptual ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans. [[A.M. Sheridan Smith]], New York: Harper &amp; Row,1972, (orig. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogically, concept work frees concepts from their field of emergence by showing the contingent history of their selection, formation, as well as their potential contemporary significance.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” in Paul Rabinow, editor, The Foucault Reader, New York: Pantheon Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnostically, concept work involves a critical function: testing the adequacy and appropriateness of a given concept or repertoire of concepts to new problems and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow, Essays on the Anthropology of Reason, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology of the contemporary==
As a mode of inquiry Rabinow distinguishes the Anthropology of the Contemporary from Michel Foucault’s History of the Present. As Rabinow describes it, the History of the Present consists in formulating an understanding of the past as “a means of showing the contingency of the present and thereby contribute to making a more open future.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett, “Toward Synthetic Anthropos: Remediating Concept,” online at www.anthropos-lab.net/documents&lt;/ref&gt; The current challenge is to be specific about which inquiries and what objects are best engaged with an approach that is drawn from a History of the Present orientation.
Contrastingly, Rabinow defines the contemporary as a (re)assemblage of both old and new elements and their interactions and interfaces. This means, among other things, that contemporary problems and objects are emergent and consequently, by definition, contingent. Emergence refers to “a state in which multiple elements combine to produce an assemblage, whose significance cannot be reduced to prior elements and relations.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett, “From Bio-Ethics to Human Practices,” In Tactical Biopolitics, Costa and Philips, eds. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the History of the Present, while often helpful, is not fully adequate to work on the contemporary because by definition the contemporary is contingent.

Rabinow identifies “the contemporary” as a temporal and ontological problem space. In ''Marking Time'' (2007) he distinguishes two senses of the term contemporary. First, to be contemporary is to exist at the same time as something else. This meaning has temporal but no historical connotations. The second sense, however, carries both temporal and historical connotations, and it is this meaning that figures in Rabinow’s work. Rabinow takes up the contemporary as a “moving ratio.” Just as “the modern” can be thought of as a moving ratio of tradition and modernity, so the contemporary “is a moving ratio of modernity, moving through the recent past and near future in a (non-linear) space.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow, Marking Time: On the Anthropology of the Contemporary, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the Anthropology of the Contemporary consists of analytic work that helps develop modes of inquiry into under-determined, emergent and discordant relations. It seeks to develop methods, practices, and forms of inquiry and narration coherent and co-operable with understandings of the mode (or modes) taken by anthropos as figure and an assemblage today.

Inquiry into the contemporary is both analytic and synthetic. It is analytic in that sets of relations must be decomposed and specified, synthetic in that these relations must be recomposed and given new form. In this sense, work on the contemporary falls within a zone of analytic consideration in that it consists of linking the recent past to the near future and the near future to the recent past.

==Anthropos as a problem==
Rabinow’s work on the anthropology of the contemporary was formally initiated by his diagnosis of anthropos (Greek, “the human thing”) as a problem today for thought, equipment, and venues. This diagnosis is carried out most systematically in his works ''Anthropos Today'' (2003) and ''Marking Time'' (2007). Rabinow describes anthropos as a being which today is burdened with a multiple and heterogeneous truths about itself, a being of hetero-logoi.&lt;ref name="Paul Rabinow 2003"&gt;Paul Rabinow, Anthropos Today: Reflections on Modern Equipment, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of inquiry, methods of narration, and principles of verification must be designed in view of the “apparently unavoidable fact that anthropos is that being who suffers from too many logoi.”&lt;ref name="Paul Rabinow 2003"/&gt;

It follows that in order to pose and eventually to answer the question “what is anthropos today?” modes of thought are needed which not only open up new possibilities, but also discriminate significance, and forms truth claims into practices for the ethical life. Using a classical formulation, Rabinow argues that anthropos today is in need of paraskeue or equipment for forming logos into ethos. In his 1981-82 lectures at the Collège de France Michel Foucault provided an extensive meditation on the classical notion of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, The Hermeneutics of the Subject, lectures at the Collège de France, 1981-82. Trans. Graham Burchell, New York: Palgrave macmillan, 2005 (orig. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In those lectures Foucault shows that in antique thought the mandate to “know thyself” was connected and oriented to an imperative to “care for thyself.” Ramifying Foucault’s insight in new directions, Rabinow has posed the challenge of inventing equipment adequate to ethical and scientific problems today—contemporary equipment.

If the challenge of contemporary equipment is to develop a mode of thinking as ethical practice, it also involves the design or redesign of venues within which such formation is possible. Rabinow deals directly with the problem of venues in the work ''Synthetic Anthropos'' (with Gaymon Bennett) (2009). In that work Rabinow and Bennett argue that the question of where and how the composition of equipment takes place is itself a primary problem site.

==Collaboration==
A defining feature of the venues Rabinow has called for and worked on is collaboration. Understood as a mode of work, Rabinow defines collaboration in distinction to cooperation. A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett, “Human Practices: Interfacing Three Modes of Collaboration,” in The Prospect of Protocells: Social and Ethical Implications of Recreating Life, Bedau and Parke, eds. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation does not entail either a common definition of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. It entails a common definition of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).

Rabinow calls for the invention of new modes of collaboration where problem-spaces are unstable or emergent, and where prior problems and their significance can no longer be taken for granted and can fruitfully be contested. Such situations require the reworking of existing modes of reasoning and intervention, adjusting these modes to the topography of the emerging problem-space. It follows that collaboration is a mode of work appropriate to the anthropology of the contemporary

==Case work==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2012}}
Case work functions as an exercise in framing problems so as to identify potentially significant elements, relations, and interfaces. Case work underscores questions of how such material should be presented. Case work can indicate strengths and weaknesses in the venues in which inquiry is initiated and formed. Casework, therefore, is an essential aspect of inquiry neither reducible to theory nor an end-in-itself.

(a) ''Constructing Equipment, Can the Human and Life Science Collaborate? (SynBERC 2006–2011).''

Rabinow was an investigator in the (Human) Practices Thrust of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center. http://synberc.org. With Gaymon Bennett, he had been part of a collaborative effort to re-think the relationship between ethics and science within this NSF funded Engineering Research Center. In SynBERC, the mandate from the NSF was to invent a collaborative mode of engagement such that the relationship between ethics and science might be reconceived and reworked.

(b) ''Chronicling Emergent Organizations (Celera Diagnostics 2003).''

Rabinow, working with Talia Dan-Cohen, then an undergraduate at Berkeley, took up the challenge of chronicling Celera Diagnostic’s efforts to turn the complete sequence of the human genome into tools for diagnosing molecular predispositions for pathological developments in health. The anthropological work was an experiment in thought and production, given a self-imposed one year time limit for both research and writing. It was an experiment in collaboration involving first and second order modes of observation. The product is Rabinow and Dan-Cohen’s A Machine to Make a Future: Biotech Chronicles.

(c) ''New Venues: Problematizing Knowledge, Care and Ethics (Centre d'Études du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) 1994).''

The fieldwork leading up to French DNA: Trouble in Purgatory focused on a multidimensional crisis revolving around a proposal for commercial collaboration between an American biotechnology start-up company and the French laboratory that led the genome sequencing effort in France, the CEPH. As opposed to his earlier book, French Modern, French DNA is not a history of the present but an initial case study in the anthropology of the contemporary. Rabinow accepted the challenge from the Center’s scientific director to be a 'philosophic observer.’ His task was to identify the formation of constellations of value judgments around new forms of scientific knowledge, and to make that process available for further debate and modification, not to adjudicate disputes. The text is in part a meditation on committed ‘disinterestedness:’ “a certain vocational integrity, an asceticism in Weber and Foucault's senses, a certain rigor and patience that could, lead us somewhere beyond what we already believe and know.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinow, French DNA, Trouble in Purgatory, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; This work still emphasizes the observation in “participant-observation” and can be contrasted to latter work at SynBERC in which both poles are put into play.

(d) ''New Venues of Knowledge and Commerce: The Rise of Biotech Start-up Companies, (Cetus Corporation 1980s).''

Cetus Corporation (later, Roche Molecular Systems) figured as both a scientific and anthropological milieu within which to explore a set of a highly specific set of political, economic, scientific and legal vectors that generated a new industry as well as a major technological development, the polymerase chain reaction. Contrary to narratives of invention and discovery as the work of individual geniuses, Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology highlights the assembling and governing of scientific and technical prowess, sustained teamwork, management skills, legal input and material resources, all of which were necessary for this fundamental molecular biological tool to emerge, be stabilized, commercialized and to become rapidly a tool fundamental for all biological research.

(e) ''The Invention of Modern Equipment: (France and its Colonies 1830-1930'').

French Modern: Norms and Forms of the Social Environment is a fine-grained genealogical account on the rise of the French “social” moving conceptually through domains as diverse as nineteenth century epidemiology, sociology, the Beaux Arts, colonial administration, Lamarckian biology, statistics, etc. French Modern demonstrates the century long process of bringing these domains of knowledge and practices of power slowly into a common frame of rationality and eventually into an operative apparatus characteristic of the welfare state.

(f)'' Philosophy as Inquiry: Fieldwork in Philosophy (Encountering Hubert Dreyfus, Robert Bellah and Michel Foucault, 1976-84).''

Trained at the University of Chicago in the history of philosophy under the tutelage of Richard McKeon, where McKeon emphasized the rhetorical and pragmatic functions of philosophy (Dewey), Rabinow renewed this activity and moved beyond the work of his advisor, Clifford Geertz. Encounters with Robert Bellah and Hubert Dreyfus at UC Berkeley in the context of a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship year (1976–77) led to a focus on interpretive social science and ethical practice on the one hand, and an education in Heidegger and the question of technology and modern philosophy on the other. The work with Dreyfus led to a fortuitous encounter with Michel Foucault in 1979, the development of an intense dialogic working relationship, and a joint book with Dreyfus, ''Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics'', as well as an anthology of Foucault’s works (in consultation with Foucault), ''The Foucault Reader'', published shortly before his death.

(g) ''Anthropology as Inquiry: Inheriting the Modern(Morocco, Middle Atlas Mountains 1968-1970).''

The importance of colonial history, the self-understanding of descendents of an Islamic saint, the dilemma of tradition and modernity as well as fieldwork itself, as a practice, rite and site of self-formation, became case material for reflection. The major themes that Rabinow will consistently pursue for the next decades are all incipiently present in these untimely reflections; ethics as form giving, motion and care.

"[https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA465 Expansion not Imperialism]" p. 465. (''cf''. [...] Felix Adler [states ...] "if, instead of establishing the Pax Americana so far as our influence avails throughout this continent, we should enter into' the field of Old World strife, and seek the sort of glory that is written in human blood." Here it is assumed that we have failed in establishing self-government, and propose to substitute, at least in other lands, an Old World form of government. This sort of argument has no effect on the expansionist, because he believes that we have magnificently succeeded in our problem, in spite of failures, neglects, and violations of our own principles, and because what he wishes to do is, not to abandon the experiment, but, inspired by the successes of the past, extend the Pax Americana over lands not included in this continent.")&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for "American Peace", modeled after ''[[Pax Romana]]'', ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'') is a term applied to the concept of relative [[peace]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and later the world beginning around the middle of the 20th century, thought to be caused by the preponderance of power enjoyed by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Pax+Americana|title=Definition of PAX AMERICANA|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used with different meanings and eras, such as the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era in [[North America]],&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia"&gt;Lalor, John J., ''Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States''. Chicago: Rand, McNally, 1884. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=OC0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA959 The Union]", p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt; and regionally in the Americas at the start of the 20th century.

''Pax Americana'' is primarily used in its modern connotations to refer to the peace among [[great powers]] established after the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, also called [[Long Peace|the Long Peace]]. In this modern sense, it has come to indicate the military and economic position of the United States in relation to other nations.  For example, the [[Marshall Plan]], which spent $13 billion to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, has been seen as "the launching of the pax americana".&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Mee, ''The Marshall Plan: The launching of the pax americana'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term derives from ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]]. The term is most notably associated with ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (1815–1914) under the [[British Empire]], which served as the global hegemon and constabulary from the late 18th century until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Magazine''. 1885. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bPEvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413#v=onepage&amp;q=pax%20britannica&amp;f=false The Federal Union]", p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early period ==
{{Main|Gilded Age}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1865–1918)|Territorial changes of the United States|Overseas expansion of the United States}}
The first articulation of a ''Pax Americana'' occurred after the end of the [[American Civil War]] with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among [[developed nation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |title=sagehistory.net |publisher=sagehistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629043938/http://sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |archivedate=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of its national [[credo]], historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-25|title=American Exceptionalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of [[immigrants]] and the first [[modern democracy]]. From the establishment of the United States after the [[American Revolution]] until the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[foreign policy of the United States]] had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national [[prosperity]]. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the [[Federation|federal]] constitutional republic.&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia" /&gt; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of ''Forum'': "The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the ''pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00344727?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Pax+Americana&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|title=Help – Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[rise of the New Imperialism#New Imperialism and the emerging empires|rise of the New Imperialism]] in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[isolationism|isolationist]] factions in the U.S. Here, ''Pax Americana'' was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]] and steel tycoon [[Andrew Carnegie]]. American politicians such as [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[William McKinley]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow the constitutional government]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and establish a [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]] and then a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]]. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the [[Newlands Resolution]] in July 1898.

After its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]], the United States had gained a [[colonial empire]]. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly [[China]]. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a [[sphere of influence]] in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar"&gt;Kirkpatrick, F. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 ''South America and the War'']: Being the Substance of a Course of Lectures Delivered in the University of London, King's College Under the Tooke Trust in the Lent Term, 1918. Cambridge [England]: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a "Pax Americana".&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt;

European powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global [[sea power]] which the [[British Empire]] enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bernard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=m38uhldLcGsC ''Empire and Superempire: Britain, America and the World'']. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserving the [[freedom of the seas]] and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the [[Informal Empire]] that accompanied Britain's imperial possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.

The United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted [[protectionism]] after the [[Spanish–American War]] and built up the navy, the "[[Great White Fleet]]", to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became [[President of the United States|President]] in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]. The [[Philippine–American War]] arose from the ongoing [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|author=John M.

== Interwar period ==
{{Main|Interwar period}}
The United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of ''Pax Britannica'' before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the [[World Bank]] or [[United Nations]] which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Harold. The Interwar Depression in an International Context. München: R. Oldenbourg, 2002.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DE4P7NdaycC&amp;pg=PA135 Great Depression]'' pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.&lt;br /&gt;
[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumbnail|left|The Gap in the Bridge. Cartoon about the absence of the U.S. from the League of Nations, depicted as the missing keystone of the arch.]]

The United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the [[Interwar period]] did the United States become a part of the international system.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability.&lt;ref name="ParchamiHegemonic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parchami|first=Ali|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQPEdl_cGHEC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=181|chapter=The Pax Americana Debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of  European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John (1998), The First World War, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|0-09-180178-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve ''Pax America'' as a [[corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy"&gt;Einstein, Lewis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gpUMAAAAYAAJ A Prophecy of the War (1913–1914)]. New York: Columbia University Press, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the "Great War" initially had properly been one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;

The average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:&lt;ref&gt;Roland Hugins, ''The Possible Peace'', New York, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for "a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values." We have a deep abhorrence of war for war's sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the "masters of the world." The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between [[Liberalism]] and [[reactionary|reaction]], between the aspirations of [[democracy]] and the [[Wilhelminism]] [[Blood and Iron (speech)|gospel of iron]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bismarck introduced this in the era of force.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern ''Pax Americana'' era is cited by both supporters and critics of [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] after World War II. However, from 1946 to 1992 ''Pax americana'' is considered a partial international order, as it applied only to capitalist bloc countries, being preferable for some authors to speak about a ''Pax americana et sovietica''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibañez Muñoz, Josep, "El desafío a la Pax americana: del 11 de septiembre a la guerra de Irak" in C. García and A. J. Rodrigo (eds) "El imperio inviable. El orden internacional tras el conflicto de Irak", Madrid: Tecnos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90 page document, ''[[Project for the New American Century#Rebuilding America's Defenses|Rebuilding America's Defenses]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |title=Rebuilding America's Defenses Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century |publisher=Newamericancentury.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923154604/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Project for the New American Century]], but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and [[hyperpower]] as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the [[Cold War]], and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]].

The modern ''Pax Americana'' may be seen as similar to the period of peace in [[Roman Empire|Rome]], ''[[Pax Romana]]''. In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'.  During both ''Pax Romana'' and ''Pax Americana'' wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace.  Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their [[military]], [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[manufacturing]].

=== ''Pax Britannica'' heritage ===
{{Main|Pax Britannica}}

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]] played the role of [[Offshore balancing|offshore-balancer]] in Europe, where the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time.  The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong [[nation-state]]s, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]]. In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], as well as numerous other wars. ''[[La Belle Époque]]'', [[William Wohlforth]] argued, was rather ''Pax Britannica'', ''Russica'' and later ''Germanica'', and between 1853 and 1871 it was not ''Pax'' of any kind.&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39"&gt;"The Stability of a Unipolar World,"' ''International Security'', 24/1, (1999): p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British hegemony, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a "[[special relationship]]" between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], members of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]], such as [[Harold Macmillan]], liked to think of [[Anglo-American relations|Britain's relationship with America]] as similar to that of a progenitor [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] to America's [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/09/06/do0602.xml  Labour's love-in with America is nothing new] [[Daily Telegraph]] 6 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, both have been active in [[North America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, and [[Asia]]n countries.

=== Late 20th century ===
{{Main|American Century}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1945–1964)|History of the United States (1964–1980)}}

After the Second World War, no [[war|armed conflict]] emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no [[nuclear weapon]]s were used in open conflict.  The [[United Nations]] was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]], which included the United States.

In the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]], the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's [[gold]] reserves, and was the world's sole [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear power]]. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the [[Old World]], victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic [[infrastructure]] virtually unscathed and its [[Military of the United States|military forces]] at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States [[air power]], just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its [[sea power]].&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Robert Frank, "Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force 1907–1960". DIANE Publishing, 1989. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kps2EhXM-lwC&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'' was seen to have occurred following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|collapse]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Patrick P. From Globalism to Regionalism: New Perspectives on US Foreign and Defense Policies. [Washington, D.C.]: [National Defense Univ. Press], 1993. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ-jjUbxveUC&amp;pg=PA213 p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Pax Americana'' was explicitly used by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on "American weapons of war" was undesirable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a ''Pax Americana'' enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

Beginning around the [[Vietnam War]], the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of ''[[Neocolonialism]]'' was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the [[Third World]] and other developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Anuradha M.

{{Main|Great power|Superpower}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1980–1991)|History of the United States (1991-present)}}
Currently, the ''Pax Americana'' is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world's ''commons''—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the [[Unified Command Plan]] which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Notably, "the right to command" translated into Latin renders ''imperium''. Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the [[Rio Pact]], [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]] and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for [[Robert J. Art]], "was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Robert J., Art, "Geopolitics Updated: The Strategy of Selective Engagement", ''International Security'', 23/3 (1998–99), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Security Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of ''Pax Americana'' shortly after the ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'':
{{quote|
In contrast [to the earlier empires], the scope and pervasiveness of American global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all the world's oceans, its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia&amp;nbsp;... American vassals and tributaries, some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot the entire Eurasian continent&amp;nbsp;... American global supremacy is&amp;nbsp;... buttered by an elaborate system of alliances and coalitions that literally span the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]'', (Perseus Books, New York, 1997, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Besides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the [[United Nations]] and [[WTO]]). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the [[Marshall Plan]] and in the reconstruction of [[Japan]], economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the [[Iron Curtain]]/[[Eastern Bloc]] and the widening of the [[Cold War]].

[[File:Antiimperialismo caracas.jpg|thumb|left|Street art in [[Caracas]], depicting [[Uncle Sam]] and accusing the American government of [[imperialism]]]]

Being in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of [[communism]] in [[China]] and the detonation of the first Soviet [[atom bomb]], the historically [[Noninterventionism|non-interventionist]] U.S. also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (World Bank), part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[international financial system|international financial management]] was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a [[fixed exchange rate]] to the US dollar. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade [[tariff]]s.

With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], the demise of the notion of a ''[[Pax Sovietica]]'', and the end of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and [[East Asia]]. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as "the world's [[police]]man" has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfield, H. Bradford. ''The Instruments of America's Foreign Policy''. New York: Crowell, 1963. p. 138. (''cf''. "the traditional American aversion to foreign wars, but also related to some recent disillusionment with the fruits of total wars&amp;nbsp;...")&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in "Rebuilding America's Defenses":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global ''Pax Americana'' will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{Cite news

This is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that "there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de" /&gt; It should be noted that resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.
In the ''[[post-communism]]'' world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister [[Hubert Védrine]] describes the US as a hegemonic [[hyperpower]], while the U.S. political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] counter that the US is not a "true" hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Sr., ''Understanding International Conflicts: An introduction to Theory and History'', pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of India|India]], and the [[European Union]].

Joseph Nye discredited the United States as not a "true" hegemony in his 2002 article titled "The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 23/3, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} His book of the same year he opens: "Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others."&lt;ref&gt;''The Paradox of American Power'', (Oxford University Press, New York, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; And his 1991 book he titled ''Bound to Lead''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bound To Lead: The Changing Nature Of American Power'' (Basic Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leadership'', translated into Greek, renders ''[[hegemony]]''; an alternative translation is ''archia'' – Greek common word for ''empire''. Having defined the US hegemony as "not true", Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. "Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-11-01/future-american-power The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective]", ''Foreign Affairs'' (November–December  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are striking parallels with the early ''Pax Romana'' (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that ''Pax Romana'' other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called "clients". The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called "friends and allies"—a popular expression under the ''Pax Americana''.

One of the first to use the term ''Pax Americana'' was the [[Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy]]. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to replace the British Empire. Therefore, the United States "must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, ''To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon Secret War Plans'', Boston: South End Press, 1987, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swen Holdar, the founder of [[geopolitics]] [[Rudolf Kjellen]] (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term ''Pax Americana'' shortly after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ideal State and the Power of Geography. The Life Work of Rudolf Kjellen", ''Political Geography Quarterly'', 11/3 (1992): p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is this "11/3"? A date? Who wrote it?|date=July 2018}} Writing in 1945, [[Ludwig Dehio]] remembered that the Germans used the term ''Pax Anglosaxonica'' in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:
{{quote|
Now [1918] the [American colonial] cutting had grown into a tree that bade fair to overshadow the globe with its foliage. Amazed and shaken, we Germans began to discuss the possibility of a Pax Anglosaxonica as a world-wide counterpart to the Pax Romana. Suddenly the tendency toward global unification towered up, ready to gather the separate national states of Europe together under one banner and blanket in a larger cohesion&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Dehio, ''The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle'', 1945 (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. "Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role." Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], invoked the example of the two-centuries long "Pax Romana" which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:
{{quote|
During the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers—Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the 'Pax Romana'&amp;nbsp;... It may be that America's air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace&amp;nbsp;... This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One of the first criticisms of "Pax Americana" was written by [[Nathaniel Peffer]] in 1943:
{{quote|
It is neither feasible nor desirable&amp;nbsp;... Pax Americana can be established and maintained only by force, only by means of a new, gigantic imperialism operating with the instrumentalities of militarism and the other concomitants of imperialism&amp;nbsp;... The way to dominion is through empire and the price of dominion is empire, and empire generates its own opposition.&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''Political Science Quarterly'', 58/1 (1943): pp. 12, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is "58/1"? Who is the author?|date=July 2018}}}}
However, Peffer was not certain that this would not happen: "It is conceivable that&amp;nbsp;... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation." He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: "That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''op. cit.'', pp. 12, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of Pax Americana, [[Michio Kaku]] and [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: "[[Gunboat diplomacy]] would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. [[Pax Britannica]] would give way to Pax Americana." After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Red Army.&lt;ref name="To Win a Nuclear War, p 64"&gt;''To Win a Nuclear War'', ''op. cit.'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the [[Unipolarity|unipolar moment]]. [[Joshua Muravchik]] commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, "At Last, Pax Americana". He detailed:
{{quote|
Last but not least, the Gulf War marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire—a real competitor with American power—was born at the same moment. The result was not a "pax" of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world&amp;nbsp;... During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Muravchick, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/opinion/at-last-pax-americana.html At Last, Pax Americana]", ''The New York Times'' (January 24, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], confessed seven years later: "In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon&amp;nbsp;... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy." The draft's strategy aimed "to prevent any hostile power from dominating" a Eurasian region "whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power". He added: "Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a ''Pax Americana''&amp;nbsp;... It won't work&amp;nbsp;...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a ''Pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wolfowitz, "Remembering the Future", ''National Interest'', 59: (2000), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War period, concluded [[William Wohlforth]], much less ambiguously deserves to be called ''Pax Americana''. "Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality".&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39" /&gt;

The ‘’Pax Americana’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The phrase "American Empire" appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Go, ''Patterns of Empire: The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present'' (New York: Cambridge University Press,  2011), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] observed:
{{Quote|

{{American Empire}}

''American imperialism'' is a term referring to outcomes or ideological elements of United States foreign policy. Since the start of the [[cold war]], the United States has economically and/or diplomatically supported friendly foreign governments, including many that overtly violated the civil and human rights of their own citizens and residents.  American imperialism concepts were initially a product of capitalism critiques and, later, of theorists opposed to what they take to be aggressive United States policies and doctrines. Although there are various views of the imperialist nature of the United States, which describe many of the same policies and institutions as evidence of imperialism, explanations for imperialism vary widely. In spite of such literature, the historians Archibald Paton Thorton and Stuart Creighton Miller argue against the very coherence of the concept. Miller argues that the overuse and abuse of the term "imperialism" makes it nearly meaningless as an analytical concept.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Stuart Creighton  | title="Benevolent Assimilation" The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-02697-8 | url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/4300.html#miller}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polanyi’s paradox''', named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher [[Michael Polanyi]], is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book ''The Tacit Dimension'' in 1966, but it was economist [[David Autor]] that named it as Polanyi’s paradox in his 2014 research paper on “Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Autor|first=David|title=Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth|url=http://www.nber.org.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/papers/w20485.pdf|pages=1–48|year=2014|series=NBER Working Paper Series|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarised in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’, Polanyi’s paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This "self-ignorance" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their [[tacit knowledge]], which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tacit Dimension|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=May 2009|isbn=9780226672984|location=Chicago|pages=1–26|oclc=262429494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Origins ==
British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work ''The Tacit Dimension'' (1966)'','' Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of "tacit knowledge", as opposed to the term "[[explicit knowledge]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tacit knowledge]] can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through [[implicit learning]], the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to television and day-to-day communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Arthur|date=September 1989|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Reber/publication/232481584_Implicit_learning_of_tacit_knowledge/links/0a85e533465dd6c4ef000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=118|pages=219–235|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ganga Rejuvenation : Governance Challenges and Policy Options|last=Asanarong|first=Thanathorn|last2=Jeon|first2=Sowon|last3=Ren|first3=Yuanlin|last4=Yeo|first4=Christopher|date=18 December 2018|publisher=World Scientific|others=Wu Xun, Robert James Wasson, Ora-Orn Poocharoen|isbn=9789814704588|location=New Jersey|pages=349|chapter=Creating a Knowledge Management Culture for Ganga River|oclc=1013819475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, "tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chugh|first=Ritesh|title=Do Australian Universities Encourage Tacit Knowledge Transfer|url=https://www.academia.edu/19661139|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management|pages=128–135|year=2015|place=Lisbon, PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacit knowledge can also be described as ''know-how,'' distinguishing from ''know-that'' or ''facts.''&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between ''knowing-that (knowledge of proposition)'' and ''knowing-how.'' According to Ryle, this ''know-how'' knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryle|first=Gilbert|date=1945|title=Knowing How and Knowing That: The Presidential Address|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=46|pages=1–16|jstor=4544405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a prelude to ''The Tacit Dimension'', in his book ''Personal Knowledge'' (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a [[Postpositivism|post-positivist]] approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self-evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal Knowledge : Towards a Post-critical Philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael,|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|others=|year=1974|isbn=978-0226672885|edition=  |location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=880960082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
Polanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that "our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment — human intuitive knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Android Dreams: the Past, Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence|last=Walsh|first=Toby|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd|date=September 7, 2017|isbn=9781849048712|location=London|pages=89–97|oclc=985805795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of [[self-driving car]]s and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans as a Service : the Promise and Perils of Work in the Gig Economy|last=Prassl|first=Jeremias|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198797012|edition=  |location=Oxford|pages=138–139|oclc=1005117556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 Confounding Questions that Hold the Key to the Future of Driverless Cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=January 15, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing [[Job polarisation|occupational polarisation]] in the past few decades —the growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs — has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-&amp;shy;intensive jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle-income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-&amp;shy;intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe|date=February 2015|title=Is Information Technology Destroying the Middle Class?|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/2/182648-is-information-technology-destroying-the-middle-class/fulltext|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=58|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some technological optimists argue that recent advances in [[machine learning]] have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relaying on programmer’s algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Susskind|first=Daniel|title=Re-Thinking the Capabilities of Machines in Economics|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/15127/825-susskind-capabilities-of-machines.pdf|pages=1–14|year=2017|series=University of Oxford Department of Economics Discussion Paper Series|place=Oxford, OX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AlphaGo]] program built by the Google subsidiary [[DeepMind]] is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world’s top GO players, [[Lee Sedol|Lee Se-dol]], four games to one.

On the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|date=September 29, 2014|isbn=9780393240764|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=11–12|oclc=870098283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Kaplan]], a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book ''Humans Need Not Apply'' by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in [[Computer cluster|server clusters]] or on the 'cloud' (reasoning).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans Need Not Apply : a Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|last=Kaplan|first=Jerry|publisher=Yale University Press|date=August 4, 2015|isbn=9780300223576|location=New Haven|pages=41–43, 145|oclc=907143085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, "Automation is blind to the colour of your collar."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

One example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google’s CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, "abstract task") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607894/why-googles-ceo-is-excited-about-automating-artificial-intelligence/|title=Google’s CEO is excited about seeing AI take over some work of his AI experts|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 17, 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moravec's paradox ===

[[Moravec's paradox|Moravec’s paradox]] is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform. Examples include [[natural language processing]] and dextrous physical movements (e.g. running over rough terrain).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies|last=Brynjolfsson|first=Erik|last2=McAfee|first2=Andrew|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|others=|date=January 20, 2014|isbn=9780393239355|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=47–50|oclc=867423744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robotics experts have, therefore, discovered that machines are difficult to master the skills of even the least-trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book ''[[The Language Instinct]],'' "The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1994|isbn=978-0688121419|location=New York|pages=|oclc=28723210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced. Gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are, by contrast, currently secure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Moore's Law ===
[[Moore's Law]] is the observation articulated by [[Gordon Moore]] in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be fitted onto an integrated circuit doubles every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gordon|date=April 19, 1965|title=Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jproc.2010.2044436|journal=Electronics|volume=38|issue=8|pages=114–117|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's law has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning and AI. The larger and larger capacity of a chip allows for the advent of extremely small data-collecting devices, which could be placed on any intelligent machine. Innovations resulted from the exponentially growing power of computer chips include mobile apps, video games, spreadsheets, and accurate weather forecasts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/|title=The Foundation of the Computing Industry’s Innovation is Faltering. What Can Replace It?|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 13, 2016|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore’s Law changes the way people are valued. As machines can do more and more tasks for free, people become correspondingly expensive. On the other hand, Moore's Law to some extents erases the line between an ordinary person and a skilled person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/829937196|title=Who Owns the Future?|last=Lanier|first=Jaron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2013|isbn=9781451654967|edition= First Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover |location=New York|pages=|oclc=829937196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Moore’s prediction had been realized until around 2012, Intel announced in 2015 that the pace was slowing to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/technology/smaller-faster-cheaper-over-the-future-of-computer-chips.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-2&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article|title=Smaller, Faster, Cheaper, Over: The Future of Computer Chips|last=Markoff|first=John|date=September 26, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wenisch, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, thinks the stagnant development of chips with denser transistors would create a problem for areas like mobile devices, data centers, and self-driving cars on different timescales. Without Moore's Law as the feedstock of innovation in computing, technology companies have to work harder to achieve new development levels (e.g. to get a new breakthrough on Polanyi's paradox).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Richard Sylvan''' (13 December 1935 – 16 June 1996) was a [[philosopher]], [[logician]], and [[environmentalist]].

== Biography ==
Sylvan was born '''Francis Richard Routley''' in [[Levin, New Zealand]], and his early work is cited with this surname. He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now [[Victoria University of Wellington]]), and then [[Princeton University]], before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the [[University of Sydney]]. From 1971 until his death in [[Bali, Indonesia]], he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. 

Sylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist [[Val Plumwood|Val Routley]] (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Dominic (2014). Eco-Logical Lives. The Philosophical Lives of Richard Routley/Sylvan and Val Routley/Plumwood. Cambridge: White Horse Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (née Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name ''Sylvan'' (an English word meaning "of the forest") to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to [[environmentalism]].

== Work in logic and metaphysics ==
Sylvan was instrumental in the development and study of [[relevance logic]]. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed a semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers [[Nuel Belnap]] and [[Alan Ross Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Routley, R. and V. Routley (1972). “Semantics of First Degree Entailment”, Noûs, 3: 335-359.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into a semantics for a large number of logical systems.
Their work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley's work had particular influence for [[Graham Priest]], a well-known proponent of non-classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, G., Routley, R., and Norman, J. (eds.) (1989). Paraconsistent Logic: Essays on the Inconsistent, München: Philosophia Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on [[dialetheism]] — the view that some contradictions are true.&lt;ref&gt;See Routley, Richard and Meyer, Robert K. (1976), "Dialectical Logic, Classical Logic and the Consistency of the World", Studies in Soviet Thought 16: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after meeting Priest, then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1979), "Dialectical Logic, Semantics and Metamathematics", Erkenntnis 14: 301-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvan's studies ranged over a variety of topics in [[logic]] and the [[philosophy of logic]]. He wrote important papers on [[free logic]], general [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;"Existence and identity in quantified modal logics," Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 10: 113-149 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural deduction]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;"A simple natural deduction system," Logique et Analyse 12: 129-152 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository).

From early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]-inspired ontology (which he called "noneism"), first presented in his 1966 paper, "Some Things Do Not Exist."&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1966): “Some Things Do Not Exist”. Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 7, 251–276.&lt;/ref&gt; After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, ''Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1982). Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond. Ridgeview Pub Co&lt;/ref&gt; The view—also defended in recent years by Priest&lt;ref&gt;Priest, Graham (2005): Towards Non-Being. The Logic and Metaphysics of Intentionality. Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt;—utilizes a [[modal logic|modal theory]] including "impossible worlds" to deal with supposed objects, like the "round square." Sylvan's formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong's original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.&lt;ref&gt;Reicher., "Non-Existent Objects", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Dominic (2001), ‘Richard (Routley) Sylvan: Writings on Logic and Metaphysics’,  History and Philosophy of Logic 22: 181-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental ethics and politics ==

Outside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of [[environmental ethics]] (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by [[Arne Næss]]). In his important 1973 paper "Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?",&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1973), "Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?", Proceedings of the XVth World 
Congress of Philosophy, Varna, 1: 205-10. Reprinted in "Environmental Philosophy: from Animal Rights to Radical Ecology", (ed. M. Zimmerman et al.), Prentice Hall: New Jersey, 1993, pp.12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of [[deep ecology]], but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard (1985), "A Critique of Deep Ecology", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #12, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, 60 pages. Also in serialised form: ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part I’, Radical Philosophy 40 (1985): 2-12; and ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part II’, Radical Philosophy 41 (1985): 10-22.  Reprinted in M. Redelift and G. Woodgate (eds), The Sociology of the Environment, Edward Elgar: London, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, Sylvan published several other notable articles and books on environmental ethics and issues,&lt;ref&gt;Beginning with: Routley, R., 1973. “Is there a need for a new, an environmental ethic?” Proceedings of the 15th World congress of Philosophy, vol. 1 pp. 205-10, Sophia: Sophia Press; and Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1973), "The Fight for the Forests: the Takeover of Australian Forests for Pines, Wood Chips and Intensive Forestry", Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra. Subsequently: Routley, Richard and Routley, Val (1979), "Against the Inevitability of Human Chauvinism" in K.E. Goodpaster and K.M. Sayre (eds), Ethics and the Problems of the 21st Century, Notre Dame University Press: South Bend, Indiana; Routley, R. and V. (1980), "Human Chauvinism and Environmental Ethics" in D. Mannison, M. McRobbie and R. Routley (eds), Environmental Philosophy, Department of Philosophy Monograph Series #2, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, pp. 96-189; Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1980), "Destructive Forestry in Melanesia and Australia", The Ecologist 10: 56-67; Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1985), "An Expensive Repair-Kit for Utilitarianism", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #7, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, pp. 21-55; and Sylvan, R. (1994), "Mucking With Nature" in ''Against the Main Stream: Critical Environmental Essayes, Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy'' {{sic}} #20, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; and he co-authored the 1994 book ''The Greening of Ethics'' with David Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard, Bennett, David, 1994. The Greening of Ethics, Cambridge: White Horse Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From his work in environmental ethics, Sylvan took an interest in [[anarchism]], contributing an often-cited entry on the subject to ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard (1995). "Anarchism". in Goodwin, Robert E. and Pettit. A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy. Philip. Blackwell Publishing. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Rifa'i Ratib''' (also Rifai raatheeb, Hadra rifa'iyya)  is a [[ritual]] performed by a section of Ahmed ar-Rifa'i . Rifai is a name which originates from [[sufi]] saint [[Shaikh Ahmed ar-Rifai]] who was born in the Wasit region in Baghdad, Iraq in 1118. Shaikh Rifai committed himself to memorise the Koran at the age of seven years and he is the founder of the Rifai Sufi Order.

Rifai Ratib .  performed at ritual festivals, and homes. they are done to escape from incurable diseases and to fulfil the aspirations of the people. 
''Byths'' or ''Ratheebs'' are sung during the ritual. (There are more than twenty different ''byths'' being used). [[daf]] main musical instruments used in Rifai Ratib.  During heightened states of Rifa'i Ratib, Rifa'i followers were noted to have eaten live snakes, entered ovens filled with fire and ridden on lions.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham 1998, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and thrusting iron spikes and glass into their bodies. .  The ritual consists of acts like piercing parts of one's own body like the tongue, the ear, and the stomach with knives and sharp-edged steel tools.  The followers and protagonists of the ritual believe, that even though injuries are inflicted on the bodies of the performers by [[weapons]],&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; these do not cause pain or damage to the body. According to many masters of the rifai sufi order, They believe that, since the ritual is performed by devotees who have received "ijazath" (permission) from their "sheikh" (deity), it will not cause injuries.
While some scholars attribute is it's allowed in Islam, but other scholars (like salafi Movement) contend sahaba were unaware of these practices and don't have any proof to real teaching  of Sahaba, Quran, and hadeeth. that these were introduced after the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanford "Sandy" H. Kadish''' (Sept. 7, 1921&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Andrew Cohen, [http://www.law.berkeley.edu/17696.htm "Former Dean and Criminal Law Giant Sanford Kadish Dies at 92"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016221740/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/17696.htm |date=2014-10-16 }}, ''Berkeley Law News'', Sept. 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; - Sept. 5, 2014) was an American [[criminal law]] scholar and theorist.  He was well known for his scholarship in [[criminology]] and [[criminal law theory]], and for being one of the drafters of the American ''[[Model Penal Code]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Sanford H. Kadish, "Codifiers of the Criminal Law: Wechsler's Predecessors", 78 ''[[Colum. L. Rev.]]'' 1098 (v.78, n.5, June 1978) for a review of the time prior to the MPC and the early work that led to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sanford Harold Kadish was born in 1921 in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;John S. Bowman, ''Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography'', Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; He graduated from [[City College of New York]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and then attended a [[Japanese language]] school in [[Colorado]].

He served in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II, translating Japanese military documents from the Pacific,&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; until he was discharged in 1946.&lt;ref name="columbiabio"&gt;[http://www.law.columbia.edu/law_school/communications/reports/Spring2002/six4 "Sanford Kadish '48"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018221015/http://www.law.columbia.edu/law_school/communications/reports/Spring2002/six4 |date=2014-10-18 }}, Columbia Law School Profiles.&lt;/ref&gt; Kadish earned his law degree from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1948; during that time he studied with professors [[Herb Wechsler]] and [[Walter Gellhorn]], who were influential on his career and scholarship.&lt;ref name="columbiabio" /&gt; After law school, he practiced privately in New York before entering legal academia in 1951 at the [[University of Utah Law School]], where he taught for ten years.&lt;ref name="columbiabio" /&gt; He then joined the [[University of Michigan]]&lt;ref name="columbiabio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="halbach"&gt;Edward C. Halbach, Jr., "Sanford Kadish: A Dean Retires and a Colleague Returns", 70 ''[[Cal. L. Rev.]]'' 515 (v.70, n.3, May 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961,&lt;ref name="michhist"&gt;[http://www.law.umich.edu/historyandtraditions/faculty/Faculty_Lists/Alpha_Faculty/Pages/SanfordHKadish.aspx "Sanford H. Kadish"], ''University of Michigan Law School's Law Quadrangle Notes'', v.5, n.3 (May 1961), available at the [http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/sanford-h-kadish/bio "University of Michigan Faculty History Project"] (last visited Oct. 11, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; before he joined UC Berkeley's School of Law (then "Boalt Hall School of Law") in 1964, where he stayed until his retirement in 1999.  He served as Boalt's Dean from 1975 to 1982,&lt;ref name="halbach" /&gt; and continued to serve as emeritus faculty (the Alexander F. and May T. Morrison Professor of Law (Emeritus)) even after his retirement in 1999.

During his years in academia, he worked with Wechsler on the ALI's ''Model Penal Code'', which was to prove hugely influential in reforming American criminal law.  He also published the first edition of his criminal law casebook, ''[[Criminal Law and Its Processes]]'', which became the leading criminal law casebook for decades.

== Scholarship ==
Kadish was renowned as "the preeminent criminal law scholar of his generation",&lt;ref name="schulhofer"&gt;Stephen J. Schulhofer, 79 ''Cal. L. Rev.'' 1408 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; "America's foremost scholar of the criminal law",&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Michael S. Moore, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3480776?uid=3739576&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104315994801 "Tribute: Retirement of Sanford Kadish"], 79 ''[[Cal. L. Rev.]]'' 1401 (v.79, n.6, Dec. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and "the dean of American criminal law academicians".&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dancohen" /&gt; He has been described as "the leading scholar in ... criminal law theory", who was largely responsible for shaping the field.&lt;ref name="dancohen"&gt;Meir Dan-Cohen, 1418 ''Cal. L. Rev.'' 1417 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scholarship and his work on legal reform, Kadish applied a [[sociological]] lens to criminal law and criminology. Kadish authored the leading criminal law casebook&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; (''Criminal Law and Its Processes'', first published in 1962) and the first comprehensive encyclopedia of criminal law&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; (''The Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice'', first published in 1983).

Kadish is particularly cited for a number of contributions, including:
* criticizing the criminalization of so-called "victimless crimes", which led to removal of most such crimes from the ''[[Model Penal Code]]''
* providing impetus to the [[sentencing reform movement]] with an article on criminal procedure, "Legal Norm and Discretion in the Police and Sentencing Process", 75 ''[[Harv. L. Rev.]]'' 904 (1962)&lt;ref name="schulhofer" /&gt;
* a highly cited article on [[due process]], "Methodology and Criteria in Due Process Adjudication -- A Survey and Criticism", 66 ''[[Yale L.J.]]'' 319 (1957)&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "The Most-Cited Articles from the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''", 100 ''[[Yale L.J.]]'' 1449 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;
* scholarship on excuses and exceptions in criminal law, including several articles and ultimately a formulation in his criminal law casebook that shaped the treatment of this topic in all subsequent casebooks
* studies of the codification of law, beginning with his contributions to the ''[[Model Penal Code]]''
* his influential casebook, ''[[Criminal Law and Its Processes]]'', which "took the field of criminal law class materials by storm, revolutionized the prevalent approach to teaching the first-year course, and projected a vision of the subject matter that deservedly dominated the field."&lt;ref name="schulhofer" /&gt; "With the possible exception of the American Law Institute's ''Model Penal Code'', these materials are the single most influential document in shaping the study and the teaching of criminal law in America today."&lt;ref name="dancohen" /&gt;

== Academic service and awards ==
At different times, Kadish was president of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] (AALS) and the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP),&lt;ref name="dailycalobit"&gt;Adrianna Dinolfo, [http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/10/uc-berkeley-law-professor-emeritus-sanford-kadish-dies-92/ "UC Berkeley School of Law Professor Emeritus Sanford Kadish Dies at 92"] (obituary), ''The Daily Californian'', Sept. 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice-President of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref name="choper"&gt;Jesse Choper, "Sanford H. Kadish", 79 ''Cal. L. Rev.'' 1415 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s Kadish served as an arbitrator with the [[Regional Wage Stabilization Board]] (1951–53).&lt;ref name="michhist" /&gt;

Kadish was a [[Fulbright Lecturer]] in 1957 at the [[University of Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name="michhist" /&gt; In 1974 Kadish was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/7478-sanford-h-kadish Sanford H. Kadish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017010050/http://www.gf.org/fellows/7478-sanford-h-kadish |date=2014-10-17 }}, Guggenheim Fellows database (last visited Oct. 11, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  While dean, Kadish helped institute the [[Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program]], one of the first of its kind.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; In 2003, Kadish and his wife endowed the Kadish Center for Morality, Law and Public Affairs,&lt;ref name="columbiabio" /&gt; fostering continued scholarship in the ethics and policy of criminal law, and in legal and moral reasoning generally.

== Personal life ==

Kadish was the son of Frances R. Kadish.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' Death Notices, Nov. 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Kadish co-authored some work with his brother, Mortimer Kadish, a philosopher. He was married to June Kadish (1922-2011) for 68 years,&lt;ref&gt;June Kadish, Obituary, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', April 24, 2011 (available at [http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=june-kadish&amp;pid=150467789 legacy.com]).&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had two sons, Josh and Peter Kadish.&lt;ref name="dailycalobit" /&gt;

'''Shakespeare's editors''' were essential in the development of the modern practice of producing printed books and the evolution of [[textual criticism]].

The 17th-century [[Folio (printing)|folio]] collections of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] did not have editors in the modern sense of the term. In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the [[First Folio]] ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) were gathered together or "compiled" by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play manuscripts may have been [[proofreading|proofread]] and prepared for printing by [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of [[First Folio#First Folio Technique|proofreading and correcting]] the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the [[First Folio#Compositors|compositors]] and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.

Even less is known about the creation of the [[Second Folio|Second]] ([[1632 in literature|1632]]), Third ([[1663 in literature|1663&amp;ndash;64]]), and Fourth Folios ([[1685 in literature|1685]]) than about the First; see [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].

In the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.

*[[1709 in literature|1709]], [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]; [[book size|octavo]], 6 volumes. Rowe was the first person to attempt a clean and fully comprehensible text of the plays; but he depended upon a copy of the Fourth Folio and made generally [[conjectural emendation]]s. He also added full stage directions (he was a playwright himself) and full lists of ''Dramatis personae'', and wrote the first biographical sketch of the poet. 
*[[1725 in literature|1725]], [[Alexander Pope]]; [[book size|quarto]], 6 volumes. Pope was the first to attempt a collation of the quarto texts of the plays, yet he produced what was basically a reprint of Rowe that added little of value.
*[[1733 in literature|1733]], [[Lewis Theobald]]; octavo, 7 volumes. Theobald has been called "the first Shakespeare scholar";&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; he carried forward the task of collating the quartos, and began the study of Shakespeare's sources and the order of the plays' composition. (See [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|Chronology of Shakespeare's plays]].)
*[[1744 in literature|1744]], [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Thomas Hanmer]]; quarto, 6 volumes. Hanmer relied on Theobald's text, and made guesswork corrections. His edition was reprinted in [[1770 in literature|1770]].
*[[1747 in literature|1747]], [[William Warburton]]; octavo, 8 volumes. Warburton built upon Pope's edition; indeed, Warburton placed Pope's name before his own on the title pages of his edition. In his preface, Warburton wrote that his friend Pope "was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet, as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that ''his'' Edition should be melted down into ''mine'', as it would, he said, afford him (so great is the modesty of an ingenuous temper) a fit opportunity of confessing his Mistakes." The phrase "without Talents or Judgment" refers to Theobold and Hanmer. However, Warburton did allow, rather begrudgingly, some corrections put forward by Theobold and Hanmer: "For the rest, all the Corrections which these two Editors have made on any ''reasonable'' Foundation, are here admitted into the Text; and carefully assigned to their respective Authors. A piece of Justice which the ''Oxford Editor'' never did; and which the ''Other'' was not always scrupulous in observing towards me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warburton|first1=William|title=The Works of Shakespear|date=1747|publisher=J. &amp; P. Knapton; S. Birt; T. Longman &amp; T. Shewell; and others|location=London|pages=title page, xix, &amp; xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[1748 in literature|1748]] Thomas Edwards published his ''Supplement to Warburton's Edition of Shakespeare'', in later editions called ''The Canons of Criticism'' &amp;mdash; a satirical but spot-on analysis of Warburton's editorial emendations, some of which are truly silly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Thomas|title=The Canons of Criticism, and Glossary|date=1765|publisher=C. Bathurst|location=London|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson had this to say: "Soon after Edwards's ''Canons of Criticism'' came out, Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller's, with Hayman the Painter and some more company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to put that authour upon a level with Warburton, "Nay, (said Johnson,) he has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other is a horse still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=James|editor1-last=Malone|editor1-first=Edmond|title=The Life of Samuel Johnson|date=1807|publisher=T. Cadell &amp; W. Davies|location=London|page=207, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1765 in literature|1765]], [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''; octavo, 8 volumes. Johnson in turn relied upon Warburton; his edition is noteworthy mainly for its famous Preface.
*[[1768 in literature|1768]], [[Edward Capell]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Appalled by the undisciplined emendations of Hanmer and Warburton, Capell spent three decades collecting and collating the quartos. He was also the first to exploit the [[Stationers' Register]] and [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'', and to explore Shakespeare's use of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and Sir [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]].''
*[[1773 in literature|1773]], [[George Steevens]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Steevens employed Johnson's text, but continued Capell's trend of adding new material. Steevens revised and re-issued his edition in [[1778 in literature|1778]]; in [[1780 in literature|1780]] Edmond Malone added another 2 volumes that contained Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems and other material. [[Isaac Reed]] revised the Steevens edition again in 1785, and Steevens himself produced one final, 15-volume revision in [[1793 in literature|1793]].
*[[1790 in literature|1790]], [[Edmond Malone]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Malone, often considered the best of the century's editors of Shakespeare, wrote the first general consideration of [[English Renaissance theatre]], utilizing resources like the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] and [[Edward Alleyn]]'s papers at [[Dulwich College]].  He is also noted for his work on the problem of chronology.

The early 19th century saw the first [[Variorum]] editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:

*[[1803 in literature|1803]], the First Variorum edition, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]; 21 volumes.
*[[1813 in literature|1813]], the Second Variorum, a reprint of the First; 21 volumes.
*[[1821 in literature|1821]], the Third Variorum, edited by James Boswell;&lt;ref&gt;Not the famous [[James Boswell|Boswell]], the biographer of Johnson, but rather his third son (1778&amp;ndash;1822): Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells: ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare.'' OUP 2001. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 volumes.

These massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general. In the 19th century the text, drawn primarily from Malone and Steevens, was "monumentalized"{{sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}} in the Cambridge edition (1863-6) and its single-volume companion, the Globe edition (1864). It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.{{Sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}}

As for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of ''[[The Dunciad]].'' Warburton belittled Rowe's "Account of the Life" of Shakespeare &amp;mdash; but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 30, 110, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863&amp;ndash;66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by [[William George Clark]] and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and [[William Aldis Wright]]. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.

The most radical edition in the twentieth century was the [[Oxford Shakespeare]], prepared under the general editorship of [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Gary Taylor (English literature scholar)|Gary Taylor]]. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of ''[[King Lear]]'', a text of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.

'''Silvio O. Funtowicz''' (born 1946) is a philosopher of science active in the field of [[science and technology studies]].
He created the NUSAP, notational system for characterising uncertainty and quality in quantitative expressions, and together with [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] he introduced the concept of [[post-normal science]]. He is presently professor at the University of Bergen (Norway) at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities (SVT).

== Biography ==
Silvio Funtowicz began his career teaching mathematics, logic and research methodology in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He left Argentina during the military dictatorship, and moved to England where, during the 1980s he was a Research Fellow at the University of Leeds. Until his retirement in 2011 he was a scientific officer at the [[Joint Research Centre]] of the European Commission (EC-JRC). Since February 2012 he has been Professor II at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities (SVT) at the [[University of Bergen]], Norway.

== Work ==
Silvio Funtowicz's work with Jerome R. Ravetz [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]] &lt;ref name="PNS0"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1990. [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; started a series of reflections on the quality of science used for policy, mostly in connection with environmental and technological risks and policy-related research, introducing [[NUSAP]] a notational system for the management and communication of uncertainty in science for policy. NUSAP’s applications to different settings were spearheaded in the Netherlands by Jeroen van der Sluijs et al. 2005.&lt;ref name="vdS2005"&gt;van der Sluijs, J., Craye, M., Funtowicz, S., Kloprogge, P., Ravetz, J., and Risbey, J.  (2005) Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Measures of Uncertainty in Model based Environmental Assessment: the NUSAP System, Risk Analysis, 25 (2). p. 481-492.&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on this ground work the concept of [[post-normal science]] was introduced in a series of papers published in the early nineties.&lt;ref name="PNS1"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1991. "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues", in Costanza, R. (ed.), Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability: 137–152.

Another very important and inspiring paper is 'The worth of a songbird:ecological economics as a post-normal science'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Funtowicz, S. O., &amp; Ravetz, J. R.|date=1994|title=The worth of a songbird: ecological economics as a post-normal science.|url=|journal=Ecological economics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=197–207|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90108-2|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ecological economics|Ecological Economics]].

Today [[post-normal science]] (PNS) is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values. For Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including  “eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability”.&lt;ref name="Gluckman"&gt;Gluckman, P., 2014, Policy: The art of science advice to government, Nature, 507, 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Carrozza &lt;ref name="Carrozza" /&gt; PNS can be “framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’”, and as a “reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople”.

Funtowicz’s most recent work – with Roger Strand - has touched upon the issue of agency at times of change, arguing that a risk centred vision based on prediction and control in front of global and emerging treats should be replaced by one based on commitment: “rather than believing that contemporary global challenges will be sufficiently met by being responsible under risk, we will ask how to stay committed in times of change.” &lt;ref name="Roger"&gt;Silvio Funtowicz and Roger Strand, 2011, Change and commitment: beyond risk and responsibility, Journal of Risk Research, 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Together with Ângela Guimarães Pereira he curated a volume for Oxford University Press ‘Science for Policy: New Challenges, New Opportunities’,&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Guimarães Pereira, Â. and Funtowicz, S. (eds.), 2009. Science for Policy: New Challenges, New Opportunities,  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and another with  Routledge on the End of the Cartesian Dream&lt;ref name="Cartesian"&gt;Guimarães Pereira, Â. and Funtowicz, S.

New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent an important collective effort gathering three generation of scholars active in the field of PNS, followed a year later by a multi-authors book by the same community on the reproducibility and quality control crisis of science.&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016. [[The Rightful Place of Science: Science on the Verge]]. The Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Andrea Saltelli and others he developed the concept of [[sensitivity auditing]], an extension of [[sensitivity analysis]] for statistical and mathematical models used as input to policy design and appraisal.&lt;ref name="Saud1"&gt;Saltelli A, Guimarães Pereira A, van der Sluijs JP &amp; Funtowicz S 2013, 'What do I make of your Latinorum?

He has authored with Alice Benessia a series of works on innovations and technoscience. These are critical essays on what it means for a society to be ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’.&lt;ref name="Alice1"&gt;Benessia A. and Funtowicz S.

With [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] he recently contributed two original voices to the Encyclopaedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences (Oxford) on ‘Peer Review and Quality Control’ and on ‘New Forms of Science.&lt;ref name="PRQC"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J.

In the 1990s, Silvio Funtowicz collaborated with the late [[James J. Kay]] and other members of what some have called the [http://www.postnormaltimes.net/wpblog/a-tribute-to-james-kay/ "Dirk Gently Gang"] (including [https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/Mario-giampietro-423 Mario Giampietro] and [[David Waltner-Toews]]) on the Ecosystem Approach.&lt;ref name="Dirk"&gt;David Waltner-Toews, James J.

'''Suing for peace''' is an act by a [[war]]ring nation to initiate a peace process. Suing for peace is usually initiated by the losing party in an attempt to stave off an unconditional surrender and may sometimes be favorable to the winning nation, as prosecuting a war to a complete or [[unconditional surrender]] may be costly. In this case, then, the word "sue" is being used in its original, now-obsolete meaning of "to make petition to or for", rather than the usual meaning of "to take legal action against".

Pressing for peace may sometimes, however, be started by the winning faction as a means to end the war for several reasons, such as where additional conflict would not be in the perceived best interest of the winning party. In this case, demands might be made, or the two nations may agree to a "white peace," or [[status quo ante bellum]].

==Examples==

The '''First Sino-Japanese War''' (1 August 1894&amp;nbsp;– 17 April 1895) was fought between the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] of China and the [[Empire of Japan]], primarily over influence of [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chino-Japanese War |volume=6 |pages=233–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the Chinese port of [[Weihai]]wei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.

The archives abound with attempts to halt World War I, but most attempts were unofficial and of no effect.  On 2 December 1916, prior to his coronation later that month, [[Charles I of Austria]] took over the title of Supreme Commander of the army from [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Frederick]]. In 1917, he secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary.  The negotiations of the [[Sixtus Affair]] for a sued peace failed.

'''Tommy J. Curry''' is an American author and professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].

In 2017, Curry became the first Black professor to ever be promoted to the rank of full professor in the philosophy department at Texas A&amp;M University. In 2004, Curry received his masters at DePaul University and his doctorate in philosophy from [[Southern Illinois University]] in 2009. His dissertation, Cast Upon the Shadows: Essays toward the Culturalogic Turn in Critical Race Theory, explored the political philosophy of Derrick Bell using only Black authors and theorists. His dissertation remains the only known work to have done this in the discipline of philosophy. His main research areas include [[critical race theory]], Black Male Studies, and [[Africana philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophy.tamu.edu/people/tommy-curry/|title=Tommy Curry {{!}} Professor|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various documents including a signed statement by other faculty in Texas A&amp;M University's philosophy department, Curry was hired specifically to research Critical Race Theory and revolutionary violence and armed resistance. Curry's publications and podcasts routinely give credit to radical race scholars such as Derrick Bell, Richard Delgado, and Robert Guthrie for their intellectual influence and guidance.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Over the last year, Curry's name has appeared in multiple national publications as a symbol of academic freedom garnering support and drawing attention to the risks Black professors take on in their discussion of race and racism in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/it-takes-a-nation-of-snowflakes/541050/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/threats-attacks-white-supremacists-target-campuses-170708055258069.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/05/11/furor-over-texas-am-philosophers-comments-violence-against-white-people&lt;/ref&gt;

Curry is the author of ''The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/07/tommy-curry-discusses-new-book-how-critical-theory-has-ignored-realities-black&lt;/ref&gt; In academic circles, The Man-Not is regarded as controversial for its discussion of the rape of Black males during slavery by white men and women, its depiction of white feminism as the perfection of patriarchy and American imperialism, and the text's documenting of the rape and domestic abuse Black males suffer at the hands of Black men and women in their communities. However, The Man-Not has received multiple positive reviews in Masculinity Studies, Black Studies, and Gender Studies journals.&lt;ref&gt;http://tupress.temple.edu/book/20000000009481&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the Before Columbus Foundation announced that The Man-Not would be awarded a 2018 American Book Award for its original contribution to American literature and thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ABA-press-release-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Curry's book argues for the creation of a new field of study looking at the experiences and historical development of racialized men and boys the world over. In 2018, Temple University Press made Curry editor of the Black Male Studies series which Curry has claimed is the first book series specifically dedicated to the study of Black men and boys and racialized males to ever be supported on a University Press.&lt;ref&gt;http://tupress.temple.edu/series/S-199&lt;/ref&gt; Curry's research emphasizes the rape of Black men and boys during slavery and Jim Crow by white men and women and argues that under racist patriarchal regimes racialized males are sexually vulnerable to rape, genital mutilation, and dismemberment. Unlike current theories of Black masculinity that utilize intersectional theory to discuss Black men as a privileged disadvantaged group, Curry argues that racialized males are sexually vulnerable to dominant group men and women in racist societies because they are Man-Nots. Curry utilizes Social Dominance Theory and Global South Masculinities research to create a paradigm of outgroup-alien male fungibility that examines the historical treatment and violence racialized men and boys endure throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Tommy J. Curry, “Killing Boogeymen: Phallicism and the Misandric Mischaracterization of Black Males in Theory,” Res Philosophica 95.2 (2018):235-272. &lt;/ref&gt; His work also documents the rape of Jewish men and boys in the Holocaust German SS and Kapos as evidence of this sexual dynamic towards racialized males throughout history. &lt;ref&gt;https://sfi.usc.edu/profiles/tommy-curry&lt;/ref&gt;. Curry's research on the sexual vulnerability and disposibility of racialized men and boys has been recognized by multiple awards over the last several years. In 2017, Curry was awarded the Alain Locke Award by the Society of American Philosophy for his public intellectual research and commentaries on anti-Black racism, the death and dying of Black males, and the rape of Black men and boys in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;https://philosophy.tamu.edu/dr-tommy-curry-receives-the-alain-locke-award-for-public-philosophy/&lt;/ref&gt; His publications and national profile earned him recognition as one of the Top 15 Emerging Scholars of Color in the United States by Diverse Magazine in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://diverseeducation.com/article/108851/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}

The '''Wheel of time''' or '''wheel of history''' (also known as ''[[Kalachakra]]'') is a concept found in several religious traditions and philosophies, notably religions of Indian origin such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Buddhism]], which regard time as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]] and consisting of repeating ages.  Many other cultures contain belief in a similar concept: notably, the Q'ero Indians in [[Peru]], as well as the Hopi Indians of Arizona.

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Kalachakra}}
The [[Kalachakra|Wheel of Time]] or Kalachakra is a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity that is associated with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Tantric Buddhism]], which encompasses all four main schools of [[Sakya]], [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]], and is especially important within the lesser-known [[Jonang]] tradition.

The Kalachakra tantra prophesies a world within which (religious) conflict is prevalent. A worldwide war will be waged which will see the expansion of the mystical Kingdom of [[Shambhala]] led by a messianic king.

==Ancient Rome==
The philosopher and emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] saw time as extending forwards to infinity and backwards to infinity, while admitting the possibility (without arguing the case) that "the administration of the universe is organized into a succession of finite periods".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations'', book 5, paragraph 13. {{ISBN|978-0-19-957320-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

===Literature===
In an interview included with the [[audiobook]] editions of his novels, author [[Robert Jordan]] has stated that his bestselling fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' borrows the titular concept from Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Jordan chats about his 'Wheel of Time' series|url=http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/12/12/jordan/|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Several episodes of the American TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' feature a wheel which can be physically turned in order to manipulate space and time. In a series of episodes during the fifth season, the island on which the show takes place begins to skip violently back and forth through time after the wheel is pulled off its axis.

{{Japanese name|Abe}}
{{nihongo|'''Yoshishige Abe'''|安倍 能成|Abe Yoshishige|extra=23 December 1883 &amp;ndash; 7 June 1966}} was a philosopher, educator, and statesman in [[Shōwa period]] [[Japan]]. As Minister of Education in the immediate post-war era, he oversaw major reforms to the Japanese educational system.

==Biography==
Abe was born in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]], [[Ehime Prefecture]] as the son of a doctor of [[Chinese medicine]]. He graduated from [[Tokyo Imperial University]], and was a close associate of [[Natsume Sōseki]], [[Seiichi Hatano]], [[Kyoshi Takahama]] and [[Shigeo Iwanami]], although he was forced to return home to teach [[English language|English]] in Matsuyama due to reduced family circumstances. He later married the sister of [[Misao Fujimura]]. While still a student, he began writing [[literary criticism]] and was interested in the development of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]].

From 1920, Abe worked as a professor at [[Hosei University]]; however, he toured Europe extensively and spent some time at [[Heidelberg University]] in 1924 where he studied [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian philosophy]]. In 1926 he accepted a position at [[Keijō Imperial University]] in [[Seoul]] [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], where he became interested in [[Korean culture]] and [[Korean literature]]. He travelled to China in 1929, visiting [[Jinan]], [[Qufu]] and climbed [[Mount Tai]], and noted the strong Japanese commercial presence throughout [[Shandong Province]]. He also visited [[Manchuria]] and noted the increasing Chinese presence in [[Harbin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fogel | first =  Joshua | coauthors = | year = 1996 | title = The Literature of travel in the Japanese Rediscovery of China 1862-1945 | publisher =  Stanford University Press | location = | isbn = 0804725675}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Abe returned to mainland Japan in 1940, returning to his alma mater, the Daiichi High School in Tokyo. However, Abe soon ran afoul of the military authorities with his outspoken criticism of the military’s plans to cut short school curriculums to increase the numbers of conscripts, and of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]]’s efforts to create a single-party state. Although occasionally harassed by the [[Kempeitai]], he was not arrested.

After the [[surrender of Japan|end of World War II]], Abe was appointed to a seat in the [[House of Peers (Japan)|Upper House]] of the [[Diet of Japan]] in December 1945, and from January through March 1946 served as  [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Minister of Education]] in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Kijūrō Shidehara]], where he oversaw the post-war reform of the Japanese educational system. He helped draft the [[Fundamental Law of Education]], and the current [[Tōyō kanji]] and [[Modern kana usage]] guidelines. As Education Minister, he also stated that he felt it was fortunate that Japan had been occupied by America instead of the [[Soviet Union]]. From October 1946, he was principal of the [[Gakushuin]] Peers’ School – a post he held until his death in 1966.

Abe was a strong supporter of the anti-war movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but maintained a critical stance against post-war [[socialism]], which he viewed as dangerous as pre-war [[militarism]].

Abe was awarded the [[Yomiuri Literary Prize]] in 1958 for his biography of Shigeo Iwanami. In 1964, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]].
 
Abe died in Tokyo in 1966, but his grave is at the temple of [[Tōkei-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

'''Samyeongdang''' (1544–1610), also known by his [[dharma name]] '''Yujeong''', was a [[bhikkhu|Korean Buddhist monk]] during the [[Joseon]] era. He is sometimes identified by his pen name, '''Song-un.'''  He was born to a family of the [[Im (Korean surname)|Im]] clan in [[Miryang]], [[Gyeongsang Province]]. After the deaths of his mother in 1558 and his father in 1559, he became a monk at [[Jikjisa]] on [[Hwangaksan]] in [[Gimcheon]].

==Life==
In 1561, he passed the ''seon-gwa'', the specialized [[gwageo]] (civil service examinations) for [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]]. He corresponded with various scholars of the time including [[Pak Saam]], [[Heo Hagok]], and [[Im Baekho]].  In 1575, he was recommended as head of the [[Korean Seon|Seon order]], but refused and instead traveled to [[Myohyangsan]]. There he was instructed by preceptor [[Hyujeong]].  He went on to pass three years at [[Bodeoksa]] on [[Mount Kumgang]], and later traveled through [[Palgongsan]], [[Cheongnyangsan]], and [[Taebaeksan]].

With the start of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] in 1592, Yujeong joined his teacher Hyujeong's [[righteous army]] of monks. After Hyujeong retired due to his age, Yujeong took over the leadership of the army. He led the army into battles at [[Pyongyang]] and [[Uiryeong County]] in 1592, set up mountain fortresses through Gyeongsang in 1594, and joined in battle again at [[Ulsan]] and [[Suncheon]].

In 1604, after the end of the war, he traveled to Japan on [[Seonjo of Joseon]]'s orders to forge a peace accord with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and returned with 3500 Koreans who had been taken prisoner. Yujeong's diplomatic missions established a resilient foundation for a series of major Joseon missions to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b17a1705a "Yu Jeong", ''Encyclopædia Britannica Korean Edition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in 1610 on [[Haeinsa]], Yujeong was enshrined in the [[Pyochung Seowon]] in [[Miryang]] and at [[Suchungsa]] in [[Nyongbyon County|Nyongbyon]].  He continues to be remembered in modern times, with numerous statues and other memorials around Korea. He has been cited together with [[Hyujeong]] as an example of a "patriotic-minded" Buddhist by the North Korean Buddhist Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcckp.net/en/event/2005-06-15/article.php?9|title=For the Building of an Elysium|work=KCCKP.net|year=2005|accessdate=2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yujeong's writings are preserved in the ''Samyeongjip'' ({{korean|hangul=사명대사집|hanja=四溟大師集}}) and ''Bunchungseo Nallok'' ({{korean|hangul=분충서난록|hanja=奮忠紓難錄}}).
