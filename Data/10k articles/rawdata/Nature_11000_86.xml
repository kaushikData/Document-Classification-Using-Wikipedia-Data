      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30515">An '''ADR rose''' is a winner in the German ADR [[rose trial grounds|rose trial]] (''Allgemeine Deutsche Rosenneuheitenprüfung''). No chemical pesticides have been allowed since 1997 and breeders often describe the trial as among the most challenging in the world.&lt;ref name="Pellett167"&gt;Pellett 2010, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The trial is set up by a working group that includes the Bund deutscher Baumschulen (German nurseries association), rose breeders, and eleven independent trial stations in Germany. The trial results are analyzed by the Bundessortenamt (Federal Office of Plant Varieties).

[[Roses]] are tested over three years and criteria analyzed include disease resistance, hardiness, attractiveness, and habit. About 50 [[cultivar]]s are judged annually and more than 2000 cultivars have been tested since the award's creation in the 1950s. Roses that no longer fulfill quality standards have their certificate removed. As of November 2013, 161 cultivars are recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8568">'''Animated mapping''' is the application of [[animation]], either computer or video, to add a temporal component to a [[map]] displaying change in some dimension.  Most commonly the change is shown over [[time]], generally at a greatly changed scale (either much faster than real time or much slower).  An example would be the animation produced after the 2004 tsunami showing how the waves spread across the Indian Ocean.

The concept of animated maps began in the 1930s, but did not become more developed by cartographers until the 1950s (Slocum et al. 2005).  In 1959, Norman Thrower published ''Animated Cartography'', discussing the use of animated maps in adding a new dimension that was difficult to express in static maps: time.  These early maps were created by drawing "snap-shots" of static maps, putting a series of maps together to form a scene and creating animation through photography tricks (Thrower 1959).  Such early maps rarely had an associated scale, legends or oriented themselves to lines of longitude or latitude (Campbell and Egbert 1990).

With the development of computers in the 1960s and 1970s, animation programs were developed allowing the growth of animation in mapping.  [[Waldo Tobler]] created one of the first animations, using a 3-D computer generated map to portray population growth over a specified time in Detroit (Tobler 1970).  Hal Moellering created another animated map in 1976 representing a spatiotemporal pattern in traffic accidents (Slocum et al. 2005).

Further development in animated map was stalled until the 1990s due to a lack of animation in academics, financial restrictions on research, and lack of distribution means (Campbell and Egbert 1990).  In the 1990s, however, the invention of faster, more efficient computers, compact discs and the Internet solved such problems.

==Visual variables==
With the growth of animated mapping came the development of guidelines for creating animated maps.  Visual variables such as spacing, lightness and shape used for static maps apply.  However, in 1991, David DiBiase and colleagues developed visual variables unique to animated maps: duration, rate of change and order.  Duration is the unit of time a frame or scene is displayed, affecting the smoothness of the animation.  The shorter a frame is displayed, the smoother the animation will appear (Slocum et al. 2005).  Smoothness of animation is also a function of the rate of change (Slocum et al. 2005).  Order refers to the time sequence in which animation is played out, usually presented in chronological sequence (Slocum et al. 2005).  [[Alan MacEachren]] extended these visual variables in 1995 to include display date (time at which change is initiated), frequency (number of times identifiable forms are displayed) and synchronization (correspondence of 2 or more time series) (Slocum et al. 2005).

==Types of animated maps==
Animated maps can emphasize the existence of an occurrence at a location, emphasize an attribute of an occurrence or representing change in the position or attributes of an occurrence (DiBiase 1992).  For instance, a flashing symbol may be used to draw the map-reader’s attention to a particular occurrence at one location or multiple location across the map.  Maps on the weather channel use animation to emphasize current and predicted paths of hurricanes.

The use of the Internet has allowed animated maps to become interactive.  The user can witness representations of changes over time, while manipulating the direction of view, the pace or the parameters of the map displayed (MacEachren 1998).

Animation on Maps can be mainly divided into two types:

'''Temporal Animation:'''  Temporal shows the ongoing gradual changes over time.  Temporal maps can also be termed as animated timeline maps and can be a useful reference to examine the changes ongoing on each step and analyze the progression occurring gradually as time passes.

There are many purposes which temporal animation might serve to depict: displaying and analyzing geographic patterns, meteorological events, climate, natural disasters, and other multivariate data.

''Importance of Legend in Temporal Maps:''
As in the case of static maps, it would be useful if temporal maps could also be provided with proper legend. Legends for temporal maps should not only tell the time but also let user travel over the time. Various manipulations such as traveling to a certain point in time, selecting focus level etc. should be allowed to enhance user friendliness.

Using legend in temporal map will answer important questions related to the entity’s existence (if?), the entity’s location (when?), time intervals (how long?), temporal texture (how often), speed at which change takes place (how fast?), and the order of change (what order?) (MacEachren, 1995).

Depending upon their construction, animated legends may distract the viewer from the animated map.  Care must be taken to integrate the legend in an unobtrusive fashion.

'''Non-Temporal Animation:''' Non-Temporal Animation shows changes against some other variables other than time. The variable might be place, position, generalization level etc.  Non –temporal animation also serves when there is a need to show both the data set and the transformation that has been applied on it for its display.

Non- temporal animation can be of many types according to the purpose they serve:

1)	Fly through animation:  
This type of animation gives the viewer the feeling of flying through the landscape.

2)	 Cartographic zoom animation: 
This type of animation shows maps at different focus level and viewer can change the scale of the map as desired.

3)	Classification animation:  
Different methods of data classification are depicted in this animation.

4)	Generalization animation: 
This type of animation uses single classification method with multiple classes of data.

Time is an important aspect in both animations. Real time is depicted in temporal animation and presentation time (time to show the animation) is associated with non-temporal animation.

An '''annual cycle''' refers to a set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.

In [[biology]], the annual cycle for plants and animals details behavioral and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, John M. and Houston, Alasdair I. (2008) "Introduction: Adaptation to the annual cycle" ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 363(1490):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a [[business cycle]] refers to the way modelling and analysis is applied to the periodic development and marketing of new products and services.

In [[religion]], the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, in [[Christianity]] the [[liturgical year]] is an annual cycle, which for some [[Christian denomination]]s is composed of the ''temporal cycle'' that tracks the events in the life of [[Christ]], and the ''sanctoral cycle'' which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the ''temporal cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;Flesher, Paul [http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm "Christian Time and Worship"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309191604/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }} ''Exploring Religions'' University of Wyoming&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in [[orbit]] over the course of the year.  Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming [[solar radiation]] at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[westerlies]] and [[polar easterlies|easterlies]] over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.

Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an [[anomaly time series]].

'''Anthroposols''' are soils which have been profoundly modified or constructed by humans. They typically have one or more of their natural soil [[Soil horizon|horizons]] modified, removed or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anne Naeth|first=M.|last2=Archibald|first2=Heather A.|last3=Nemirsky|first3=Candace L.|last4=Leskiw|first4=Leonard A.|last5=Anthony Brierley|first5=J.|last6=Bock|first6=Michael D.|last7=VandenBygaart|first7=A. J.|last8=Chanasyk|first8=David S.|date=2012-01-01|title=Proposed classification for human modified soils in Canada: Anthroposolic order|journal=Canadian Journal of Soil Science|volume=92|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.4141/cjss2011-028|issn=0008-4271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word anthroposol is derived from the Greek words ''anthropos'', meaning man and ''genes'' meaning caused. Anthroposols are typically found on industrial, commercial, urban and resources extraction sites as well as throughout transportation, fuel and power corridors. 

== Classification of Anthroposols ==
[[Soil classification]] systems are used globally to systematically categorize soils based on diagnostic features or characteristics. Human-formed soils have historically been excluded from soil classification systems due in part to the fact that the criteria used for naturally-formed soils are often not applicable. However, many countries are recognizing their pervasiveness and the need for some type of common language and taxonomy. As of 2016, fifteen countries had added (or proposed adding) [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils to their soil classification systems including Brazil, Germany, Canada, Poland and China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capra|first=Gian Franco|last2=Ganga|first2=Antonio|last3=Grilli|first3=Eleonora|last4=Vacca|first4=Sergio|last5=Buondonno|first5=Andrea|date=2015-07-01|title=A review on anthropogenic soils from a worldwide perspective|journal=Journal of Soils and Sediments|language=en|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1602–1618|doi=10.1007/s11368-015-1110-x|issn=1439-0108}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

They are known by many terms including: ''[[Plaggen soil|Plaggen soils]], Paddy soils, Oasis soils, Terra Preta do Indio'' (Brazil), ''Agrozems'' (Russia), ''Terrestriche anthropogene Böden'' (Germany), ''Anthroposols'' (Australia and Canada) and ''[[Anthrosol|Anthrosols]]'' (China)&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2006). ''World reference base for soil resources 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== World Reference Base for Soil Resources ===
[[World Reference Base for Soil Resources|The World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB) offers some guidelines for classification. This system is based on a large scale and is not meant to replace national or local systems but rather to facilitate communication between them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=David G.|date=2007-06-01|title=Classification of Urban and Industrial Soils in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (5 pp)|journal=Journal of Soils and Sediments|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=96–100|doi=10.1065/jss2007.02.208|issn=1439-0108}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [http://www.fao.org/3/a-a0510e.pdf FAO World Soil Resources Report 2006] offers full details. It outlines two larger anthropogenic sub-categories based on the degree of disturbance as well as the pervasiveness of the artifacts within: 

* [[Anthrosol]]: soils under agricultural cultivation for long periods
* [[Technosol]]: soils containing products and artifacts of industrial processes (often toxic). These could include constructed soils used for closure of landfills and mines and soils under pavement.  

=== National Soil Classification Systems ===
Each country varies slightly in their diagnostic features and taxonomic structure for soil classification systems as local needs and [[Pedogenesis|soil-forming processes]] are highly variable.  

==== France ====
First implemented in 1995, three sub groups are included: 

* Transformés: changed by agriculture
* Reconstitutes: for use in agriculture
* Artificiels: urban soils

==== Azerbaijan ====
There are two broader categories within the framework of anthropogenically modified and technogenically disturbed: 

* Urbanzems: open and unsealed by paving structures
* Ekranozems: sealed with paving

==== United Kingdom ====
Artificial ground is the term used for anthropogenic soils and is given four classes: 

* Made: artificial soils have been placed on top of an existing naturally-formed soil surface
* Worked: naturally-formed soils have been removed
* Infilled: naturally-formed soils have been removed and artificial soil has been added
* Landscaped: extensive remodeling such that one cannot readily distinguish between the areas where the above methods are used

==== Canada ====
As outlined by Naeth et al. (2012) "Anthroposols are azonal soils, highly modified or constructed by human activity, with one or more natural horizons removed, removed and replaced, added to, or significantly modified."  The defining features of Anthroposols are:

*[[File:Anthroposol under lawn.jpg|thumb|Anthroposol under an urban lawn]][[Soil horizon|horizons]] have been removed, replaced, added to or severely modified by humans
* manufactured items (artifacts) are present

A depth of anthropogenic disturbance (of either modification or addition) must be of at least 10 cm above or below the soil surface for a soil to be categorized as an Anthroposol. Minimal disturbance would likely still allow the natural soil formation process to be identified.  

Tilled soils are not included in the proposed Anthroposolic order within the [[Canadian system of soil classification|Canadian System of Soil Classification]] and this disturbance is covered by use of suffix p to indicate a plowed horizon within other soil orders. Anthroposols; however, can occur on agricultural soils when substantial disturbance goes beyond typical tillage (e.g., land levelling that alters natural soil profiles through excavation and burial, pipeline or well construction).  

Since Anthroposolic soils are commonly developed by human activity with anthropogenic materials, this precludes these soils from classification in the existing classification categories. The first problem is identification of the order for the modified or reconstructed soil, since the existing classification system is applicable only for soils that have been forming under natural conditions. The second problem is determining the most likely trajectory soil development would take.  

Proposed categorization within the [[Canadian system of soil classification|Canadian System of Soil Classification]].   

===== Order: =====

Anthroposol - "soil that has been visibly disturbed by human activity and that have a D horizon [equal to or greater than] 10 cm thick or have had natural soil horizons removed."&lt;ref&gt;Pennock, D.J., K. Watson, and P. Sanborn. 2016. Section 5: Taxonomic Key for Canadian Soils. ''Field Handbook for the Soils of Western Canada''. Canadian Society of Soil Science. &lt;/ref&gt;

===== Great Group: =====


* Technic: a D layer with more than 10% physical artifacts present. If less, move to next two groups
* Spolic: D layer with less than 17% [[organic carbon]]
* Carbic: D layer with more than 17% organic carbon

===== Subgroups: =====


* Egeo: (latin: ''to be without'') surface layer is less than 10 cm thick
* Albo (latin: ''white''): surface layer more than 10 cm thick with less than 2% carbon
* Fusco (latin: ''to make dark''): surface layer more than 10 cm thick and has 2-17% organic carbon
* Carbo (latin: ''carbon''): has a layer equal to or greater than 10 cm thick with more than 17% organic carbon (but not deep enough to be within the Carbic Great Group)
* Techno (latin: ''technical or artificial''): a layer with more than 10% physical artifacts with a minimum thickness of 10cm (but not deep enough to be within the Technic Great Group)
* Spolo (latin: ''to strip''): a layer with more than 17% organic carbon and a minimum depth of 10cm (but not deep enough to be within the Spolic Great Group)
* Terro (latin: ''earth):'' shallow disturbances with at least 10cm of original [[parent material]] present.
* Aquo (latin: ''water''): poor drainage (mottles and [[Gleysol|gleying]] not needed) evident by [[Water content|saturated]] soils, a high water table or [[Aquatic plant|water-adapted vegetation]]
* Cryo (greek: ''kruos - icy cold''): [[permafrost]] present

Suffixes are used to highlight features of the particular soil. New ones are being created for the anthroposol order, a few examples are: 

* q - [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] present
* w - human-created artifacts present ie. waste
* o - more than 17% [[organic carbon]] present&lt;ref&gt;Pennock, D.J., K. Watson, and P. Sandborn. 2015. Section 4: Horizon Identification. ''Field Handbook for the Soils of Western Canada.'' Canadian Society of Soil Science. &lt;/ref&gt;

Field testing is currently being done on the new Anthroposol classification system for the Canadian soil classification system.

'''Abraham "Bram" van Ojik''' (born 22 September 1954) is [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician and diplomat of the [[GroenLinks]] (GL) party. Since 23 March 2017 he is a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. He previously served in the House from 1993 to 1994, and from 2012 to 2015. In the latter three years he also served as leader of GroenLinks. He is an [[Foreign relations of the Netherlands|Envoy of the Netherlands]] for [[human migration]] since 20 October 2015.

==Political career==

===Political Party of Radicals===
Van Ojik comes from the [[Political Party of Radicals]], one of the four parties that merged to form GroenLinks in 1989. Van Ojik had been member of the PPR since 1973. Between 1972 and 1980 Van Ojik studied [[economics]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Free University]]. He specialized in [[development cooperation|development economics]]. Between 1978 and 1981, he served on the board for radical education. As a [[conscientious objector]], Van Ojik did his [[alternative service]] at the development organization NIO. After that he worked for the [[scientific bureau]] of the PPR until 1983. Here he wrote a book on [[basic income]]. In 1986 he co-authored the PPR's [[election program]]. Between 1985 and 1988, he was editor-in-chief of the PPR party paper. Between 1988 and 1990 he was [[party chair]] of the PPR. As chair of the PPR, he was involved in the negotiations over the formation of GroenLinks, a new political party formed by the merger of the [[Pacifist Socialist Party]], [[Communist Party of Netherlands]], and [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical People's Party]]. Van Ojik had always favoured cooperation between the four parties, but the PPR party board soon wanted to abandon negotiations. Van Ojik had to defend this, although he did not support it. The formal PPR delegation was replaced by an informal delegation by former party chair [[Wim de Boer]]. In 1989 the talks led to the formation of a new party. Van Ojik became a member of the first party board. In addition to these activities, Van Ojik freelance journalist and advisor on the subject of development cooperation. Between 1990 and 1993 Van Ojik worked for [[Oxfam NOVIB]].

===GroenLinks===
Between 1993 and 1994, Van Ojik was member of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] for [[GroenLinks]]. He replaced PPR member [[Ria Beckers]]. He spoke on [[LNV|agriculture]], development cooperation and science. He prepared an initiative to limit the use of wood from the tropics. It was finally proposed in 1994 by [[Marijke Vos]]. At the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]] Van Ojik was put on the seventh place of the GroenLinks list, the same place he had in 1989. GroenLinks only won five seats. He also co-authored the GroenLinks election program.

In 1997 Van Ojik again co-authored GroenLinks election program for the [[Dutch general election, 1998|1998 election]].

For GroenLinks, Van Ojik chaired a committee which evaluated the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2006|municipal elections]] (2006), [[Dutch general election, 2006|parliamentary]] (2006) and [[Dutch provincial elections, 2007|provincial]] (2007), all of which GroenLinks had lost. Then he became chair of the committee which oversaw a debate within GroenLinks on the party's principles, strategy and organizations. This led to a new manifesto of principles in 2008 of which Van Ojik is one of the co-authors.

After national elections on 12 September 2012 the size of the representation of the GroenLinks party within the House of Representatives was reduced from 10 seats to 4 seats. On 8 October 2012 Van Ojik became leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks; some days earlier his predecessor [[Jolande Sap]] was forced to step down as leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks by the board of the GroenLinks party.

===Further career===
After not being re-elected for the Dutch [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], Van Ojik worked for the environmental organization [[Milieudefensie|MilieuDefensie]] between 1994 and 1997. In 1995 he co-authored a book on [[coral]]s together with [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]] politician [[Max van den Berg]]. In 1997 Van Ojik switched to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], where he became director of public communication on development cooperation. In 1998 he again co-authored a book with Van der Berg, now on development cooperation. In 2001 Van Ojik became [[ambassador]] in general service. He organized external contacts for the Dutch [[Minister for Development Cooperation]]. In 2003 Van Ojik became the Dutch ambassador to [[Benin]].&lt;ref name="Group2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Group|first=Taylor &amp; Francis|title=Europa World Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA783|accessdate=29 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-85743-254-1|pages=783–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he returned to the Netherlands to become director of the inspection for evaluation of development cooperation policy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also helped the government prepare policy to meet the [[millennium goals]] for the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]].

On 12 May 2015 his resignation as [[Leader of GroenLinks]]  and as member of parliament was announced. [[Jesse Klaver]] took over his role as leader of the party, while [[Rik Grashoff]] took up Van Ojik's seat in parliament on 20 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groenlinks.nl/nieuws/afscheidsbrief-bram-van-ojik Letter Van Ojik to members of the party] published on the website of the party, retrieved 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/2035249-van-ojik-weg-als-fractieleider-groenlinks-klaver-volgt-op.html Van Ojik weg als Franctieleider Groenlinks, Klaver volgt op] NOS, 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2036548-tweede-kamer-neemt-afscheid-van-van-ojik.html |title=Tweede Kamer neemt afscheid van Van Ojik |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bugyals''' are alpine [[grassland|pasture lands]], or [[meadow]]s, in higher elevation range between {{Convert|3300|m}} and {{Convert|4000|m}} of the Himalayas in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]], where they are called "nature’s own gardens".{{Sfn|Tmh|p=93}} The topography of the terrain is either flat or sloped. The surface of these bugyals is covered with natural green grass and seasonal flowers. They are used by tribal herdsmen to graze their cattle. During the winter season the alpine meadows remain snow-covered. During summer months, the Bugyals present a riot of beautiful flowers and grass.  As bugyals constitute very fragile ecosystems, particular attention needs to be given for their conservation.{{Sfn|Tmh|p=93}}

Some of the notable bugyals are: [[Auli]] near [[Joshimath]], [[Garsi]], [[Kwanri]], [[Bedni Bugyal|Bedni]], [[Panwali and Kush Kalyan]], [[Dayara]] and [[Munsiyari]].&lt;ref name="Tmh"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tmh|title=General Knowledge Digest 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyLmXWTKHXgC&amp;pg=SA1-PA93|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-069939-7|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On either side of the bugyal there are coniferous, [[oak]] and [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] forests which limits the wind velocity to acceptable {{Convert|16|km}} for skiing.{{Sfn|Goyal|2014|p=151}} It is in the backdrop of [[Nanda Devi]] ({{Convert|7817|m}}), [[Kamet]] ({{Convert|7756|m}}), [[Mana Peak]] ({{Convert|7273|m}}), [[Dunagiri (mountain)|Dunagiri]] ({{Convert|7066|m}}), [[Hathi Parbat]] ({{Convert|6727|m}}), Bethantoli ({{Convert|6353|m}}) and [[Ghora Parbat]] peaks of the [[Himalayas]].

During the winter months (January to March) the slopes are covered with a mantle of snow which is spread over a width of {{Convert|3|km}},{{Sfn|Pandey|Pandey|2003|p=242}} and has a thickness {{Convert|8|-|10|ft}}.{{Sfn|Thapliyal|2005|p=215}} It is a skiing resort with modern skiing equipment.{{Sfn|Nigam|2002|p=139}} It is the venue of skiing festivities and the annual national championship of skiing held during February and March. It is {{Convert|13|km}} away from [[Joshimath]]. A {{Convert|500|m}} ski-lift system exists here which is believed to be the longest cable car ({{Convert|3.9|km}}) from Joshimath to the top most station at Gorson. It is the only location where artificial snow making system is provided to ensure that snow is present on the slopes for skiing. There are also two snow beaters which are used to make the snow slopes  fit for skiing.{{Sfn|Goyal|2014|p=151}}  As it is a winter sports centre and Vayudoot two airports have been planned in the region.&lt;ref name=Airport/&gt; R.

Vernede, the British Deputy High Commissioner of the district during the British Raj had built a hut known as “Vernede” here at an elevation of {{Convert|11000|ft}}.{{Sfn|Prasad|2009|p=62}} It is under the control of the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Limited, which also provides for all skiing gear at site.{{Sfn|Pandey|Pandey|2003|p=242}}

Auli Bugyal is a very large alpine meadow which has expanse of grass land that covers several hundred acres of land, towards the sides of a wide ridge; Bedni Bugyal lies beyond this ridge. The meadows have vegetation of [[anemones]], ''[[Potentilla]]'', [[Pedicularis|lousewort]], [[Salvia roborowskii|wild ''Salvia'']] and [[thistles]]. Grazing by cattle and sheep is extensive. There are many trails that pass through the meadows.{{Sfn|Alter|2015|p=110}}

This budyal also has a small lake called Bedini Kund.{{Sfn|Weare|2009|p=173}}{{Sfn|Singhal|2013|p=173}} It is an artificial lake built with a concrete [[Levee|dyke]] by reclaiming a marshy wetland. There are two shrines here, one a small temple of Nanda Devi and the other a shrine for Latu. The temple is built with stones without using any mortar but moss growth is seen in the crevices. The Nanda Devi temple has two small carved stone images of the goddess and a pure white conch shell.{{Sfn|Alter|2015|p=111}} Bedni and Rup Kund are approached from [[Karnaprayag]].{{Sfn|Goyal|2014|p=111}} Medicinal herbs are found here.{{Sfn|Singh|2004|p=196}}

==Conservation issues==
Bugyal is a fragile [[ecosystem]] and it is essential to maintain a balance between [[ecology]] and [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. In this context a court case was filed by the public objecting to erection of the prefab houses and by introducing non-biodegradable matter in the upper meadows of the bugyals by the tourism departments. It was averred that the peace and tranquility of the bugyals was getting affected. The court had ordered that the polluter must pay for the damage to environment based on [[Absolute liability|absolute liability principle]], which covered payment of damages to the affected people but also to compensate for all costs for restoration of the degraded environments.{{Sfn|Bhatt|2004|p=51}}

The '''Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance''' (CNCA or “Alliance”) is a collaboration of leading global cities working to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% or more by 2050 or sooner (“80x50”) — the most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets undertaken by any cities across the globe. The Alliance aims to address what it will take for leading international cities to achieve these deep emissions reductions and how they can work together to meet their respective goals more efficiently and effectively.

== Background ==
The Alliance was born in Copenhagen in June 2014 at an organizing meeting of the following 17 cities:
* [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]]
* [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder CO, USA]]
* [[Boston|Boston MA, USA]]
* [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]]
* [[London|London, United Kingdom]]
* [[Melbourne, Australia]]
* [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis MN, USA]]
* [[New York City|New York City NY, USA]]
* [[Oslo|Oslo, Norway]]
* [[Portland, Oregon|Portland OR, USA]]
* [[San Francisco|San Francisco CA, USA]]
* [[Seattle|Seattle WA, USA]]
* [[Stockholm|Stockholm, Sweden]]
* [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]]
* [[Vancouver|Vancouver BC, Canada]]
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC, USA]]
* [[Yokohama|Yokohama, Japan]]
Founding cities came together to share lessons in planning for and implementing deep carbon reductions and agreed upon opportunities to accelerate best practices through collaboration in the Alliance’s first year, including:
* ''Developing Carbon Neutrality Planning Standards'' – Developing approaches, analysis, and tools to support carbon neutrality; standardizing measurement and verification methodologies for tracking progress.
* ''Advancing “Transformative Change” in Key Urban Sectors'' – Sharing and implementing best practices for achieving “transformative” deep carbon reduction strategies in urban transportation, energy use, and waste systems.
* ''Advocating for Policy Change'' – Identifying and advocating for policies at the state, regional, and federal levels to reduce emission sources not controlled directly by cities and engaging with other external stakeholders who are critical to cities’ success.
* ''Speaking with a Common Voice'' – Helping CNCA cities demonstrate their leadership and communicate with a common voice.
* ''Creating a CNCA “Innovation Fund”'' – Investing in high-potential, city-led projects that develop, test, implement, and amplify deep de-carbonization strategies and practices (currently funded at $500,000).
* ''Increasing Alliance Impact'' – Sharing Alliance learnings with a broader audience to benefit the “next wave” of cities striving for carbon neutrality.

== Staff, Partners and Funders ==

'''Critterding''' is an artificial life simulator created by Bob Winckelmans and released as open source under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

== Simulation ==
Critterding is a 3D/Physics based simulator, in which critters try to survive by developing a form of locomotion, find food and reproduce. Critters are made up of two types of body parts which are linked together by joints. The head, coloured red, is where the vision and mouth is located. The body segments are used for locomotion and display the colour of the critter. On an initial run, random seed critters are generated in a food rich environment, eventually a seed critter is generated that is able to eat and reproduce before dying. The new offspring have a chance to receive a mutation to either the body or neural network, some of which will be detrimental, causing the critter to fail and die while other mutations will be beneficial allowing it and its offspring to flourish over their siblings. Once the critter population reaches a preset maximum, the population is halved and the available food in the system is slightly reduced.

== Vision ==
Critters see with a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid is able to see red, green, blue and alpha channels.

== Environment ==
Critterding supports 2 main environment types. A tray/petri dish style flatworld with walls to keep critters from falling into the void and the roundworld environment where critters and food are held on with planet like gravity. Beta 14 introduces .obj loading for fully customisable terrain, critter and food skins, skydome and dynamic lighting.

'''Delta Waterfowl Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization]] operating in both [[Canada]] and in the [[United States]] whose mission is to provide knowledge, leaders and science-based solutions that efficiently conserve [[anatidae|waterfowl]] and secure the future for waterfowl hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltawaterfowl.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do|publisher=www.deltawaterfowl.org|date= |accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Image:Barringer-Arial.jpg|thumb|[[Barringer Slough]] in [[Geology of Iowa|Iowa]], a remnant of the extensive prairie wetlands that once covered the region.]]

In the 1930s [[James Ford Bell]], sportsman and founder of [[General Mills]], purchased 5,000 acres (20 km²) of the [[Delta Marsh]] in Manitoba, Canada.  For several years Bell hunted waterfowl on the marsh in the fall and raised and released waterfowl in the spring and summer from a privately owned [[hatchery]].

In 1938, Bell approached [[Aldo Leopold]], who is considered to be the father of wildlife management in the United States, about establishing a research station dedicated to waterfowl research at the Delta Marsh as very little was known at that time about waterfowl biology.  After some discussion, Aldo Leopold agreed to Bell’s idea and brought in his graduate student [[Hans Albert Hochbaum]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  

Hochbaum completed his graduate work at the Delta Marsh on [[canvasback duck]]s and continued on to become the Scientific Director of the [[Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station]].

== Today ==

Today Delta Waterfowl Foundation supports graduate research on waterfowl ([[Master’s degree]] and [[Ph.D.]]) along with other programs focused on waterfowl populations and waterfowl hunting in North America.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

'''Energy For Opportunity (EFO)''' is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of solar energy across the West African Region.  They provide solar energy to off-grid families, schools, organizations, and communities in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Benin]], and [[Mali]].

==History==
Energy For Opportunity's two founders, Simon Willans and Paul Munro, first met while living and working with community-based organizations in rural [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Coster, Helen (2011) [https://blogs.forbes.com/helencoster/2011/01/31/forget-the-grid-can-solar-power-light-africa/ Forget the Grid. Can Solar Power Light Africa?] Forbes Magazine (online)&lt;/ref&gt;  This initial collaboration led to further opportunities in [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]], where they helped to implement a large-scale solar electricity installation project in twelve schools and health clinics in refugee affected areas across [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2006-2007"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.efasl.org.uk|title=Annual Report 2006-2007|publication-date =2007 |publisher=The Environmental Foundation for Africa| author=EFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace Corps Interview with Paul Munro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arc.peacecorpsconnect.org/Round1Winners |publication-date=2009 |title=Peace Corp Interview with Paul Munro |publisher=Africa Rural Connect |author=Peace Corps Connect |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830055131/http://arc.peacecorpsconnect.org/Round1Winners |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Munro, who has worked in post-catastrophe relief,&lt;ref name="Texts, Tweets Saving Haitians From the Rubble"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/texts-tweets-saving-haitians-from-the-rubble/|publication-date =2010|title=Texts, Tweets Saving Haitians From the Rubble|publisher=Wired Magazine  |author= Nathan Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Texts and Tweets Saving Lives in Haiti"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.switched.com/2010/01/23/texts-and-tweets-saving-lives-in-haiti/#continued |publication-date =2010|title=Texts and Tweets Saving Lives in Haiti |publisher=Switched| author= Amar Toor}}&lt;/ref&gt; has served as EFO's Chief Information Officer since its inception.

Energy For Opportunity was registered as a charity in Canada on September 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="Canadian Registered Charities Detail Page"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/charity-eng.action?r=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cra-arc.gc.ca%3A80%2Febci%2Fhaip%2Fsrch%2Fbasicsearchresult-eng.action%3Fs%3D%2B%26amp%3Bk%3Denergy%2Bfor%2Bopportunity%26amp%3Bb%3Dtrue%26amp%3Bp%3D1%26amp%3Bf%3D100&amp;bn=800168551RR00010 |publication-date =2009|title=Canadian Registered Charities Detail Page |publisher=Canadian Revenue Agency| author= CRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
"Focusing on the key areas of health, education, livelihoods and skills training, Energy For Opportunity with the strategic implementation of solar installation projects, seeks to make a difference in the daily lives of communities in the region.  EFO's strategy is to develop innovative ways in which to both promote and implement the use of renewable energy. The emphasis therefore is not only on direct solar installation projects (in health clinics, schools, community centers, etc.), but also on solar training for students in partnership with local education institutions and the active promotion of the use of renewable energies in the offices and projects of government bodies and international organizations. Thus the objective is not just to deliver renewable electricity through projects, but also instill a philosophy of renewable energy use across the broader community." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyforopportunity.org/about/strategy/ |title=Our Strategy |publisher=Energy for Opportunity |date= |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GSMA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/documents/charging_choices.pdf |publication-date=2009 |title=Green Power For Mobile: Charging Choices - Off-grid Charging Solutions For Mobile Phones |publisher=GSM Association |author=GSMA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231023125/http://gsmworld.com/documents/charging_choices.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental soil science''' is the study of the interaction of humans with the [[pedosphere]] as well as critical aspects of the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Environmental [[soil science]] addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], [[nutrient management]], movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, [[bioremediation]], application of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, [[land use]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and the study of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils, such as [[terra preta]]. Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hongwei|last2=An|first2=Jing|last3=Wei|first3=Shuhe|last4=Gu|first4=Jian|last5=Liang|first5=Wenju|title=Spatial Patterns and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Soils in a Resource-Exhausted City, Northeast China|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=2015|volume=10|issue=9|page=e0137694|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziadat|first1=Feras Mousa|last2=Yeganantham|first2=Dhanesh|last3=Shoemate|first3=David|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Raghavan|last5=Narasimhan|first5=Balaji|last6=Tech|first6=Jaclyn|title=Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) to predict spatial distribution of soil attributes for environmental modeling|journal=International Journal of Architectural and Biological Engineering|date=2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=158–172|doi=10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flood basalt''' is the result of a giant [[volcanic eruption]] or series of [[eruption]]s that covers large stretches of land or the [[ocean]] floor with [[basalt]] [[lava]]. Flood basalt provinces such as the [[Deccan Traps]] of India are often called '''[[Trap rock|traps]],''' after the Swedish word ''trappa'' (meaning "stairs"), due to the characteristic stairstep [[geomorphology]] of many associated landscapes. [[Michael R.

One proposed explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of [[Rift (geology)|continental rifting]] and its associated [[decompression melting]], in conjunction with a [[mantle plume]] also undergoing decompression melting, producing vast quantities of a [[tholeiitic basalt]]ic [[magma]]. These have a very low [[viscosity]], which is why they 'flood' rather than form taller [[volcano]]es. Another explanation is that they result from the release, over a short period, of melt that has accumulated in the mantle over a long period.&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deccan Traps]] of central [[India]], the [[Siberian Traps]], and the [[Columbia River Plateau]] of western [[North America]] are three regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts. The [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Mackenzie Large Igneous Province]] in [[Canada]] contains the [[Coppermine River Group|Coppermine River flood basalt]]s related to the [[Muskox intrusion|Muskox layered intrusion]]. The [[lunar mare|maria]] on the [[Moon]] are additional, even more extensive, flood basalts. Flood basalts on the [[ocean floor]] produce [[oceanic plateau]]s.

The surface covered by one eruption can vary from around 200,000&amp;nbsp;km² ([[Karoo-Ferrar|Karoo]]) to 1,500,000&amp;nbsp;km² (Siberian Traps). The thickness can vary from 2000 metres (Deccan Traps) to 12,000 m {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} ([[Lake Superior]]). These are smaller than the original [[volume]]s due to [[erosion]].

==Petrography==
[[Image:Ethiopian highlands 01 mod.jpg|thumb|[[Ethiopian Highlands]] basalt]]
Flood basalts have tholeiite and [[olivine]] compositions (according to the classification of [[Hatton Schuyler Yoder|Yoder]] and [[Cecil Edgar Tilley|Tilley]]). The composition of the basalts from the [[Paraná Basin|Paraná]] is fairly typical of that of flood basalts; it contains [[phenocryst]]s occupying around 25[[%]] of the volume of rock in a fine-grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. These phenocrysts are [[pyroxenes]] ([[augite]] and [[pigeonite]]), [[plagioclase]]s, opaque [[crystal]]s such as [[titanium]] rich [[magnetite]] or [[ilmenite]], and occasionally some olivine. Sometimes more differentiated volcanic products such as [[andesite]]s, [[dacite]]s and [[rhyodacite]]s have been observed, but only in small quantities at the top of former [[magma chamber]]s.

==Structures==
Subaerial flood basalts can be of two kinds :
* with a smooth or twisted surface : very compact surface; [[Vesicular texture|vesicles]] (gas bubbles) are rare. [[Degassing]] was easy (magma maintained at a high [[temperature]] and more [[fluid]] in a chamber of a size such that confining [[pressure]]s did not confine gases to the melt before expulsion). Such lava flows may form [[underground river]]s; when degassing fractures and conduits are present, very large flows may reach the surface.
* with a chaotic surface : the basalt flood is very rich in bubbles of gas, with an irregular, fragmental surface. Degassing was difficult (less fluid magma expelled from a rift with no chance of progressive expansion in a hot chamber; the degassing took place closer to the surface where the flow forms a crust which cracks under the pressure of the gases in the flow itself and during more rapid cooling).
In the [[Massif Central]] in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], France, there is a good example of chaotic lava flow, produced by eruptions from [[Puy de la Vache]] and [[Puy de Lassolas]].

==Geochemistry==
[[Image:Chasm Provincial Park trees and flood basalts.jpg|thumb|Multiple flood basalt flows of the [[Chilcotin Group]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]
[[Geochemical]] analysis of the major [[oxide]]s reveals a composition close to that of [[mid-ocean ridge]] basalts (MORB) but also close to that of [[ocean island basalt]]s (OIB). These are in fact [[tholeiite]]s with a [[silicon dioxide]] percentage close to 50%.

Two kinds of basaltic flood basalts can be distinguished :
*those poor in P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, called low [[phosphorus]] and [[titanium]]
*those rich in P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, called high phosphorus and titanium

The [[isotopic ratio]]s &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Sr/&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Sr and &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Pb are different from that observed in general, which shows that the basalt flood magma was contaminated as it passed through the [[continental crust]]. It is this contamination that explains the difference between the two kinds of basalt mentioned above. The low phosphorus and titanium type has an excess of elements from the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] such as [[potassium]] and [[strontium]].

The content in [[incompatible element]]s of flood basalts is lower than that of ocean island basalts, but higher than that of mid-ocean ridge basalts.

The hiss can be seen between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz, sandwiched between components of [[:en:radio atmospheric|sferics]]]]

[[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic]] '''hiss''' is a naturally occurring [[Extremely Low Frequency]]/[[Very Low Frequency]] [[electromagnetic wave]] (i.e., 300&amp;nbsp;Hz – 10&amp;nbsp;kHz) that is generated in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of either the Earth's [[ionosphere]] or [[magnetosphere]]. Its name is derived from its incoherent, structureless spectral properties which, when played through an audio system, sound like [[white noise]] (hence the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] name, "hiss").

==Varieties==
Hiss may be observed in any of several varieties depending on local time and [[L-shell]] of the observer:&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Plasmaspheric hiss''' is generally observed within the [[plasmasphere]], peaking in frequency slightly below ~1&amp;nbsp;kHz and rarely exceeding 3&amp;nbsp;kHz.
* '''Exo-hiss''' and '''ELF hiss''' are two varieties of hiss observed outside of the [[plasmasphere]], both having a spectrum similar to that of plasmaspheric hiss.
* '''Midlatitude hiss''' is generally observed outside of the plasmasphere and tends to have frequencies between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.
* '''Auroral hiss''' is observed in the [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral zones]] of the Earth and can extend up to several hundred kHz.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Lake Bafa''' or '''Lake Bafa Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Bafa Gölü Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[lake]] and a [[nature reserve]] situated in southwestern [[Turkey]], part of it within the boundaries of [[Milas]] district of [[Muğla Province]] and the northern part within [[Aydın Province]]'s [[Söke]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.cevreorman.gov.tr/Haber.asp?hID=1848 |publisher=Çevre ve Orman Bakanlığı |title=Bafa Gölü Tabiat Parkı Uzun Devreli Gelişme Planı Onaylandı… |date=2008-10-28 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314062850/http://www2.cevreorman.gov.tr/Haber.asp?hID=1848 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake used to be a gulf of the [[Aegean Sea]] until the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], when the sea passage was gradually closed by the alluvial mass brought by [[Büyük Menderes River]] (Maeander River). The gulf, and later the lake, was named [[Latmus]] in antiquity.

The southern shore of the lake is traced by the highway connecting [[İzmir]]-[[Kuşadası]]-[[Söke]] to towns such as [[Milas]] and [[Bodrum]] that are situated in the south. The northern shore of the lake, where steep slopes are covered by wild or semi-domesticated olive trees, is virtually untouched to this day.

==History==
[[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|left|250px|Location of lake Bafa at [[Büyük Menderes River|Maeander River]]'s mouth and the steps of its creation during Antiquity.]]
At the innermost north-east tip of the lake is the village of [[Kapıkırı]], as well as the ruins of ''Heraclea by Latmus'' (sometimes called Heraclea in Ionia), to distinguish from other ancient Greek sites named [[Heraclea (disambiguation)|Heraclea]]. The mountain chain of [[Beşparmak Mountains|Beşparmak]] (''Dağları'') -also named (Latmus) in antiquity- rises on the back, sheltering the non-restored ruins of a dozen monasteries dating from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era on its slopes. Yet another monastery is situated on an islet on the lake just across the village. The village of Kapıkırı has recently developed important facitilies catering to visiting tourists, although agriculture and fishing still occupies an important part in its economy.

According to the legend, it was here that the goddess [[Selene]] fell in love with the shepherd [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]] and she asked [[Zeus]] to keep the young shepherd in perpetual sleep and bore up to fifty children from her nightly encounters with the sleeping young man.

The table above only lists those [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s for which a reference exists in the open (unclassified) English-language scientific literature to persistent artificial radiation belts resulting from the explosion.

The [[Starfish Prime]] radiation belt had, by far, the greatest intensity and duration of any of the artificial radiation belts.&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt;

The Starfish Prime radiation belt damaged the United Kingdom Satellite [[Ariel 1]] and the United States satellites, [[Transit Research and Attitude Control|Traac]], [[Transit_(satellite)#Other_satellites|Transit&amp;nbsp;4B]], [[Injun (satellite)|Injun&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Telstar|Telstar&amp;nbsp;I]].&amp;nbsp;  It also damaged the Soviet satellite [[Kosmos 5|Cosmos&amp;nbsp;V]].&amp;nbsp; All of these satellites failed completely within several months of the Starfish detonation.&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt; 

Telstar&amp;nbsp;I lasted the longest of the satellites damaged by the Starfish Prime radiation, with its complete failure occurring on February 21, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;National Space Science Data Center: Telstar 1 [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1962-029A] (Retrieved 2009-10-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] report LA-6405, Herman Hoerlin gave the following explanation of the history of the original Argus experiment and of how the nuclear detonations lead to the development of artificial radiation belts.&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt;

{{quote|Before the discovery of the natural [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen belts]] in 1958, [[Nicholas Christofilos|N. C. Christofilos]] had suggested in October 1957 that many observable geophysical effects could be produced by a nuclear explosion at high altitude in the upper atmosphere. This suggestion was reduced to practice with the sponsorship of the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA) of the Department of Defense and under the overall direction of [[Herbert York]], who was then Chief Scientist of [[DARPA|ARPA]]. It required only four months from the time it was decided to proceed with the tests until the first bomb was exploded. The code name of the project was [[Operation Argus|Argus]]. Three events took place in the South Atlantic. ... Following these events, artificial belts of trapped radiation were observed.}}

{{quote|A general description of trapped radiation is as follows. Charged particles move in spirals around [[field line|magnetic-field lines]]. The pitch angle (the angle between the direction of the motion of the particle and direction of the field line) has a low value at the equator and increases while the particle moves down a field line in the direction where the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] strength increases. When the pitch angle becomes 90 degrees, the particle must move in the other direction, up the field lines, until the process repeats itself at the other end. The particle is continuously reflected at the two ''[[magnetic mirror|mirror]]'' points &amp;mdash; it is trapped in the field. Because of asymmetries in the field, the particles also drift around the earth, electrons towards the east. Thus, they form a shell around the earth similar in shape to the surface formed by a field line rotated around the magnetic [[dipole]] axis.}}

In 2010, the United States [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] issued a report that had been written in support of the United States Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|Electromagnetic Pulse]] Attack.  The report, entitled "Collateral Damage to Satellites from an EMP Attack," discusses in great detail the historical events that caused artificial radiation belts and their effects on many satellites that were then in orbit.  The same report also projects the effects of one or more present-day high altitude nuclear explosions upon the formation of artificial radiation belts and the probable resulting  effects on satellites that are currently in orbit.&lt;ref name="DTRA-IR-10-22"&gt;Conrad, Edward E., et al.

This is a '''list of fountains, drinking fountains and water wells in Bratislava''', the capital of [[Slovakia]]. Approximately half of the over 140&lt;ref name=BANoviny1&gt;{{cite news|title=Prvé fontány v meste už spustili, v Bratislave ich je spolu vyše 140 (First fountains started in the city, there is over 140 of them in Bratislava)|url=http://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/najnovsie-spravy-z-bratislavy/samosprava/prve-fontany-v-meste-uz-spustili-v-bratislave-ich-je-spolu-vyse-140.html|accessdate=23 March 2017|newspaper=Bratislavské Noviny|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fountain]]s found in the city form part of the picturesque landscape of the medieval [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]] of [[Bratislava]] (the city was known in the past under [[History of Bratislava|many names]]) and serve as [[tourist attractions]] while many of the newer fountains are fine examples of [[socialist realism|socialist era building]] of modern [[panelák]] city suburbs. The number of fountains in Bratislava is comparable to the four times larger neighboring [[Austria]]n capital [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=SME1&gt;{{cite news|title=Prechádzky po Bratislave: Uránový kameň zmizol, Čas zničili (Walks across Bratislava: The uranium stone disappeared, Time was destroyed)|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/6526763/prechadzky-po-bratislave-uranovy-kamen-zmizol-cas-znicili.html|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=SME|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fountains in Bratislava were first built in the 16th century as means of [[water supply]], the oldest fountain in the city is the [[Roland Fountain]] from 1572. The first decorative [[fountain]] in [[Bratislava]] was the Ganymede's Fountain from 1888. The most famous fountain in the city is the Fountain of Love in the borough of [[Ružinov]] which was specifically built as the central setting of the 1986 [[Cinema of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak hit movie]] Fountain for Suzanne ({{lang-sk|Fontána pre Zuzanu}}), directed by [[Slovaks|Slovak]] director [[Dušan Rapoš]]. The fountain features on the movie's iconic poster. Some fountains (such as the [[Roland Fountain]] and the Ganymede's fountain) are part of almost every guided tour of the city, while others (such as the fountain Earth - Planet of peace in front of the [[Grassalkovich Palace|Presidential Palace]]) form part of everyday life in Bratislava and are important [[meeting point]]s in the city.

Due to Bratislava being in the [[temperate zone]], outdoor fountains are turned off during the [[winter]] months. For the city owned fountains the operating season starts in April - May, and the fountains are not turned on en masse, but gradually starting first with the major fountains in the Old Town.&lt;ref name=SMEStart2012&gt;{{cite news|last=SITA|title=Tento týždeň spustia v meste fontány (Fountains in the city will be turned on this week)|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/6323490/tento-tyzden-spustia-v-meste-fontany.html|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=SME|date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season typically ends in October.

== History ==
Bratislava, due to its location near the river [[Danube]] and due to various streams flowing down from the [[Little Carpathians]] mountains, always had plenty of water. Fountains were fed water from the streams uphill through a series of wooden pipes, later replaced by metal ones. Since the origin of the stream was higher than the fountain it fed, gravity ejected the water at the end. The pressure was usually very weak and used for example as water flowing from the mouths of animals.&lt;ref name=Vyse100Fontan&gt;{{cite news|title=V meste je vyše sto fontán, viaceré z nich sú v zlom stave (There is over 100 fountains in the city, many of them in bad condition)|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/2039552/v-meste-je-vyse-sto-fontan-viacere-z-nich-su-v-zlom-stave.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|newspaper=SME|date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the coronation festivities accompanying the crowning of the [[Kings of Hungary]] in the city between 1563 and 1830, [[wine]] was usually poured into the town fountains.&lt;ref name=Spectator2&gt;{{cite news|title=Queen Eleonora’s crowning re-enacted in Bratislava|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/47009/8/queen_eleonoras_crowning_re_enacted_in_bratislava.html|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Slovak Spectator|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the project for the tunnel underneath the [[Bratislava Castle]] from the 1940s, today used for [[Public transport in Bratislava|public transport]] trams, contained a fountain to be built into the wall of the eastern portal. When looking inside the tunnel, the fountain was supposed to be inside the wall to the right, but this wall was finally constructed shorter and without the fountain. It was supposed to consist of six small half-circle shaped basins arranged into a triangle, with the water cascading from the upper basins into the lower ones.

A new fountain is planned with the reconstruction of the Malokarpatské Námestie in the [[Lamač]] borough at least since 2002, but the project is unrealized as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=V Lamači bude nová fontána (New fountain will be constructed in Lamač)|url=http://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/najnovsie-spravy-z-bratislavy/vystavba/v-lamaci-bude-nova-fontana.html?page_id=10020|accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=Bratislavské Noviny|date=28 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic description ==
The biggest fountain in Bratislava is ''Fontána Družby'' on [[Námestie Slobody]], Old Town. The smallest fountain is ''Girl with a deer'' on [[Hviezdoslavovo námestie (Bratislava)|Hviezdoslavovo námestie]], Old Town.

As of today, 42 fountains are taken care of by the municipal company ''Paming - Mestský investor pamiatkovej obnovy'',&lt;ref name=PAMING&gt;{{cite web|title=PAMING - City Investor of Monument Restoration - Fountains in Bratislava|url=http://www.paming.bratislava.sk/vismo/zobraz_dok.asp?id_org=600177&amp;id_ktg=51&amp;p1=53|publisher=Bratislava City Webpage|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with 11 small drinking water fountains and 3 [[water wells]], the rest is owned by the Bratislava city boroughs and various private companies and hotels. Annual budget for running and maintenance of the fountains under ''Paming'' is approximately 150 000 €. Four fountains under ''Paming'' were out of order in the 2010 summer season: fountain on Námestie slobody, fountain on Námestie M. Benku, fountain on Uránová Street and fountain on Borská Street. All four would require reconstruction before being able to function again.

One fountain, the Fountain for Suzanne in [[Ružinov]], was specially built as the central setting of the 1986 movie of the same name by Slovak director [[Dušan Rapoš]]. Fountain for Suzan is still widely known in Slovakia, despite the fountain itself, hidden behind apartment houses, quickly fell into obscurity. Moreover, it was built as a movie prop, without access to public water or electricity. During shooting, the fountain was attached to a cistern truck filled with water. In 2008 the fountain was reconstructed and made functional for the first time.

Many of Bratislava's fountains are tourist attractions, some of them feature in most guided tours. Occasionally, people are fined for swimming or skinny-dipping in the fountains, in most cases foreigners.&lt;ref name=Spectator1&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptáková|first=Jana|title=May - June - Not a banner summer for Bratislava fountains|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/30248/8/may_june_not_a_banner_summer_for_bratislava_fountains.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|newspaper=The Slovak Spectator|date=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drinking fountains'''&lt;br&gt;
There are currently 33 public drinking water fountains in Bratislava. They started to appear after the practical aspect of fountains diminished. In the past, the city featured a variety of historical drinking fountains, especially wall-fountains inside the courtyards of rich townspeople mansions. Baroque drinking fountains of this type included Putto s rybou I (Putto with a fish I) and Scharitzerova fontána (Scharitzer drinking fountain) inside the Apponyi Palace, Putto s rybou II on Biela Street survived until today.&lt;ref name=PicieFontany&gt;{{cite news|title=Fontány pomáhajú zvládať leto (Fountains help cope with the summer)|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/3399201/fontany-pomahaju-zvladat-leto.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|newspaper=SME|date=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking fountains are used especially during the summer, yet a lot of people are reluctant to drink the water due to fear of disease. According to the Public Health Office of Slovakia ({{lang-sk|Úrad verejného zdravotníctva}}), all drinking water fountains supply the same [[tap water]] as residents have in their homes and the water is safe to drink.&lt;ref name=SMEDrinking&gt;{{cite news|title=Pitným fontánam ľudia neveria (People do not trust drinking water fountains)|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/5958951/pitnym-fontanam-ludia-neveria.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=SME|date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking fountains in Bratislava do not feature any instructions on how to operate them.

| The fountain consists of two basins one above the other, the lower being 14 x 9 meters, the upper 5 x 5 meters. Both are covered in ceramic tiles. The fountain was unfinished at its launch, featuring a concrete pedestal for a sculpture that was never installed. Due to problems with water drainage and repeated complaints about excessive noise from citizens living near the fountain it was turned off after 1 or 3 years (depending on the source). In 2006 the fountain was reconstructed by the city company Paming after repeated complains from the citizens about the fountain not functioning. The technological parts of the fountain were reconstructed while the outside appearance remained the same. The fountain was restarted after 25 years on 9 May 2006. The fountain can be controlled by [[remote control]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib.bratislava.sk/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=600179&amp;id=1617&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Monument Protection Office neither a fountain or a city-type water well can be constructed here due to historical reasons. Instead a village-type decorative pump with a small basin to circulate the water was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=TASR|title=Vajnorčania opravujú Ľudový dom a chcú fontánu|trans-title=Vajnory residents are repairing the Ľudový dom and they want a fountain|url=http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/5982253/vajnorcania-opravuju-ludovy-dom-a-chcu-fontanu.html|accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=SME|date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of water wells in Bratislava ==
In the [[middle ages]], every house in the walled city of Bratislava had a [[water well]], usually several of them, being the main source of water supply. They were built at terrain level but also in the basements of buildings. Wells in Bratislava were suppllied mainly from shallow waters circulating in the [[Danube]] river terraces and from three identified streams originating at Kozia Street, Hlboká cesta Street and at the [[Slavín]] [[Bratislava Foothills|hill]]. As of 2011, there were 66 documented wells in the [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]]. 12 are restored and accessible, the well at the courtyard of the Universitas Istropolitana is the oldest. As of today, none of the [[water well]]s in Bratislava are actually used and they serve a purely decorative function.&lt;ref name=SMEstudne&gt;{{cite news|title=Bratislavčania pili zo studní a studničiek (People of Bratislava drank from wells and springs)|url=https://bratislava.sme.sk/c/987677/bratislavcania-pili-zo-studni-a-studniciek.html|accessdate=23 March 2017|newspaper=SME|date=23 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Locusta-migratoria-wanderheuschrecke.jpg|thumb|Locusts are grasshoppers, such as this [[migratory locust]] (''Locusta migratoria''), that have entered into a migratory phase of their life.]]
[[File:Garden locust (Acanthacris ruficornis).jpg|thumb|Garden locust ''Acanthacris ruficornis'' in [[Ghana]]]]
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 7007 Plague locusts on the move.jpg|thumb|Millions of [[swarm]]ing [[Australian plague locust]]s on the move]]
'''Locusts''' are certain species of short-horned [[grasshopper]]s in the family [[Acrididae]] that have a [[Swarm behaviour|swarming]] phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.  No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions.

In the solitary phase, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. Under suitable conditions of [[drought]] followed by rapid vegetation growth, [[serotonin]] in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] and nomadic (loosely described as [[Insect migration|migratory]]) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause [[pest (organism)|damage to crops]]. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.&lt;ref name="Antsey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antsey |first1=Michael |last2=Rogers |first2=Stephen |last3=Swidbert |first3=R.O. |last4=Burrows |first4=Malcolm |last5=Simpson |first5=S.J. |title=Serotonin mediates behavioral gregarization underlying swarm formation in desert locusts |journal=Science|date=30 January 2009 |volume=323|issue=5914 |pages=627–630 |doi=10.1126/science.1165939 |pmid=19179529 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5914/627.long|bibcode=2009Sci...323..627A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locusts have formed [[Swarm behaviour|plagues]] since [[prehistory]]. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]'', the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of [[famine]]s and human migrations. More recently, changes in [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control are based on the use of [[insecticide]]s from the ground or the air, but other methods using [[biological control]] are proving effective.

Swarming behaviour decreased in the 20th century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, the potential for swarms to form is still present, and when suitable climatic conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can still occur. Locusts are large insects and convenient for use in research and the study of zoology in the classroom. They are also [[Entomophagy|edible insects]]; they have been eaten throughout history and are considered a [[delicacy]] in many countries. The word "locust" is derived from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''locusta'', meaning [[grasshopper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|locust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locusts are the [[Swarm behaviour|swarming]] phase of certain species of short-horned [[grasshopper]]s in the family [[Acrididae]]. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming [[Social animal|gregarious]].&lt;ref name="CurrentBio"&gt;Simpson, Stephen J.; Sword, Gregory A.

No [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term "locust" is used for grasshopper species that change [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers.

These changes are examples of phase [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]; they were first analysed and described by [[Boris Uvarov]], who was instrumental in setting up the [[Anti-Locust Research Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reed Business Information|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhMXtivOrZ4C&amp;pg=PA156|date=20 April 1972|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=156|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his discoveries during his studies of the Migratory locust in Caucasus, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species (Locusta migratoria and L. danica L.). He designated the two phases as ''solitaria'' and ''gregaria''.&lt;ref name=Dingle1996&gt;{{cite book|author=Dingle, Hugh|title=Migration : The Biology of Life on the Move|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzzJoVfgg0QC&amp;pg=PA273 |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-535827-8 |pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also referred to as [[statary]] and migratory [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]]s, though strictly speaking, their swarms are [[nomad]]ic rather than [[Animal migration|migratory]]. [[Charles Valentine Riley]] and [[Norman Criddle]] were also involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Encyclopedia Americana (1920)/Riley, Charles Valentine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/51/criddle_n.shtml |title= Norman Criddle: Pioneer Entomologist of the Prairies |author=Holliday, N.J. |date=1 February 2006 |work=Manitoba History |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm |publisher=BBC News |author=James Morgan |title=Locust swarms 'high' on serotonin |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131010043157/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm|archivedate = 10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily.

The initial bands of gregarious hoppers are known as "outbreaks", and when these join together into larger groups, the event is known as an "upsurge". Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating from a number of entirely separate breeding locations are known as "plagues".&lt;ref name=Showler2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |title=The Desert Locust in Africa and Western Asia: Complexities of War, Politics, Perilous Terrain, and Development |author=Showler, Allan T. |date=4 March 2013 |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=3 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408034918/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |archivedate=8 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area. As time goes by, the insects become more cohesive and the bands become concentrated in a smaller area. In the desert locust plague in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that lasted from 1966 to 1969, the number of locusts increased from two to 30 billion over two generations, but the area covered decreased from over {{convert|100000|km2}} to {{convert|5000|km2}}.&lt;ref name=Krall453/&gt;

===Solitary and gregarious phases===
[[File:DesertLocust.jpeg|thumb|''Solitaria'' (grasshopper) and ''gregaria'' (swarming) phases of the desert locust]]
One of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The ''gregaria'' nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen as early as the second [[instar]]. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way around barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves [[Olfaction|olfactory]] cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.&lt;ref name=Dingle1996/&gt;

Also, differences in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the ''gregaria'' nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less [[sexual dimorphism]], and higher [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]]s. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have lower levels of [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=Dingle1996/&gt;

The mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.&lt;ref name=Dingle1996/&gt;

North America is currently the only continent besides Antarctica without a native locust species. The [[Rocky Mountain locust]] was formerly one of the most significant insect pests there, but it became extinct in 1902. In the 1930s, during the [[Dust Bowl]], a second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (''Dissosteira longipennis'') reached plague proportions in the American Midwest. Today, the High Plains locust is a rare species and no longer swarms, leaving North America with no swarming locusts.

===Ancient times===
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Horemhab 002.jpg|thumb|Locust detail from a hunt mural in the grave-chamber of [[Horemhab]], [[Ancient Egypt]], ''circa'' 1422–1411 BC]]

Study of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC, and a devastating plague is mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]] in the Bible, as taking place in Egypt around 1446 BC.&lt;ref name=Krall453&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krall, S.|author2=Peveling, R.|author3=Diallo,B.D. |title=New Strategies in Locust Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ndBQiTiRAC&amp;pg=PA453 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-7643-5442-8 |pages=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Exodus|pages=10: 13–15|quote=And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.  14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.  15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions locusts taking to the wing to escape fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Homer |title=Iliad 21.1 |website=Perseus Tufts |accessdate=16 August 2017 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D21%3Acard%3D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plagues of locusts are also mentioned in the Quran.&lt;ref name=Showler&gt;{{cite book |editor=John L.

[[Aristotle]] studied locusts and their breeding habits and [[Livy]] recorded a devastating plague in [[Capua]] in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he associated with the stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, and may have been caused by an increase in numbers of [[rats]] (and their [[fleas]]) that devoured the locust carcases.&lt;ref name=Spinage2012&gt;{{cite book|author=Spinage, Clive |title=African Ecology: Benchmarks and Historical Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3vOHF8PNKkC&amp;pg=PA533 |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-642-22871-1 |pages=481, 533–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring===
[[File:Eugenio Morales en el Sáhara Español (1942).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eugenio Morales Agacino]] on expedition monitoring locusts in the desert of [[Spanish Sahara]], 1942]]
Early intervention is a more successful means of dealing with locusts than later action when swarms have already built up. The technology to control locust populations is now available, but the organisational, financial, and political problems may be difficult to overcome. Monitoring is the key to reducing damage, with the early detection and eradication of  bands being the objective. Ideally, a sufficient proportion of nomadic bands can be treated with insecticide before the swarming phase is reached. Reaching this objective may be possible in richer countries like Morocco and Saudi Arabia, but neighbouring poorer countries lack the resources and may act as a source of locust swarms that threaten the whole region.&lt;ref name=Showler/&gt;

Several organisations around the world monitor the threat from locusts. They provide forecasts detailing regions likely to suffer from locust plagues in the near future. In Australia, this service is provided by the [[Australian Plague Locust Commission]].&lt;ref name="Role"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/locusts/role |title=Role of the Australian Plague Locust Commission |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 June 2011 |website=Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715013827/http://daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/locusts/role |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been very successful with dealing with developing outbreaks, but has the great advantage of having a defined area to monitor and defend without locust invasions from elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Krall&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krall, S.|author2=Peveling, R.|author3=Diallo, B.D. |title=New Strategies in Locust Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ndBQiTiRAC |year=1997 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-7643-5442-8 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central and Southern Africa, the service is provided by the International Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa.&lt;ref name=FAOTanzania&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Locust disaster in Eastern Africa prevented|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/21084/icode/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In West and Northwest Africa, the service is co-ordinated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Western Region, and executed by locust control agencies belonging to each country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries take responsibility for regional desert locust control|url=http://www.fao.org/in-action/countries-take-responsibility-for-regional-desert-locust-control/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2 April 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO also monitors the situation in the Caucasus and Central Asia, where over 25 million hectares of cultivated land are under threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts-CCA/en/1010/ |title=Locusts in Caucasus and Central Asia |work=Locust Watch |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control===

Historically, people could do little to protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, although eating the insects may have been some consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods.&lt;ref name=Krall453/&gt; By the 1950s, the [[organochloride]] [[dieldrin]] was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistence in the environment]] and its [[bioaccumulation]] in the [[food chain]].&lt;ref name=Krall453/&gt;

In years when locust control is needed, the hoppers are targeted early by applying water-based, contact [[pesticide]]s using tractor-based sprayers. This is effective but slow and labour-intensive, and where possible, spraying concentrated insecticide solutions from aircraft over the insects or the vegetation on which they feed is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts-CCA/en/1013/ |title=Control |work=Locusts in Caucasus and Central Asia |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ultralow-volume spraying of contact pesticides from aircraft in overlapping swathes is effective against nomadic bands and can be used to treat large areas of land swiftly.&lt;ref name=Krall/&gt; Other modern technologies used for planning locust control include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[Geographic information system|GIS tools]], and [[satellite imagery]], and computers provide rapid data management and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ceccato|first1=Pietro |title=Operational Early Warning System Using Spot-Vegetation And  Terra-Modis To Predict Desert Locust Outbreaks |url=http://iri.columbia.edu/~pceccato/Public-Desert-Locust/Ceccato_full.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510014559/http://iri.columbia.edu/~pceccato/Public-Desert-Locust/Ceccato_full.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Latchininsky |first1=Alexandre V. |last2=Sivanpillai |first2=Ramesh |title=Locust Habitat Monitoring And Risk Assessment Using Remote Sensing And GIS Technologies |url=http://www.uwyo.edu/esm/faculty-and-staff/latchininsky/documents/2010-latchininsky-sivanpillai-springer.pdf |publisher=University of Wyoming |date=2010 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230005049/http://www.uwyo.edu/esm/faculty-and-staff/latchininsky/documents/2010-latchininsky-sivanpillai-springer.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate goal in locust control is the use of preventive and proactive methods that disrupt the environment to the least possible extent. This would make agricultural production easier and more secure in the many regions where growing crops is of vital importance to the survival of the local people.&lt;ref name=Showler2013/&gt;

The locust is large and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an experimental model in research studies.

[[File:Karta PG Louisiade isl.PNG|thumb|250 px|Louisiade Archipelago]]
[[File:Louisiade archipelago.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Moving westward from eastern end of the chain are the islands of [[Rossel Island|Rossel]] and [[Vanatinai|Vanatinai (Tagula)]]. [[Misima Island]], which harbors the largest village in the region, is obscured by a patch of clouds northeast of image center]]
The '''Louisiade Archipelago''' is a string of ten larger volcanic islands frequently fringed by coral reefs, and 90 smaller coral islands in [[Papua New Guinea]].

It is located 200&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[New Guinea]], stretching over more than {{convert|160|km|mi}} and spread over an ocean area of {{convert|26000|km2|mi2}} between the [[Solomon Sea]] to the north and the [[Coral Sea]] to the south. The aggregate land area of the islands is about {{convert|1871|km2|mi2}}, with [[Vanatinai|Vanatinai (Tagula)]] being the largest.

[[Rogeia Island|Rogeia]], [[Samarai Island|Samarai]] and [[Sariba Island|Sariba]] lie closest to New Guinea, while [[Misima Island|Misima]], [[Vanatinai]], and [[Rossel Island|Rossel]] islands lie further east.

==Government==
The archipelago is divided into the Local Level Government (LLG) areas [[Bwanabwana Rural LLG|Bwanabwana Rural]] (western part, with [[Basilaki Island|Basilaki]]), [[Louisiade Rural LLG|Louisiade Rural]] (central part, with [[Misima]]), and [[Yaleyamba LLG|Yaleyamba]] (eastern part, with Rossell and Vanatinai islands). The LLG areas are part of [[Samarai-Murua District]] of [[Milne Bay Province|Milne Bay]]. The seat of the Louisiade Rural LLG is [[Bwagaoia]] on Misima Island, the population center of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pngec.gov.pg/ElectionInfo2007/PollSched-MilneBay.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The seat of the [[Yaleyamba LLG|Yaleyamba]] is changed every couple of years between [[Vanatinai|Rambuso]] and Jingo  (Rossell).
The seat of the [[Bwanabwana LLG|Bwanabwana]] was [[Samarai Island|Samarai]] from the Louisiade archipelago, but was recently transferred to the mainland of Papua New Guinea to the city of [[Alotau]].

== Islands ==
The Louisiade Archipelago consists of the following island groups and islands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g3kma.dsl.pipex.com/067-076%20oceania%20list.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102052853/http://www.g3kma.dsl.pipex.com/067-076%20oceania%20list.doc |archivedate=2006-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The islands were discovered by a Spanish expedition led by [[Luis Váez de Torres]] in 1606, that was part of the [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós|Fernandez de Quiros]] fleet which had sailed from South America in search of Australia. The Torres expedition visited various islands including [[Basilaki Island]], which he named ''San Buenaventura'' in July 1606. It is possible that Malay and Chinese sailors also visited the islands earlier. More than a century later, in 1768, [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] visited the islands and named them for [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], the king of [[France]]. Visits were also paid by Admiral [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] in 1793 and Captain [[Owen Stanley]] in 1849.

The 1942 [[Battle of Coral Sea]] was fought nearby, after Japanese occupation in the same year.  The Deboyne Islands were the site of the [[Raids on Deboyne (1942)|1942 Raids on Deboyne]].

== Rain forests ==
The islands have a moist tropical climate, and are largely covered with [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]]. The Louisiade Archipelago rain forests form a distinct [[ecoregion]], and are home to a number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including several endemic [[trees]] (in genera ''[[Pandanus]], [[Diospyros]],'' and ''[[Hopea]]''), as well as five endemic [[frog]] species, two endemic [[lizard]] species, and five endemic [[bird]] species.

The '''Messinian''' is in the [[geologic timescale]] the last [[age (geology)|age]] or uppermost [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Miocene]]. It spans the time between 7.246 ± 0.005 [[annum|Ma]] and 5.333 ± 0.005 Ma (million years ago). It follows the [[Tortonian]] and is followed by the [[Zanclean]], the first age of the [[Pliocene]].

The Messinian overlaps the [[Turolian]] [[European Land Mammal Mega Zone]] (more precise MN 12 and 13) and the [[Paratethys|Pontian]] Central European [[Paratethys]] stage. It also overlaps the late [[Huayquerian]] and early [[Montehermosan]] [[South American Land Mammal Ages]], and falls inside the more extensive [[Hemphillian]] [[North American Land Mammal Age]].

During the Messinian, around 6 million years ago, the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] took place, which brought about repeated desiccations of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==Definition==
[[Image:Gypsum cones.jpg|thumb|Messinian [[gypsum]] and [[clay]] deposits in the [[Sorbas basin]] near [[Sorbas]], southern [[Spain]]. Evaporite deposits of Messinian age are common throughout the [[Mediterranean]].]]
The Messinian was introduced by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stratigrapher Karl Mayer-Eymar in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer-Eymar, Karl (1867) ''Catalogue systématique et descriptif des fossiles des terrains tertiaires qui se trouvent du Musée fédéral de Zürich'' (Zürich, Switzerland:  Librairie Schabelitz, 1867), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 13.]  From page 13:  ''"Dans ces circonstances, je crois qu'il m'est permis comme créateur d'une classification conséquente et logique de proposer pour l'étage en question un nom qui lui convient en tous points. Ce nom est celui d'Etage messinien."''  ("In these circumstances, I think that I am permitted as the creator of a consistent and logical classification to propose for the stage in question a name that suits it in every way. That name is that of the Messinian stage.")&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the Italian city of [[Messina]] on [[Sicily]], where the [[Messinian evaporite]] deposit is of the same age.

The base of the Messinian is at the first appearance of the [[plankton]]ic [[foram]] species ''Globorotalia conomiozea'' and is stratigraphically in the middle of magnetic chronozone C3Br.1r. The [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] for the Messinian is located in a section at Oued Akrech, near the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] capital [[Rabat]].&lt;ref&gt;This GSSP was established by Hilgen ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the Messinian (the base of the Zanclean stage and Pliocene series) lies with the top of magnetic chronozone Cr3 (about 100,000 years before the Thvera normal subchronozone C3n.4n). The top is also close to the [[extinction]] level of the calcareous [[nanoplankton]] species ''Triquetrorhabdulus rugosus'' (the base of [[biozone]] CN10b) and the first appearance of nanoplankton ''[[Ceratolithus|Ceratolithus acutus]]''.{{reference needed|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''Midwestern Canadian Shield forests''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[taiga|Taiga and Boreal forests]] [[Biome]], are of northern [[Canada]].

==Setting==
This is an area of rolling hills with lakes both small and large, wetlands, and rocky outcrops  on the [[Canadian Shield]]  in northern [[Saskatchewan]], north-central [[Manitoba]] (north and east of [[Lake Winnipeg]]) and [[Northwestern Ontario]]. Specific areas include the [[Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park|Athabasca Sand Dunes]], and many lakes such as [[Cree Lake]], [[Upper Foster Lake]] and [[Reindeer Lake]] in Saskatchewan. The area has a cold climate, very cold in winter although the hills around [[Lac Seul]] are warmer and wetter than most of the ecoregion, while the Athabasca Plain and the uplands above the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] and [[Hayes River]] are cooler. There are patches of [[permafrost]] throughout&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0609|name=Midwestern Canadian Shield forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Much of the landscape, including the Athabasca Plain, is the boreal forest that covers so much of Canada at this latitude, consisting of black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), quaking aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), white birch (''[[Betula papyrifera]]''), [[balsam poplar]]s, white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]''), and balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]''). The dominant tree of the wetlands is black spruce, while the rocky outcrops are covered with [[lichen]]s.

==Fauna==
Mammals of the ecoregion include [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[woodland caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus caribou''), [[barren-ground caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus arcticus''), [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis''), [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[American beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), [[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis''), [[American marten]] (''Martes americana''), [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea''), [[fisher (animal)|fisher]] (''Martes pennanti''), [[muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethica''), [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''), [[southern red-backed vole]] (''Myodes gapperi''), [[American red squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'') and [[least chipmunk]] (''neotamius minimus'').

Birds include ducks, geese, [[American white pelican]] (''Pelecanus erythrorhynchos''), [[sandhill crane]] (''Grus canadensis''), [[spruce grouse]] (''Falcipennis canadensis''), [[sharp-tailed grouse]] (''Tympahuchus phasianellus''), [[willow grouse]] (''Lagopus lagopus''), [[common nighthawk]] (''Chordeiles minor''), [[red-tailed hawk]] (''Buteo jamaicensis''), [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax''), [[common loon]] (''Gavia immer''), [[bald eagle]] (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), [[gray jay]] (''Perisoreus canadensis''), [[northern hawk owl]] (''Surnia ulula''), [[great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus''), [[American herring gull]] (''Larus smithsonianus'') and [[double-crested cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax auritus'').

==Threats and preservation==
Most of the natural forest remains intact with most alteration having occurred in Manitoba due to logging, mining and hydro-electric power generation. Protected areas include [[Opasquia Provincial Park]], [[Woodland Caribou Provincial Park]] and [[Pipestone River Provincial Park]] in northwestern [[Ontario]], [[Atikaki Provincial Wilderness Park]] in eastern Manitoba and [[Lac la Ronge]] and Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park in Saskatchewan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1952">'''Mobil Composition of  Matter''' (MCM)  is the initial name given for a series of [[mesoporous]] materials that were first [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by Mobil's researchers in 1992. [[MCM-41]] (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) and MCM-48 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 48) are two of the most popular mesoporous [[molecular sieve]]s that are keenly studied by researchers.

The most striking fact about the MCM-41 and MCM-48 is that, although composed of [[amorphous silica]] wall, they possess long range ordered framework with uniform mesopores.  These materials also possess large surface area, which can be up to more than 1000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Moreover, the pore diameter of these materials can be nicely controlled within mesoporous range between 1.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;nm by adjusting the synthesis conditions and/or by employing [[surfactant]]s with different chain lengths in their preparation.

MCM-41 and MCM-48 have been applied as [[catalyst]]s for various chemical reactions, as a support for drug delivery system and as [[adsorbent]] in [[waste water treatment]].

MCM-41 is a material similar to FCM-16.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2605">'''Moisture advection''' is the horizontal transport of [[water vapor]] by the [[wind]].  Measurement and knowledge of atmospheric water vapor, or "moisture", is crucial in the prediction of all [[weather]] elements, especially [[cloud]]s, [[fog]], [[temperature]], [[humidity]] thermal comfort indices and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

==Definition==
Using the classical definition of advection, moisture advection is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;Adv(\rho_m)=-\mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla \rho_m \!&lt;/math&gt;

in which V is the horizontal wind vector, and &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water vapor. However, water vapor content is usually measured in terms of [[mixing ratio]] (mass fraction) in [[Meteorological reanalysis|reanalyses]] or [[dew point]] (temperature to partial vapor pressure [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]], i.e. [[relative humidity]] to 100%) in [[Weather forecasting|operational forecasting]]. The advection of dew point itself can be thought as moisture advection:

:&lt;math&gt;Adv(T_d)=-\mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla T_d \!&lt;/math&gt;

==Moisture flux==
In terms of mixing ratio, horizontal transport/advection can be represented in terms of moisture flux:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}=q\mathbf{V}\!&lt;/math&gt; 

in which q is the mixing ratio. The value can be integrated throughout the atmosphere to total transport of moisture through the vertical:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\int_0^\infty \! \rho \mathbf{f}\,dz \,=-\int_P^0 \! \frac{\mathbf{f}}{g}\,dp \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of air, and P is pressure at the ground surface. For the far right definition, we have used [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]] approximation.

And its divergence (convergence) imply net [[evapotranspiration]] ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) as adding (removing) moisture from the column:

:&lt;math&gt;P-E-\frac{\partial (\int_0^\infty \! \rho q\,dz \,)}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}\!&lt;/math&gt;

where P, E, and the integral term are&amp;mdash;precipitation, evapotranspiration, and time rate of change of [[precipitable water]], all represented in terms of mass/(unit area * unit time). One can convert to more typical units in length such as mm by multiplying the density of liquid water and the correct length unit conversion factor.

'''NRLMSISE-00''' is an [[empirical]], global [[Mathematical model|model]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] from ground to space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picone|first=J. M.|last2=Hedin|first2=A. E.|last3=Drob|first3=D. P.|last4=Aikin|first4=A. C.|date=2002-12-01|title=NRLMSISE-00 empirical model of the atmosphere: Statistical comparisons and scientific issues|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JA009430/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics|language=en|volume=107|issue=A12|pages=1468|doi=10.1029/2002JA009430|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=2002JGRA..107.1468P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It models the [[temperature]]s and [[density|densities]] of the atmosphere's components. A primary use of this model is to aid predictions of [[satellite]] orbital decay due to [[atmospheric drag]]. This model has also been used by astronomers to calculate the mass of air between telescopes and laser beams in order to assess the impact of [[laser guide stars]] on the non-lasing telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, Dolores M. &amp; Roth, Katherine C., Adaptive Optics Systems II. Edited by Ellerbroek, Brent L.; Hart, Michael; Hubin, Norbert; Wizinowich, Peter L. Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 7736, pp. 773652-773652-9 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The model, developed by Mike Picone, Alan Hedin, and Doug Drob, is based on the earlier models MSIS-86 and MSISE-90, but updated with actual satellite drag data. It also predicts [[anomalous oxygen]].

''NRL'' stands for the [[US Naval Research Laboratory]]. MSIS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=85741076&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands for mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter radar, the two primary data sources for development of earlier versions of the model. ''E'' indicates that the model extends from the ground through [[exosphere]] and ''00'' is the year of release.

Over the years since introduction, NRLMSISE-00 has become the standard for international space research.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Input and output==

The '''Offshore and Onshore Reliability Data''' ('''OREDA''') project was established in 1981 in cooperation with the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate]] (now [[Petroleum Safety Authority Norway]]). It is "one of the main reliability data sources for the oil and gas industry"&lt;ref name="DNV GL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borges|first1=Victor|title=New edition — OREDA 2015 handbook|url=http://blogs.dnvgl.com/software/2015/06/new-edition-oreda-2015-handbook/|website=[[DNV GL|DNVGL]].com|publisher=Det Norske Veritas and [[Germanischer Lloyd]]|accessdate=12 September 2015|date=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered "a unique data source on failure rates, failure mode distribution and repair times for equipment used in the offshore industr[y].&lt;ref name="RAIL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Off-Shore Reliability Database (OREDA)|url=http://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~rail/new/WP2/OREDA-history.htm|website=DATSI.FI.UPM.es/~RAIL/|publisher=RAIL (Reliability-centred maintenance Approach for the Infrastructure and Logistics of railway operation)|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; OREDA's original objective was the collection of petroleum industry safety equipment [[reliability engineering|reliability]] data. The current organization, as a cooperating group of several petroleum and natural gas companies, was established in 1983, and at the same time the scope of OREDA was extended to cover reliability data from a wide range of equipment used in oil and gas [[Upstream (petroleum industry)|exploration and production]] (E&amp;P). OREDA primarily covers [[offshore (hydrocarbons)|offshore]], [[subsea (technology)|subsea]] and [[topsides|topside]] equipment, but does also include some [[onshore (hydrocarbons)|onshore]] E&amp;P, and some [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] equipment as well.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=OREDA — History |url=http://www.oreda.com/history/ |website=OREDA.com |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OREDA ORDH"&gt;{{cite book |author=OREDA |title=Offshore Reliability Data Handbook |edition=6 |volume=1 |publisher=SINTEF Technology and Society: Department of Safety Research |year=2015 |isbn=978-82-14-05948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of the OREDA project is to contribute to an improved safety and cost-effectiveness in design and operation of oil and gas E&amp;P facilities, through collection and analysis of maintenance and operational data, establishment of a high quality reliability database, and exchange of reliability, availability, maintenance and safety (RAMS) technology among the participating companies.&lt;ref name="OREDA ORDH"/&gt;

==History==
Work on the OREDA project proceeds in phases spanning 2–3 years. Handbooks summarizing the data collected and other work completed are issued regularly.&lt;ref name="DNV GL"/&gt;

* Phase I (1983–1985)&lt;br/&gt;The primary activity during this phase was the collection and compilation of offshore drilling installations, and the publication of these data in the first ''OREDA Handbook''. This demonstrated the ability of the eight petroleum industry companies involved in the project to cooperate on safety issues. While data in this initial phase included a wide range of equipment types, the level of detail was not as complete as in later phases of the project.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (1984 edition); Phase I data are not, however, included in the OREDA database.
* Phase II (1987–1990)&lt;br/&gt;To improve data quality, the project's scope was altered to include collection of production-critical equipment data only. Data began to be stored in a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows OS]] database. The development of a tailor-made data collection and analysis program, the OREDA software, was begun.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (1992 edition), which also contains re-published data collected in phase I.
* Phase III (1990–1992)&lt;br/&gt;The number of equipment categories included was increased, and more data on maintenance programs were collected. Data quality was improved following established "Guidelines for Data Collection" and via improved quality control. The user interface of the OREDA software was improved, and programming changes allowed it to be used as a broader-purpose tool for data collection.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (1997 edition).
* Phase IV (1993–1996)&lt;br/&gt;New software for data collection and analysis was developed, plus specific software and procedures for automatic data import and conversion. Data collected were mainly for the same equipment classes as in phase III, and the data collection was — to a greater extent than previously — carried out by the companies themselves. Data on planned maintenance were also included.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2002 edition).
* Phase V (1997–2000)&lt;br/&gt;New classes of equipment were added to the project, coinciding with a greater emphasis on the collection of subsea data. Development of a new ISO standard, "Petroleum and natural gas industries — Collection and exchange of reliability and maintenance data for equipment" was begun; ISO standard 14224 was issued in July 1999.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2002 edition).
* Phase VI (2000–2001)&lt;br/&gt;Data collection on subsea equipment and new equipment classes were prioritised. A forum for co-operation between major subsea equipment manufacturers was formed.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2009 edition).
[[File:Troll B oil platform.jpg|thumb|Troll B, the world's only semi-submersible platform made of concrete, in the [[Troll gas field]] ([[North Sea]]).]]
* Phase VII (2002–2003)&lt;br/&gt;Priority continued to be given to [[subsea (technology)|subsea]] equipment data collection. A revision of ISO 14224 was begun, with contribution from members of the OREDA project.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2009 edition).
* Phase VIII (2004–2005)&lt;br/&gt;Phase VIII mainly continued the goals and activities of phase VII. OREDA members participated in the revision of ISO 14224, issued in December 2006.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2015 edition).
* Phase IX (2006–2008)&lt;br/&gt;OREDA software and taxonomy were made consistent with [[ISO 14224]]. There was a continued focus on including worldwide safety data. In observance of OREDA's 25-year anniversary, a seminar was conducted.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Data collected in this phase are published in the ''OREDA Handbook'' (2015 edition).
* Phase X (2009–2011)&lt;br/&gt;The 5th ''OREDA Handbook'' (2009 edition) was released; new safety analysis software was developed; initial steps to SIL (safety integrity level) data based on OREDA were taken; and [[GDF Suez]] and [[Petrobras]] became associated members.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
* Phase XI (2012–2014)&lt;br/&gt;New data collection software was developed; the 6th ''OREDA Handbook'' (2015 edition) was planned; a quality assurance review of the database was conducted; a new logo was designed, as were new looks for both the ''Handbook'' and the website.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
* Phase XII (2015–2017)&lt;br/&gt;The OREDA project is in its 12th phase as of 2015. During this phase, the 6th ''OREDA Handbook'' (2015 edition) was published. A new webshop for the project has been established in collaboration with the European Safety Reliability &amp; Data Association (ESReDA).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=shop&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oreda.com/shop/ |title=OREDA — Products |website=OREDA.com |accessdate= 10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase XIII (2018-)&lt;br /&gt;From 2018 the OREDA project will enter its 13th phase. Digitalization and efficiency improvements is part of the industry and there is a  need for OREDA data as a decision support tool and as support for equipment in operation. Cost effective solutions is a focus area in the industry and in line with this trend the OREDA project will provide more efficient procedures and digitalized solutions.

==Participants==
At times companies have left or joined the project, sometimes as the result of name changes or mergers. The following table lists which companies have contributed data to the OREDA project in phases VIII, IX and XII.

==Organization==
The OREDA project's Steering Committee consists of one member and one deputy member from each of the participating companies. From these members, a [[chairperson]] is elected, and appoints a Project Manager to coordinate activities approved by the steering committee. The Project Manager is also responsible for [[data quality assurance]]. [[Det Norske Veritas]] ([[DNV]], now called [[DNV GL]]), an international certification body and classification society, served as Project Manager during phases I and II and [[SINTEF]] (Stiftelsen for INdustriell og TEknisk Forskning; "Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research" in English) during phases III–IX, after which DNV GL again took over Project Manager duties. The ''OREDA Handbook'' releases have been prepared as separate projects, but in consultation with the OREDA Steering Committee;&lt;ref name="OREDA ORDH"/&gt; the current version, 2015's 6th Edition, was prepared by SINTEF and [[Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet|NTNU]] (Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet; "Norwegian University of Science and Technology" in English),&lt;ref name=NTNU&gt;{{cite web|title=OREDA Handbook — SINTEF|url=http://www.sintef.no/prosjekter/oreda-handbook/|website=SINTEF.no|accessdate=15 September 2015|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is marketed by DNV GL.&lt;ref name=DNVshop&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbooks on safety and reliability|url=https://www.dnvgl.com/oilgas/publications/handbooks.html|website=DNVGL.com|accessdate=15 September 2015|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need==
Before the OREDA project began collecting data, "no authenticated source of failure information existed for offshore installations," and risk assessments had to be made using "generic data from onshore petroleum plants and data from other industries."&lt;ref name=Leroy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leroy|first1=A.|editor1-last=Wingender|editor1-first=Hans Jörg|title=Status of the OREDA Project|journal=Reliability Data Collection and Use in Risk and Availability Assessment: Proceedings of the 5th EuReDatA Conference|date=April 9–11, 1986|pages=38-46|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-82773-0_4|publisher=EuReDatA|location=Heidelberg, Germany|accessdate=11 September 2015|quote=Despite the considerable interest in risk and reliability engineering studies for offshore systems, no authenticated source of failure information existed for offshore installations, before 1985. It was necessary to resort to generic data from onshore petroleum plants and data from other industries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Data==
By 1996, OREDA had collated data about 24,000 pieces of equipment in use in offshore installations, and documented 33,000 equipment failures.&lt;ref name=1996paper&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langseth|first1=H.|last2=Haugen|first2=K.|last3=Sandtorv|first3=H.|title=Analysis of OREDA Data for Maintenance Optimisation|url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~helgel/papers/LangsethHaugenSandtorvRESS98.pdf|format=PDF|year=1996|publisher=SINTEF Industrial Management|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The severity of failures documented in the database are categorized as either critical, degradation, incipient, or unknown severity.&lt;ref name=1996paper/&gt;

The database contains data from almost 300 installations, over 15,000 pieces of equipment, nearly 40,000 failure records, and close to 75,000 maintenance records. Access to this data, and to the search and analysis functions of the OREDA software, is restricted to the OREDA member companies, though contractors working with member companies may be granted temporary access.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Database structure==
Data are entered by installation and by owner. Each piece of equipment (e.g. a gas turbine) constitutes a single database inventory record, which includes a technical description of the equipment, and of its environmental and operating conditions, along with all associated failure events. Every failure event is given a set of data including failure cause, date, effect, and mode. Corrective and preventive maintenance data are also included.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=OREDA — About|url=http://www.oreda.com/about-us/|website=OREDA.com|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
The OREDA software handles data acquisition, analysis and collation. Features include advanced data search, automated data transfer, quality checking, reliability analyses, a tailor-made module for subsea data which includes an event-logging tool, and the option to configure user-defined applications. It can also be used to collect internal company data.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The most current version of the software, released in concert with the 6th edition of the ''OREDA Handbook'', contains an expanded set of equipment classes, including common subsea components, subsea control systems, subsea power cables, subsea pumps, and subsea vessels.&lt;ref name="DNV GL"/&gt;

==Impact==
Use of the OREDA database has "led to significant savings in the development and operation of platforms."&lt;ref name="RAIL"/&gt;

OREDA's example has inspired the creation of similar inter-company cooperation projects in related fields, such as the SPARTA (System Performance, Availability and Reliability Trend Analysis) database created by the wind farm industry in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How shared data could help slash offshore wind costs|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2326154/how-shared-data-could-help-slash-offshore-wind-costs|website=BusinessGreen.com|accessdate=15 September 2015|date=31 January 2014|quote=Sparta was initiated in 2013 by The Crown Estate in collaboration with certification services giant DNV GL and was inspired by the offshore oil industry's long-established Offshore Reliability Database, known as Oreda.}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oil Pollution Act of 1924''' is a [[United States Statutes at Large|United States federal statute]] establishing regulations for [[Territorial waters|coastal navigable waters]] with regards to intentional [[fossil fuel]] discharges from [[Ship|seagoing vessels]]. The [[Act of Congress]] grants the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] authority to evaluate the oil [[volume]] discharge from a [[Ship transport|vessel]] while [[Risk assessment|assessing]] if coastal [[Navigability|navigable]] waters have a potential [[toxicity]] posing a deleterious condition for human health and [[seafood]] contamination. The 1924 United States statute provides judicial penalties encompassing civil and criminal punishment for violations of the prescribed regulations as stated in the Act.

The [[Bill (law)|legislation]] was passed by the 68th United States Congressional session and confirmed as a federal law by the [[Presidency of Warren G. Harding|29th President of the United States]] Warren G. Harding on June 7, 1924.

==Provisions of the Act==
The 1924 environmental law provided seven codified sections defining territorial jurisdiction for the United States [[Internal waters|inland navigable waters]].

::''33 U.S.C. § 431'' ~ Title of Act
::''33 U.S.C. § 432'' ~ Meaning of terms
::''33 U.S.C. § 433'' ~ Unlawful discharge of oil in navigable waters
::''33 U.S.C. § 434'' ~ Punishment for violation of oil discharge and liability of vessel
::''33 U.S.C. § 435'' ~ Revocation of officers licenses for violations 
::''33 U.S.C. § 436'' ~ Administration by harbor and river officers for arrest of offenders and enforcement
::''33 U.S.C. § 437'' ~ Act is an addition and not a repeal of existing navigable water laws

==Amendment and Repeal of 1924 Act==
The Clean Water Restoration Act of 1966 amended the 1924 public law requiring vessel ownerships to recover [[Environmental impact of shipping|oil discharges]] in relationship to the adjoining shorelines and navigable waters of the United States. The 1966 amendment designated the authority of the Act to the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] with a provision allowing enforcement activities by the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg1246.pdf |title=Clean Water Restoration Act of 1966 ~ P.L. 89-753 |date=November 3, 1966 |series=80 Stat. 1246 ~ Senate Bill 2947 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal statute was passed by the United States 89th Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|36th President of the United States]] Lyndon Johnson on November 3, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27987 |title= Lyndon B.

[[Myanmar]], is a [[developing country]] and an important [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]] producer in [[Asia]]. It is home to one of the world's oldest petroleum industries, with its first crude oil exports dating back to 1853.&lt;ref name="total1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://burma.total.com/myanmar-en/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar-900130.html |title=Total Myanmar - Oil and Gas in Myanmar |publisher=Burma.total.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084151/http://burma.total.com/myanmar-en/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar-900130.html |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the country is one of the major [[natural gas]] producers in the Asian continent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/393763/UKTI_Burma_-_Oil_and_Gas_Report_-_Jan_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of isolation, [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], a lack of technical capacity, opaque government policies and insufficient investment has impeded the country's efforts to develop an upstream hydrocarbon sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=bm |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Eia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent but slow political reform has led the international community to ease sanctions on Burma, giving rise to hopes of greater investment and economic growth.

==History== 
Early British explorers in Burma discovered a flourishing oil extraction industry in the town of [[Yenangyaung]] in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Longmuir, Marilyn V. "Oil in Burma: The Extraction of "Earth Oil" to 1914". Bangkok: White Lotus (2001) {{ISBN|974-7534-60-6}} pp.329&lt;/ref&gt; The area had hundreds of hand-dug oil wells under the hereditary control of 24 Burmese families. 

[[British Burma]] exported its first barrel of [[crude oil]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=khiggins |url=http://www.spe.org/jpt/article/5674-presidents-column-18/ |title=Journal of Petroleum Technology - Focus on Myanmar |publisher=Spe.org |date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London]]-based [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]] (BOC) was established in 1871 and began production in the Yenangyaung field in 1887 and the Chauk field in 1902. BOC enjoyed a [[monopoly]] in the sector until 1901, when the American [[Standard Oil Company]] launched operations in Burma.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Oil supplies largely met the demand of [[British India]]. Prior to [[World War II]] and the [[Japanese invasion of Burma]], oil production stood at 6.5 million barrels annually.&lt;ref name="myanmar-oilgas1"&gt;http://www.myanmar-oilgas.com/OilGas/media/Site_Images/Day-2-AM-1-EPD-Petroleum-Sector-Prospects.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After independence in 1948, Burma continued to be one of the more prosperous nations in Asia due to its petroleum industry and agricultural exports. 

In 1963, the socialist military government led by [[Ne Win]] [[nationalize]]d the sector, causing decades of economic stagnation.&lt;ref name="total1"/&gt;

After 1989, the military junta began opening up the country to more foreign investment. [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] discovered the Apyauk gas field 50 kilometres northwest of [[Yangon]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/1995/06/20/000009265_3961019114742/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status== 
Myanmar is today primarily a [[natural gas]] producer. As of 2015, Myanmar exports gas to [[Thailand]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Myanmar had proven gas reserves of 10 trillion cubic feet in 2012, with an annual production capacity of 416 BcF.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Oil reserves in 2013 numbered at 50 million barrels, with a production capacity of 21,000 bbl/d.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"/&gt; The Yenangyaung oil field continues to be in operation. 

The country has classified 51 onshore blocks and 53 offshore blocks, including 26 deep water blocks, for oil and gas exploration.&lt;ref name="myanmar-oilgas1"/&gt; 

The National Energy Management Committee regulates the sector under the [[Ministry of Energy (Myanmar)|Ministry of Energy]]. The industry consists of three key state players:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; 

* [[Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise]], created in 1963; responsible for exploration, production and domestic gas transmission through a 1,200-mile onshore pipeline network.
* Myanma Petrochemicals Enterprise, operates small refineries and fertilizer plants 
* Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise, responsible for retail and wholesale distribution of petroleum products

Major international oil companies (IOCs) engaged in Myanmar include [[Total S.A.]], the [[Essar Group]], [[CNOOC]], [[Petronas]] and [[Sinopec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/06/uk-myanmar-oil-fb-idUKTRE8050F220120106 |title=Factbox - Myanmar's oil and gas sector, one of world's oldest &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2012-01-06 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local companies such as Parami Energy Group and MPRL are some who are leading players in this field. According to [[Kwong Weng Yap]], Chief Operating Officer of Parami, he said in a speech to the [[ASEAN]] community that the Myanmar oil and gas industry requires a clean government and local inclusion for it to be sustainable in the near term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parami.com/news/coo-speaks-at-asean-energy-business-forum/ |title=Factbox - Myanmar's oil and gas industry; ASEAN Energy Business Forum |date=2015-06-11 |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The downstream distribution network in Myanmar remains very under-developed.

'''''Orpheus''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Orphée'''}}; also the title used in the UK) is a 1950 French film directed by [[Jean Cocteau]] and starring [[Jean Marais]]. It is the central part of Cocteau's [[Orphic Trilogy]], which consists of ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), ''Orpheus'' (1950) and ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960).

==Plot==
Set in contemporary [[Paris]], the story of the film is a variation of the classic [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Orpheus]]. The picture begins with Orpheus (Marais), a famous poet, visiting the Café des Poètes. At the same time, a Princess (Casares) and Cégeste ({{ill|Édouard Dermit|fr}}), a handsome young poet whom she supports, arrive. The drunken Cégeste starts a brawl. When the police arrive and attempt to take Cégeste into custody, he breaks free and flees, only to be run down by two motorcycle riders. The Princess has the police place Cégeste into her car in order to "transport him to the hospital". She also orders Orpheus into the car in order to act as a witness. Once in the car, Orpheus discovers Cégeste is dead and that the Princess is not going to the hospital. Instead, they drive to a chateau (the landscape through the car windows is presented in negative) accompanied by the two motorcycle riders as abstract poetry plays on the radio. This takes the form of seemingly meaningless messages, like those broadcast to the [[French Resistance]] from London during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation]].

At the ruined chateau, the Princess reanimates Cégeste into a zombie-like state, and she, Cégeste, and the two motorcycle riders (the Princess' henchmen) disappear into a mirror, leaving Orpheus alone. He wakes in a desolate landscape, where he stumbles on the Princess' chauffeur, Heurtebise (Périer), who has been waiting for Orpheus to arrive. Heurtebise drives Orpheus home where Orpheus' pregnant wife, [[Eurydice]] (Marie Déa), a police inspector, and Eurydice's friend Aglaonice, (head of the "League of Women," and apparently in love with Eurydice), discuss Orpheus' mysterious disappearance. When Orpheus comes home, he refuses to explain the details of the previous night despite the questions which linger over the fate of Cégeste, whose body cannot be found. Orpheus invites Heurtebise to live in his house and to store the Rolls in Orpheus' garage, should the Princess return. Eurydice attempts to tell Orpheus that she is with child, but is silenced when he rebuffs her.

While Heurtebise falls in love with Eurydice, Orpheus becomes obsessed with listening to the abstract poetry which only comes through the Rolls' radio, and it is revealed that the Princess is apparently Death (or one of the suborders of Death). But note that Cocteau himself commented on such interpretation:

"Among the misconceptions which have been written about Orphée, I still see Heurtebise described as an angel and the Princess as Death.
In the film, there is no Death and no angel. There can be none. Heurtebise is a young Death serving in one of the numerous sub-orders of Death, and the Princess is no more Death than an air hostess is an angel.
I never touch on dogmas. The region that I depict is a border on life, a no man's land where one hovers between life and death."&lt;ref name="criterion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/13-orpheus|title=Orpheus|website=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Eurydice is killed by Death's henchmen, Heurtebise proposes to lead Orpheus through the Zone (depicted as a ruined city – actually the ruins of [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] military academy) into the Underworld in order to reclaim her. Orpheus reveals that he may have fallen in love with Death who has visited him in his dreams. Heurtebise asks Orpheus which woman he will betray: Death or Eurydice? Orpheus enters the afterlife by donning a pair of surgical gloves left behind by the Princess after Eurydice's death.

In the Underworld, Orpheus finds as a plaintiff before a tribunal which interrogates all parties involved in the death of Eurydice. The tribunal declares that Death has illegally claimed Eurydice, and they return Eurydice to life, with one condition: Orpheus may not look upon her for the rest of his life on pain of losing her again. Orpheus agrees and returns home with Eurydice. They are accompanied by Heurtebise, who has been assigned by the tribunal to assist the couple in adapting to their new, restrictive, life together.

Eurydice visits the garage where Orpheus constantly listens to the Rolls' radio in search of the unknown poetry. She sits in the backseat. When Orpheus glances at her in the mirror, Eurydice disappears. A mob from the Café des Poètes (stirred to action by Aglaonice) arrives in order to extract vengeance from Orpheus for what they suppose to be his part in the murder of Cégeste. Orpheus confronts them, armed with a pistol given to him by Heurtebise, but is disarmed and shot. Orpheus dies and finds himself in the Underworld. This time, he declares his love to Death who has decided to herself die in order that he might become an "immortal poet". The tribunal this time sends Orpheus and Eurydice back to the living world with no memories of the previous events. Orpheus learns that he is to be a father, and his life begins anew. Death and Heurtebise, meanwhile, walk through the ruins of the Underworld towards an unspecified but unpleasant fate.

==Interpretation==

In addition to Cocteau's remarks quoted above, he writes further in ''The Art of Cinema'' (1992):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The three basic themes of ''Orphée'' are:
#The successive deaths through which a poet must pass before he becomes, in that admirable line from Mallarmé, tel qu'en lui-même enfin l'éternité le change—changed into himself at last by eternity.
#The theme of immortality: the person who represents Orphée's Death sacrifices herself and abolishes herself to make the poet immortal.
#Mirrors: we watch ourselves grow old in mirrors. They bring us closer to death.

The other themes are a mixture of Orphic and modern myth: for example, cars that talk (the radio receivers in cars).

''Orphée'' is a realistic film; or, to be more precise, observing [[Goethe]]'s distinction between reality and truth, a film in which I express a truth peculiar to myself. If that truth is not the spectator's, and if his personality conflicts with mine and rejects it, he accuses me of lying. I am even astonished that so many people can still be penetrated by another's ideas, in a country noted for its individualism.

While ''Orphée'' does encounter some lifeless audiences, it also encounters others that are open to my dream and agree to be put to sleep and to dream it with me (accepting the logic by which dreams operate, which is implacable, although it is not governed by our logic).

I am only talking about the mechanics, since ''Orphée'' is not at all a dream in itself: through a wealth of detail similar to that which we find in dreams, it summarizes my way of living and my conception of life."&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
In 2000, critic [[Roger Ebert]] added ''Orpheus'' to his "Great Films" list, praising the simple but ingenious special effects, and writing: "Seeing ''Orpheus'' today is like glimpsing a cinematic realm that has passed completely from the scene. Films are rarely made for purely artistic reasons, experiments are discouraged, and stars as big as Marais are not cast in eccentric remakes of Greek myths. The story in Cocteau's hands becomes unexpectedly complex; we see that it is not simply about love, death and jealousy, but also about how art can seduce the artist away from ordinary human concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-orpheus-1949|title=''Orpheus'' Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1949)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Jean-Pierre Aumont]] says Cocteau wrote the film for him and his then-wife [[Maria Montez]] but then decided to make it with other actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sun and Shadow: an Autobiography|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Aumont|year=1977|pages=131–132|publisher=W.W. Aumont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
In 1993, [[Philip Glass]] adapted the film as a stage opera, ''[[Orphée (Glass)|Orphée]]'', with a [[libretto]] by the composer taken directly from Cocteau's screenplay. Jointly commissioned by the [[American Repertory Theatre]] and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], the work had its premiere on May 14, 1993, at the American Repertory Theater.

[[Francesca Zambello]] directed the premiere, and the production, closely based on the imagery of the film, was by frequent Glass collaborator [[Robert Israel (composer)|Robert Israel]].

The stratigraphy is detected by [[radio-echo sounding]]. The Raymond effect arises from the unusual flow properties of [[ice]]. It is of importance because it provides field evidence for the flow properties of ice. In addition, it permits dating of changes in ice flow and the establishment of changes in ice thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conway |first=H. |author2=B. Hall |author3=G. Denton |author4=A.

Ice [[viscosity]] is [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]-dependent, and in zones where the (deviatoric) stresses are low, the viscosity becomes very high. Near the base of ice-sheets, stress is proportional to the surface slope, at least when averaged over a suitable horizontal distance. At the flow divide, the surface slope is zero, implying that near the base of the ice-sheet, the viscosity increases. This diverts ice flow laterally, and is the cause of the characteristic anticlines, which are in effect draped over the high viscosity area.

In spite of its shortcomings, the [[Bohr model]] of the atom is useful in explaining these properties. Classically, an electron in a circular orbit of radius ''r'', about a hydrogen [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of charge +''[[Elementary charge|e]]'', obeys [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a} \Rightarrow { ke^2 \over r^2}={mv^2 \over r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 1/(4π[[Permittivity of free space|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

Orbital momentum is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] in units of ''[[Reduced Planck constant|ħ]]'':

:&lt;math&gt; mvr=n\hbar &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining these two equations leads to [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]'s expression for the orbital radius in terms of the [[principal quantum number]], ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt; r={n^2\hbar^2 \over ke^2m}. &lt;/math&gt;

It is now apparent why Rydberg atoms have such peculiar properties: the radius of the orbit scales as ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the ''n'' = 137 state of hydrogen has an atomic radius ~1&amp;nbsp;µm) and the geometric cross-section as ''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus Rydberg atoms are extremely large with loosely bound [[Valence shell|valence]] electrons, easily perturbed or [[Ionization potential|ionized]] by collisions or external fields.

Because the [[binding energy]] of a Rydberg electron is proportional to 1/''r'' and hence falls off like 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the energy level spacing falls off like 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; leading to ever more closely spaced levels converging on the first [[ionization energy]].  These closely spaced Rydberg states form what is commonly referred to as the ''Rydberg series''.  '''Figure 2''' shows some of the energy levels of the lowest three values of [[Azimuthal quantum number|orbital angular momentum]] in [[lithium]].

== History ==
&lt;!--[[File:Rydberg-Physicist(1854-1919).jpg|thumb|Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg.]]--&gt;
The existence of the Rydberg series was first demonstrated in 1885 when [[Johann Balmer]] discovered a [[Balmer series#Balmer's formula|simple empirical formula]] for the [[wavelength]]s of light associated with transitions in atomic [[hydrogen]].  Three years later, the Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] presented a generalized and more intuitive version of Balmer's formula that came to be known as the [[Rydberg formula]].  This formula indicated the existence of an infinite series of ever more closely spaced discrete [[energy level]]s converging on a finite limit.&lt;ref name="Rydberg"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=1|author=I. Martinson|author2=L. J. Curtis|last-author-amp=yes |title=Janne Rydberg – his life and work |journal=[[Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B]] |volume=235 |issue=1–4 |pages=17–22 |date=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.nimb.2005.03.137|bibcode = 2005NIMPB.235...17M |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/1613803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was qualitatively explained in 1913 by [[Niels Bohr]] with his [[Bohr model|semiclassical model]] of the hydrogen atom in which [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] values of angular momentum lead to the observed discrete energy levels.&lt;ref name="Bohr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/bohr.html |title=The Bohr Model |accessdate=2009-11-25 |date=2000-08-10 |website= |publisher=[[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BohrNobelLecture"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/bohr-lecture.pdf |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Structure of the Atom |accessdate=2018-11-16 |date=1922-12-11 |website= |publisher=Nobel Lecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A full quantitative derivation of the observed spectrum was derived by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1926 following development of [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and others.

== Methods of production ==

The only truly stable state of a [[hydrogen-like atom]] is the ground state with ''n'' = 1. The study of Rydberg states requires a reliable technique for exciting ground state atoms to states with a large value of ''n''.

=== Electron impact excitation ===

Much early experimental work on Rydberg atoms relied on the use of collimated beams of fast electrons incident on ground-state atoms.&lt;ref name="Electron impact"&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. Olmsted |title=Excitation of nitrogen triplet states by electron impact |journal=[[Radiation Research]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=191–200 |date=1967 |jstor=3572319 |doi= 10.2307/3572319|pmid=6025857|bibcode=1967RadR...31..191O }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Inelastic scattering]] processes can use the electron [[kinetic energy]] to increase the atoms' internal energy exciting to a broad range of different states including many high-lying Rydberg states,

:&lt;math&gt; e^- + A \rarr A^* + e^- &lt;/math&gt;.

Because the electron can retain any arbitrary amount of its initial kinetic energy, this process always results in a population with a broad spread of different energies.

=== Charge exchange excitation ===

Another mainstay of early Rydberg atom experiments relied on charge exchange between a beam of [[ion]]s and a population of neutral atoms of another species, resulting in the formation of a beam of highly excited atoms,&lt;ref name="Charge exchange"&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Haugh |title=Electronic excitation accompanying charge exchange |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=837–839 |date=1966 |doi=10.1063/1.1726773|bibcode = 1966JChPh..44..837H |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |author2=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A^+ + B \rarr A^* + B^+ &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, because the kinetic energy of the interaction can contribute to the final internal energies of the constituents, this technique populates a broad range of energy levels.

=== Optical excitation ===

The arrival of tunable [[dye laser]]s in the 1970s allowed a much greater level of control over populations of excited atoms. In optical excitation, the incident [[photon]] is absorbed by the target atom, absolutely specifying the final state energy.  The problem of producing single state, mono-energetic populations of Rydberg atoms thus becomes the somewhat simpler problem of precisely controlling the frequency of the laser output,

:&lt;math&gt; A + \gamma \rarr A^*&lt;/math&gt;.

This form of direct optical excitation is generally limited to experiments with the [[alkali metal]]s, because the ground state [[binding energy]] in other species is generally too high to be accessible with most laser systems.

For atoms with a large [[valence electron]] [[binding energy]] (equivalent to a large first [[ionization energy]]), the excited states of the Rydberg series are inaccessible with conventional laser systems.  Initial collisional excitation can make up the energy shortfall allowing optical excitation to be used to select the final state.  Although the initial step excites to a broad range of intermediate states, the precision inherent in the optical excitation process means that the laser light only interacts with a specific subset of atoms in a particular state, exciting to the chosen final state.

== Hydrogenic potential ==
{{main|Hydrogen atom}}
[[File:CorePolarizationPotential.svg|thumb|right|'''Figure 3'''. A comparison of the potential in a hydrogen atom with that in a Rydberg state of a different atom. A large core polarizability has been used in order to make the effect clear. The black curve is the Coulombic 1/''r'' potential of the hydrogen atom while the dashed red curve includes the 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; term due to polarization of the ion core.]]

An atom in a [[Rydberg states|Rydberg state]] has a [[Valence shell|valence]] electron in a large orbit far from the ion core; in such an orbit, the outermost electron feels an almost [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogenic]], Coulomb [[potential well|potential]], ''U''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; from a compact ion core consisting of a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] with [[Atomic number|''Z'']] [[proton]]s and the lower electron shells filled with ''Z''-1 electrons.  An electron in the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential has potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{C} = -\dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}&lt;/math&gt;.

The similarity of the effective potential “seen” by the outer electron to the hydrogen potential is a defining characteristic of [[Rydberg states]] and explains why the electron wavefunctions approximate to classical orbits in the limit of the [[correspondence principle]].&lt;ref name="Hezell192"&gt;{{cite journal |author=T. P. Hezel |title=Classical view of the properties of Rydberg atoms: Application of the correspondence principle |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=329–335 |date=1992 |doi=10.1119/1.16876|bibcode = 1992AmJPh..60..329H |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |author2=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the electron's orbit resembles the orbit of planets inside a solar system, similar to what was seen in the obsolete but visually useful [[Bohr model|Bohr]] and [[Rutherford model|Rutherford]] models of the atom.

There are three notable exceptions that can be characterized by the additional term added to the potential energy:

*An atom may have two (or more) electrons in highly excited states with comparable orbital radii.  In this case, the electron-electron interaction gives rise to a significant deviation from the hydrogen potential.&lt;ref name="Double"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=1|author=I. K. Dmitrieva|author2=G. I. Plindov|last-author-amp=yes |title=Energies of Doubly Excited States.

:&lt;math&gt;U_{ee} = \dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{i &lt; j}\dfrac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}&lt;/math&gt;.

*If the valence electron has very low angular momentum (interpreted classically as an extremely [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentric]] elliptical orbit), then it may pass close enough to polarise the ion core, giving rise to a 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; core polarization term in the potential.&lt;ref name="Polarization"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=1|author=L. Neale|author2=M. Wilson|last-author-amp=yes |title=Core Polarization in Kr VIII |date=1995 |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=4272–4275 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.51.4272|pmid=9912104|bibcode = 1995PhRvA..51.4272N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interaction between an [[Polarizability|induced]] [[Electric dipole moment|dipole]] and the charge that produces it is always attractive so this contribution is always negative,

:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{pol} = -\dfrac{e^2\alpha_\text{d}}{(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2r^4}&lt;/math&gt;,

:where α&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the dipole [[polarizability]].  '''Figure 3''' shows how the polarization term modifies the potential close to the nucleus.

*If the outer electron penetrates the inner electron shells, it will “see” more of the charge of the nucleus and hence experience a greater force.  In general, the modification to the potential energy is not simple to calculate and must be based on knowledge of the geometry of the ion core.&lt;ref name="Core penetration"&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. E. Theodosiou |title=Evaluation of penetration effects in high-''l'' Rydberg states |date=1983 |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=3098–3101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.28.3098|bibcode = 1983PhRvA..28.3098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quantum-mechanical details ==
[[File:Sommerfeld ellipses.svg|thumb|right|'''Figure 4'''. Semiclassical orbits for ''n''=5 with all allowed values of orbital angular momentum. The black spot denotes the position of the atomic nucleus.]]

Quantum-mechanically, a state with abnormally high ''n'' refers to an atom in which the valence electron(s) have been excited into a formerly unpopulated [[Atomic orbital|electron orbital]] with higher energy and lower [[binding energy]].  In hydrogen the binding energy is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{B} = -\dfrac{Ry}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''Ry'' = 13.6 [[electron volt|eV]] is the [[Rydberg constant]].  The low binding energy at high values of ''n'' explains why Rydberg states are susceptible to ionization.

Additional terms in the potential energy expression for a Rydberg state, on top of the hydrogenic Coulomb potential energy require the introduction of a [[quantum defect]],&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; δ&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, into the expression for the binding energy:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{B} = -\dfrac{Ry}{(n-\delta_l)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Electron wavefunctions ===

The long lifetimes of Rydberg states with high orbital angular momentum can be explained in terms of the overlapping of wavefunctions. The wavefunction of an electron in a high ''l'' state (high angular momentum, “circular orbit”) has very little overlap with the wavefunctions of the inner electrons and hence remains relatively unperturbed.

The three exceptions to the definition of a Rydberg atom as an atom with a hydrogenic potential, have an alternative, quantum mechanical description that can be characterized by the additional term(s) in the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]:

*If a second electron is excited into a state ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', energetically close to the state of the outer electron ''n&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', then its wavefunction becomes almost as large as the first (a double Rydberg state). This occurs as ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' approaches ''n&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' and leads to a condition where the size of the two electron’s orbits are related;&lt;ref name="Double"/&gt; a condition sometimes referred to as ''radial correlation''.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;  An electron-electron repulsion term must be included in the atomic Hamiltonian.
*Polarization of the ion core produces an [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] potential that causes an ''angular correlation'' between the motions of the two outermost electrons.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angular correlation"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=1|author=T. A. Heim|author2=A. R. P. Rau|last-author-amp=yes

A core polarization term must be included in the atomic Hamiltonian.
*The wavefunction of the outer electron in states with low orbital angular momentum ''l'', is periodically localised within the shells of inner electrons and interacts with the full charge of the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Core penetration"/&gt;  '''Figure 4''' shows a [[Old quantum theory|semi-classical]] interpretation of angular momentum states in an electron orbital, illustrating that low-''l'' states pass closer to the nucleus potentially penetrating the ion core.  A core penetration term must be added to the atomic Hamiltonian.

}}

The large separation between the electron and ion-core in a Rydberg atom makes possible an extremely large [[electric dipole moment]], '''d'''.  There is an energy associated with the presence of an electric dipole in an [[electric field]], '''F''', known in atomic physics as a [[Stark effect|Stark shift]],

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{S} = -\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{F}.&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the sign of the projection of the dipole moment onto the local electric field vector, a state may have energy that increases or decreases with field strength (low-field and high-field seeking states respectively).  The narrow spacing between adjacent ''n''-levels in the Rydberg series means that states can approach [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] even for relatively modest field strengths.  The theoretical field strength at which a crossing would occur assuming no coupling between the states is given by the [[Inglis-Teller Equation|Inglis-Teller limit]],&lt;ref name="Inglis-Teller"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=1|author=D.R.

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{IT} = \dfrac{e}{12\pi\varepsilon_0a_0^2n^5}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[hydrogen atom]], the pure 1/''r'' Coulomb potential does not couple Stark states from adjacent ''n''-manifolds resulting in real crossings as shown in '''figure 5'''.  The presence of additional terms in the potential energy can lead to coupling resulting in avoided crossings as shown for [[lithium]] in '''figure 6'''.

=== Investigating diamagnetic effects ===

The large sizes and low binding energies of Rydberg atoms lead to a high [[magnetic susceptibility]], &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;. As diamagnetic effects scale with the area of the orbit and the area is proportional to the radius squared (''A'' ∝ ''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), effects impossible to detect in ground state atoms become obvious in Rydberg atoms, which demonstrate very large diamagnetic shifts.&lt;ref name="Diamagnetic"&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.

=== In plasmas ===

Rydberg atoms form commonly in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s due to the recombination of electrons and positive ions; low energy recombination results in fairly stable Rydberg atoms, while recombination of electrons and positive ions with high [[kinetic energy]] often form [[Ionization potential|autoionising]] Rydberg states. Rydberg atoms’ large sizes and susceptibility to perturbation and ionisation by electric and magnetic fields, are an important factor determining the properties of plasmas.&lt;ref name="Plasma"&gt;{{cite journal |author=G. Vitrant |title=Rydberg to plasma evolution in a dense gas of very excited atoms |journal=[[Journal of Physics B]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=L49–L55 |date=1982 |doi= 10.1088/0022-3700/15/2/004|bibcode = 1982JPhB...15L..49V |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |last2=Raimond |first2=J M |last3=Gross |first3=M |last4=Haroche |first4=S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condensation of Rydberg atoms forms [[Rydberg matter]], most often observed in form of long-lived clusters. The de-excitation is significantly impeded in Rydberg matter by exchange-correlation effects in the non-uniform electron liquid formed on condensation by the collective valence electrons, which causes extended lifetime of clusters.&lt;ref name="Matter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.

Since the density within interstellar gas clouds is many [[orders of magnitude]] lower than the best laboratory vacuums attainable on Earth, Rydberg states could persist for long periods of time without being destroyed by collisions.

=== Strongly interacting systems ===

Due to their large size, Rydberg atoms can exhibit very large [[electric dipole moment]]s. Calculations using [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] show that this results in strong interactions between two close Rydberg atoms. Coherent control of these interactions combined with their relatively long lifetime makes them a suitable candidate to realize a [[quantum computer]].&lt;ref name="Jaksch gate"&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.

A simple 1/''r'' potential results in a closed [[Planetary orbit|Keplerian elliptical orbit]].  In the presence of an external [[electric field]] Rydberg atoms can obtain very large [[electric dipole moment]]s making them extremely susceptible to perturbation by the field.  '''Figure 7''' shows how application of an external electric field (known in atomic physics as a [[Stark effect|Stark]] field) changes the geometry of the potential, dramatically changing the behaviour of the electron.  A Coulombic potential does not apply any [[torque]] as the force is always [[antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] to the position vector (always pointing along a line running between the electron and the nucleus):

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{\tau}|=|\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}|=|\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{F}|\sin\theta &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\theta=\pi \Rightarrow \mathbf{\tau}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

With the application of a static electric field, the electron feels a continuously changing torque.

The time period of the oscillation in angular momentum (the time to complete the trajectory in '''figure 8'''), almost exactly matches the quantum mechanically predicted period for the wavefunction to return to its initial state, demonstrating the classical nature of the Rydberg atom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9328">'''Spontaneous potential (SP)''', also called '''self potential''', is a naturally occurring [[Electric potential|electric potential difference]] in the Earth, measured by an electrode relative to a fixed reference electrode. Spontaneous potentials are often [[Well logging|measured down boreholes]] for [[formation evaluation]] in the oil and gas industry, and they can also be measured along the Earth's surface for [[mineral exploration]] or [[groundwater]] investigation. The phenomenon and its application to [[geology]] was first recognized by [[Conrad Schlumberger]], Marcel Schlumberger, and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Romanian oil fields.

==Physics==
Spontaneous potentials (SP) are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, due to presence of semi-permeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid through the rocks.

The origin of SP across formation can be attributed to two processes involving the movement of ions:
# [[Streaming potential]] (''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;)
# [[Electrochemical potential]] (''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Streaming potential''' originates from the flow of an electrolyte (water) over naturally charged solids (i.e., surfaces that acquired [[electrokinetic potential|electrokinetic]] or ''zeta'' potential). The streaming potential appears when [[mud filtrate]] is forced into the formation under the differential pressure between mud column and formation. The streaming potential is produced when the flow takes place across mud-cake in front of permeable formations, across permeable formations being invaded, and across shale beds. It is generally accepted that the streaming potential across the mud-cake is compensated by that across the shale. As such, in most cases, the spontaneous potential measured is only related to the electrochemical potential.

'''Electrochemical potential''' (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of liquid junction or diffusion potential (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;), and membrane potential (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;)
[[image:SP MembraneAndLiquidJunctionPotential, small.png|thumb|Fig1: Electrochemical Potential: Liquid junction &amp; membrane potential]]
Liquid junction potential is established at the direct contact of the mud filtrate and formation water at the edge of the invaded formation. Ions Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; diffuse from either solution to the other, but at different rate due to different mobilities. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tends to be less mobile due to its affinity for water molecules. 

: ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/a&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt;)
where: 
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.6 mV at 25 °C
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = formation water ionic activity
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; = mud filtrate ionic activity

Membrane Potential develops when two electrolytes of different ionic concentrations, such as mud and formation water, are separated by shale. The clay minerals in shale are usually made up of atom Al, Si, and O. O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy the outer layer and cause a net negative charge. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from solution are attracted and allowed to pass through the shale, while Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions are repelled. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions will migrate between the two solutions, with a net influx from the more saline to the less. 

: ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/''a''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt;)
where: 
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.3 ''RT''/''F'', where:
::''R'' = ideal gas constant
::''T'' = absolute temperature in kelvins
::''F'' = Faraday constant
::''a''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = formation water ionic activity
::''a''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; = mud filtrate ionic activity

The total electrochemical potential is thus summarized as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K'' log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/''a''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt;)

Since spontaneous potential is a measure of electrochemical potential  and the ionic activity of a solution is inversely proportional to its resistivity, the above equation can be simplified as SP = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K'' log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;we&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;we&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalent mud filtrate resistivity and equivalent formation water resistivity respectively. 

The ideal spontaneous potential across clean bed is known as Static SP (SSP), and defined as follow:

:SSP = −''K'' log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;we&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Applications in Boreholes==
The most useful SP component is the electrochemical potential, since it can cause a significant deflection opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of the deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between borehole and formation fluid, and the clay content of the permeable bed. The SP log is therefore useful in detecting permeable beds and to estimate formation water salinity and formation clay content. Due to the nature of the [[electric current]], SP can only be recorded in conductive mud.

===Determination of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;===

As established earlier, static SP is defined as follow:

:SSP = −''K'' log (''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;we&lt;/sub&gt;)

Static SP (SSP) can be obtained directly from the SP curve if the bed is clean, thick, porous, permeable, and only moderately invaded. When these conditions are not met, the recorded SP will need to be corrected. Various correction charts are available for this purpose. 

To convert the measured mud filtrate resistivity ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; into an equivalent mud filtrate resistivity ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt;, the following rules are employed:
* If ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; at 75 °F is greater than 0.1 [[ohm|Ω]]·[[meter|m]], use ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.85 ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; at formation temperature.
* If ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; at 75 °F is less than 0.1 Ω·m, derive ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mfe&lt;/sub&gt; from ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt; using Schlumberger Chart SP-2 or equivalent.

Schlumberger Chart SP-2 can then be used to convert ''R''&lt;sub&gt;we&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain ''R''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Applications on the surface==
Electrodes can be placed on the ground surface to map relative changes in the SP value (in [[volt|millivolts]], or mV), typically with the goal of identifying the path of [[groundwater]] flow in the subsurface, or [[seepage]] from an earthen [[dam]].  A [[voltmeter]] measures the voltage between a fixed liquid-junction electrode and a mobile one (rover), which is moved along a dam face or over an area of investigation to collect multiple readings.  Anomalies observed may indicate groundwater movement or seepage.&lt;ref&gt;Corwin, R. F., 1990, The self-potential method for environmental and engineering applications, in Ward, S. H., editor, Geotechnical and Environmental Geophysics, Volume I: Review and Tutorial, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Tulsa, OK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
SP can be affected by several factors that complicates the interpretation. Beside petrochemical component, SP is also affected by electrokinetic potential and bimetallism. Besides, SP is also affected by the following factors:
* Bed thickness (''h''); Since SP is a measurement of electrical potential produced by current in the mud, its amplitude approaches the SSP value only when the resistance to current due to formation and adjacent beds is negligible compared with that of the mud. This condition is met only in thick bed. In thin beds, the SP is proportionally reduced.
* True resistivity (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;) of permeable bed; As ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; increases, the SP deflection decreases, and the bed boundaries are less sharply defined. Presence of hydrocarbons also attenuates SP.
* Resistivity of invaded zone (''R''&lt;sub&gt;xo&lt;/sub&gt;) and mud resistivity (''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;); SP increases with increase of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;xo&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
* Diameter of invasion (''d''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;); SP decreases as invasion deepens
* Ratio of mud filtrate to formation water salinities: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;mf&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;
* Neighbouring shale resistivity (''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;); SP increases with increase of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
* Hole diameter (''d''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;); With increasing hole size, the value of SP is reduced

==Measurement technique==
Spontaneous potential can be measured by placing one probe of a [[voltmeter]] at the Earth's surface (called surface electrode) and the other probe in the borehole (called downhole electrode), where the SP is to be measured. In fact, logging tools employ exactly this method. Since this measurement is relatively simple, usually SP downhole electrode is built into other logging tools.

The streamers form at the end of a pointed rod projecting from the terminal.  The high electric field at the pointed end causes the air to ionize there.  ]]

A '''streamer discharge''', also known as ''filamentary discharge'', is a type of transient [[electrical discharge]]. Streamer discharges can form when an insulating medium (for example air) is exposed to a large [[voltage|potential difference]]. When the [[electric field]] created by the applied voltage is sufficiently large, accelerated [[electron]]s strike air [[molecule]]s with enough energy to knock other electrons off them, [[ionization|ionizing]] them, and the freed electrons go on to strike more molecules in a chain reaction.  These [[electron avalanche]]s (Townsend discharges) create ionized, electrically conductive regions in the air near the electrode creating the electric field.  The [[space charge]] created by the electron avalanches gives rise to an additional electric field.
This field can enhance the growth of new avalanches in a particular direction.
Then the [[ionization|ionized]] region grows quickly in that direction, forming a finger-like discharge called a ''streamer''.

Streamers are transient (exist only for a short time) and filamentary, which makes them different from [[corona discharge]]s. They are used in applications such as ozone production, air purification or plasma medicine. Streamers pave the way for [[Electric arc|arcs]] and [[lightning]] [[leader (spark)|leader]]s, in which the ionized paths created by streamers are heated by large currents. Streamers can also be observed as [[sprite (lightning)|sprites]] in the upper atmosphere. Due to the low pressure, sprites are much larger than streamers at ground pressure, see the [[#Similarity laws|similarity laws]] below.

== History ==
The theory of streamer discharges was preceded by [[John Sealy Townsend]]'s [[Townsend discharge|discharge theory]]&lt;ref name="Townsend1900"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=J. S.|title=The Conductivity produced in Gases by the Motion of Negatively–charged Ions|journal=Nature|volume=62|issue=1606|year=1900|pages=340–341|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/062340b0|bibcode = 1900Natur..62..340T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
from around 1900.
However, it became clear that this theory was sometimes inconsistent with observations.
This was especially true for discharges that were longer or at higher pressure.
In 1939, Loeb&lt;ref name="Loeb1939"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Benedict Loeb|title=Fundamental processes of electrical discharge in gases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3LPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 August 2012|year=1939|publisher=J.

independently described a new type of discharge, based on their experimental observations.
Shortly thereafter, in 1940, Meek presented the ''theory of spark discharge'',&lt;ref name="Meek1940"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meek|first1=J.|title=A Theory of Spark Discharge|journal=Physical Review|volume=57|issue=8|year=1940|pages=722–728|issn=0031-899X|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.57.722|bibcode = 1940PhRv...57..722M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
which quantitatively explained the formation of a self-propagating streamer.
This new theory of streamer discharges successfully explained the experimental observations.

== Applications ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2017}}
Streamers are used in applications such as ozone generation, air purification and plasma-assisted combustion.
An important property is that the plasma they generate is strongly non-equilibrium: the electrons have much higher energies than the ions.
Therefore, chemical reactions can be triggered in a gas without heating it.
This is important for plasma medicine, where "plasma bullets", or guided streamers, can be used for wound treatment, although this is still experimental.

== Streamer physics ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2017}}
Streamers can emerge when a strong electric field is applied to an insulating material, typically a gas.  Streamers can only form in areas where the electric field exceeds the [[dielectric strength]] (breakdown field, disruptive field) of the medium.  For air at atmospheric pressure, this is roughly 30&amp;nbsp;kV per centimeter. 
The electric field accelerates the few [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s that are always present in air, due to natural processes such as [[cosmic rays]], [[radioactive decay]], or [[photoionization]].  Ions are much heavier, so they move very slowly compared to electrons.
As the electrons move through the medium, they collide with the neutral molecules or atoms.
Important collisions are:
* [[Elastic collision]]s, which change the direction of motion of the electrons.
* [[electron excitation|Excitations]], where the neutral particle is excited, and the electron loses the corresponding energy.
* [[Impact ionization]], where the neutral particle becomes ionized, with the incident electron losing the energy.
* [[electron capture ionization|Attachment]], where the electron attaches to the neutral to form a negative ion.
When the electric field approaches the breakdown field, the electrons gain enough energy between collisions to ionize the gas atoms, knocking an electron off the atom.   At the breakdown field, there is a balance between the production of new electrons (due to impact ionization) and the loss of electrons (due to attachment).
Above the breakdown field,  the number of electrons starts to grow exponentially, and an [[electron avalanche]] ([[Townsend avalanche]]) forms.

The electron avalanches leave behind positive ions, so in time more and more [[space charge]] is building up.
(Of course, the ions move away in time, but this a relatively slow process compared to the avalanche generation).
Eventually, the electric field from all the space charge becomes comparable to the background electric field.
This is sometimes referred to as the "avalanche to streamer transition".
In some regions the total electric field will be smaller than before, but in other regions it will get larger, which is called electric field enhancement.
New avalanches predominantly grow in the high-field regions, so a self-propagating structure can emerge: a streamer.

=== Positive and negative streamers ===
There are positive and negative streamers.
Negative streamers propagate against the direction of the electric field, that is, in the same direction as the electrons [[drift velocity]].
Positive streamers propagate in the opposite direction.
In both cases, the streamer channel is electrically neutral, and it is shielded by a thin space charge layer.
This leads to an enhanced electric field at the end of the channel, the "head" of the streamer.
Both positive and negative streamers grow by impact ionization in this high-field region, but the source of electrons is very different.

For negative streamers, free electrons are accelerated from the channel to the head region.
However, for positive streamers, these free electrons have to come from farther away, as they accelerate into the streamer channel.
Therefore, negative streamers grow in a more diffuse way than positive streamers.
Because a diffuse streamer has less field enhancement, negative streamers require higher electric fields than positive streamers.
In nature and in applications, positive streamers are therefore much more common.

As noted above, an important difference is also that positive streamers need a source of free electrons for their propagation.

Most processes in a streamer discharge are two-body processes, where an electron collides with a neutral molecule.
An important example is [[impact ionization]], where an electron ionizes a neutral molecule.
Therefore, the [[mean free path]] is inversely proportional to the gas [[number density]].
If the electric field is changed linearly with the gas number density, then electrons gain on average the same energy between collisions.
In other words, if the ratio between electric field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is constant, we expect similar dynamics.
Typical lengths scale as &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;, as they are related to the mean free path.

This also motivates the [[Townsend (unit)|Townsend unit]], which is a physical unit of the &lt;math&gt;E/N&lt;/math&gt; ratio.

== Emission of run-away electrons and high-energy photons ==
It has been observed that discharges in laboratory experiments emit X-rays &lt;ref&gt;Kochkin, P., K&amp;ouml;hn, C., Ebert, U., van Deursen, L. Analyzing x-ray emissions from meter-scale negative discharges in ambient air. Plasma Sour. Sci. Technol. (2016), vol. 25, 044002&lt;/ref&gt; and that lightning discharges emit X-rays and [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es, bursts of photons with energies of up to 40 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;K&amp;ouml;hn, C., Ebert, U. Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons, and protons associated with terrestrial gamma ray flashes. J. Geophys. Res. Atmos. (2015), vol. 120, pp. 1620-1635&lt;/ref&gt; These photons are produced by [[runaway electrons]], electrons which have overcome the [[friction]] force, through the [[Bremsstrahlung]] process.&lt;ref&gt;K&amp;ouml;hn, C., Ebert, U. Angular distribution of Bremsstrahlung photons and of positrons for calculations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and positron beams. Atmos. Res. (2014), vol. 135-136, pp. 432-465&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been fully understood how electrons can gain such high energies in the first place since they constantly collide with air molecules and lose energy. A possible explanation is the acceleration of electrons in the enhanced electric fields of the streamer tips.&lt;ref&gt;Cooray, V., Arevalo, L., Rahman, M., Dwyer, J., Rassoul, H.

The '''subatomic scale''' is the domain of physical size that encompasses objects smaller than an [[atom]]. It is the scale at which the atomic constituents, such as the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] containing [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and the [[electron]]s, which orbit in spherical or elliptical paths around the nucleus, become apparent.

The subatomic scale includes the many thousands of times smaller '''subnuclear scale''', which is the scale of physical size at which constituents of the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s - particularly [[quark]]s - become apparent.

This agreement is officially known as the '''Agreement between the Government of [[Australia]] and the Government of the Democratic Republic of [[Timor-Leste]] relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour Fields'''.&lt;ref&gt;Full text of agreement available from the Australasian Legal Information Institute's Australian Treaty Series database at [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/2007/11.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sunrise International Unitisation Agreement (Sunrise IUA) was made to enable the exploitation of the Sunrise and Troubador petroleum and gas fields in the [[Timor Sea]], together known as the Greater Sunrise field.  The Greater Sunrise field straddles the border between the joint petroleum development area (JPDA) established under the [[Timor Sea Treaty]] and Australian territorial waters as determined by the 1972 seabed boundary agreement between Australia and Indonesia. Unitisation of the field would enable it to be treated as one as far as exploitation, regulation, revenue taxation, management and other purposes are concerned, giving certainty to investors by providing a financial framework and international legal basis for development of the field.

The agreement deemed 20.1% of the resources of the Greater Sunrise field as lying within the JPDA, attributing 20.1% of production from it to the JPDA and 79.9% to Australia. With East Timor getting 90% of the revenue of the JPDA, it effectively was only going to receive 18.1% of the revenue from the field. This share ratio was amended to both Australia and East Timor getting equal share of the upstream revenue from the field with the signing of the [[Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea]] (CMATS) in 2006. By virtue of this, this agreement is "read together" with CMATS and the [[Timor Sea Treaty]].

The Sunrise IUA was signed in [[Dili]], [[East Timor]] on 6 March 2003 by then Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Alexander Downer]] and [[Ana Pessoa]], East Timor's Minister of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The agreement came into force on 23 February 2007 by virtue of the coming to force of CMATS on the same day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">The '''McKendrick–von Foerster equation'''&lt;!-- Who is von Foerster? --&gt; is a linear first-order [[partial differential equation]] encountered in several areas of [[mathematical biology]] – for example,  [[cell proliferation]] modeling; it is applied when age structure is an important feature in the [[mathematical model]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;MURRAY, J.D.  Mathematical Biology: an introduction. third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[biophysics]] professor [[Heinz von Foerster]].

==Mathematical formula==
The mathematical formula can be derived from first principles. It reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial n}{\partial a}  = - m(a)n, &lt;/math&gt;

where the population density ''n''(''t'',''a'') is a function of age ''a'' and time ''t'', and ''m''(''a'') is the death function.

When ''m''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, we have:&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial n}{\partial a} &lt;/math&gt;

It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.

==Analytical solution==

The von Foerster equation is a [[transport equation]]; it can be solved using a characteristics method.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Another way is by [[similarity solution]]; and a third is a numerical approach such as [[finite differences]].

To get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added:

:&lt;math&gt; n(t,0)= \int_0^\infty b (a)n(t,a) \, da ,&lt;/math&gt;

which states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation for otherwise), and that

:&lt;math&gt; n(0,a)= f(a), \, &lt;/math&gt;

which states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.

==Similar equations==

In Sebastian Anita, Viorel Arnautu, Vincenzo Capasso. ''An Introduction to Optimal Control Problems in Life Sciences and Economics'' (Birkhouser. 2011),  this equation appears as a special case of the Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation; in the latter there is inflow, and the math is based on [[directional derivative]].

The concept of a '''vortex engine''' or '''atmospheric vortex engine''' ('''AVE'''), independently proposed by Norman Louat &lt;ref&gt;Louat's International Patent Application is PCT/AU99/00037. International publication number WO0042320 [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=20000720&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=0042320A1&amp;KC=A1]&lt;/ref&gt; and Louis M. Michaud,&lt;ref&gt;Michaud's U.S. Patent is US 2004/0112055 A1, "Atmospheric Vortex Engine"&lt;/ref&gt; aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.  The AVE induces ground-level vorticity, resulting in a vortex similar to a naturally occurring [[landspout]] or [[waterspout]].
[[Image:Experimental vortex.JPG|right|thumb|An [[Australian]] experimental atmospheric vortex using smoke as the tracer.[[Geoffrey Wickham]] ]]

Michaud's patent claims that the main application is that the air flow through the louvers at the base will drive low-speed air turbines (21), generating twenty percent additional electric power from the heat normally wasted by conventional power plants.  That is, the vortex engine's proposed main application is as a "[[bottoming cycle]]" for large power plants that need cooling towers.

The application proposed by Louat in his patent claims is to provide a less-expensive alternative to a physical [[solar updraft tower]].  In this application, the heat is provided by a large area of ground heated by the sun and covered by a transparent surface that traps hot air, in the manner of a [[greenhouse]]. A vortex is created by deflecting vanes set at an angle relative to the tangent of the outer radius of the [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]]. Louat estimated that the minimum diameter of the solar collector would need to be 44+ metres in order to collect "useful energy".  A similar proposal is to eliminate the transparent cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vortexengine.ca/ Atmospheric Vortex Engine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme would drive the chimney-vortex with warm seawater or warm air from the ambient surface layer of the earth.  In this application, the application strongly resembles a [[dust devil]] with an air-turbine in the center.

Since 2000, Croatian researcher from the ''Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture'' ([[University of Split]]) such as Ninic and Nizetic also work on this technology, publishing paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sandro Nizetic | title=Technical utilisation of convective vortices for carbon-free electricity production: A review | journal=Energy | volume=36 | issue=2 | date=2011 | pages=1236–1242 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.11.021 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421000647X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and patents.&lt;ref&gt;Ninic Patent is HRP20000385 (A2), published in 2002, title: "SOLAR POWER PLANT INCLUDING A GRAVITATIONAL AIR VORTEX" [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=HR&amp;NR=P20000385A2&amp;KC=A2&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=4&amp;date=20020228&amp;DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;locale=en_EP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nizetic Patent is WO2009060245, published in 2009, title: "SOLAR POWER PLANT WITH SHORT DIFFUSER" [https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2009060245]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of operation==
[[Image:Conceptual vortex engine.jpg|left|thumb|Conceptual illustration of a vortex engine by Louis Michaud. Diameter 200 m (660 ft.) or greater]]

(applicable primarily to the Michaud patent)
[[Image:VortexEngine.gif|thumb|350 px|right|Elevation (side) view of an 80 m-wide (260 ft) vortex engine. It's constructed mostly of [[reinforced concrete]]. (48) is grade level (the surface of the ground).]]
In operation, the vortex [[centripetal force|centripetally expels]] heavier, colder external air (37), and therefore forms a large, low-pressure [[chimney]] of hot air (35).  It uses about twenty percent of a power-plant's [[waste heat]] to drive its air motion.  Depending on weather, a large station may create a virtual chimney from 200 m to 15&amp;nbsp;km high, efficiently venting waste power  plant heat into colder upper atmosphere with minimal structure.

The vortex is begun by briefly turning on a diffuse heater (83) and electrically driving the turbines (21) as fans.  This moves mildly heated air into the vortex arena (2).  The air must have only a mild temperature difference because large temperature differences increase mixing 
with cold ambient air and reduce efficiency.  The heat might be from flue gases, turbine exhaust or small natural gas heaters.

The air in the arena rises (35).  This draws more air (33, 34) through directing louvers (3, 5), which cause a vortex to form (35). In the early stages, external airflow (31) is restricted as little as possible by opening external louvers (25).  Most of the heat energy is at first used to start the vortex.

In the next stage of start-up, the heater (83) may be turned off and the turbines (21) by-passed by louvers (25).  At this time, low-temperature heat from an external powerplant drives the updraft and vortex via a conventional crossway cooling tower (61).

As the air leaves the louvers (3, 5) more rapidly, the vortex increases in speed.  The air's momentum causes centrifugal forces on the air in the vortex, which reduce pressure in the vortex, narrowing it further.  Narrowing further increases the vortex speed as [[conservation of momentum]] causes it to spin faster.  The speed of spin is set by the speed of the air leaving louvers (33, 34) and the width of the arena (2).  A wider arena and faster louver speed cause a faster, tighter vortex.

Heated air (33, 34) from the crossway cooling tower (61) enters the concrete vortex arena (2) via two rings of directing louvers (3, 5, height exaggerated for clarity) and rises (35). The upper ring of louvers (5) seals the low-pressure end of the vortex with a thick, relatively high-speed air-curtain (34).  This substantially increases the pressure difference between the base of the vortex (33) and the outside air (31).  In turn, this increases the efficiency of the power turbines (21).

The lower ring of louvers (3) convey large masses of air (33) almost directly into the low-pressure end of the vortex.  The lower ring of louvers (3) are crucial to get high mass flows, because air from them (33) spins more slowly, and thus has lower centripetal forces and a higher pressure at the vortex.

Air-driven turbines (21) in constrictions at the inlet of the cooling tower (61) drive electric motor-generators.  The generators begin to function only in the last stages of start-up, as a strong pressure differential forms between the base of the vortex arena (33) and the outside air (31).  At this time, the bypass louvers (25) are closed.

The wall (1) and bump (85) retain the base of the vortex (35) in ambient winds by shielding the low-velocity air-motion (33) in the base of the arena, and smoothing turbulent airflow.  The height of the wall (1) must be five to thirty times the height of the louvers (3, 5) to retain the vortex in normal wind conditions.

To manage safety and wear of the arena (2), the planned maximum speed of the vortex base (33) is near 3&amp;nbsp;m/s (10&amp;nbsp;ft/s).  The resulting vortex should resemble a large, slow dust-devil of water-mist more than a violent tornado.  In uninhabited areas, faster speeds might be permitted so the vortex can survive in faster ambient winds.

Most of the unnamed numbered items are a system of internal louvers and water pumps to manage air velocities and heating as the engine starts.

==Criticism and history==
In early studies it was not absolutely clear that this could be made workable due to cross-wind disruption of the vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michaud LM | title=Vortex process for capturing mechanical energy during upward heat-convection in the atmosphere | journal=Applied Energy | volume=62 | issue=4 | date=1999 | pages=241–251 | doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00013-6 | url=http://vortexengine.ca/VPS/VorPro.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2006-07-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928010557/http://www.vortexengine.ca/VPS/VorPro.pdf | archive-date=2006-09-28 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaud LM (2005) {{cite web|url= http://vortexengine.ca/VSC/AVE_WEB.pdf |title="Atmospheric Vortex Engine" }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(198&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This motivated later studies with wind tunnel empirical validation of the CFD model, which conclude, "The full scale simulations subjected to cross wind show that the power generation capacity is not affected by the cross winds."

'''William Flynn Martin''' (born October 4, 1950) is an American energy economist, educator and international diplomat. Martin served as Special Assistant to President Reagan for National Security Affairs, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in the West Wing of the White House and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy during the Ronald Reagan administration.  He was President of the Council of the [[University for Peace]], appointed to the Council by Secretary General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]]. On May 8, 2018 he was awarded the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], Gold and Silver Star by [[Akihito|Emperor Akihito of Japan]] in a ceremony in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for his work in strengthening US-Japan cooperation in nuclear energy. 

Martin was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. He achieved his [[Bachelor of Science]] from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] in 1972 and his [[Master of Science]] from [[MIT]] in 1974. His master's thesis was the basis of an article he co-authored with George Cabot Lodge in the March, 1975 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' entitled ''Our Society in 1985: Business May Not Like It''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Articles/Harvard%20Business%20Review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

William F. Martin's official White House government National Security Council files are available in the [https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/textual/smof/martin.pdf Ronald Reagan Library archive]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/textual/smof/martin.pdf|title=Ronald Reagan Library Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early career ==
As a graduate student at MIT, he was part of a team that prepared ten days of Congressional hearings chaired by Congressman [[John Dingell]] on ''Growth and Its Implications for the Future'' (Roundtable Press, 1973).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings were in response to the [[Club of Rome]]'s report, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and were aimed at providing the first Congressional hearings on the world economic, energy and environmental outlook and the need for sustainable growth strategies.  He was also part of an MIT engineering  group that produced a volume for the United Nations Environmental Program on resource materials for studies in environmental management. He is co-author of the report, ''Professional Materials for Environmental Management Education'' (MIT Press, 1975). These publications were induced by the first United Nations conference on the environment held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and headed by [[Maurice Strong]] who said of ''Growth and Its Implications for the Future'', "This small volume summarizes much of the important work going on today with regard to global survival...I know of no other publication to date which emphasizes more systematically or extensively, and in such readable form, the interacting relationships amongst diverse fields."

Following graduating from MIT, Martin joined the MIT Energy Laboratory as a Program officer for the Workshop on Alternative Energy Strategies (WAES) headed by Professor Carroll L. Wilson, the first General Manager of the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]]. This fifteen country energy assessment group, headquartered at MIT, met for three years and produced the report, ''Energy:  Global Energy Prospects 1985-2000'' (McGraw-Hill, 1975).&lt;ref name="wpainc.com"&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/ENERGY%20%20Global%20Prospects%201985-2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was a co-author of the final report and editor of ''Energy Supply to the Year 2000'' (MIT Press, 1977).&lt;ref name="wpainc.com"/&gt; Martin was responsible for energy supply analysis as well as energy projections of developing nations. He and his co-author Frank J.P. Pinto were responsible for using the SIMLINK model of the [[World Bank]] as an economic foundation for projecting energy futures for developing nations. This World Bank-MIT project entitled ''Energy and Economic Growth Prospects for the Developing Countries: 1960-2000'' (MIT Press, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Energy%20and%20Economic%20Prospects%20for%20Developing%20Countries%201960-2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the pioneering research attempts to estimate energy prospects for developing countries.

[[File:Martin &amp; Carroll Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Martin with Carroll L. Wilson, [[Normandy]], 1976|Martin with [[Carroll L. Wilson]], [[Normandy]], 1976]]
Martin then moved to Paris where he was responsible for energy statistics for developing countries at the [[International Energy Agency]] [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and was part of a UN expert group that developed the methodology for reporting United Nations energy statistics. The statistics were published in the volumes I&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/IEA%20Files/IEA%201977%20to%201980/Workshop%20On%20Energy%20Data%20vol%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and II&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/IEA%20Files/IEA%201977%20to%201980/Workshop%20On%20Energy%20Data%20vol.%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the report ''Workshop on Energy Data of Developing Countries'' (IEA/OECD, 1978). Martin was also director of the IEA Workshop on Energy Statistics for Developing Countries that resulted in the first publication of energy statistics for over 100 countries in a matrix supply/demand integration format.

In 1978, he was promoted to Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the IEA, Ulf Lantzke, and served in this capacity for two years during the time of the [[Second Oil Shock]]. At the commencement of the [[Iran-Iraq war#U.S. Embargo|Iran-Iraq war]], it was agreed that nations should coordinate their oil stock draws in the event of a major disruption. As the Special Assistant to the IEA Executive Director, Martin served as the coordinator for four IEA Ministerial meetings where he aided in the drafting of several communiques, including the one from 1981&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/IEA%20Files/IEA%201977%20to%201980/IEA%201981%20Communique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that is the basis of IEA agreements today on coordinated stock draw as well as a key element of the 2009 discussions between [[Henry Kissinger]] (the founder of IEA), [[Nobuo Tanaka]] (then Executive Director) and Martin on expanding this concept to include China, India and other advancing nations. A letter from Kissinger to Martin recognizing his contribution in this regard can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/IEA%20Files/IEA%202020%20Project/Letter%20to%20Martin%20from%20Henry%20Kissinger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Martin joined the United States Department of State as Special Assistant to Under Secretary of State [[James L. Buckley]] who recalled Martin's activities in his book ''Gleanings from an Unplanned Life''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Gleanings%20from%20an%20Unplanned%20Life.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The senior Reagan administration inter-agency "Buckley Group" that Martin coordinated sought to reduce European subsidies and credits to the Soviet Union.  It also urged Europeans to reduce their dependence on Soviet gas and to find alternatives. Finally, it proposed market oriented energy policies for the United States (deregulation of oil and gas price controls, permitting Alaskan oil exports, allowing eminent domain for coal slurry pipelines) -- all policies of which eventually came to fruition during the Reagan Presidency. (see reference to this again in James Buckley's ''Gleanings from an Unplanned Life'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Gleanings%20from%20an%20Unplanned%20Life%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin briefed President Reagan in the Oval Office that unless the US was credible in its energy policies, the Europeans would not take seriously our concerns on their over dependence on Soviet gas imports.

In 1982, he was transferred to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] as the Director of International Economic Affairs. In this capacity he prepared recommendations for the President in the areas of energy security, East-West economic relations, the Iran-Iraq War and Central American economic development. A key responsibility of Martin's was to conceptualize and then negotiate with the Europeans on the issue of reducing their reliance on Soviet natural gas imports, a project that was directed personally by President Reagan. Martin made a key presentation to President Reagan on alternative gas scenarios for Europe, concluding that the Troll field was vital for European security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive%5CReagan%20Administration%5CWFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives%5CIEA%20and%20Bilateral%20Energy%20Documents%5CMartin%20Memo%20to%20Clark%20on%20Soviet%20Gas%20in%20Europe%2010-22-82.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's role was to negotiate the development of the giant Norwegian [[Troll gas field]] to be an alternative to Soviet gas imports and this was documented in the book ''Troll: Gas for Generations'', an excerpt of which can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Troll.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This was part of a larger program to undermine the [[Soviet economy]] as reported by Peter Schweizer in his book, ''Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union '' and the excerpt where he credited Martin for this effort can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/William%20Martin%20reference%20in%20Peter%20Schweizer%27s%20book%20%27Victory%27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G7 Summit in Williamsburg, VA (1983).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Martin with Reagan in Williamsburg|Martin with Reagan in Williamsburg]]

Martin is also credited in a Presidential citation as the principal draftsman of the ''Williamsburg Declaration'', at the [[9th G7 summit|9th G7 Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/1983williamsburg/communique.html|title=UTLink. G7 Economic Summit, Williamsburg, VA., 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a three-page communique agreed to by the G-7 leaders who were Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] of the UK, Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] of Japan, Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of West Germany, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] of Canada, Prime Minister [[Amintore Fanfani]] of Italy and Prime Minister [[François Mitterrand]] of France. The President read the three-page declaration before the world press (President Reagan's opening remarks can be seen on online).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=41403#axzz2iNt6MZQh|title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks on Reading the Williamsburg Economic Summit Conference Declaration on Economic Recovery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited Martin as the principal draftsman in the following online letter.&lt;ref name="wpainc.com1"&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%206-9-86.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many conclude that this jointly agreed document, which argued for free markets and free trade policies, set in place the foundations for a worldwide economic recovery beginning in 1983. Based on these achievements, Martin was appointed Special Assistant to President Reagan, responsible for the coordination of the President's international and head of state meetings.
[[File:Reagan reading Martin cards prior to Oval Office meeting.jpg|thumb|Reagan reading Martin cards prior to Oval Office meeting]]

Martin helped arrange President Reagan's international meetings coordinating with the White House Advance Office, NSC staff and the Department of State.  He participated in the President's visits to Japan (1983), South Korea (1983), China (1984), Ireland (1984),  United Kingdom (1984), the D-Day fortieth anniversary commemoration on Normandy beaches in France (1984), Canada (1985), Spain (1985), Germany (1985), EU Parliament (1985), the Reagan-Gorbachev [[Geneva Summit (1985)]] and several G-7 economic summit meetings (Williamsburg, London and Bonn).  Working closely with the State Department and NSC staff, he also coordinated the preparation of President Reagan's Oval Office head of state meetings.  As NSC Senior Director for Coordination, he coordinated and participated in the President's major bilateral meetings with, among others,  Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] of Japan, [[Shimon Peres]] of Israel, [[King Fahd]] of Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] of Canada, President [[Ali Saibou]] of Niger, [[King Hussein]] of Jordan, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] of the UK, Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]] of Italy, Prime Minister [[Kåre Willoch]] of Norway, Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanond]] of Thailand, Prime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] of Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] of the USSR, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye, UN Secretary General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of West Germany.

In addition to general preparations for the President's meeting with the Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], he and Dr. [[Alvin Trivelpiece]] were responsible for concluding an agreement with his Russian counterpart Academic [[Evgeny Velikhov]] on magnetic fusion cooperation that has since become the [[ITER#Organization history|ITER]] (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/|title=ITER - the way to new energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; project as recognized in the concluding sentence of the communique of this historic meeting, "The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/news/detail/the-iter-initiative/?|title=Joint Soviet-United States Statement on the Summit Meeting in Geneva|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from Martin to Dr. Trivelpiece recounting this experience can be seen online.&lt;ref name="wpainc.com2"&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/DOE%20DepSec/WFM%20Letter%20to%20Dr.%20Alvin%20Trivelpiece%20on%20Achievements%20at%20DOE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for major visits abroad and in the Oval office, as well as visits outside the United States, Martin would sometimes do the first draft of the President's weekly radio address in close coordination with Presidential chief speech writer Ben Elliott.  Three of these addresses were especially important.  First, Reagan's radio address in 1984 following his first meeting with a Soviet leader (Foreign Minister Gromyko) after four years in office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Reagan%20Radio%20Addresses/Reagan%20Radio%20Address%20on%20Genever%20Summit%209-29-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This widely quoted radio address, highlighted in headlines on the front page of the ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Reagan%20Operations/Washington%20Post%209-30-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; set the agenda and tone for the subsequent meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev one year later. Reagan recognized Martin's role in its drafting in the following letter.&lt;ref name="wpainc.com3"&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%2010-18-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Martin prepared a radio address describing the G-7 Economic Meeting chaired by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Reagan%20Radio%20Addresses/Reagan%20Radio%20Address%20on%20G-7%20Meeting%206-9-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  And third, he prepared a radio address in 1983 describing the President's visit to Japan and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Reagan%20Radio%20Addresses/Reagan%20Radio%20Address%20on%20South%20Korea%20Trip%2011-12-83.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In appreciation for Martin's work on numerous projects, President Reagan commended him in a series of letters on: European gas supplies;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%205-24-83.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the 1983 Williamsburg Summit;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%207-29-83.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the 1984 UN General Assembly;&lt;ref name="wpainc.com3"/&gt; the 1985 Reagan-Gorbachev Geneva Summit;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%2011-21-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's 1983 trip to Asia;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%2012-05-83.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's 1984 trip to China;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Letters%20from%20the%20Reagans/Letter%20from%20Ronald%20Reagan%207-16-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin's tenure as the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council.&lt;ref name="wpainc.com1"/&gt;

== National Security Council, the White House ==
Martin served as the Executive Secretary of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in the Reagan White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/|title=National Security Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Secretary is the head of the NSC as defined by the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. In practice, it serves as the NSC's chief of staff responsible for coordination, budget and management of the National Security Council. The Executive Secretary coordinates the National Security Council meetings and manages vital policy and information communication from the Cabinet and the NSC staff to the President. One of the duties of Mr. Martin as Executive Secretary was to oversee the [[White House Situation Room]] located in the basement of the West Wing of the White House which is in 24/7 communication with the Department of Defense, State Department, Intelligence Community and US embassies abroad.

Martin also initiated and coordinated the production of several videos prepared for the President describing Reagan's international visits, objectives and "scene-setters" including his visit to China in 1984, his visit to Europe to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of D-Day and a preview of the historic first meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, a script of which can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/1984%20Trip%20to%20Europe/Film%20for%20President%20on%20Trip%20to%20Europe%201984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These videos were presented to the President just before visits to supplement other written and oral presentations.

At the time of the [[Iran-Iraq war#U.S. Embargo|Iran-Iraq war]] in 1984, Martin was responsible for the coordination of an NSC Special Situation Group headed by Vice-President Bush on building up the defensive capabilities of friendly Middle Eastern countries and developing a strategy to cope with potential oil market disruptions.  The briefing to the President was the culmination of several meetings of the NSC working group, documents of which can be found here: Memo on Internal Paper on Persian Gulf;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Bonk%20Memo%20to%20Martin%20on%20Persian%20Gulf%204-9-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Memo outlining talking points;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Revised%20Talking%20Points%20for%20NSC%20Meeting%20on%20Iran-Iraq%20Energy%203-20-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Memo to McFarlane on working group;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Martin%20Memo%20to%20McFarlane%20on%20Iran-Iraq%20Working%20Groups%201-12-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Memo to Clark updating the situation;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Martin%20Memo%20to%20Clark%20on%20Iran%20Iraq%205-7-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and cables between President Reagan and British Prime Minister Thatcher on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Cables%20Between%20Reagan%20and%20Thatcher%201984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's role was detailed by [[Robert C. McFarlane]] in his book ''Special Trust'', an excerpt of which can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/Special%20Trust.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, approved by the President and Vice President, was an important step in building US military capability in the Gulf resulting in the successful defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in the 1991 [[Gulf War]].  The plan also stimulated the buildup of the US [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]]. Martin's now declassified presentation to the President can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Presentation%20on%20Gulf%20Oil%20Disruption%205-22-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Martin chaired an NSC inter-agency group on [[History of the United States National Security Council 1981-1989#Central American Economic Development|Central American Economic Development]]. The [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ivrgavsi0dezsq5/AABMO0hJ81wXBoL0yuDeJ6G6a?dl=0 conclusion] of the working group, presented to and approved by the President&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/qywyz6c7sbazwgp/Meeting%20with%20the%20White%20House%20Security%20Council.pdf?dl=0|title=Meeting with the White House Security Council.pdf|website=Dropbox|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was threefold:  encourage free market reforms; contribute $8 billion in economic assistance; and encourage continued security in the region.  The actual Reagan National Security Study Directive (NSSD) describing these initiatives can be viewed on reaganlibrary.gov.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sreference/cabinet-members&lt;/ref&gt; The policy also called upon all US Cabinet officers to assist Central America in its quest for economic development (i.e. agriculture, energy, commerce and transportation).  The theme of the presentation was that security assistance in Central America would be enhanced through economic growth and prosperity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/5erav5l4s36qo55/Economic%20Development%20for%20Central%20America%20Presentation.pdf?dl=0|title=Economic Development for Central America Presentation.pdf|website=Dropbox|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Without economic progress, the security situation would continue to unravel. In addition, Martin coordinated a special program transfer [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] "hot dry rock" energy technology to Costa Rica. The program laboratory program grew to include laser technology developed in Department of Energy (DOE) labs to evaluate air quality in Mexico City.

During the Christmas holiday season in 1985, Mr. Martin was traveling with President Reagan to California as the NSC aide. During this time, there was a terrorist attack on the [[Rome and Vienna airport attacks|Rome and Vienna]] airports, resulting in the deaths of many innocent men, women and children. Martin set up an NSC crisis management center on the site of the [[Annenberg Estate]] where the President was staying and kept the President updated with morning, noon and evening meetings. The terrorist was [[Abu Nidal]] and the New York Times reported that Martin was handling the terrorist attack for the President. It was learned that Abu Nidal had backing from Libya and a key question for the President was the appropriate response. The President responded that since the attacks were in Rome and Vienna, authorities in those countries should bring the criminals to justice. "This is not a time to spread violence in the region", the President told Martin and also told him to tell Israel not to attack Syrian missiles in the [[Beqaa Valley]].  Three months later when Americans were killed in the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|La Belle Discotheque bombing]] in Berlin, President Reagan responded with an attack on Gaddafi's compound codenamed [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].

William Martin was also involved in the conceptualization and implementation of the [[National Program Office]].  The National Program was established to ensure continuity of the United States government in the even of a nuclear attack. This deterrence system was later adapted following the 9/11 attacks to protect the US government in the event of a hostile terrorist attack.

==Department of Energy==
[[File:Martin with Ed Teller at DOE.png|thumb|Martin with Ed Teller at DOE]]
In June 1986, Martin was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] as United States Deputy Secretary of Energy, the number two official of the [[United States Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=36894|title=Nominations &amp; Appointments, February 21, 1986|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin reported to Secretary of Energy [[John S. Herrington]]. The DOE is responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons complex, scientific research and energy policy. At the time of his confirmation, the department had over 150,000 employees and contractors. Martin was awarded the department's highest award by Energy Secretary [[John S. Herrington]] for a report he produced, ''Energy Security: Report to the President of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/DOE%20DepSec/Energy%20Security%20A%20report%20to%20the%20President.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first comprehensive inter-agency, publicly available study on US energy security and concluded that energy imports would continue to rise and that US must strive for greater energy efficiency and development of clean coal technology, safe nuclear power, natural gas, solar and other renewable technologies, as well as to maintain incentives for environmentally sensitive domestic oil development. Martin testified before the United States Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the study conclusions. His testimony can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/5-20-87%20-%20Testimony%20on%20Energy%20Secrurity%20Report-%20Senate%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For this, he was commended by the Democratic Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], [[John Dingell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/DOE%20DepSec/Letter%20to%20WFM%20from%20Rep.%20John%20Dingell.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin was also the administration's top energy adviser on the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] that opened up energy markets between the United States and Canada. He was commended for his work as a member of the negotiating team and core member of the Cabinet group that oversaw the negotiations with Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Free%20Trade%20Certificate.JPG&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's testimony on behalf of the agreement before the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Trade and Western Hemisphere Affairs can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/US-Canada%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement/William%20Martin%20Prepared%20Statement%20for%20US-Canada%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%20Congressional%20Testimony.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of these Congressional hearings on the agreement is available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/US-Canada%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement/Full%20Text%20of%20William%20Martin%20Congressional%20Hearing%20on%20US-Canada%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin at 200th Constitution Anniversary.jpg|thumb|alt=Acting Energy Secretary Martin at 200th anniversary celebration of US Constitution|Acting Energy Secretary Martin at 200th anniversary celebration of US Constitution]]
In 1986, Martin engaged then-Governor and future President [[Bill Clinton]] in a debate before the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] on the merits of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]]'s powers to set interstate electricity rates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/7-14-86%20–%20Hearing%20on%20Grand%20Gulf%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20–%20Senate%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20Committee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate Committee supported Martin's view, objected to by Clinton, that an electricity holding company, Grand Gulf, could justifiably raise electricity prices in the state of Arkansas due to cost overruns of the [[Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station]] operating in Mississippi.  Though Arkansas received no power from Grand Gulf because of their interstate jurisdictions under US federal law, this debate was significant in that it established firm guidelines for the US electricity industry during a period of deregulation and concern over "rate shock."

[[File:William F. Martin with ITER Display at US DOE HQ.jpg|thumb|Martin with Human Genome and ITER displays at US DOE HQ]]
During Martin's tenure at the DOE, he was presented with and approved a proposal by Dr. [[Alvin Trivelpiece]] to map the Human Genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/herac2.shtml|title=Report on the Human Genome Initiative for the Office of Health and Environmental Research|publisher=ornl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Genome Project#History|Human Genome Project]] was the crown jewel of 20th century biology.  This chart (available online)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Trivelpiece/HGP%20Presenation.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; was used in the Spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief  Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of Secretary Herrington. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million the following year. This modest effort triggered the activities that led to the sequencing of the Human Genome. It is notable that this scientific gem was launched by the math, physics and supercomputing strengths of the Department of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Genome Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; Trivelpiece and Martin, under the supervision of Secretary Herrington, also collaborated on a project to launch the [[Superconducting Super Collider]]. A letter from Martin to Dr. Trivelpiece recounting the origins of ITER, Human Genome and SSC can be seen online.&lt;ref name="wpainc.com2"/&gt;

In 1987, Acting Secretary of Energy Martin also joined President Reagan and members of his cabinet and the [[United States Supreme Court]] to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the United States Constitution.  President Reagan, accompanied by his Cabinet, spoke on the footsteps of the US Capitol addressing hundreds of thousands of Americans celebrating the event on the National Mall.

Martin has continued to work with the DOE on various projects since his tenure as Deputy Secretary. From 2002 to 2004, he served on the Secretary's Advisory Board (SEAB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/leadership/secretary-energy-advisory-board|title=Secretary of Energy Advisory Board - Department of Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairing the industry-government sub-committee and participated in the drafting of its 2003 report ''Critical Choices: Science, Energy and Security''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/NEAC/SEAB%202003%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, he has been Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC)&lt;ref name="doe.gov"&gt;https://www.energy.gov/ne/services/nuclear-energy-advisory-committee&lt;/ref&gt; and was a committee member of a SEAB group to review the Department of Science.&lt;ref&gt;DOE Office of Science. http://science.energy.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, he served in an advisory capacity on the DOE's Strategic Technology Energy Plan (STEP) aimed to utilize technological gains in energy efficiency to both reduce carbon emissions as well as overall energy consumption. His contribution to the project was to create an energy supply/demand ‘matrix’ approach to detail all sectors of energy use (industrial, commercial, residential etc.) and supplies to meet those demands.  A sample matrix can be seen online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/DOE%20Projects/STEP%20Matrix%20with%20Supply%20and%20Demand%20Integration.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin has testified more than twenty-five times before the US House of Representatives and US Senate on topics including: United States energy security; the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement; oil and gas tax policy; the future of natural gas; China's nuclear power prospects; US coal exports; electricity deregulation; the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement; the priorities of the Department of Energy, the role of International Energy Agency; renewable energy prospects; the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; the Reagan-Gorbachev fusion agreement; and US economic sanctions policy.

'''Order of the Rising Sun (Japan):''' Martin received the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver from Emperor Akihito of Japan on May 8, 2018 in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The citation of the Emperor and Prime Minister notes his contributions to strengthening US-Japan relations in the field of nuclear energy. 

'''International Atomic Energy Agency:'''
In 2008, he was appointed by [[IAEA]] Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] as Project Coordinator for the IAEA's 20/20 Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/IAEA%20Project/Letter%20from%20IAEA%20DG%20ElBaradei.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which provided an assessment of the challenges the Agency will face in a report, ''Reinforcing the Global Nuclear Order for Peace and Prosperity: The Role of the IAEA to 2020 and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/gov2008-22gc52inf-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ministry of Foreign Affairs Leadership Award (France):'''  
In 1991, Martin was one of two recipients in the United States honoring American researchers interested in France.  The award was granted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France.  The research, conducted in French, was focused on the French nuclear energy program.

'''Department of Defense:'''
In early 2003, Martin was assigned to the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] with responsibilities to recruit senior US civilian advisers for assignments in Iraq. This involved placing American advisers in twenty six Iraqi agencies and ministries for the purposes of reconstruction, as well as dispatching Czech Chief Justice Vojtech Cepl to Iraq to evaluate property restitution. Based on this experience, Justice Cepl with the assistance of Ambassador [[C. Boyden Gray|Boyden Gray]] initiated the training of over one hundred and forty Iraqi judges in Prague's CEELI Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/iraqi-judges-train-in-prague-to-better-understand-their-role-in-a-democratic-society&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|de|Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels}}''' is a treatise by [[Christian Doppler]] (1842)&lt;ref&gt;Some sources mention 1843 as year of publication because in that year the article was published in the Proceedings of the [[Bohemian Society of Sciences]]. Doppler himself referred to the publication as "Prag 1842 bei Borrosch und André", because in 1842 he had a preliminary edition printed that he distributed independently.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he postulated his principle that the observed frequency changes if either the source or the observer is moving, which later has been coined the [[Doppler effect]]. The [[s:de:Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels|original German text]] can be found in wikisource. The following annotated summary serves as a companion to that original.

==Summary==
The '''title''' "{{lang|de|Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels - Versuch einer das Bradley'sche Aberrations-Theorem als integrirenden Theil in sich schliessenden allgemeineren Theorie}}" ''(On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens - Attempt at a general theory including Bradley's theorem as an integral part)'' specifies the purpose: describe the hypothesis of the Doppler effect, use it to explain the colours of binary stars, and establish a relation with Bradley's stellar aberration.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;In 1728 [[James Bradley|Bradley]] discovered and explained the so called [[aberration of light|aberration of star light]]. This aberration was one of the first compelling pieces of evidence for the finite speed of light in the universe. Finite meaning in this case: although large, not extremely large compared to the orbital speed of the Earth. Bradley's aberration is approximately proportional to v/c, the ratio of the speed of the Earth over the speed of light. The Doppler effect contains a similar proportionality to v/c.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''§ 1''' Introduction in which Doppler reminds the readers that light is a wave, and that there is debate as to whether it is a [[transverse wave]], with aether particles oscillating perpendicular to the propagation direction. Proponents claim this is necessary to explain polarised light, whereas opponents object to implications for the [[lumiferous aether|aether]]. Doppler doesn't choose sides, although the issue returns in § 6.

'''§ 2''' Doppler observes that colour is a manifestation of the frequency of the light wave, in the eye of the beholder. He describes his principle that a frequency shift occurs when the source or the observer moves. A ship meets waves at a faster rate when sailing against the waves than when sailing along with them. The same goes for sound and light.

'''§ 3''' Doppler derives his equations for the frequency shift, in two cases:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

'''§ 4''' Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for sound: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-

|}

'''§ 5''' Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for light from stars. Velocities are expressed in Meilen/s, and the light speed has a rounded value of 42000 Meilen/s.&lt;ref&gt;Meile = geografische Meile = 7420 m. Doppler provides the rounded value of 42000 Meilen/s instead of the best accurate value of his time. The rounded value was well known and stable throughout the years, whereas the accurate value varied due to frequent new measurements. Since 1835 the accurate value was 41549 geogr. Meilen/s (308000 km/s), see [http://www.zeno.org/Pierer-1857/A/Licht+%5B1%5D Pierer's Universallexikon] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=IZSwwhfJfF8C&amp;pg=PA619&amp;vq=fizeau&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=0_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0eyXaxxKsKlbBGhFQorWSWLeTT5Q#PPA873,M1 Wüllner's Experimentalphysik]&lt;/ref&gt; Doppler assumes that 458 THz (extreme red) and 727 THz (extreme violet) are the borders of the visible spectrum,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;The frequencies 458 THz (extreme red) and 727 THz (extreme violet) and other colours apparently have been derived from the wavelengths mentioned by Thomas Young in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=CPAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=toc&amp;hl=nl#PPA161,M1 Theory of Light and Colours (1802)], where Doppler would have used 309000 km/s as light speed. This explains most values in the table, except for the v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-values 19000 and 5007 that remain as calculation errors by Doppler (deviation about 25%).

|}&lt;/ref&gt; that the spectrum emitted by stars lies exactly between these borders (except for the infrared stars of § 8), and that the colour of the light emitted by stars is white.&lt;ref&gt;These assumptions are wrong. Doppler ignores the emitted infrared and ultraviolet, although their presence in sun light was known since studies by Herschel (1800) and Ritter (1801). As a result Doppler overstimates the visual colour changes. He knew that stars are able to emit infrared, as he proposes so in § 8. With regard to the colours of stars, the assumption that stars emit white light is his major mistake. Nowadays we know that colour mainly depends on the star temperature.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Doppler this implies that white star light undergoes a perceptible colour change if the frequency shift is at least 1% of the red segment of the spectrum. Using Young's definition of the red segment (wavelength 625 - 675nm, Theory of Light and Colours, see above) and  c=309000km/s (see above), the red segment corresponds to the frequency range 458 - 495THz. The value in that segment at 1% distance from the border is 458.37THz.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

'''§ 6''' Doppler summarises: 
* The natural colour of stars is white or a weak yellow. 
* A white star receding with progressive speed would successively turn to green, blue, violet, and invisible (ultraviolet).
* A white star approaching with progressive speed would turn to yellow, orange, red, and invisible (infrared).

Doppler wishes that his frequency shift theory will soon be tested by another method to determine the radial velocity of stars. He thinks, without reason, that a confirmation of his theory would imply that light is not a transverse but a longitudinal wave.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzano, in his review in 1843, points out that Doppler's thought that his theory would not apply for transverse waves is a mistake. 
[[s:de:Ein Paar Bemerkungen über die neue Theorie in Herrn Professor Chr. Doppler’s Schrift|Annalen der Physik 1843]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''§ 7''' Doppler argues that his theory applies mainly to binary stars. In his opinion the fixed stars&lt;ref&gt;In Doppler's article, 'fixed stars' are single stars that are not part of a binary star. The idea of their immobility is a legacy from antiquity, when the ideal fixed stars were contrasted with the planets.&lt;/ref&gt; are immobile and white.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzano argues in his review in 1843 that the idea of the immobility of single stars is unnecessary, and that the observed proper motion of many stars indicates that single stars do move. [[s:de:Ein Paar Bemerkungen über die neue Theorie in Herrn Professor Chr. Doppler’s Schrift|Annalen der Physik 1843]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a binary star high speeds could be possible due to orbital motion,&lt;ref&gt;Later it turned out that the orbital speed of binary stars is ''not'' particularly large compared to the [[proper motion]] speed of stars. Speeds up to about 200 km/s are observed in eclipsing binaries. An exception is the fastest binary star, a rare type of two white dwarfs, with a period of 5 minutes, an orbit diameter of 80000 km, and an orbital speed  of more than 1000 km/s. [http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2002/pr-06-02.html RX J0806.3+1527]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At present, the highest radial speed of nearby single stars is about 300 km/s. ([[Doppler effect#Astronomy LHS 52]])&lt;/ref&gt; and binaries appear to be colourful.&lt;ref&gt;With a few known facts Doppler could have easily estimated that the orbital speed of the ''visual'' binaries, which appear to be colourful, is ''smaller'' than the orbital speed of the Earth. The distance from the Earth to stars is at least 4 light years (that is the distance to the nearest star). A traditional telescope at sea level has a resolving power of 1 arc second or worse, due to atmospheric turbulence. Hence, the two stars that compose a visual binary have a distance of at least 1 AU. The shortest period of a visual binary is 1.7 year. Therefore the orbital speed of visual binaries (with a circular orbit) is smaller than that of the Earth, below the threshold for visual colour changes (see § 9). That is another flaw in Doppler's explanation of the colours of visual binaries.&lt;/ref&gt; Doppler divides the binaries in two groups: (1) binary stars of unequal brightness; and (2) binary stars of equal brightness. His interpretation is: in case (1) the brighter star is the heavier one, the weaker star revolves around him; in case (2) both stars revolve around a center of mass in the middle, or around a dark third star. In case (2) the colours are usually complementary. Doppler rules out that the rich complementary colours of binaries are contrast illusions, because an astronomer said he had observed that covering one star does not change the colour impression of the other star. Doppler claims that his theory is supported by the fact that for many binary stars the colour indication in Struve's catalogue is different from that in Herschel's older catalogue, attributing the difference to progress of the orbital motion.&lt;ref&gt;An additional motive for Doppler to focus on binary stars might have been that binary stars were a hot topic in astronomy. Accurate binary star catalogues had been composed by Herschel and by Struve. It had been discovered that binary stars are not static, but that they revolve in an orbit around a center, bound by gravity. The orbit parameters (speed, period, and excentricity) were determined. It had become clear that visually single, variable stars with a particular brightness development, were actually binary stars (''eclipsing binaries'', like Algol).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''§ 8''' Doppler presents two groups of variable stars that in his opinion can be explained as binary stars with Doppler effect. These are the "other stars in the heavens" from the title. 
* Periodic variable stars that are invisible for most of the time, and that brighten up with a red colour for a short while once per cycle. In Doppler's opinion they are binary stars. Such a star is usually invisible because it emits infrared instead of white light. In the orbit section with the maximal radial speed in the direction of Earth, the observed frequency on Earth is shifted from infrared to visible red.
* 'New stars' (in particular two [[supernova]]s, [[SN 1572|Tycho's Nova]] of 1572, and [[SN 1604|Kepler's Nova]] of 1604), that suddenly appeared, having a white colour in the brightest phase, then turning to yellow and red, and finally fading out. According to Doppler they too are binary stars, with extremely high speed and long period.&lt;ref&gt;Therefore Doppler expects that supernovas flame periodically.&lt;/ref&gt; Doppler assumes Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, belongs to this group, because some texts from antiquity say its colour was red, instead of its current white colour.&lt;ref&gt;For details see [[Sirius#Red controversy|Sirius Red controversy]]. This idea meant that Sirius would be a binary star with an extremely long period and high speed. This is incorrect: although Sirius actually is a binary star (as discovered in 1844), it doesn't have a high speed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''§ 9''' Doppler notes that the orbital speed of the Earth (4.7 Meilen/s) is too low (&lt;33 Meilen/s) to result in visually perceptible colour changes. He identifies two factors that may lead to high orbital speeds in a binary star:
* Central star far heavier than the Sun. According to Doppler stars that are a million times heavier than the Sun are plausible.&lt;ref&gt;We now know that the heaviest stars are 100 times heavier than the Sun, but a black hole could be a million times heavier than the Sun. See [[solar mass]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Highly elliptical orbit with a small perihelium distance&lt;ref&gt;In the case of binary stars the perihelium should actually be called periastron&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]).

Doppler assumes that there are binary stars with a perihelium speed larger than the speed of light. The astronomer Littrow would have suggested that the perihelium speed of the visual binary star γ Virgo is nearly equal to the speed of light.

'''§ 10''' Doppler summarises the above, and concludes that his speculations explain so much that his theory has to be true. He shares a few more speculations:
* The colours of binary stars are not static, they will change periodically in phase with the orbital motion.
* The stars of § 8, which suddenly (in just a few hours time) appear, then gradually extinguish and remain invisible for many years, are binary stars with a highly elliptical orbit and a high perihelium speed. If the Earth sees the orbit obliquely, such a star may appear faster than it disappears. 
* Fluctuations in the period of variable stars like [[Mira]] (according to Doppler its period varies between 328 and 335 days), result from the orbital motion of the Earth.

'''§ 11''' Conclusion: Doppler expects his frequency shift theory will be accepted, because similar aberrations that depend on v/c (Rømer's and Bradley's)&lt;ref&gt;Doppler's suggestion that his theory encompasses Bradley's aberration is an exaggeration. However, he could have claimed that his theory encompassed [[Ole Rømer]]'s (among astronomers equally famous) aberration of the revolution of Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], which Rømer used in 1676 to determine the finite speed of light. That aberration is exactly given by f ' / f = (c+v&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) / c, where  f ' and f are the apparent and the actual frequency of revolution. In addition, this shows that the Doppler effect applies to more than just the oscillation frequency of a wave.&lt;/ref&gt; have been accepted before. Doppler waits for the experts to decide if his speculations will do as evidence. He is convinced that finally his principle will be used for the determination of the speed of remote stars.&lt;ref&gt;In his time, Doppler could have thought himself of measuring the shift of ''spectral lines'' of stars, although he didn't. In 1815 Fraunhofer had observed dark lines in spectra of the Sun and Sirius. He proposed that every star has a unique line spectrum. A few years later he measured the wavelength of these lines, using a grating. In 1823 William Herschel suggested that the chemical composition of stars could be derived from their spectrum. In 1848 Fizeau pointed to the possibility of measuring the shift of spectral lines in star spectra. But until the breakthrough of the work by Kirchhoff and Bunsen in 1859, spectroscopy remained a difficult method, producing complex and fairly useless spectra. In 1868 Huggins discovered a redshift in the spectrum of Sirius, and he calculated the speed. In 1871 Vogel succeeded in measuring the shift of spectral lines at the edges of the Sun, and he used it to calculate the rotation speed of the sun. In the same year Talbot pointed to the possibility of discovering spectroscopic binary stars by means of periodic doubling of spectral lines, and in 1889 this was observed for the first time in the star Mizar A, by Pickering.
