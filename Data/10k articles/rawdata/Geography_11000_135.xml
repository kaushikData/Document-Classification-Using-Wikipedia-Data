[[File:Death of Theodora.jpg|thumb|Death of Theodora and visions of spiritual trials]]
'''Aerial toll houses''' refers to a teaching held by some [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Theotokos and saints|Eastern Orthodox saints]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] about the immediate state of the soul after death. It holds that "following a person's death the soul leaves the body, and is escorted to [[God]] by [[angel]]s. During this journey the soul passes through an aerial realm, which is inhabited by [[Demons|wicked spirits]] ([[Ephesians 6]]:12). The soul encounters these demons at various points referred to as ''toll-houses'' where the demons then attempt to accuse it of sin and, if possible, drag the soul into hell."&lt;ref name="stlukeorthodox.com"&gt;Andrew Werbiansky, [http://www.stlukeorthodox.com/html/evangelist/2000/deathtoll.htm Death and the Toll House Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some forms, the teaching is taught in hagiographical and other spiritual texts from quite early in the history of the church, but it has never been formally promulgated by any [[ecumenical council]].&lt;ref name="stlukeorthodox.com"/&gt; A number of the Orthodox saints, modern elders and theologians have openly endorsed it, but some theologians and bishops, starting from the last century, have condemned it as [[heresy|heretical]] and [[gnostic]] in origin.&lt;ref name="gnosticteaching" /&gt; The content is somewhat similar to that propounded by [[John Climacus]] in ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]''. Some say that given the amount of fear that comes along with the teaching, the love of Christ becomes misunderstood and is forgotten, but others suggest that fear is perfectly natural and salvific for Orthodox Christians.

==Teaching==

Some authors of the ''[[Philokalia]]'', an authoritative anthology&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Spirituality: The Classics''.
 Edited by Arthur Holder. London and. New York: Routledge, 2010. {{ISBN|0415776023}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} of writings of saints and ascetics of the first millennium, taught about the toll houses. For example, St Theodoros the Great Ascetic instructs to "reflect on the dreadful reckoning that is to come, how the harsh keepers of the toll homes will bring before as one by one the actions, words and thoughts which they suggested but which we accepted and made our own".&lt;ref&gt;St Theodoros the Great Ascetic. A Century of Spiritual Texts / Philokalia. Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} Abba Isaiah of Scetis wrote, "... you will leave this body, pass the powers of darkness that will meet you in the air".&lt;ref&gt;Abba Isaiah of Scetis - Ascetic Discourses. 2002. Cistercian Studies (Book 150)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}

Prayers mentioning the aerial accusers can be found in Liturgical texts and official Orthodox books like ''The Great Book of Needs'': "do thou banish from me the commander of the bitter toll-gatherers and ruler of the earth.... O holy Theotokos" (Ode 8, Troparion 3).&lt;ref name="the_great_book_of_needs"&gt;[http://www.stspress.com/products-page/books/the-great-book-of-needs-complete-set/ The Great Book of Needs], St Tikhon's Monastery Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentions of toll houses&lt;ref&gt;However, it is first with the Greek and Slavonic ''Euchologion'', in the canon for the departure of the soul by St. Andrew, that the words used in Ode 7 are found' "All holy angels of the Almighty God, have mercy upon me and save me from all the evil toll-houses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Canon of Supplication at the Parting of the Soul in ''The Great Book of Needs'' are found the following references to the struggle of a soul passing through the toll houses: "Count me worthy to pass, unhindered, by the persecutor, the prince of the air, the tyrant, him that stands guard in the dread pathways, and the false accusation of these, as I depart from earth" (Ode 4, p. 77). "Do thou count me worthy to escape the hordes of bodiless barbarians, and rise through the aerial depths and enter into Heaven…" (Ode 8, p. 81). "[W]hen I come to die, do thou banish far from me the commander of the bitter toll-gatherers and ruler of the earth…" (Ode 8, p. 81).&lt;/ref&gt; can be found in the hymnology of the church, and in stories of the lives of some saints (for example, the Life of [[Saint Anthony the Great]], written by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, the life of [[Basil the New]], and Theodora,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} in the homilies of [[Cyril of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyril of Alexandria]] ''Ephesi praedicata depoito Nestorio, ACO''.14(5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.405D) as referenced by Lampe, G.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;H., ''A Patristic Greek Lexicon'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1961, p.1387&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} in the Discourses of [[Abba Isaiah]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Twenty-nine Discourses of our Holy Father Isaiah,'' Volos, 1962, p. 37 (in Greek): "[Live] every day having death before your eyes, and concerning yourselves with  how you will come out from the body, how you will pass by the powers of darkness that will meet you in the air, and how you will answer before God..."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} the [[Philokalia]], ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, and the Dogmatics of the Orthodox Church by [[Justin Popović]]{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}). Other church hymns say that the souls have to "pass through the rulers of darkness standing in the air"&lt;ref&gt;January 27, The Recovery of the Holy Relics of our Father among the Saints John Chrysostom, Troparion 1, Ode 5 of Orthros: "Grant me to pass untroubled through the host of noetic satraps and the tyrannic battalion of the lower air in the hour of my departure..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parakletike, Friday Vespers, Second Mode: "When my soul is about to be separated violently from the members of the body, then, O Bride of God, come to my aid; scatter the counsels of the fleshless enemies and shatter their millstones, by which they seek to devour me mercilessly; that, unhindered, I may pass through the rulers of darkness standing in the air."&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary church figures support the teaching on toll-houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxinfo.com/death/soul_taxing.aspx The Taxing of Souls] by Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxinfo.com/death/critic.aspx Answer to a Critic, Appendix III from The Soul After Death] by [[Seraphim Rose]] of Platina&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vid. Ephraim, Elder, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0966700023 ''Counsels from the Holy Mountain,''] St. Anthony's Greek Orthodox Monastery, Arizona, 1999, pp. 436, 447.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavarnos, Constantine, ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0911165061 The Future Life According to Orthodox Teaching,]'' Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, Etna, California, 1985, pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent saints, including [[Ignatius Brianchaninov]]&lt;ref&gt;A Word on Death, chapter "Aerial toll-houses"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theophan the Recluse]],&lt;ref&gt;What is spiritual life, and how to obtain it, chapter "Perfect preparation for the Mystery of Repentance"&lt;/ref&gt; insisted not only on the truthfulness of but also on the necessity of this teaching in the spiritual life of a Christian.

The most detailed account of the aerial toll-houses is found in the hagiography of Basil the New, found in the ''Lives of Saints'' for 26 March (according to the Orthodox calendar).  In this rendering, Theodora, spiritual student of Basil, appeared to another student, the pious and holy layman Gregory.  According to the story, Gregory had prayed to God and asked him to inform them of what happened to Theodora after her death. God answered his prayers (according to this account) by sending Theodora herself to Gregory; and told him, in great detail, about her journey through the toll-houses.&lt;ref name="orthodoxinfo.com"&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/death/theodora.aspx St. Theodora's Journey Through the Aerial Toll-Houses] Lives of Saints, March 26th&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theodora's teaching, every Christian has a demon who tempts him or her.  These demons keep a record of every sin of thought or action they succeed in tempting a person to commit, though repented sins are erased from the demonic records.  On the third day after the soul separates from the body, according to this account, it is carried by angels towards Heaven. On the way, souls must go past twenty aerial toll-houses. Each toll house is populated by demons devoted to particular sins. At each toll-house, demons demand that souls "pay" for their sins by giving an account of compensatory good deeds. If the soul is unable to compensate for a sin, the demons take it to hell.&lt;ref name="orthodoxinfo.com"/&gt;

The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad&lt;ref name="orthodebatelink"&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/death/tollhouse_debate.aspx Holy Synod of the Russian Church Abroad]&lt;/ref&gt; had a session on "a controversy raised by Deacon Lev. Puhalo", the main opponent of the toll-house teaching. The resolution says the Holy Synod "demands the cessation in our magazines of controversy", "this controversy must be ended on both sides" and that "Deacon Lev Puhalo is forbidden to lecture in the parishes".&lt;ref name="orthodebatelink"/&gt;

===Toll houses===

There are twenty toll-houses. On the first aerial toll-house, the soul is questioned about the sins of the tongue. The remaining are, in order, the toll-houses of:
{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* Lies
* Slander
* Gluttony
* Laziness
* Theft
* Covetousness
* Usury
* Injustice
* Envy
* Pride
* Anger
* Remembering evil
* Murder
* Magic
* Lust
* Adultery
* Sodomy
* Heresy
* Unmercifulness&lt;ref name="orthodoxinfo.com"/&gt;
{{div col end}}

==Controversy==
The opponents of toll houses argue that it is a form of gnosticism, or neo-gnosticism, and claim that the teaching is opposed to the church's [[catechism]] and other Orthodox teachings.&lt;ref name="gnosticteaching"&gt;"Against the Gnostic Story of Judging Demons." http://constans_wright.tripod.com/notolls.html&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Azkoul argues that [[Seraphim Rose]] is its only contemporary theological proponent. Rose, an American Orthodox hieromonk and theologian, wrote a book on the subject, ''The Soul After Death''. While Ignatius Brianchaninov, John Maximovich, Rose and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos endeavored to demonstrate that this teaching is derived from patristic and other church sources, his opponents, among them Azkoul and Archbishop Lazar Puhalo (a retired hierarch in the [[Orthodox Church in America|Orthodox Church of America]], who had previously been defrocked from [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]), found his conclusions questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Azkoul, Rge Michael. ''The Toll-House Myth: The Neo-Gnosticism of Fr. Seraphim Rose.'' Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, opponents of the teaching argue that it emphasizes fear and guilt as a way of keeping believers "in line", while ignoring the forgiveness of [[Jesus Christ]], who, according to Orthodox Christian teaching, came to earth to save the world and humanity when they least deserved it. On that account, the emphasis of the spiritual life thus changes from communion with a God of love, to fear of demons.

Opponents of the teaching also consider it similar to the intermediary state taught by the Catholic Church in its doctrine of [[purgatory]].  While some say that the toll houses are only metaphorical, others believe in a real but not physical representation of "stations of taxation", where demons have the right to ask their victims to account for their wrongdoings, and actually let the victim go if a good enough payment (of victim's good deeds) is offered. This latter thought shares some aspects with the Roman Catholic teaching on merits, but in the case of the Catholic Church, the merits in question are not primarily individual but those of Christ and the saints administered by the church.

However, two dedicated chapters in the book &lt;!--http://thedepartureofthesoul.org/--&gt;''The Departure of the Soul According to the Teaching of the Orthodox Church'' allegedly reveal for the first time over 100 falsifications, misrepresentations, and errors in Puhalo's and Azkoul's writings. Puhalo reportedly falsified reproduction of several ancient icons and falsified translations of the writings and lives of several saints, while Azkoul is said to have falsified several patristic texts.  Both writers' works are asserted to contain an inordinate number of gross misrepresentations and errors, all attempting to support their allegedly incorrect opinions about the Orthodox teaching on the toll-houses.

'''Durla''' is a [[fictional planet]] in the 30th century [[DC Universe]], best known as the home planet for [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member [[Chameleon Boy]]. It is a member world part of the [[United Planets]].

==Fictional history==
Durl' is the only existing planet in the Durla star system. It once sustained a high-order civilization whose warlike tendencies ultimately ended in a conflict known as the "Six-Minute War." The war reduced the planet to nuclear rubble, gradually mutating the native populace until they gained the power to change their form instantly to adapt to their immediate circumstances. This ultimately created a barbaric tribal life on what is colloquially referred to as ''The Chameleon Planet''. Their ability to appear as other than what they are has led to deep distrust among other beings in the galaxy.

Few examples of [[Durlan (comics)|Durlan]] architecture remain, and those that do are in a state of slow decay from the instantaneous burn of implosion bombs that killed many of the planet's inhabitants. The form of the inhabitants in the time of the holocaust is unknown, as no remains have been found in identifiable condition. Archaeological and anthropological permits were not granted to investigate the circumstances. Whole sections of the planet are essentially barren, wasted by the impact of the high-intensity fusion weapons developed to destroy military bases. Insects, lizards and lower order life dwell in these regions.

As surviving Durlans began to gather into tribal packs, each tribe adopted a characteristic shape used in their rituals and worn by Durlans of the tribe who leave the planet. The relationship of any of these shapes to the natural appearance of Durlans is unknown. Best available data indicates these shapes may be those worn by the primary ancestors of the tribe at the Temple - the alleged source of the inhabitants' unique abilities. &lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 2) #301 (July, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
==In other media==
===Television===
* Durla is featured in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode "Who Am I?". Durla's position became a target of [[Imperiex]] in his bid to rule the universe. He attempted to invade the planet with a Supermissile but the Legion of Superheroes prevented it.
* Durla is first mentioned in the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode "Distant Sun" when [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]] suggests that he and Kara evade his mother by hiding out on a planet when "a Durlan emissary" once took him to as a child. In the episode "Resist", it is revealed that President Olivia Marsdin ([[Lynda Carter]]) fled from Durla after her home-world was conquered by an unknown military force.

The term '''Ecofeminism''' is used to describe a [[feminism|feminist]] approach to understanding [[ecology]]. Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of [[gender]] to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;{{cite book |author=MacGregor, Sherilyn |title=Beyond mothering earth: ecological citizenship and the politics of care |year=2006 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-1201-6 |page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined by the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] in her book ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' (1974).&lt;ref name="Merchant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Karen|date=September 2002|title=Karen Warren's Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|volume=7|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are many interpretations of ecofeminism and how it might be applied to social thought, including: [[ecofeminist art]], ecofeminist theory, [[social justice]] and [[political philosophy]], religion, contemporary feminism and poetry. As there are several different types of feminism and different beliefs held by feminists, there are different versions of ecofeminism.

Ecofeminism is widely referred to as the third wave of feminism, it adds to the former feminist theory that an environmental perspective is a necessary part of feminism. Ecofeminism uses the parallels between the oppression of nature and the oppression of women as a way to highlight the idea that both must be understood in order to properly recognize how they are connected. These parallels include but are not limited to seeing women and nature as property, seeing men as the curators of culture and women as the curators of nature, and how men dominate women and humans dominate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminism and the Sacred|last=Adams|first=Carol|publisher=Continuum|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlene Spretnak]] has offered one way of categorizing ecofeminist work: 1) through the study of political theory as well as history; 2) through the belief and study of [[Earth religion|nature-based religions]]; 3) through [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spretnak, Charlene. "Ecofeminism: Our Roots and Flowering." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Feminism'', edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Ornstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Oppression==

According to [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] in her book ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' (1974, Ecofeminism relates the [[oppression]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of all subordinate groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.). In the book, the author argues that oppression, domination, exploitation, and [[colonization]] from the Western [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society has directly caused irreversible environmental damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] was an activist and organizer, and her writing encouraged the eradication of all social injustice, not just injustice against women and the environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminist Philosophy: A Western Perspective on What It Is and Why It Matters|last=Warren|first=Karen J.|publisher=Roman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc|year=2000|isbn=9780847692996|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition includes a number of influential texts including: ''Women and Nature'' ([[Susan Griffin]] 1978), ''The Death of Nature'' ([[Carolyn Merchant]] 1980) and ''Gyn/Ecology'' ([[Mary Daly]] 1978). These texts helped to propel the association between domination by man on women and the domination of culture on nature. From these texts feminist activism of the 1980s linked ideas of ecology and the environment. For example, conferences for women devoted to living on the earth and protests against [[nuclear testing]] and other [[militarism]] that oppresses [[femininity]]. Writing in this circle discussed ecofeminism drawing from Green Party politics, [[peace movement]]s, and [[direct action]] movements.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamar|first=Stephanie|year=1991|title=Ecofeminist Theory and Grassroots Politics|journal=Hypatia|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28–45|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb00207.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such [[essentialism]] and instead focuses more on [[intersectional]] questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.

==Gendering Nature==
[[File:Petra Kelly.jpg|thumb|[[Petra Kelly]].]]
One ecofeminist theory is that [[capitalist]] values reflect [[paternalistic]] and gendered values. In this interpretation effects of capitalism has led to a harmful split between [[nature]] and [[culture]]. In the 1970s, early ecofeminists discussed that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for nurture and [[holistic]] knowledge of nature's processes.

Several feminists make the distinction that it is not ''because'' women are female or "feminine" that they relate to nature, but because of their similar states of oppression by the same male-dominant forces. The [[marginalization]] is evident in the [[Language and gender|gendered language]] used to describe nature and the animalized language used to describe women. Some discourses link women specifically to the environment because of their traditional social role as a nurturer and [[caregiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|first=Mark|last2=Tindall|first2=D. B.|year=2011|title=Ecofeminism, Hegemonic Masculinity, And Environmental Movement Participation In British Columbia, Canada, 1998-2007: "Women Always Clean Up The Mess"|journal=Sociological Spectrum|volume=31|issue=3|pages=342–368|doi=10.1080/02732173.2011.557065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminists following in this line of thought believe that these connections are illustrated through the coherence of socially-labeled values associated with 'femininity' such as nurturing, which are present both among women and in nature.

[[Vandana Shiva]] says that women have a special connection to the environment through their daily interactions and this connection has been ignored. She says that women in subsistence [[Economy|economies]] who produce "wealth in partnership with nature, have been experts in their own right of holistic and ecological knowledge of nature's processes". She makes the point that "these alternative modes of knowing, which are oriented to the social benefits and sustenance needs are not recognized by the [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[Reductionism|reductionist]] paradigm, because it fails to perceive the interconnectedness of nature, or the connection of women's lives, work and knowledge with the creation of wealth (23)".&lt;ref name="Shiva"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shiva, Vandana |title=Staying alive: women, ecology and development |year=1988 |publisher=Zed Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-86232-823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &amp;nbsp;Shiva blames this failure on the West's [[patriarchy]], and the patriarchal idea of what development is. According to Shiva, patriarchy has labeled women, nature, and other groups not growing the economy as "unproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana. "Development as a New Project of Western Patriarchy." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Feminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Ornstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 189-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An "Ecofeminist Framework"==

In the 1993 essay entitled "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" authors [[Greta Gaard]] and [[Lori Gruen]] outline what they call the "ecofeminist framework". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills.

Gaard and Gruen argue that there are four sides to this framework:

# The [[Mechanistic Materialism|mechanistic materialist]] model of the universe that resulted from the [[Scientific Revolution|scientific revolution]] and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used
# The rise of [[patriarchal religion]]s and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of [[Immanence|immanent]] divinity
# Self and other dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails
# Capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people for the sole purpose of creating [[wealth]].

They hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a "separation between nature and culture" that is the root source of our planetary ills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaard, Greta and|first=Gruen, Lori|date=1993|title=Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health|url=|journal=Society and Nature|volume=2|pages=1–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Modern science and ecofeminism ===
In ''Ecofeminism'' (1993) authors [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Maria Mies]] and [[Evan Bondi]] ponder [[modern science]] and its acceptance as a universal and value-free system. Instead, they view the dominant stream of modern science as a projection of Western men's values.&lt;ref name="Mies"&gt;(Mies, Maria, and Vandana Shiva.  ''Ecofeminism''. Halifax, N.S. : Fernwood Publications; 1993. 24.)&lt;/ref&gt; The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, and for the most part of history restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of [[childbirth]] and the industrialization of [[plant reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Mies" /&gt;

Bondi argues that the [[medicalization]] of childbirth has marginalized [[midwife]] knowledge and changed the natural process of childbirth into a procedure dependent on specialized technologies and appropriated expertise.
A common claim within ecofeminist literature is that patriarchal structures justify their dominance through binary opposition, these include but are not limited to: [[heaven]]/earth, mind/body, [[male]]/[[female]], human/animal, spirit/matter, culture/nature and [[White people|white]][[Non-white|/non-white]].&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/bron/PDF--Christianity/Hobgood-Oster--Ecofeminism-International%20Evolution.pdf|title=Ecofeminism: Historic and International Evolution|author=Laura Hobgood-Oster|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oppression is reinforced by assuming truth in these binaries and instilling them as 'marvelous to behold' through religious and scientific constructs.&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster" /&gt;

=== Vegetarian ecofeminism ===
The application of ecofeminism to animal rights has established [[vegetarian ecofeminism]], which asserts that "omitting the oppression of animals from feminist and ecofeminist analyses […] is inconsistent with the activist and philosophical foundations of both feminism (as a "movement to end all forms of oppression") and ecofeminism."&lt;ref name="gaard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaard|first1=Greta Claire|year=2002|title=Vegetarian ecofeminism: A review essay|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/frontiers/v023/23.3gaard.html|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=23|issue=2|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It puts into practice "[[the personal is political]]" for it believes that "meat-eating is a form of patriarchal domination…that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet."&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminism combines sympathy with the analysis of culture and politics to refine a system of ethics and action.&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt;

=== Materialist ecofeminism ===
Ecofeminism as materialist is another common theme in ecofeminism. A materialist view connects some institutions such as labor, power and property as the source of domination over women and nature. There are connections made between these subjects because similarly there are varying values in production and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Borders" /&gt;

=== Spiritual ecofeminism ===
[[Spiritual ecofeminism]] is another branch of ecofeminism, and is popular among ecofeminist authors such as [[Starhawk]], [[Riane Eisler]], Carol J. Adams, and more. Starhawk calls this an earth-based spirituality, which recognizes that the Earth is alive, that we are interconnected, as well as a community.&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk. "Power, Authority, and Mystery: Ecofeminism and Earth-based Spirituality." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Orenstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 73-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual ecofeminism is not linked to one specific religion, but is centered around values of caring, [[compassion]], and non-violence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Eisler, Riane. "The Gaia Tradition &amp; The Partnership Future: An Ecofeminist Manifesto." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Orenstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, ecofeminists refer to more ancient traditions, such as the worship of [[Gaia]], the Goddess of nature and spirituality (also known as Mother Earth).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Buddhism'''

Buddhism and feminism simultaneously gained momentum in America during the 1960s. Some of the parallels between these movements include their experiential epistemology, the intersection of the constrained mind, intersectionality and connection, using emotional energy as a coping mechanism, relational ethics, and a communal mindset and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaza, Stephanie. “Acting with Compassion: Buddhism, Feminism, and the Environmental Crisis” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 50-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Buddhist and ecofeminist practitioners viewed nature as a pathway to enlightenment and as a source of many jumping off points for introspection and deeper thought about the relationship of nature and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Alfred. “Buddhism, Nature and the Environment.” ''The Eastern Buddhist'', vol. 5, no. 1, 1972, pp. 115–129. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/44361321.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaism'''

Jewish ideology emphasizes leaving the earth as it was found (or in better condition than it was found in). This concept is also promoted through ecofeminist theories and movements. Both Judaism and ecofeminism do not always present as social justice movements, but they often contribute ideals and motivations for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. “Feminist Judaism and Repair of the World” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 70-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is an important part of Judaism, and many practitioners see social justice as a form of spirituality, and some feel this form of spirituality through environmental and feminist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Eilon. “Judaism and Nature: Theological and Moral Issues to Consider While Renegotiating a Jewish..” ''Judaism'', vol. 44, no. 4, Fall 1995, p. 437. ''EBSCOhost'', echo.louisville.edu/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=9601090437&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism'''

In Hinduism, the Ganges River is personified by the Goddess Ganga. She is a paradoxical deity, as she is supposed to be independent yet guarded, pure yet polluted. Ganga is referred to as a deity to be both subjugated and protected. The underlying tone of the passages is patriarchal despite being reverent. The pollution or purity of the Ganges river is a reflection on Ganga, which represents the relationship between spirituality and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Lina. “Ganga: Purity, Pollution, and Hinduism” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 99-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism emphasizes that all lives are connected and indistinguishable. In this context, every life, be it human or animal, is important.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rana PB. "Ecospirituality in Indian Tradition: Messages for Global Order."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Movements==
Women participated in the [[environmental movement]]s, specifically preservation and conservation beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=Susan A.|date=2011|title=Pioneers of U.S. Ecofeminism and Environmental Justice|journal=Feminist Formations|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–25|doi=10.1353/ff.2011.0028|jstor=41301654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movements of the 1970s ===

In [[northern India]] in 1973, women took part in the [[Chipko movement]] to protect forests from [[deforestation]]. [[Non violent protest|Non-violent protest]] tactics were used to occupy trees so that [[loggers]] could not cut them down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Wangari Maathai no Brasil.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Wangari Maathai]].]]
In [[Kenya]] in 1977, the [[Green Belt Movement]] was initiated by Professor [[Wangari Maathai]], environmental and political activist, and is ongoing today. It is rural [[tree planting]] program led by women, which Maathai designed to help prevent [[desertification]] in the area. The program created a '[[green belt]]' of at least 1,000 trees around villages, and gives participants the ability to take charge in their communities. In later years, the Green Belt Movement was an advocate for informing and empowering citizens through seminars for civic and environmental education, as well as holding national leaders accountable for their actions and instilling agency in citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/who-we-are/our-history|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|website=The Green Belt Movement|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[New York (state)|New York]], mother and environmentalist [[Lois Gibbs]] led her community in protest after discovering that their entire neighborhood, [[Love Canal]], was built on top of a toxic [[dump site]]. The toxins in the ground were causing illness among children and reproductive issues among women, as well as [[birth defect]]s in babies born to pregnant women exposed to the toxins. The Love Canal movement eventually led to the evacuation and relocation of nearly 800 families by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chej.org/about-us/story/love-canal/|title=Love Canal|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Health, Environment, &amp; Justice|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 and 1981, members of such a conference organized a peaceful protest at the [[Pentagon building|Pentagon]]. Women stood, hand in hand, demanding equal rights (including social, economic, and [[reproductive rights]]) as well as an end to militaristic actions taken by the government and exploitation of the community (people and the environment). This movement is known as the [[Women's Pentagon Actions]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1985, the [[Akwesasne]] Mother's Milk Project was launched by [[Katsi Cook]]. This study was funded by the government, and investigated how the higher level of contaminants in water near the Mohawk [[Indian reservation|reservation]] impacted babies. It revealed that through [[breast milk]], Mohawk children were being exposed to 200% more toxins than children not on the reservation. Toxins contaminate water all over the world, but to due [[environmental racism]], certain subversive groups are exposed to a much higher amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/cjm5/blogs/english/2012/04/mothers-milk-project.html|title=Mother's Milk Project|last=Doverspike|first=Nicole|year=2012|website=English 487W Blog: West of Everything|publisher=|access-date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greening of Harlem Coalition]] is another example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, [[Bernadette Cozart]] founded the coalition, which is responsible for many urban gardens around [[Harlem]]. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into [[community gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-sowing-a-future-with-green-in-it.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Bernadette%20Cozart&amp;st=cse|title=Neighborhood Report: Harlem; Sowing a Future With Green in It|last=Bernstein|first=Emily|date=1993|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities to be in touch with nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. [[Green urbanism|Urban greening]] exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of [[African Americans|African-American]] women in [[Detroit]] have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild Politics: Feminism, Globalisation, Bio/diversity|last=Hawthorne|first=Susan|publisher=Spinifex Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[vegetarian ecofeminism]] can be traced to the mid-80s and 90s, where it first appeared in writing. However, the roots of a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] ecofeminist view can be traced back further by looking at sympathy for non-humans and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt; At the culmination of the decade ecofeminism had spread to both coasts and articulated an [[Intersectionality|intersectional analysis]] of women and the environment. Eventually, challenging ideas of environmental [[classism]] and racism, resisting toxic dumping and other threats to the impoverished.&lt;ref name="Gaard" /&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s some began to see the advancing theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This [[dichotomy]] is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism is trying to break. Out of this critique rose the [[Gender essentialism|anti-essentialist]] argument. Ecofeminist and author [[Noel Sturgeon]] says in an interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Michiels, Nete. "Social Movements And Feminism." Women &amp; Environments International Magazine, no. 92/93, 2013, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s–present===
[[File:Video Vandana Shiva 2014.webm|thumb|[[Vandana Shiva]].]]
Coming out of the 90s, ecofeminism met a lot of criticism from anti-essentialist feminism, which heavily critiqued what they viewed as [[essentialism]]. The essentialist view saw ecofeminism as reinforcing and growing patriarchal dominance and norms.&lt;ref name="Borders" /&gt; Feminist thoughts surrounding ecofeminism grew in some areas as it was criticized; vegetarian ecofeminism contributed intersectional analysis; and ecofeminisms that analyzed [[animal rights]], [[labor rights]] and activisms as they could draw lines among oppressed groups. To some, the inclusion of non-human animals also became to be viewed as essentialist. According to ecofeminist and author [[Charlene Spretnak]], modern ecofeminism is concerned about a variety of issues, including reproductive technology, [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] and equal rights, toxic poisoning, [[Third World]] development, and more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ecofeminism as it propelled into the 21st century became aware of the criticisms, and in response ecofeminists with a materialist lens began doing research and renaming the topic, i.e. queer ecologies, global feminist [[environmental justice]], and [[gender]] and the environment.&lt;ref name="Gaard" /&gt;

=== Movements based on literature ===
Beginning in the late 20th century, women worked in efforts to protect [[wildlife]], food, air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glazebrook|first=Trish|date=Autumn 2002|title=Karen Warren's Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|volume=7|issue=2|pages=12–27|doi=10.2979/ete.2002.7.2.12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts depended largely on new developments in the environmental movement from influential writers, such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Muir]], and [[Rachel Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norlock|first=Kathryn J.|date=December 2011|title=Building Receptivity: Leopold's Land Ethic and Critical Feminist Interpretation|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/NORBRL|journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature &amp; Culture|volume=5|issue=4|pages=491–509|doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v5i4.491|via=|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seager|first=Joni|date=Spring 2003|title=Rachel Carson Died of Breast Cancer: The Coming of Age of Feminist Environmentalism|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=28|issue=3|pages=945–973|doi=10.1086/345456|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental examples of women's efforts in the 20th century are the books ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by Rachel Carson and ''Refuge'' by [[Terry Tempest Williams]]. These works truly opened American's eyes to the environmental harm they were perpetuating, and created a platform for change.

Ecofeminist author [[Karen J. Warren|Karren Warren]] lists [[Aldo Leopold|Aldo Leopold's]] essay "[[Land ethic|Land Ethic]]" (1949) as a fundamental work to the ecofeminist conception, as Leopold was the first to pen an ethic for the land which understands all non-human parts of that community (animals, plants, land, air, water) as equal to and in a relationship with humans. This inclusive understanding of the environment launched the modern [[Conservation movement|preservation movement]] and illustrated how issues can be viewed through a framework of caring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Susan A. Mann]] an eco-feminist and professor of [[Sociological theory|sociological]] and feminist theory considers the roles women played in these activisms to be the starter for ecofeminism in later centuries. Mann associates the beginning of ecofeminism not with feminists but with women of different race and class backgrounds who made connections among gender, race, class and environmental issues. This ideal is upheld through the notion that in activist and theory circles marginalized groups must be included in the discussion. In early environmental and women's movements, issues of varying races and classes were often separated.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Major critiques==
The major criticism of ecofeminism is that it is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaard|first=Greta|date=Summer 2011|title=Ecofeminism Revisited: Rejecting Essentialism and Re-Placing Species in a Material Feminist Environmentalism|url=|journal=Feminist Formations|volume=23|issue=2|pages=26–53|via=|doi=10.1353/ff.2011.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ascribed essentialism appears in two main areas:

* '''Adherence to strict dichotomy between men and women:''' Some eco-feminist critiques are that the [[dichotomy]] between women and men and nature and culture creates a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is too stringent and focused in the difference of women and men. That eco-feminism too strongly correlates the [[social status]] of women with the social status of nature, rather than the non-[[Essentialism|essentialist]] view that women along with nature both have masculine and feminine qualities, and that just like feminine qualities have often been seen as less worthy, nature is also seen as having lesser value than culture, or the qualities involved in these concepts.&lt;ref name="greenfuse" /&gt;
* '''Divergent view regarding participation in oppressive structures:''' As opposed to [[Radical feminism|radical]] and [[Liberal feminism|liberation-based]] feminist movements, mainstream feminism which is most tightly bound with [[hegemonic]] social status strives to promote equality within the existing social and political structure,&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center" Cambridge, MA: South End Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; such as making it possible for women to occupy positions of power in business, industry and politics, using direct involvement as the main tactic for achieving pay equity and influence. In contrast, many ecofeminists oppose active engagement in these areas, as these are the very structures that the movement intends to dismantle.&lt;ref name="greenfuse" /&gt;

[[Social ecology (Bookchin)|Social ecologist]] and feminist [[Janet Biehl]] has criticized ecofeminism for focusing too much on a [[mystical]] connection between women and nature and not enough on the actual conditions of women.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{cite book |author=Biehl, Janet |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stated that rather than being a forward-moving theory, ecofeminism is an anti-progressive movement for women.&lt;ref name="Biehl" /&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]] also critiques this focus on [[mysticism]] over work that focuses on helping women, but argues that spirituality and activism can be combined effectively in ecofeminism.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism&amp;Globalization"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Ecofeminism and Globalization|year=2003|editor=Heather Eaton &amp; Lois Ann Lorentzen|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, Toronto, Oxford|isbn=978-0-7425-2697-6|pages=vii – xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A.E. Kings]] has criticized ecofeminism for limiting itself to focusing only on gender and the environment, and neglecting to take an intersectional approach. Kings says that ecofeminists claim to be intersectional, however have fallen short on their commitment until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kings|first=A.E.|date=Spring 2017|title=Intersectionality and the Changing Face of Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics and the Environment|volume=22|pages=63–87|via=|doi=10.2979/ethicsenviro.22.1.04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Regions Airline Association was founded as the '''European Regional Airlines Association''' in 1980, by a small number of what were then known as ''commuter airlines''.{{r|gbr|page=127}} The association is registered as a limited company in England &amp; Wales.{{r|self}}

In the 2000s, the line between low-cost airlines serving regional airports close to high-traffic areas and actual regional airlines became blurry, and the scope of ERA's potential members grew much bigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/regionals-face-competition-from-low-cost-airlines-218493/|title=Regionals face competition from low-cost airlines|website=Flightglobal.com|date=12 October 2007|author=Victoria Moores|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congestion of major airports also led to a greater usage of closeby regional airports, once again making ERA a central actor of this growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/727359/The-rise-and-rise-of-the-regional-airport.html|title=The rise and rise of the regional airport|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=29 April 2003|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, the ERA opposed the application of the European commission's rule to increase the airlines' responsibility regarding delayed or cancelled flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/barrot-air-passengers-get-raw-deal/|title=Barrot: air passengers get raw deal|website=Politico.eu|date=28 March 2007|author=Lorraine Mallinder|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, when the European commission allowed airlines to trade take-off and landing slots, the ERA warned that this could lead to a slot-bartering economy that may in turn deteriorate the primary focus of airlines, servicing passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/eu-to-allow-sale-of-airport-slots/|title=EU to allow sale of airport slots|website=Euractiv.com|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2013, along with the [[International Air Transport Association]], the ERA published ''A Blueprint for a Single European Sky'', a set of proposals to strengthen the legislative basis for the [[Single European Sky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/10960623/a-step-towards-the-single-european-sky|title=A Step towards the Single European Sky|website=Aviationpros.com|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, when the European commission called for all state subsidies for airports to end within 10 years, the ERA criticized the proposal, arguing that this decision will have a negative impact on the development of regional airlines and airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2013-07-15/europe-set-stifle-state-aid-airports-and-airlines|title=Europe Set To Stifle State Aid for Airports and Airlines|website=Ainonline.com|date=15 July 2013|author=Charles Alcock|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the ERA pledged for a hiatus of the [[European Union Emissions Trading System]] until a compromise with other international authorities could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/eu-ets-stop-clock-scope-extended-till-2016|title=EU ETS ‘Stop-the-Clock’ Scope Extended Till 2016|website=Aviationweek.com|date=17 March 2014|author=Cathy Buyck|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest rings''' are large, circular patterns of low tree density in the [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forests]] of northern [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="HamiltonCranston2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BraunederHamilton2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GirouxBergeron2001"/&gt; These rings can range from {{convert|50|m}} to nearly {{convert|2|km}} in diameter, with rims about {{convert|20|m}} in thickness.&lt;ref name="HamiltonCranston2000"/&gt; The origin of forest rings is not known, despite several mechanisms for their creation having been proposed. Such hypotheses include radially growing fungus, buried [[volcanic pipe#Kimberlite pipes|kimberlite pipes]], trapped gas pockets, and meteorite impact craters.&lt;ref name="GirouxBergeron2001"/&gt;

== History ==

Because of their large scale, forest rings are not apparent from the ground, and it was not until aerial photography became a common surveying tool in the 1950s that geologists began to notice them.&lt;ref name="ElleAndraWarner2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veillette1999"/&gt; The term "forest ring" was coined by [[Ontario Geological Survey|The Ontario Geological Survey]] to differentiate the phenomenon from [[fairy ring]]s.&lt;ref name="BraunederHamilton2016"/&gt;

== Hypothesis ==

=== Biological ===

Forest rings were originally thought to be caused by the radial growth of fungi within the  root system of [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] (''Picea mariana''), possibly the fungus ''[[Armillaria ostoyae]]''. A ring would begin as a single point of infection and grow outward in all directions. Affected trees would die in the interior of the circle, and eventually new trees would grow in their place. The fungal mat would become ring-shaped and visible from above as a circular ring of stunted trees.&lt;ref name="Veillette1999"/&gt; The fungal hypothesis is no longer favoured as there is little compelling evidence to support it. Observations of forest rings in the Abitibi region of Quebec have found no evidence of mass tree mortality by a pathogen.&lt;ref name="GirouxBergeron2001"/&gt;

It was further hypothesized that bacteria, such as ''[[Geobacter]]'' might be contributing to the ring formation.&lt;ref name="HamiltonHattori2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HamiltonGovett2010"/&gt; Their capability to form conducting nanowires or [[Pilus|pili]] and to perform directional electron transport might contribute to a circular charge transfer from the electron-rich center of the ring towards the ring edges.&lt;ref name="Reguera2005"/&gt; The so catalyzed oxidation processes are increasing [[Acidity or alkalinity|acidity]] and dissolve carbonates, thus creating a depression and accordingly, the ring edge. Recent microbiological investigations indeed show a high abundance of ''[[Geobacter]]'' at the ring edge.&lt;ref name="vonGunten2018"/&gt;

== Outside of Canada ==

Forest rings have also been reported in [[Russia]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="ElleAndraWarner2008"/&gt;

[[Niger]] is a [[landlocked]] nation in [[West Africa]] located along the border between the [[Sahara]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] regions. Its [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] are [[longitude]] 16°N and [[latitude]] 8°E. Its area is 1.267 million square kilometers, of which 1&amp;nbsp;266&amp;nbsp;700&amp;nbsp;km² is land and 300&amp;nbsp;km² water, making Niger slightly less than twice the size of [[France]].&lt;ref name="The World Factbook" /&gt;

==Brief history==
Niger, which attained independence from [[France]] in 1960 was under military regime till 1991. On public demand [[Ali Saibou|Gen. Ali Saibou]] held multiparty elections in 1993 and soon democracy came into effect in 1993. However, political unrest was caused by [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara|Col. Ibrahim Bare]] who staged a coup in 1996, but he later died in a counter insurgency operations by officers of the military establishment in 1999. This was followed by fresh elections for a democratic rule, and [[Mamadou Tandja]] assumed power in December 1999. Tandja, who won the elections in 2004 and in 2009, wanted to bring about a constitutional amendment to extend his tenure as president. However, in February 2010, he was removed from the post of the president in a coup engineered by the military and the constitution was annulled. Soon after, in 2011, elections were held and [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] got elected as the president and was sworn in April 2011.&lt;ref name="The World Factbook"/&gt;
Niger’s problem with rebellious groups continued during 2007 and 2008. Rebellion was controlled. However, its security problems with its neighbors such as [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Mali]] have been a cause for concern&lt;ref name="The World Factbook"/&gt;

==Geography==
Niger, with a land area of 1.267 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is a land locked country which is bounded with a land boundary of 5,834&amp;nbsp;km by seven countries: [[Algeria]] (951&amp;nbsp;km), [[Benin]] (277&amp;nbsp;km), [[Burkina Faso]] (622&amp;nbsp;km), [[Chad]] (1,196&amp;nbsp;km), [[Libya]] (342&amp;nbsp;km), [[Mali]] (838&amp;nbsp;km, and [[Nigeria]] (1,608)&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="The World Factbook"/&gt;

===Regions===
{{main|Regions of Niger}}
[[Niger]] is divided into 7 Regions (French: ''régions;'' singular{{spaced ndash}}''région)''. Each department's capital is the same as its name.

===Departments===
{{main|Departments of Niger}}
[[Image:Niger arrondissements.png|thumb|right|The pre-2011 36 [[Departments of Niger]]. A further 27 were then carved out of existing divisions.]]
The Regions of Niger are subdivided into 63 [[Department (country subdivision)|Departments]].

===Communes===
{{main|Communes of Niger}}
The 63 Departments are broken down into Communes. As of 2006 there were 265 communes, including ''communes urbaines'' (Urban Communes: centred in or as subdivisions of cities of over 10000), ''communes rurales'' (Rural Communes) centred in cities of under 10,000 and/or sparsely populated areas, and a variety of traditional (clan or tribal) bodies amongst semi-nomadic populations.

[[File:Niger sat.png|thumb|275px|A satellite image depicting the [[physical geography]] of Niger]]

Some of the land in Niger is used as [[arable land]] (660&amp;nbsp;km² of land in Niger is [[irrigation|irrigated]]) and as [[pasture]]. There are some forests and woodland. The table below describes land use in Niger, as of 2011.

===Climate===
[[File:Niger map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Niger map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Niger's climate is largely hot and dry, with most of the country in a [[desert]] region. The terrain there is predominantly desert plains and sand [[dune]]s. There are also large plains in the south and hills in the north. In the extreme south, there is a [[tropical]] climate near the edges of the [[Niger River]] Basin. [[Lake Chad]] at the southeast corner of the country is shared between Niger, [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], and [[Cameroon]].

===Current issues===
Current environmental issues in Niger include: overgrazing, [[soil erosion]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]], recurring droughts, and endangered wildlife populations (such as the [[African elephant]], [[Northwest African cheetah]], [[West African giraffe]], and [[Addax]]), which are threatened because of poaching and habitat destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niger: African Wildlife Foundation|url=http://www.awf.org/country/niger|website=AfricanWildlifeFoundation.com|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2005–06 Niger food crisis]] created a severe, but localized [[food security]] crisis in the regions of northern [[Maradi Region|Maradi]], [[Tahoua (department)|Tahoua]], [[Tillabéri]], and [[Zinder]] of [[Niger]] from 2005 to 2006. It was caused by an early end to the 2004 rains, [[desert locust]] damage to some pasture lands, high food prices, and [[chronic poverty]].

==Political geography==
{{see also|Politics of Niger|Foreign relations of Niger}}
Surrounded by seven other countries, Niger has a total of 5,834&amp;nbsp;km of borders. The longest border is with [[Nigeria]] to the south, at 1,608&amp;nbsp;km. This is followed by [[Chad]] to the east (1,196&amp;nbsp;km), [[Algeria]] to the north-northwest (951&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Mali]] to the west (838&amp;nbsp;km). Niger also has short borders in its far southwest frontier ([[Burkina Faso]] at 622&amp;nbsp;km and [[Benin]] at 277&amp;nbsp;km) and to the north-northeast ([[Libya]] at 342&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="The World Factbook" /&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Geologic Clock with events and periods.svg|thumb|400px|This clock representation shows some of the major units of geological time and definitive events of Earth history. The [[Hadean]] eon represents the time before fossil record of life on Earth; its upper boundary is now regarded as 4.0 [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] ([[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago).&lt;ref name=ICS_chart/&gt; Other subdivisions reflect the evolution of life; the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] are both eons, the [[Palaeozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] are [[era]]s of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon. The three million year [[Quaternary]] period, the time of recognizable humans, is too small to be visible at this scale.]]

The '''geologic time scale''' ('''GTS''') is a system of [[chronological dating]] that relates geological strata ([[stratigraphy]]) to time. It is used by [[geologist]]s, [[paleontology|paleontologists]], and other [[earth sciences|Earth scientists]] to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]]. The table of geologic time spans, presented here, agree with the [[Taxonomy (general)|nomenclature]], dates and standard color codes set forth by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS).

__TOC__
{{clear}}

==Terminology{{anchor|terminology&lt;!-- Various redirects target this section title --&gt;}}==
The primary defined divisions of time are '''eons''', in sequence the [[Hadean]], the [[Archean]], the [[Proterozoic]] and the [[Phanerozoic]].
The first three of these can be referred to collectively as the [[Precambrian]] '''supereon'''. 
Eons are divided into [[Era (geology)|eras]], which are in turn divided into [[Period (geology)|periods]], [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]] and [[Age (geology)|ages]].

{{Timeline geological timescale}}

Corresponding to eons, eras, periods, epochs and ages, the terms "[[eonothem]]", "[[erathem]]", "[[system (stratigraphy)|system]]", "[[series (stratigraphy)|series]]", "[[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]]" are used to refer to the layers of rock that belong to these stretches of geologic time in Earth's history.

Geologists qualify these units as "early", "mid", and "late" when referring to time, and "lower", "middle", and "upper" when referring to the corresponding rocks. For example, the lower Jurassic Series in [[chronostratigraphy]] corresponds to the early Jurassic Epoch in [[geochronology]].&lt;ref name=ICSchronostrat&gt;{{cite web|author=International Commission on Stratigraphy|title=Chronostratigraphic Units|website=International Stratigraphic Guide|access-date=14 December 2009|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209020034/http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm|archivedate=9 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus "early Miocene" but "Early Jurassic."

==Rationale==

Evidence from [[radiometric dating]] indicates that Earth is about [[age of the Earth|4.54 billion years old]].&lt;ref name="USGS1997"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The geology or ''[[deep time]]'' of Earth's past has been organized into various units according to events which took place. Different spans of time on the GTS are usually marked by corresponding [[Stratigraphy|changes in the composition of strata]] which indicate major geological or [[paleontology|paleontological]] events, such as [[mass extinction]]s. For example, the boundary between the [[Cretaceous]] period and the [[Paleogene]] period is defined by the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], which marked the demise of the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and many other groups of life. Older time spans, which predate the reliable fossil record (before the [[Proterozoic eon]]), are defined by their absolute age.

Geologic units from the same time but different parts of the world often look different and contain different fossils, so the same time-span was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America, the Lower [[Cambrian]] is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of [[trilobita|trilobites]]. In [[East Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the same unit is split into [[Alexian]], [[Atdabanian]], and [[Botomian]] stages. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal [[Horizon (geology)|horizons]] that can be used around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/status.htm#_2.__PURPOSE_AND_OBJECTIVES|title=Statutes of the International Commission on Stratigraphy|access-date=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other [[Planet#Solar System|planets]] and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the Solar System have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories, for example, [[Geology of Venus|Venus]], [[Geology of Mars|Mars]] and the [[Geology of the Moon|Earth's Moon]]. Dominantly fluid planets, such as the [[gas giant]]s, do not preserve their history in a comparable manner. Apart from the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earth's time scale, except in a Solar System context. The existence, timing, and terrestrial effects of the Late Heavy Bombardment are still debated.{{efn|Not enough is known about extra-solar planets for worthwhile speculation.}}

===Early history===
In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE) observed that [[fossils]] of seashells in rocks resembled those found on beaches – he inferred that the fossils in rocks were formed by living animals, and he reasoned that the positions of land and sea had changed over long periods of time. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) concurred with Aristotle's interpretation that fossils represented the remains of ancient life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmnh.com/wmas0002.htm|title=Correlating Earth's History|first=Paul R.|last=Janke|publisher = Worldwide Museum of Natural History|date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, died 1037) and the 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[bishop]] [[Albertus Magnus]] (died 1280) extended Aristotle's explanation into a theory of a [[petrification|petrifying]] fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Meaning of Fossils: Episodes in the History of Palaeontology|first= M.

===Establishment of primary principles===
In the late 17th century [[Nicholas Steno]] (1638–1686) pronounced the principles underlying geologic (geological) time scales. Steno argued that rock layers (or strata) were laid down in succession, and that each represents a "slice" of time. He also formulated the law of superposition, which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. While Steno's principles were simple, applying them proved challenging. Steno's ideas also lead to other important concepts geologists use today, such as [[relative dating]]. Over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that:

# Sequences of strata often become eroded, distorted, tilted, or even inverted after deposition
# Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances
# The strata of any given area represented only part of Earth's long history
The [[Neptunist]] theories popular at this time (expounded by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]] (1749–1817) in the late 18th century) proposed that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. A major shift in thinking came when [[James Hutton]] presented his ''Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe''&lt;ref&gt;

before the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in March and April 1785. [[John McPhee]] asserts that "as things appear from the perspective of the 20th century, James Hutton in those readings became the founder of modern geology".&lt;ref name="mcphee"&gt;
{{cite book|first=John|last=McPhee|authorlink=John McPhee|title=Basin and Range|location=New York|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|date=1981}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95–100}}
Hutton proposed that the interior of Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory, known as "[[Plutonism]]", stood in contrast to the "Neptunist" flood-oriented theory.

===Formulation of geologic time scale===
The first serious attempts to formulate a geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts (championed by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]], among others) divided the rocks of Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a "Tertiary Period" as well as of "Tertiary Rocks." Indeed, "Tertiary" (now Paleogene and Neogene) remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and  "Quaternary" remains in formal use as the name of the current period.

The identification of strata by the fossils they contained, pioneered by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]], and [[Alexandre Brongniart]] in the early 19th century, enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely. It also enabled them to correlate strata across national (or even continental) boundaries. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geologic periods still used today.

===Naming of geologic periods, eras and epochs===
Early work on developing the geologic time scale was dominated by British geologists, and the names of the geologic periods reflect that dominance. The "Cambrian", (the classical name for [[Wales]]) and the "Ordovician", and "Silurian", named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from Wales.&lt;ref name="mcphee"/&gt;{{rp|113–114}} The "Devonian" was named for the English county of [[Devon]], and the name "Carboniferous" was an adaptation of "the Coal Measures", the old British geologists' term for the same set of strata. The "Permian" was named after [[Perm]], Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by Scottish geologist [[Roderick Murchison]]. However, some periods were defined by geologists from other countries. The "Triassic" was named in 1834 by a German geologist [[Friedrich Von Alberti]] from the three distinct layers (Latin {{lang|la|trias}} meaning triad)—[[red bed]]s, capped by [[chalk]], followed by black [[shale]]s—that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the ‘Trias’. The "Jurassic" was named by a French geologist [[Alexandre Brongniart]] for the extensive marine [[limestone]] exposures of the [[Jura Mountains]]. The "Cretaceous" (from Latin ''creta'' meaning ‘[[chalk]]’) as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]] in 1822, using strata in the [[Paris basin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|pages=vol. 16, p. 50|date=1974|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true|title-link=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named for the extensive beds of chalk ([[calcium carbonate]] deposited by the shells of marine [[invertebrate]]s) found in Western Europe.

British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs. In 1841 [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]] published the first global geologic time scale based on the types of fossils found in each era. Phillips' scale helped standardize the use of terms like ''[[Paleozoic]]'' ("old life") which he extended to cover a larger period than it had in previous usage, and ''[[Mesozoic]]'' ("middle life") which he invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudwick|first=Martin|title=Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform|date=2008|pages= 539–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating of time scales===
{{Main|Chronological dating}}

When William Smith and [[Sir Charles Lyell]] first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods, time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since estimates of rates of change were uncertain. While [[Creationism|creationists]] had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of Earth based on the [[Bible]], early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods, and some were even suggesting a virtually infinite age for Earth.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils, and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of [[weathering]], [[erosion]], [[sedimentation]], and [[lithification]]. Until the discovery of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through [[radiometric dating]] during the first half of the 20th century, the ages of various rock strata and the age of Earth were the subject of considerable debate.

The first geologic time scale that included absolute dates was published in 1913 by the British geologist [[Arthur Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/Geologictime.html|title=Geologic Time Scale|publisher = EnchantedLearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He greatly furthered the newly created discipline of [[geochronology]] and published the world-renowned book ''The Age of the Earth'' in which he estimated Earth's age to be at least 1.6 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2007/5609.html|title=How the discovery of geologic time changed our view of the world|publisher=Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the ''Global Commission on Stratigraphy'' (now the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]) began to define global references known as GSSP ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]) for geologic periods and faunal stages. The commission's most recent work is described in the 2004 geologic time scale of Gradstein et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Felix M.|editor1-last=Gradstein|editor2-first=James G.|editor2-last=Ogg|editor3-first=Alan G.|editor3-last=Smith|title=A Geologic Time Scale 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78673-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] model for how the timescale is structured, relating it to the GSSP, is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= Simon J.

===The Anthropocene===
Popular culture and a growing number{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} of scientists use the term "[[Anthropocene]]"  informally to label the current epoch in which we are living. The term was coined by [[Paul J. Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]] and [[Eugene F. Stoermer|Eugene Stoermer]] in 2000 to describe the current time, in which humans have had an enormous impact on the environment.  It has evolved to describe an "epoch" starting some time in the past and on the whole defined by anthropogenic carbon emissions and production and consumption of plastic goods that are left in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anthropocene: Age of Man – Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/03/age-of-man/kolbert-text/2|website = ngm.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this term say that the term should not be used because it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to define a specific time when humans started influencing the rock strata—defining the start of an epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Anthropocene and Are We in It?|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-the-anthropocene-and-are-we-in-it-164801414/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-09-22|first = Joseph|last = Stromberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that humans have not even started to leave their biggest impact on Earth, and therefore the Anthropocene has not even started yet.

The ICS has not officially approved the term {{As of|2015|9|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name = icsanthropocene&gt;{{Cite web |website= Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy |title= Working Group on the 'Anthropocene'|url = http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|publisher= [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch.&lt;ref name = icsanthropocene/&gt; Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend "Anthropocene" as the new geological age in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth&lt;/ref&gt;
Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the geologic time scale.&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001"&gt;

{{Administrative division of Poland sidebar}}
The '''gmina''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] pronunciation {{IPAc-pl|'|g|m|i|n|a}}, plural ''gminy'' {{IPAc-pl|'|g|m|i|n|y}}) is the principal unit of the administrative division of [[Poland]], similar to a [[municipality]]. As of 2010 there were 2,478 gminy throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_powierzchnia_ludnosc_teryt_2006.pdf Central Statistical Office of Poland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711195047/http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_powierzchnia_ludnosc_teryt_2006.pdf |date=2007-07-11 }}, January 1, 2006. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''gmina'' derives from the [[German language|German]] word ''Gemeinde'', meaning "community".

The gmina has been the basic unit of territorial division in Poland since 1974, when it replaced the smaller [[gromada]] (cluster). There are three types of gminy:
#'''urban gmina''' ({{lang-pl|gmina miejska}}) consisting of just one city or town,
#mixed '''urban-rural gmina''' ({{lang-pl|gmina miejsko-wiejska}}) consisting of a town and surrounding villages and countryside; and
#'''rural gmina''' ({{lang-pl|gmina wiejska}}) consisting only of villages and countryside (occasionally of just one village).
Some rural gminy have their seat in a [[town]] which is outside the gmina's division. For example, the ''rural'' [[Gmina Augustów]] is administered from the town of [[Augustów]], but does not include the town, as Augustów is an ''urban'' type gmina in its own right.

The legislative and controlling body of each gmina is the elected municipal council (''rada gminy''), or in a town: ''rada miasta'' (town assembly). Executive power is held by the directly elected [[mayor]] of the municipality, called ''[[wójt]]'' in rural gminy, ''burmistrz'' in most urban and urban-rural gminy, or ''prezydent'' in towns with more than 400,000 inhabitants and some others which traditionally use the title. A gmina may create auxiliary units (''jednostki pomocnicze''), which play a subordinate administrative role. In rural areas these are called [[sołectwo|sołectwa]], in towns they may be [[dzielnica|dzielnice]] or [[osiedle|osiedla]] and in an urban-rural gmina, the town itself may be designated as an auxiliary unit. For a complete listing of all the gminy in Poland, see ''[[List of Polish gminas]]''.

==Types of administrative tasks and objectives==
Each gmina carries out two types of tasks: its own tasks and commissioned ones. Own tasks are public tasks exercised by self-government, which serve to satisfy the needs of the community. The tasks can be twofold:

* compulsory – where the municipality cannot decline to carry out the tasks, and must set up a budget to carry them out in order to provide the inhabitants with the basic public benefits
* optional – where the municipality can carry them out in accordance with available budgetary means, set out only to specific local needs (on the gmina's own responsibility and budget).

===Own objectives ===
Own high objectives include matters such as spatial harmony, real estate management, environmental protection and nature conservation, water management, country roads, public streets, bridges, squares and traffic systems, water supply systems and source, the sewage system, removal of urban waste, water treatment, maintenance of cleanliness and order, sanitary facilities, dumps and council waste, supply of electric and thermal energy and gas, public transport, health care, welfare, care homes, subsidised housing, public education, cultural facilities including public libraries and other cultural institutions, historic monuments conservation and protection, the sports facilities and tourism including recreational grounds and devices, marketplaces and covered markets, green spaces and public parks, communal graveyards, public order and safety, fire and flood protection with equipment maintenance and storage, maintaining objects and devices of the public utility and administrative buildings, pro-family policy including social support for pregnant women, medical and legal care, supporting and popularising the self-government initiatives and cooperation within the commune including with non-governmental organizations, interaction with regional communities from other countries, etc.

=== Commissioned tasks ===
Commissioned tasks cover the remaining public tasks resulting from legitimate needs of the state, commissioned by central government for the units of local government to implement. The tasks are handed over on the basis of statutory by-laws, charters and regulations, or by way of agreements between the self-government units and central-government administration.

==History==
[[File:China Proper 1944.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of "China" in the 1944 American [[propaganda film]] ''[[The Battle of China]]'', distinguishing "[[China proper]]" from [[Manchuria]], "Mongolia" (here [[Pan-Mongolism|Greater Mongolia]] including [[Mongolia|the present country]], the [[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]], and [[Tuva]]), Sinkiang (modern [[Xinjiang]]), and [[Tibet]].]]
The term has been used for a long time, but with differing scope and connotations.

In the 1930s [[George Cressey]] used it to refer to the entire [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese Empire]], as opposed to [[China proper]].&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite journal
  | first = Harry
  | last = Harding
  | title = The Concept of 'Greater China': Themes, Variations and Reservations
  | journal = The China Quarterly
  | issue =  136, Special Issue: Greater China
  | pages = 660
  | date = December 1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Usage by the United States on government maps in the 1940s as a political term included territories [[History of the Republic of China|claimed by the Republic of China]] that were part of the previous empire, or geographically to refer to topographical features associated with China that may or may not have lain entirely within Chinese political borders.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt; 

The concept began to appear again in Chinese-language sources in the late 1970s, referring the growing commercial ties between the mainland and Hong Kong, with the possibility of extending these to Taiwan, with perhaps the first such reference being in a Taiwanese journal ''Changqiao'' in 1979.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt; 

The English term subsequently re-emerged in the 1980s to refer to the growing economic ties between the regions as well as the possibility of political unification.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt; It is not an institutionalized entity such as the [[European Union|EU]] or [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]. The concept is a generalization to group several markets seen to be closely linked economically and does not imply [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Aretz 2007"&gt;{{cite book  | first = Tilman  | last = Aretz  | title = The greater China factbook  | publisher = Taiwan Elite Press  | location = Taipei  | year = 2007  | url = http://www.books.com.tw/exep/prod/booksfile.php?item=0010380377  | isbn = 978-986-7762-97-9 &lt;!--9867762975--&gt;  | oclc = 264977502  | deadurl = no  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090131200221/http://www.books.com.tw/exep/prod/booksfile.php?item=0010380377  | archivedate = 2009-01-31  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political usage==
The term is often used to avoid invoking sensitivities over the [[political status of Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Aretz 2007"/&gt;  For some Asians, the term is a reminder of the "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]", a euphemism for the region controlled by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Guillaume Le Testu''', sometimes referred to as  '''Guillaume Le Têtu''' (c. 1509-12 &amp;ndash; April 29, 1573), was a [[France|French]] [[privateer]], explorer and navigator. He was one of the foremost [[cartographer]]s of his time and an author of the [[Dieppe maps]]. His maps were distinguished by their sophistication and detail; they influenced generations of cartographers, navigators and explorers.

Le Testu was successful as a privateer during the early years of the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In 1573, he and Sir [[Francis Drake]] attacked a Spanish mule train escorting gold and silver to [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] on the Atlantic coast of Panama, and he was subsequently killed following his capture by the Spanish.

Suggestions that Le Testu may have mapped (or even visited) [[Australia]] are based on: first, his maps' depiction of a large island (or continent), south of [[Java (island)|Java]], which Le Testu identified as the ''[[Jave la Grande]]'' ("Java Major" or "Great Java") mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] (and was otherwise known at the time as ''[[Terra Australis]]'') and second, Le Testu's incorporation in these maps of birds that resemble [[black swan]]s and [[cassowary|cassowaries]], which are both native to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, William. ''The Furthest Shore: Images of Terra Australis from the Middle Ages to Captain Cook''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. (pg. 23) {{ISBN|0-521-39268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not claim to have seen Jave la Grande in person and many cartographers at the time incorporated hypothetical, mythological or fantastic elements, a practice that is clearly also true of Le Testu.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Gregory C. ''The Piri Reis map of 1513''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2000. (pg. 45) {{ISBN|0-8203-2157-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maps also showed [[unicorn]]s and [[monster|monstrous creatures]] such as 200 metre long [[Serpent (symbolism)|giant snake]]s, [[basilisk]]s, [[satyrs]], [[Blemmyes]] (headless humans) and [[Cynocephalic]]s (dog-headed humans).&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, Andrew. ''Europe in the Sixteenth Century''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers, 2002. (pg. 228) {{ISBN|0-631-20704-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Testu's work was used by Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]] and [[French Huguenots]] hoping to establish themselves in [[Brazil]], [[Florida]], the Caribbean and even the ''Terra Australis'' derived from Le Testu's "Jave la Grande". However, these attempts were abandoned following Coligny's assassination in 1572 and Le Testu's death the following year.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;Quinn, David B. ''Explorers and Colonies: America, 1500-1625''. London: Hambleton Press, 1990. (pg. 63) {{ISBN|1-85285-024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Le Testu GRANDE JAVE.png|thumb|left|250px|Guillaume Le Testu, ''Jave la Grande'', in ''Cosmographie Universelle,'' 1555/56. &lt;br&gt;Note that North is to the left]]

Guillaume le Testu was born sometime around 1509&amp;ndash;12, in either [[Le Havre|Le Havre, Normandy]] or [[Grasse|Grasse, Provence]].

He was one of the last students to be taught [[cartography]] at the famed school of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkaEDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;ots=uZjFEd63ux&amp;dq=dieppe%20cartography%20school&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q=dieppe%20cartography%20school&amp;f=false|title=Ships on Maps: Pictures of Power in Renaissance Europe|last=Unger|first=R.|date=2010-08-04|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230282162|location=|pages=119–124|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Testu subsequently took part in voyages of exploration throughout the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

In 1550, Le Testu was commissioned by King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] to create a map of the Americas, particularly where the French were trading. In June 1551, he sailed to [[Brazil]] on both an exploration and reconnaissance mission from Henry II, charting as far as the [[Rio de la Plata]]. His ship, the ''Salamandre'',&lt;ref&gt;The [[salamander]] was a royal device favoured by Henry II and his father, Francis I.&lt;/ref&gt; reached as far south as 26 latitude a fair distance past present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In late December, he became involved in a firefight with two Portuguese ships near [[Trinidad]] and sustained heavy damage to his ship, although he was successful in mapping much of the South American coastline by the time of his return to Dieppe in July 1552.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, John T.

Le Testu was also involved in the founding of a French colony near [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1555.

In 1555 or 1556, Le Testu published a world atlas entitled ''Cosmographie Universelle selon les Navigateurs, tant anciens que modernes'' and was consequently awarded the title of ''Pilote Royale'' by Henry II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/marine/grand/d1-z14_005v.htm Cosmographie universelle, Guillaume Le Testu, Le Havre, 1556.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cosmographie Universelle'' contained 56 maps reportedly based on charts Le Testu had personally drawn by hand on his expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Buisseret, David, ed. ''Monarchs, Ministers, and Maps: The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992. (pg. 103) {{ISBN|0-226-07987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This atlas was dedicated to his mentor and patron Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], who had become leader of the [[Huguenots]] three years earlier. The manuscript was based on charts from French, Spanish and Portuguese sources supplied by Coligny. Included in this atlas were twelve charts of ''Jave le Grand/Terra Australis,'' which Le Testu located southward of the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]]. Le Testu commented: "However, what I have marked and depicted is only by imagination, and I have not noted or remarked on any of the commodities or incommodities of the place, nor its mountains, rivers or other things; for there has never yet been any man who has made a certain discovery of it."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Christian.

Three centuries later, the English scholar [[Edward Jenks]] suggested that a chart said to have been created in 1542 and later held by the [[British Museum]] may have been Le Testu's source for Jave la Grande.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, Edward. ''A History of the Australasian Colonies (From Their Foundation to the Year 1893)''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1895. (pg. 5-6)&lt;/ref&gt; Le Testu's ''Cosmographie Universelle'' (1555) and world atlas (1556) are both in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Marcus. ''History of the Continent of Australia and the Island of Tasmania (1787 to 1870)''. Melbourne: F.F. Bailliere, 1870. (pg. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;  The map, said Jenks, was said to have been “the property of a man named Rotz, a French sailor who passed some part of his life in England”.  Jenks commented: “this fact gives some colour to the claim put forward by the French, that their countryman, Guillaume le Testu, was  the true discoverer of Australia. The claim is based mainly upon the fact that Testu’s name appears on a map dated 1555, on which a southern continent, styled [[Jave la Grande]] (“Great Java”), is outlined. But this fact, of course, merely proves that Testu had heard of such a country..."

The next several years saw the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]], civil wars between the Huguenots and Catholics; in 1567, Le Testu sided with the Protestant Huguenots, conducting privateering raids for two years before his capture by the Catholics. He would remain imprisoned for over four years until he was released by order of King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], due to public interest on his behalf.

===Raid on Nombre de Dios and death===
On March 23, 1573, Le Testu unexpectedly encountered Sir [[Francis Drake]] near "Cabo de Cativas", near [[Cativá]], [[Panama]]. Le Testu was in command of the 80-ton warship ''Havre'' (or the ''New Haven'') with a crew of seventy; although it is unknown what Le Testu's mission was, he may have been there at the behest of an Italian sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Kris E. ''Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America''. Oxford, UK: Signal Books, 1999. (pg. 40) {{ISBN|1-902669-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly presented to Drake a [[scimitar]], formerly belonging to the ''[[condottiero]]'' [[Piero Strozzi]], as a gift on behalf of Coligny.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. ''Nineteen Years Captivity in the Highlands of Ceylon, March 1660 - October 1679''. New Delhi and Chennai: Asian Educational Services, 2004. (pg. xix) {{ISBN|81-206-1927-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this meeting, having brought news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], that he offered to join Drake in a final raid against a Spanish mule train en route to [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] before leaving the area.

He and Drake sailed their combined fleet to the "Francisco River" (probably Rio Cuango, near [[Cuango, Panama]]). Le Testu and Drake landed with their men just east of Nombre de Dios. Le Testu had 70 men under his command while Drake himself led 31 men including his [[Cimarron people (Panama)|Cimarron]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, John. ''Sir Francis Drake''. Random House UK, 2006. (pg. 72) {{ISBN|1-84413-762-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their ships sailed off, with orders to return for them in four days, the party headed inland to a spot two leagues south of the city, arriving on April 29, where they awaited the Spanish mule train. It was soon after their arrival that the party heard bells in the distance signaling the arrival of the caravan. Cimarrons scouts also warned of their approach reporting the size of the caravan consisting of almost 200 mules each carrying up to three hundred pounds of treasure. Drake had chosen the spot for the ambush, believing the Spaniards to be at their most vulnerable as they were nearing their destination after traveling through miles of jungle, to take the mule train off guard in a surprise attack. They drove off the Spanish guards, although at a cost of several Cimarron and Frenchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Peter. ''Sir Francis Drake''. New York: New York University Press, 2004. (pg. 34) {{ISBN|0-8147-9403-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was a complete success and nearly 30 tons of gold and silver were captured by Drake and Le Testu. Between 80,000-100,000 ''[[peso]]s'' in gold were taken by the privateers: in fact, there was so much treasure that the privateers were unable carry all the silver off and buried what remained. Le Testu's share came to £20,000. However, he was seriously wounded during the first assault and chose to rest with two of his men by the roadside until he was able to travel. As the rest of the party continued to meet the scheduled rendezvous with their fleet, they discovered a Spanish fleet waiting for them instead. Drake was forced to construct a raft and sail out to an island roughly three leagues offshore, where he contacted his own ships. Safely aboard with his crew once more, he sent a rescue party back for La Testu. When Drake's men returned, they reported that Le Testu and his men had been caught by Spanish soldiers and executed. Le Testu was beheaded. One of his men had also been tortured until he revealed the location of most of the buried silver.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Kenneth R. ''Trade, plunder and settlement: Maritime enterprise and the genesis of British Empire, 1480-1630''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1984. (pg. 131) {{ISBN|0-521-27698-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Testu's head was taken back to Nombre de Dios where it was displayed in the marketplace.

Drake's men had managed to find some silver which had been missed, which they brought back to split between the English and French crews before sailing back for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey, Harry. ''Sir Francis Drake: The Queen's Pirate''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1998. (pg. 63-64) {{ISBN|0-300-08463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving French  later complained the English had taken the majority of the proceeds, however.&lt;ref name="Quinn"/&gt;

It is possible that Le Testu mentioned plans for an expedition to Jave la Grand/Terra Australis to Drake and his associates, and/or otherwise inspired Drake's voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and circumnavigation of the world during 1576–1578.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''HERE WeGo''' (formerly '''HERE Maps''') is a maps and navigation application for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], and a desktop [[web mapping]] service, by [[Here (company)|HERE Global B.V.]]. Originally developed by [[Nokia]], the application was first released for [[Windows Phone]] and the [[World Wide Web]] in 2013 as a revamped version of Nokia Maps. HERE Maps was released to the [[Google Play]] Store on 10 December 2014 and later on the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] on 11 March 2015, and the name was changed to HERE WeGo in July 2016. Maps are updated at two- to three-month intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/04/here-updates-maps-for-android-ios-and-windows/|title=HERE updates maps worldwide for Android, iOS and Windows|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline, availability and compatibility==
In 2006, [[Nokia]] purchased a Berlin-based start-up, Gate5, with a mapping software called '''smart2go'''. In February 2007 Nokia announced that smart2go would be available free on the [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] Symbian platform and on [[Windows Mobile]] 5.0. It was pre-installed on handsets, including [[Nokia N95]], which featured [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pocketgpsworld.com/nokia-smart2go.php|title=Nokia launch smart2go a free mapping application|first=Mike|last=Barrett|website=www.pocketgpsworld.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007 the smart2go application was reworked into '''Ovi Maps''', named under the new umbrella [[Ovi (Nokia)|Ovi]] brand, released for S60 3rd Edition devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/5831_Nokia_Maps_10_rolled_out_for_a.php|title=Nokia Maps 1.0 rolled out for all|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, Nokia bought [[Navteq]], a provider of digital map systems.

Ovi Maps version 2.0 went into public [[beta]] in February 2008 and released in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/7340_Nokia_Maps_2_now_officially_av.php|title=Nokia Maps 2 now officially available|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3.0 was released in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/10009_Ovi_Maps_30_is_now_officially_.php|title=Ovi Maps 3.0 is now officially released (but you need a PC)|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turn-by-turn navigation and traffic information originally required a subscription, but in January 2010 Nokia announced that these would be provided for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11010_Nokias_Ovi_Maps_navigation_goe.php|title=Nokia's Ovi Maps navigation goes free|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it became '''Nokia Maps'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/08/03/why-3-car-giants-just-bought-nokias-mapping-division-for-3b/|title=Why 3 car giants just bought Nokia’s mapping business for $3B|date=3 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released for [[Nokia Lumia]] in November 2011, coming preloaded on the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/apps/2011/11/7/2544764/nokia-maps-ready-to-download-on-lumia-800-and-710-phones|title=Nokia Maps ready to download on Lumia 800 and 710 phones|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions for the [[Nokia N900]] and [[Nokia N9]] were also made.

In November 2012, Nokia rebranded Nokia Maps as HERE Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/21/review_nokia_here_ios_maps_app/|title=Nokia HERE iOS maps app review|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebranded version was first released for [[iOS]] and later in February 2013 for all [[Windows Phone 8]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2013/02/25/nokias-free-map-and-navigation-apps-now-available-for-more-windows-phones/|title=Nokia’s free map and navigation apps now available for more Windows Phones - Windows Experience BlogWindows Experience Blog|website=blogs.windows.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also released on the [[Nokia Asha platform]] and [[Firefox OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/03/nokias-here-maps-to-asha-501/|title=Nokia's Here Maps service comes to the Asha 501, beta release available now for download|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy [[Symbian]] and [[Series 40]] versions carried using the old name without HERE branding.

The HERE application was first announced for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] as a [[beta test]] version for some [[Samsung Galaxy]] smartphones on 29 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/08/29/here-samsung-galaxy-android/|title=Android fans rejoice: HERE for Samsung Galaxy smartphones|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was downloadable from 8 October 2014 from Samsung's Galaxy Apps Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/10/08/getting-started-android-basics/|title=Getting started with HERE for Android: the basics|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also launched on the same day for the [[Samsung Gear S]] smartwatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/08/29/here-samsung-gear-tizen/|title=HERE for Gear: apps inbound for Samsung Tizen|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public release of the beta HERE app (across all of the Android platform was on 21 October 2014, as an APK download from the HERE.com Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/10/21/here-for-all-android/|title=HERE for Android unleashed on more smartphones!|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app became available in the [[Google Play]] store from 10 December 2014.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; On 12 February 2015 a stable version of HERE was released on the Google Play store.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The Web site wego.here.com (formerly here.com) evolved out of the maps.ovi.com and then maps.nokia.com site and provides the Web companion to the HERE suite. It works on all major browsers. Users can organise their favourite places on collections and sync to mobile devices. The Web application also uses [[WebGL]] to offer 3D map views without a plug in. With 3D goggles users can get stereoscopic views of 25 cities.

In December 2015, HERE, at the time a division of Nokia, was sold to a consortium of German automotive companies (comprising [[Audi|Audi AG]], [[BMW|BMW AG]] and [[Daimler AG]]) as HERE Global BV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2015/08/03/nokia-completes-next-stage-of-transformation-with-agreement-to-sell-here-to-automotive-industry-consortium-at-an-enterprise-value-of-eur-28-billion Nokia completes next stage of transformation with agreement to sell HERE to automotive industry consortium at an enterprise value of EUR 2.8 billion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816051912/http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2015/08/03/nokia-completes-next-stage-of-transformation-with-agreement-to-sell-here-to-automotive-industry-consortium-at-an-enterprise-value-of-eur-28-billion# |date=16 August 2015 }}, Nokia.

On 15 March 2016 HERE announced that it would discontinue support for its app for [[Windows 10 Mobile]] on 29 March 2016 due to its use of "a workaround that will no longer be effective after June 30, 2016", and that the existing [[Windows Phone 8]] app will only receive critical updates after this date and no longer be actively developed. Here Maps licensed by [[Microsoft]] are still offered as part of the existing [[Bing Maps]]-based software on these devices.&lt;ref name="verge-herenomorewin"&gt;{{cite web |title=Here Maps drops support for Windows Phone and Windows 10|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11234462/here-maps-support-windows-phone-windows-10|website=The Verge|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2016 the mapping service was updated and re-branded '''HERE WeGo'''; the update first launched on Android, and is followed by an iOS version and a relaunch of the Web version. The update and rebranding focuses on navigation capabilities, including the addition of taxi fare information in some cities, and integration with Daimler's [[Car2Go]] service.&lt;ref name="gsma-herewego"&gt;{{cite web |title=Here Maps becomes Here WeGo, improved navigation options debut|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/here_maps_becomes_here_wego_improved_navigation_options_debut-blog-19643.php|website=GSMArena|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Some features are available offline with a downloaded map, others require a data connection, and some also require the user to be signed in.
===Turn-by-turn navigation===
HERE WeGo provides turn-by-turn navigation in both offline and online modes. Users can enter a destination address, landmark, or business name, and then the app automatically calculates directions and distance to the destination. Real-time traffic data (where available) is also factored and a prediction made on arrival time to the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/10/13/turn-turn-navigation-android-basics/|title=Turn-by-turn navigation with HERE for Android: The basics|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HERE WeGo formerly provided text-to-speech "Hi-Fi" navigation voices on Android, but eliminated them to focus on "bringing a larger variety of good quality voices instead of handful of Hi-Fi voices.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/31/getting-vocal-spoken-navigation/|title=Getting vocal about HERE spoken navigation|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transport, pedestrian, and bicycle navigation===
Public transport data is displayed by the HERE app whilst planning a route while online, for transport options such as buses and trains. Walking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/10/22/using-android-get-around-transit-foot/|title=Using HERE for Android to get around with transit and on foot|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cycling&lt;ref&gt;[http://360.here.com/2016/05/11/here-launches-beta-test-of-bike-routing-on-android/ HERE launches beta test of bike routing on Android], 360 Here. Retrieved 6 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; routes are also supported. Time and distance estimates are provided for these modes, and driving navigation.

Full transit information is available in Switzerland, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, The Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, and Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/08/26/here-expands-city-to-city-transit-coverage-to-14-countries/|title=HERE expands city-to-city transit coverage to 14 countries|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partial support for transport directions in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.here.com/android/HEREapp/#g277|title=HERE Maps|work=here.com|access-date=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704112850/https://help.here.com/android/HEREapp/#g277#g277|archive-date=4 July 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time traffic and reversible lane traffic===
{{As of|2017|3}} Here WeGo had real-time information on traffic conditions and incidents available for 63 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://360.here.com/2017/03/23/expands-real-time-traffic-coverage-63-countries/|title=HERE expands real-time traffic coverage to 63 countries|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2015 Here added real-time traffic for reversible express lanes across the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/07/02/here-adds-reversible-lanes-traffic/|title=HERE adds reversible lanes traffic to Android, iOS, and more|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='Collections' and location sharing===
Users can save the location and details of  destinations as 'Collections' if they are online and signed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/04/29/managing-collections-here-android-ios/|title=Managing Collections with HERE for Android and iOS|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to store destinations offline, on the device. Location can be shared by several methods, including the Glympse system, [[Google+]], [[Facebook Messenger]], [[email]], and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2014/12/17/sync-share-plan-routes-collections-android/|title=Sync, share and plan routes with Collections on HERE for Android|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|10|23}} there was no option to sort collections by name or distance in the Web, Android, and iOS versions.

===Offline maps===
Here WeGo can download maps of countries to internal storage, so that a data connection is not needed for navigation. Online usage provides live traffic data and additional venue information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/06/03/offline-navigation-really-matters-500mb-data-costs-week-wages/|title=Offline navigation really matters if 500&amp;nbsp;MB of data costs a week in wages|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps include floor-by-floor details of some large indoor venues such as shopping malls and airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/02/18/get-inside-venue-maps-now-android/|title=Get inside Venue Maps – now on HERE for Android|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Street view===
Street-level views had been available in the past, but no longer are.

====Future coverage====
There is a Web page "HERE car drive schedule - Drive schedule for our map data collection cars", with entries typically for the current and next month&lt;!--but I don't know what it means--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legal.here.com/terms/driveschedule|title=here.com vehicles drive schedule|work=here.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Download statistics==
Statistics published by HERE state that it reached 1,000,000 downloads on the Android platform a couple of weeks after launch and, 12 weeks after its launch, reached 2.5 million downloads,&lt;ref name="360.here.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/03/11/official-everywhere/|title=It's official – HERE is everywhere|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing to 3 million by mid-February 2015,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.here.com/2015/02/12/here-android-updated-improved/|title=HERE for Android updated and improved, leaves beta|work=HERE 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 4 million through the Google Play store alone by March 2015.&lt;ref name="360.here.com" /&gt; By 4 August 2015  Google Play downloads had increased to 5 million, and to 10 million by early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&amp;hl=en|title=HERE Maps – Android Apps on Google Play|author=Nokia Apps LLC|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous versions==

===Symbian^3/Belle===
&lt;!--- Symbian and Asha versions are relevant to the subject as Nokia Maps used to be exclusive to what were at the time Nokia (now Microsoft Mobile Oy) platforms, also as I've told the Indian IP author before just because a product isn't currently supported doesn't mean that we should immediately delete it from Wikipedia in the name of "updation", please keep the Symbian and Asha sections intact, also the usage of past tense indicate that its availability is historic and not current so deleting them does not equal "updation" ---&gt;
HERE was available on the [[Symbian^3]] platform under the name Nokia Maps. The latest, and the last, Version 3.09 included:
*Driving and walking turn-by-turn with international voice guidance
*Live traffic rerouting in some countries
*Live traffic visualisation on the map in some countries
*Third-party content such as [[ViaMichelin]] and [[Lonely Planet]]
*[[Social networking service]] integration
*Support for preloading street maps for offline use
*Users can report errors in the maps (from version 3.03 except on [[Nokia E66]] and [[Nokia E71|E71]] models)&lt;ref name="Nokia errors 1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Map reporter FAQ |url=http://www.nokia.com/za-en/support/faq/?action=singleFAQ&amp;caseid=FA133108_en_US}}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nokia blog errors 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Custom 3.03 version for Nokia E71 and Nokia E66|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11363_Nokia_E71_and_E66_get_Ovi_Maps.php|author=Rafe Blandford|date=6 April 2010|access-date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Local weather conditions by the hour and forecasts for the week
*Night View mod
*Satellite maps and terrain maps
*3D buildings and 3D maps
*Public transport routing in some cities
*Saving of [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|favourites]]
*City Lens (augmented reality) (Beta only)&lt;ref name="phonearena AR 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nokia outsources Symbian support which will continue until 2016|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Nokia-outsources-Symbian-support-which-will-continue-until-2016_id22661|date=4 October 2011|access-date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia stated that the Nokia 808 from 2012 would be the last Symbian phone;&lt;ref name="TC last Symbian phone 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/nokia-confirms-the-pure-view-was-officially-the-last-symbian-phone|title=Nokia Confirms The PureView Was Officially The Last Symbian Phone|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=24 January 2013|access-date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbian development then stopped. Accenture was responsible for maintenance of Symbian and Nokia Maps until 2016.&lt;ref name="phonearena AR 1" /&gt;

The supported phones were:
*Version 3.09 (12 November 2012, also called Maps Suite 2.0): only for Symbian Belle phones (500, 603, 700, 701, N8-00, E7-00, C7-00, C6-01, X7-00, E6-00)
*Version 3.08 (15 November 2011) and 3.07: supported on Symbian^3
*Version 3.06 (2 December 2010): Symbian S60v5 (N97, N97 mini, X6, C6-00, 5800XM, 5235 &amp; 5230, etc.)
*Version 3.04 (20 May 2010): Symbian S60v3 FP2

===Asha/S40===
Maps for S40 were limited compared to other platforms. The maps were streamed online into the device or pre-downloaded with [[Nokia Suite]]. In some markets the phones were sold with an SD card preloaded with local maps. The system did not support turn-by-turn navigation. Asha series phones did not have GPS receivers; positioning was done by [[Cell ID]] of the cellular network or by using the [[Wi-Fi positioning system]].

'''Joannes Disma Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld''' (Slovenized as ''Ivan'' or ''Janez Dizma Florjančič de Grienfeld''; July 1, 1691 – 1757) was a [[Carniola]]n astronomer, mathematician, geographer, and cartographer.

==Life and work==
Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld was born in [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name="Glonar"&gt;[http://www.slovenska-biografija.si/oseba/sbi189985/ Glonar Joža. 1926. Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld, Ivan Dizma.

Študij in znanost Ivana Dizma Florjančiča. ''Bogoslovni vestnik'' 70(3): 379–390.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in a series of important church functions, finishing his career in 1757 as the [[archdeacon]] of [[Stična Abbey]]. In 1744, he published the first map of [[Carniola]], titled ''Ducatus Carnioliae Tabula Chorographica'' (Chorographic Map of the Duchy of Carniola) at a scale of 1:111,000.&lt;ref&gt;Adelung, Johann Christoph. 1787.

Göttingen: Joh. Christian Dieterich, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a book on [[gnomonics]] and a work on measuring time, and built his own observatory. From his writings it is clear that he was familiar with the methods of astronomy at the time. His two Latin manuscripts, which are held by the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]] in Ljubljana, preserve many essays on astronomy and mathematics, tables with instructions for making astronomical calculations, tables and a theory about the movement of the Sun and to some extent also the Moon and the planets for the Gregorian calendar for the Ljubljana [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], a geometry manual, writings about [[squaring the circle]], and his own observations on the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref name="Glonar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Juznic"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5803">'''Khurd''' and '''Kalan''' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]: ख़ुर्द और कलाँ, خرد اور کلاں [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਖੁਰਦ ਜਾਂ ਕਲਾਂ) are administrative designations used in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] to indicate the smaller (Khurd) and larger (Kalan) segments of a town, village or settlement. They are usually added after place names. For instance, [[Berote Khurd]] and [[Berote Kalan]] in [[Abbottabad District]] in the [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province, [[Dangoh Khurd]] in [[Una District]] of [[Himachal Pradesh]] and the famous [[Dariba Kalan]] jewellery market in [[Delhi]], there was also a smaller street near by, known as Dariba Khurd or Chhota Dariba, both mean small, now known as Kinari Bazaar.&lt;ref name=bigexp&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Bazaar|author=Danish Shafi|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/latest-news/big-bazaar/230560/|publisher=Indian Express|date=Oct 21, 2007|accessdate=May 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130616134950/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/latest-news/big-bazaar/230560/|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Upper Chambal Basin: A Geographical Study in Rural Settlements|author=Moti Lal Nath|publisher=Northern Book Centre|year= 1989|isbn=8185119597 |page=47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIgBKeSXF4AC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Khurd++Kalan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T_edUd5ah4GuB_DkgNAI&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Khurd%20%20Kalan&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the former [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] territory, the word [[Budruk]] is used instead of "Kalan". It is a corruption of the Persian word for "greater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maratha town and city planning with reference to the systems of village development during 17th and 18th centuries |chapter=Provincial divisions Administration Of Maratha province During 17th to 18th Centuries |author=Avinash Sowani |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manipur]], Khullen and Khunou are used.

:''For the head of state post-1504, see [[Lord of Mann]].''
The '''King of Mann''' ({{Lang-gv|Ree Vannin}}) was the title taken between 1237{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and 1504 by the various rulers, both [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[suzerainty|suzerain]], over the Kingdom of Mann – the [[Isle of Man]] which is located in the [[Irish Sea]], at the centre of the [[British Isles]].

==Kingdom of Mann and the Isles (before 1237)==
[[File:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|right|The [[Kingdom of the Isles]] about the year 1100. The Isle of Man is the southernmost island in red.]]
:''See [[Kingdom of the Isles]]'' and ''[[List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles]]''
Since the emergence of [[Somerled]] and [[Clann Somhairle|his descendants]] in the 12th century, the Manx kings began to lose territory and power in the [[Hebrides]]. Before the reigns of the three sons of [[Olaf the Black]], the Manx kings styled themselves "King of the Isles". By the time of the reigns of Olaf's sons, the kings had begun to style themselves "King of Mann and the Isles".

*[[Haraldr Guðrøðarson|Harald Godredson]] (1249–1252)
*[[Magnus Olafsson]] (1252–1265)

==Scottish and English rule (1265–1333)==

Between 1265 and 1333, Mann was ruled directly by the kings of Scots (1265–1290, 1293–1296, 1313–1317, 1328–1333) or the kings of England (1290–1293, 1296–1313,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v2p139.htm pp139/140 - Manx Soc vol 7 'Monumenta de Insula Manniae - Vol 2' - Resumption of Island by Edward I 1307&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 1317–1328).

==Independent kingdom (1333–1399)==
[[File:Castle Rushen.jpg|thumb|[[Castle Rushen]], [[Castletown, Isle of Man]], the stronghold on the island of the Kings and Lords of Mann]] 
On 9 August 1333 [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] renounced all English claims over the Isle of Man, and recognised it as an independent kingdom under its then King, [[William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury]].

{{cquote|''Totum jus et clamium quod habemus, habuimus vel aliquo modo habere poterimus, in Insula de Man cum suis pertinentiis quibuscumque; ita quod nec Nos, nec haeredes nostri, seu quivis alius nostro nomine, aliquid juris vel clamii in Insula praedicta de caetero exigere poterimus vel vindicare.''|30px|30px}}
{{cquote|The whole right and claim that We have, We have had, or in any manner shall We be able to have in the future, in the island of Man with all its privileges, so that neither We, nor Our heirs, or any other in Our name, will not demand or avenge in the future the aforesaid right or claim to the island.|30px|30px|Renunciation of claim to Mann by Edward III, 1333&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v2p183.htm pp183/184 - Manx Soc vol 7 'Monumenta de Insula Manniae - Vol 2']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|William le Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire]] was the last King of Mann in this line, claiming descent from the House of [[Godred Crovan]], the earlier Norse Rulers.

William le Scrope was executed for treason for his support of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in his struggle with Henry Bolingbroke, who defeated Richard and became [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]. Le Scrope's possessions, including the Isle of Man, passed to the Crown.

===Kings of Mann in this period===
*[[William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William, Earl of Salisbury]] (1333–1344)
*[[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|William, Earl of Salisbury]] (1344–1392)
*[[William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|William, Earl of Wiltshire]] (1392–1399)

==English suzerainty (1399–1504)==
As Henry's predecessor, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], had recognised Mann as an independent kingdom, Henry IV did not directly claim the Manx throne, but instead proclaimed that he had acquired the island by [[right of conquest]], which in international legal theory at that time erased any existing constitutional arrangements. He then on 19 October 1399 granted the Island, as a fiefdom under the English Crown, to [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]] together with wide-ranging powers of government and associated regalities, together with the style of 'Lord of Man', in a position of [[feudality]] and thus without [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v2p215.htm pp215/219 - Manx Soc vol 7 'Monumenta de Insula Manniae - Vol 2' - Concession of the Isle of Man by Service of the Lancaster Sword, 1399&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Percy styled himself as 'King of Mann'.

{{cquote|''We have given and granted … to the said Earl of Northumberland the Island, Castle, Peel and Lordship of Man, and all the islands and lordships appertaining to the said Isle of Man, which belonged to Sir William le Scrope deceased, whom in his life We lately conquered, and so have decreed him conquered, and which by reason of that conquest, as having been conquered, We seized into Our hands; which decree and conquest as touching the person of the said William and all his lands and tenements, goods and chattels, as well within as without Our Kingdom, in Our Parliament by the assent of the Lords temporal … at the petition of the Commons of Our said Kingdom, are confirmed …''|30px|30px|Letters-patent of 19 October 1399&lt;ref&gt;"An Abstract of the Laws, Customs and Ordinances of the Isle of Man", James Gell, [[Manx Society]]: Douglas, 10/23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following Percy's treasonous rebellion, Henry IV granted the [[suzerainty]] of the Isle of Man, on similar terms but only for the term of his life, to [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|Sir John Stanley]] in 1405.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v2p232.htm pp232/234 - Manx Soc vol 7 'Monumenta de Insula Manniae - Vol 2' - Respecting the Grant of the Isle of Mann, 1405&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, but separate from the power of governance over the Island, John Stanley was also granted the patronage of the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]].

A second letters-patent were issued and re-granted to Sir John Stanley on 6 April 1406, the difference being that the grant was inheritable and had a different feudal fee, the service of which comprised rendering [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and a [[tribute]] of two falcons to all future Kings of England on their [[coronation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;'History of the Isle of Man', Hannah Bullock (Longman) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kings of Mann in this period===
*[[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Henry, Earl of Northumberland]] (1399–1405)
*[[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|John Stanley]] (1405–1414)
*[[John II Stanley of the Isle of Man|John Stanley]] (1414–1437)
*[[Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley|Thomas, Lord Stanley]] (1437–1459)
*[[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Earl of Derby]] (1459–1504)

==Lord of Mann (1504—present)==
{{see|Lord of Mann}}
[[Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby]], the son of [[Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby]], did not take the [[style (manner of address)|style]] 'King', and he and his successors were generally known instead as [[Lord of Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castletown.org.im/heritage/castle_rushen_p4.html Castletown - Ancient Capital of Mann - Castle Rushen - Kings and Lords of Mann&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Latin style ''Rex Manniae et Insularum'' (King of Mann and the Isles) continued to be occasionally used in official documents until at least the 17th century.

In 1765 the title was [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765|revested]] in [[the Crown]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]; thus today the title, Lord of Mann, is used by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.three.fm/news/isle-of-man-news/lord-of-mann-receives-congratulations-for-time-in-service/ Her Majesty The Queen received a letter from Tynwald this week congratulating her on becoming the longest serving Lord of Mann. 12 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-business/iom-post-office-commemorates-queens-reign/ IOM Post Office commemorates Queen's reign - Manx Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape detailing''' describes the process of integrating soft landscape materials and hard landscape materials to create a [[landscape design]]. It requires knowledge of:
*[[Landscape architecture]]
*[[Landscape engineering]]
*[[Soft landscape materials]]
*[[Hard landscape materials]]
*[[Landscape products]]
Designing Landscape detailing can be boiled down to three different steps:Function, Structure, and Appearance. Function allows you to satisfy the requirements of the landscape to serve a purpose. Structure is the physical implementation of function through the best available resources; usually those of a local character. Appearance is about obtaining visual satisfaction, commonly known as aesthetic values.

Landscape detailing can influence the attitude and mood of a landscape. A study was conducted on how young people feel when in a natural oriented landscape versus an engineered habitat. The results showed that more structured landscapes are preferred in young people. Detailing in landscape allows the designer to make choices that help influence the landscape; allowing the potential to be shown.(1)

Landscape can have an influence on how communities and societies evolve and vice verse. Communities can shape how the landscape is used based on the needs of the community. We can see an example of this in Canada's landscape and the role the railroads had in shaping the community. With the introduction of the railroad, Canada's wild lands were more susceptible to exploitation. On the contrary to that, the railroad system also allowed the community to experience Canada's array of National Parks.(2)

Landscape detailing is not just limited to actual land, but can also be seen as a way to improve waterfront area; making the waterfront a more appealing setting for the public to enjoy. Typically when addressing the relationship of landscape detailing and water, we think of drainage and how the landscape can be manipulated to serve the user; as to prevent flooding and maintain water flows.(3)

With today's every expanding technologies, there has been an increase in ways to convey landscape detailing. The visualization tools can be split into two categories; traditional and computerized. Traditional ways to convey details in the landscape would be simply a pen/pencil, paper maps, and models; while the computerized way would to use GIS, 3D virtual modelling,or simulations using layers of photography to convey urban areas that have potential to be molded. (4)

Aesthetics are an important part of Landscape Detailing,the visual quality of a landscape is what is noticed by others and therefore the goal is to achieving pleasing aesthetic without creating a synthetic feel. Art and design are also qualities that enhance the landscape. Artistic influence has a direct role in planning a landscape.(5)

__NOTOC__
In a 2005 [[NASA]]-sponsored study, it was estimated that the area covered by '''[[lawn]]s''' in the '''[[United States]]''' to be about {{convert|128,000|km2|sqmi}}, making it the nation's largest [[irrigation|irrigated]] crop by area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Lawn "Looking for Lawns"] - general interest article about the NASA study&lt;/ref&gt; Lawn care is thus a popular business in the United States; proper maintenance, construction and management of lawns of various kinds being the focus of much of the modern [[horticulture]] industry. Estimates of the amount spent on professional lawn care services vary, but a Harris Survey put the total at $28.9 billion in 2002 (approximately $1,200 per household using such services).

In her book ''The Lawn: A History of an American Obsession'' (1994) Virginia Scott Jenkins traces the historic desire to kill [[weed]]s. She notes that the current rage for a chemically dependent lawn emerged after World War II and argues that "American front lawns are a symbol of man's control of, or superiority over, his environment."

According to the EPA, "of the 26 billion gallons of water consumed daily in the United States, approximately 7.8 billion gallons, or 30 percent, is devoted to outdoor uses. The majority of this is used for irrigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/greenhomes/ConserveWater.htm "Conserving Water"] - EPA tips to conserve water &lt;/ref&gt;

Along with trees, lawns are a vital element in the fight against [[urban heat island]]ing.  Lawns provide:
* Oxygen conversion,
* Filtering of air particulates,
* [[Erosion control]],
* Air and surface cooling to offset asphalt, cement, and rooftops,
* A place for recreation and enjoyment.

In comparison to bare dirt, a lawn may be 20 °F cooler on a hot day, and up to 40 °F cooler than cement surfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Copyright]] is the right to copy and publish a particular work. The terms "copy" and "publish" are quite broad. They also cover copying in electronic form, the making of translated versions, the creation of a television program based on the work, and putting the work on the Internet. A work is protected by copyright if it is a literary or artistic work. This is quite a broad expression, and almost all products of creative and original effort are copyrighted. Note that copyright protects only specific expressions of an idea, not the idea itself. A collection of facts may be copyrighted, assuming there is some creative activity involved in compiling the collection. Several countries provide a separate protection regime for collections of facts that qualify as "databases", but this regime has nothing to do with copyright. Copyright protection is automatic upon creation of the work. In some countries, registration with a Copyright Office has some benefits (like the ability to sue, or to receive more money in damages). When a work's copyright term ends, the work passes into the [[public domain]].

==Berne Convention==
[[File:Berne Convention signatories.svg|alt=Map of the world showing signatory states of the Berne Convention|thumb|Signatory states of the Berne Convention]]
The [[Berne Convention]] stipulates that the duration of the term for copyright protection is the life of the author plus at least 50 years after their death. For some categories of works, the minimum duration is shorter. For example, the minimum term for applied art is 25 years. Movies have a minimum term of 50 years. Countries may choose a longer term of protection, and most countries have done so.

In Berne-signatory countries, the duration of copyright is dependent on the duration of the author's life. Berne requires that copyright exist until a minimum of 50 years after the author's death. A number of countries, including the European Union and the United States, have extended that to 70 years after the author's death. A small number of countries have extended copyright further. The current lengthiest term is 100 years after the death of the author (Mexico).

===United States===
In 1989, the Berne Convention became effective in the U.S., and from that moment on also U.S. authors automatically obtained copyright on their works. However, many U.S. texts on copyright still echo the old registration principle, which can be very confusing at times.

To confuse matters even more, the requirement for registration has not been abolished completely in the U.S. To start a lawsuit against infringers, it is still necessary to register the work in some countries. Further, registration offers the possibility to obtain statutory damages, rather than only the actual damages from the infringer.

===European Union===
All countries within the European Union are signatory states of the Berne Convention. Additionally, [[Copyright law of the European Union|Copyright in the European Union]] is regulated through European Directives. The member states of the European Union have, following a directive, increased the term to life of the author and 70 years after their death. Although this was not the original intention, this extension applies retroactively. Works that had ended up in the public domain because the author was dead for 50 years received an additional twenty years of protection.

Most European countries, on the other hand, follow the principle that '''copyright protection is granted automatically''' upon creation of the work. This principle was first laid down in the Berne Convention (1886). The Berne Convention specifically forbids (in article 5) any member country to require any formality for getting copyright protection.

==Copyright durations by country==
This is a list of countries and their [[copyright term]]s, the lengths of their standard [[copyright]]s, in years. The table includes entries for non-country entities: the [[European Union]], [[Berne Convention]], and the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], which set minimum terms for their member states or signatories. The [[Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), though not included, requires a copyright length of at least 50 years after death.

===Legend===
* 0, no copyright = Not copyrighted
* Life + xx years = Copyrighted for authors' lifetime plus xx years after their deaths
* xx years after publication, creation, etc. = copyrighted for xx years since publication, creation, etc., of works
* Until year end = Copyrighted until the end of a calendar year, i.e. December 31, unless otherwise specified
* Berne = Country has signed the [[Berne Convention#Copyright term|Berne Convention]], see Berne in the "Countries, ..." column
* TRIPS = The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]) is an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation as applied to nationals of other WTO Members.This also indicates that this country has at least a minimum of 50 years after the death of the creator until the copyright expires.
* WCT = The [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty]], (WIPO Copyright Treaty or WCT), is an international treaty on copyright law adopted by the member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996.

"Norway also has some peculiar laws that protect «simple» photographs. I.e. photographs, such as snapshots, that are below the threshold of originality to merit copyright protection are given neighbouring rights protection.
[..]
The Norwegian copyright act does not address public domain directly.
The Norwegian copyright law defines two basic rights for authors: economic rights and moral rights.
[..]
For material that is outside the scope of copyright, the phrase «i det fri» («in the free») is used. This corresponds roughly to the term «public domain» in English. Norwegian copyright law makes a distinction between copyright and neighbouring rights. Only creative and artistic works are subject to copyright. Some other types of works are protected by so‐called neighbouring rights."&lt;ref name="Norway"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20483">The '''list of postcode areas in the United Kingdom''' is a tabulation of the [[postcode]] areas used by [[Royal Mail]] for the purposes of directing mail within the [[United Kingdom]]. The postcode area is the largest geographical unit used and forms the initial characters of the alphanumeric [[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|UK postcode]].&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{Cite book |title=Address Management Guide |edition=5th |publisher=Royal Mail Group plc |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.royalmail.com/marketing-services/address-management-unit/address-data-products/address-management-guide |accessdate=22 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108053647/http://www.royalmail.com/marketing-services/address-management-unit/address-data-products/address-management-guide |archivedate=8 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 121 geographic postcode areas in use in the UK and a further 3 often combined with these covering the Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and Isle of Man.

==Subdivision==
Each postcode area is further divided into [[List of post towns in the United Kingdom|post town]]s and [[List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|postcode district]]s.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; There are on average 20 postcode districts to a postcode area.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; The [[London postal district|London]] post town is instead divided into several postcode areas.&lt;ref name=inner&gt;HMSO, ''The Inner London Letter Post'', (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The single or pair of letters chosen for postcode areas are generally intended as a [[mnemonic]] for the places served.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; Postcode areas, [[post town]]s and postcode districts do not follow political boundaries and usually serve much larger areas than the place names with which they are associated. For example, within the PA postcode area the PA1 and PA78 postcode districts are 140 miles apart; and the eight postcode areas of the [[London postal district|London post town]] cover only 40% of [[Greater London]].&lt;ref name=inner/&gt; The remainder of its area is covered by sections of twelve adjoining postcode areas: [[EN postcode area|EN]], [[IG postcode area|IG]], [[RM postcode area|RM]], [[DA postcode area|DA]], [[BR postcode area|BR]], [[TN postcode area|TN]], [[CR postcode area|CR]], [[SM postcode area|SM]], [[KT postcode area|KT]], [[TW postcode area|TW]], [[HA postcode area|HA]] and [[UB postcode area|UB]].&lt;ref name=inner/&gt;

==Defunct postcode areas==

===London NE and S===
{{further|London postal district#Abolition of NE and S divisions and retraction of E division}}

===Glasgow===
Glasgow, like London, was divided into compass districts: C, W, NW, N, E, SE, S, SW. When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new ''G'' postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. As NW and SE had never been subdivided they became G20 and G40 respectively.

===Norwich and Croydon===
Norwich and Croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s, which was replaced by the current system. The format was of the form NOR or CRO followed by two numbers and a letter, e.g. NOR 07A.

==Non-geographic postcodes==
{{further|Postcodes in the United Kingdom#Non-geographic codes}}

Note that a number of non-geographic postcode sectors are also contained within geographic postcode areas.

===GIR===
GIR 0AA is a postcode created for [[Girobank]] in [[Bootle]]. It remained in use by its successors when Girobank was taken over by [[Alliance &amp; Leicester]] and subsequently by [[Santander UK]].

===BF===
The BF postcode area was introduced in 2012 to provide optional postcodes for [[British Forces Post Office]] addresses, for consistency with the layout of other UK addresses. It uses the national non-geographic [[post town]] "[[BFPO]]" and, as of 2012, the postcode district "BF1".

===BX===
The non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality: this allows large organisations long-term flexibility as to where they receive their mail.  This postcode area is used by [[Lloyds Banking Group]] (BX1 1LT) and parts of the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] like VAT Central Unit (BX5 5AT) and Pay as You Earn (BX9 1AS).  Lloyds Bank also use BX4.

===QC===

Engineering in the Americas [[Pre-Columbian era|before the arrival]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] was advanced in [[agriculture]], [[hydrology]], [[irrigation systems]], [[transportation]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]] and [[astronomy]]. In addition [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] made extensive use of [[Native American use of fire|fire to change the landscape and to create open areas for farming and hunting]]. Examples of [[pre-Columbian]] engineering from different indigenous civilizations can be found across North and South America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1105">'''Natural lines of drift''' are those paths across terrain that are the most likely to be used when going from one place to another.  These paths are [[Path of least resistance|paths of least resistance]]: those that offer the greatest ease while taking into account obstacles (e.g. rivers, cliffs, dense unbroken woodland, etc.) and modes of transit (e.g. pedestrian, automobile, horses.).  Common endpoints or fixed points may include water sources, food sources, and obstacle passages such as fords or bridges.

Local paths may be derived from game trails or from artificial paths created by utility lines or political boundaries.  Property ownership and land use may also be factors in determining local variation.

Improved paths may also be partially defined by the logistics necessary to build roads or railways.

[[Image:Omelek Island.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view]]
'''Omelek Island''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|m|əl|ɛ|k}}; [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]]: '''{{lang|mh|Kom̧le}}''', pronounced {{IPAc-mh|kw|woh|mh|^hoy|l|yoy|oy}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel2.com/MOD/LocK.htm#Kuwajleen |title=Marshallese-English Dictionary - Place Name Index |publisher=Trussel2.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; is part of the [[Kwajalein|Kwajalein Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands|Republic of the Marshall Islands]]. It is controlled by the [[United States military]] under a long-term lease (along with ten other islands in the [[atoll]]) and is part of the [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]].

==Geography==
The Island is about {{convert|32000|sqm|acre}} in size.  Geologically, it is composed of [[reef|reef-rock]], as are the other islands in the atoll, which is created by the accumulation of marine organism remnants ([[coral]]s, [[Mollusca]], etc.)

==History==
{{update section|date=October 2018}}
[[Image:Kawajalein Omelek.png|right|thumb|Map of Kwajalein Atoll]]
Omelek has long been used by the [[United States]] for small research [[rocket launch]]es due to its relative isolation in the South Pacific.  The last U.S. government rocket launch occurred in 1996.

After 2000, the island's [[equator]]ial proximity and nearby radar tracking infrastructure attracted [[SpaceX]], an [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] launch provider, which updated facilities on the island and established it as their primary launch location by 2006. SpaceX began launching [[Falcon 1]] rockets from Omelek in 2006. [[Falcon 1 Flight 4]], the first successful [[Private spaceflight|privately funded]], [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-propelled]] orbital [[launch vehicle]], was launched from Omelek Island on 28 September 2008 and was followed by another Falcon 1 launch on 13 July 2009, placing [[RazakSAT]] into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon/005/status.html |title=Falcon Launch Report &amp;#124; Mission Status Center |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omelek was planned to host launches for the upgraded [[Falcon 1e]] rocket,&lt;ref name=gsc20130919&gt;
{{cite web |title=Falcon-1e|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_lau_det/falcon-1e.htm |work=Gunter's Space Page |publisher=skyrocket.de |accessdate=2013-12-06 |date=2013-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slr20090718&gt;
{{cite web |title=SpaceX Falcon Data Sheet |url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/falcon.html |date=2009-07-18 |publisher=Space Launch Report |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but {{asof|2012|lc=y}}, SpaceX stopped development on the Falcon 1e launches while it focused on its large Falcon 9 launch manifest.

SpaceX had tentatively planned to upgrade the launch site for use by the [[Falcon 9]] launch vehicle.  {{as of|December 2010}}, the SpaceX launch manifest listed Omelek (Kwajalein) as a potential site for several Falcon 9 launches,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/08/spacex-has-magical-goals-for-falcon-9/]&lt;/ref&gt; the first in 2012.&lt;ref name="SpaceX Launch Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Manifest|url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php|publisher=SpaceX|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Falcon 9 Overview document offered Kwajalein as a launch option.&lt;ref name=SxLaunchCost20101206&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php#pricing_and_performance|
title=Falcon 9 Overview, Performance |publisher=''SpaceX'' |date=2010 |accessdate=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In any event, SpaceX did not make the upgrades necessary to support Falcon 9 launches from the atoll.

The Reagan Test Site, which includes rocket launch sites on other islands in the Kwajalein Atoll, on [[Wake Island]], and at [[Aur Atoll]], is the only U.S. government equatorial launch facility.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A country within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba has no administrative subdivisions. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|193|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and lies outside the [[hurricane belt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8746">'''Pardo''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: פרדו) is a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] surname.  Members of the Pardo family have mostly distinguished themselves in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11906-pardo|title=Pardo|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The name belongs to [[Jewish]] people who settled due to their [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; and today in countries like [[Israel]], [[Spain]], [[Colombia]], [[Curaçao]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].  Many members of the family were scattered throughout [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where they became known as [[Brown (surname)|Brown]] or [[Browne]].&lt;ref name="tzorafolk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tzorafolk.com/genealogy/history/pardo.htm|title=The Pardo (Prado) Family|year=1999|accessdate=Oct 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of Jewish life are known in the Iberian Peninsula from the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], where those [[Jewish exile|exiled Jews]] of [[Jerusalem]] were already in those territories, including those dubbed Pardus by the Romans themselves; however we must go back to the years after the [[expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] (1492), and afterwards [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|from Portugal]] (1496). This [[diaspora]] within the diaspora, which gave rise to the [[Sephardim]], led many to settle in cities in the [[Ottoman Empire]], in many cases sponsored by the same authorities of the empire that not only were welcoming this group of immigrants, but also preferred installation in areas that had been conquered not long ago and where they wanted to strengthen its sovereignty. This name is after the various [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]] spread by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; many Jews were forced to leave Spain and emigrated to territories of Europe including [[Thessalonica]], [[Bitola]] (city of ancient [[Republic of Macedonia]]), Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Serbia, and Bosnia, and after the [[conquest of the Americas]], the new [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]]. However, persecution later continued in the colonies under the Court of the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]].

Today this name is very common among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] in [[Israel]]; other common surnames are [[Levy (surname)|Levy]], [[Sarfati]], [[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]], [[Ovadia]], [[Albalak]], [[Azulai]], and [[Pinto (surname)|Pinto]].  The Pardo surname which apparently originated in [[Prado del Rey]] flourished during the 16th–18th centuries in the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[England]], and the [[America|Americas]].  The place-name Prado is derived from the Spanish word prado, which means meadow. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word pardo means brownish grey.{{Infobox surname

'''Remote sensing techniques in archaeology''' are an increasingly important component of the technical and methodological tool set available in [[archaeology|archaeological]] research.&lt;ref name="Rindfuss and Stern"&gt;Rindfuss,Ronald R and Stern, Paul C. Linking Remote Sensing and Social Science: The Need and the New Challenges.''People and Pixels: Linking Remote Sensing and Social Science.''National Academy Press.  Washington D.C.1998. ,&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[remote sensing]] techniques allows archaeologists to uncover unique data that is unobtainable using traditional archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] techniques.

==General techniques==
Remote Sensing methods employed in the service of archaeological investigations include:
*Aerial, UAV and Satellite Imaging
**[[Aerial photography]]
***[[Multispectral Scanner|Multispectral]] and [[Hyperspectral imaging|Hyperspectral Sensors]]
***[[Multispectral Scanner|Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS)]]
***[[Infrared photography|Color Infrared Film (CIR)]]
***[[Radar|Microwave Radar]]
**Satellite Imaging
***[[LIDAR|Laser altimeters or light detection and ranging (LIDAR)]]
***[[Synthetic aperture radar|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)]]
***[[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar|INSAR - Interferometric SAR]]
Ground-based geophysical methods such as [[Ground-penetrating radar|Ground Penetrating Radar]] and [[Magnetometer|Magnetometry]] are also used for archaeological imaging. Although these are sometimes classed as remote sensing, they are usually considered a separate discipline (see [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)]]).

==Satellite archaeology==
Satellite archaeology is an emerging field of archaeology that uses high resolution satellites with thermal and infrared capabilities to pinpoint potential sites of interest in the earth around a meter or so in depth.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellite archaeology|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/02/125-explore/satellite-archaeology|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infrared light used by these satellites have longer wavelengths than that of visible light and are therefore capable of penetrating the earth's surface. The images are then taken and processed by an archaeologist who specializes in satellite remote sensing in order to find any subtle anomalies on the earth's surface.

Landscape features such as soil, vegetation, geology, and man-made structures of possible cultural interest have specific signatures that the multi-spectral satellites can help to identify. The satellites can then make a 3D image of the area to show if there are any man-made structures beneath soil and vegetation that can not be seen by the naked eye. Commercially available satellites have a .4m-90m resolution that make it possible to see most ancient sites and their associated features in such places as Egypt, Perù and Mexico. It is a hope of archaeologists that in the next few decades resolutions will improve to the point where they are capable of zooming in on a single pottery shard buried beneath the earth's surface.

Satellite archaeology is a non-invasive method for mapping and monitoring potential archaeological sites in an ever changing world that faces issues such as [[urbanization]], [[looting]], and [[groundwater pollution]] that could pose threats to such sites. In spite of this, satellites in archaeology are mostly a tool for broad scale survey and focused excavation. All archaeological projects need ground work in order to verify any potential findings.

== Examples of regional applications ==

=== Maya research ===

Some of the most prominent remote sensing research has been done in regard to [[Maya civilization|Maya]] studies in [[Mesoamerica]]. The [[Petén Basin|Petén]] region of northern [[Guatemala]] is of particular focus because [[remote sensing]] technology is of very definite use there. The Petén is a densely forested region and it lacks modern settlements and infrastructure. As a result, it is extremely difficult to survey, and because of this remote sensing offers a solution to this research problem. The use of remote sensing techniques in this region is a great example of the applications these methods have for archaeologists. The Petén is a hilly, [[karst]]ic, thickly forested landscape which offers an incredible barrier for field archaeologists to penetrate. With the advent of remote sensing techniques, a plethora of information has been uncovered about the region and about the people that inhabited it.

The Petén is arguably one of the most difficult of the Maya landscapes in which to subsist. It is questions regarding [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence patterns]] and related problems that have driven remote sensing methodology in the hopes of understanding the complex adaptations that the Maya developed.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3401/03-ask.html NOVA Science interview],&lt;/ref&gt; Remote sensing methods have also proven invaluable when working to discover [[Feature (archaeology)|features]], [[cisterns]], and [[temples]]. Archaeologists have identified vegetative differentiation associated with such features. With the advent of remote sensing, archaeologists are able to pinpoint and study the features hidden beneath this canopy without ever visiting the jungle.

A pioneer in the use of remote sensing in Maya research is [[NASA]] archaeologist Tom Sever, who has applied remote sensing to research in Maya site discovery as well as mapping [[causeways]] (''[[sacbe]]ob'') and roads. Sever has stressed the enormous use of remote sensing in uncovering settlement patterns, population densities, societal structure, communication, and transportation.&lt;ref name="NASA site"&gt;[http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/archeology/peten.html NASA archaeology website],&lt;/ref&gt; Sever has done much of his research in the Petén region of northern Guatemala, where he and his research team have used satellite imagery and [[GIS]] to map undiscovered roads and causeways the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] built to connect cities and settlements. These landscape artifacts represent the advantage of using [[remote sensing]] as these [[causeways]] are not visible from the ground. By mapping these forms, Sever is able to locate new sites and further uncover ancient Maya methods of communicated and transportation. Sever and his team also use remote sensing methods to gather data on [[deforestation]]. The [[rain forests]] of the Petén are undergoing massive deforestation, and Sever's remote sensing offers another window into this understanding and halting this problem. Monitoring the rate of deforestation not only has important ecological value, but the use of remote sensing can detect landscape change. By measuring the magnitude of landscape change in terms of vegetative cover and [[soil geography]], as well as shifting land use patterns and the associated cultural diversity, archaeologists are given a window into depletion rates and trends in anthropogenic landscape alteration.&lt;ref name="Sever book"&gt;Sever, Thomas L.Validating Prehistoric and Current Social Phenomena upon the Landscape of the Peten, Guatemala.''People and Pixels: Linking Remote Sensing and Social Science.''National Academy Press. Washington D.C.1998.,&lt;/ref&gt;

Much attention has been devoted to the mapping of [[canals]] and [[irrigation]] systems.&lt;ref name="Pope Paper"&gt;Pope, Kevin O. and Dahlin, Bruce H.Ancient Maya wetland agriculture: new insights from ecological and remote sensing research.''Journal of field archaeology''.Vol. 16 p. 87-106. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has proved particularly useful in this research. SAR is a type of radar that is sensitive to linear and geometric features on the ground.&lt;ref name="NASA site"/&gt; It is also important to include a method called [[ground truth]]ing, or the process of physically visiting (on foot) the localities surveyed to verify the data and help inform the interpretation. GPS is often used to aid in this process.

Ground-based geophysical methods have also been employed in Maya research. [[Ground-penetrating radar|Ground Penetrating Radar]] (GPR) has been performed on a number of sites, including [[Chichen Itza]]. The GPR research has detected buried causeways and structures that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.&lt;ref name="GPR Paper"&gt;Desmond, Lawrence G. and William A. Sauck.Entering the Maya Underworld: A ground penetrating radar Survey at Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico.

====Maya "collapse"====
{{main article|Classic Maya collapse}}
One of Sever's research goals is understanding the comparatively sudden decline of many Maya centers in the central Lowlands region by the end of the 1st millennium [[Common Era|CE]], a happenstance often referred to as the "[[Classic Maya collapse|(Classic) Maya collapse]]". Sever's research on communication and transportation systems points to an extensive societal infrastructure capable of supporting the building and maintenance of the [[causeways]] and roadways. Using [[satellite imagery]], researchers have been able to map [[canals]] and [[reservoirs]]. These offer a glimpse into Maya cultural adaptations during the period of their highest population density. At the height of the classic period, the population in the Maya lowlands was 500 - 1300 people per square mile in rural areas, and even more in [[urban region]]s. This far outweighs the carrying capacity for this region, but this follows centuries of successful adaptation. Other data shows that by the end of the classic period, the Maya had already depleted much of the rain forest.  Understanding how the ancient Maya adapted to this [[karst]] topography could shed light on solutions to modern ecological problems that modern peoples in the Petén currently face, which is much the same, except there are fewer people who are causing even more damage to the biodiversity and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Sever and Irwin journal"&gt;Sever, Thomas and L and Irwin, Daniel E.LANDSCAPE ARCHAEOLOGY: Remote-sensing investigation of the ancient Maya in the Peten rainforest of northern Guatemala. Ancient Mesoamerica. Issue 1, vol.14. January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Sever believes that the Maya collapse was a primarily ecological disaster. By detecting deforestation rates and trends can help us to understand how these same processes affected the Maya.
An important contribution to the study of Maya has been provided by LiDAR thanks to its ability to penetrate dense tropical canopies. LiDAR has been applied to the site of Caracol, Belize in 2009, revealing an impressive monumental complex covered by jungle.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, A.F.; Chase, D. Z.; Weishampel, J. F.; Drake, J.

=== Satellite archaeology in Peru===
In Peru, an  Italian scientific mission of CNR, directed by [[Nicola Masini]], provided important results by using satellite imagery for both site discovery and  the protection of archaeological heritage. In particular, by processing QuickBird images a large buried  settlement, including a pyramid, in the Nasca riverbed (Southern Peru), near the Ceremonial Center of [[Cahuachi]], has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27010998/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/ancient-peru-pyramid-spotted-satellite/#.VPlvP3Vd5D8&lt;/ref&gt; In the region of Lambayeque (Northern Peru), which is strongly affected by clandestine excavations, satellite imagery have been also employed for mapping and monitoring archaeological looting.&lt;ref&gt;Protecting Peru's ancient past https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16190824&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location of ancient Iram ===

[[Iram of the Pillars]] is a [[lost city]] (or region surrounding the lost city) on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. In the early 1980s a group of researchers interested in the history of Iram used [[NASA]] remote sensing satellites, [[ground penetrating radar]], [[Landsat program]] data and images taken from the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] as well as [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT]] data to identify old [[camel train]] routes and points where they converged. These roads were used as [[frankincense]] trade routes around 2800 BC to 100 BC.

One area in the [[Dhofar]] province of [[Oman]] was identified as a possible location for an outpost of the lost civilization. A team including adventurer [[Ranulph Fiennes]], archaeologist [[Juris Zarins]], filmmaker [[Nicholas Clapp]], and lawyer [[George Hedges]], scouted the area on several trips, and stopped at a water well called Ash Shisar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Frankincense Route Emerges From the Desert | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81E3FF932A15757C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print | publisher=New York Times | date=1992-04-21 | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Near this oasis was located a site previously identified as the 16th century Shis'r fort. Excavations uncovered an older settlement, and artifacts traded from far and wide were found.  This older fort was found to have been built on top of a large limestone cavern which would have served as the water source for the fort, making it an important oasis on the trade route to Iram.  As the residents of the fort consumed the water from underground, the water table fell, leaving the limestone roof and walls of the cavern dry. Without the support of the water, the cavern would have been in danger of collapse, and it seems to have done so some time between 300-500 AD, destroying the oasis and covering over the water source.

Four subsequent excavations were conducted by Dr. [[Juris Zarins]], tracing the historical presence by the people of 'Ad, the assumed ancestral builders of Iram.

=== Egypt and the Roman Empire ===

The '''Saharo-Arabian Region''' is a [[floristic region]] of the [[Holarctic Kingdom]] proposed by [[Armen Takhtajan]]. The region is covered by [[hot desert]]s, [[semidesert]]s and [[savanna]].

The region occupies the [[temperate]] parts of the [[Sahara]] desert, [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Arabian Peninsula]] (geographically defined), Southern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Lower Mesopotamia]].

==Flora==
Much of its flora is shared with the neighboring [[Mediterranean Region|Mediterranean]] and [[Phytochorion#VIII. Irano-Turanian Region|Irano-Turanian Region]]s of the Holarctic Kingdom and [[Sudano-Zambezian Region]] of the [[Paleotropical Kingdom]]. However, about a quarter of the species, especially in the families [[Asteraceae]], [[Brassicaceae]] and [[Chenopodiaceae]], are [[endemism|endemic]].

===Endemism===

Some of the endemic genera are ''[[Nucularia]]'', ''[[Fredolia]]'', ''[[Agathophora]]'', ''[[Muricaria]]'', ''[[Nasturtiopsis]]'', ''[[Zilla (plant)|Zilla]]'', ''[[Oudneya]]'', ''[[Foleyola]]'', ''[[Lonchophora]]'', ''[[Gymnarrhena]]'', ''[[Lifago]]''.

'''Silk Road sites in India''' are sites that were important for trade on the ancient [[Silk Road]]. There are 12 such places in [[India]]. These are spread across seven states in India ([[Bihar]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Puducherry]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. These sites are on tentative list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Ruins of ancient Vaishali==
;Kolhua
The excavations conducted by Archaeological Survey of India have unearth remains of ''Kuthagarshala'', ''Swastika'' shaped monastery, a tank, a cluster of votive stupas, miniature shines, main stupas and the Ashokan pillar. The main components of structure belong to period of [[Maurya Dynasty]] (3rd century BC) to [[Gupta Dynasty]] (7th century AD).

The pillar is 11.00 meters high is monolithic polished sand stone. This pillar is locally called ''Lat''. It is Probably one of the earliest pillar of [[Emperor Ashoka The Great]] and does not bear usual edict, but few letters of shell character of [[Gupta Dynasty|Gupta Period]] are engraved on the pillar.

The brick stupa was erected to commemorate the event of offering honey to [[Buddha]] by the [[Monkey|chief monkey]]. It was originally built in [[Maurya Dynasty|Maurya period]] (323 BC-232 BC) and subsequently enlarged in [[Kushan Dynasty|Kushan period]] (1st-2nd century A.D.) by raising height and providing brick paved circumambulatory path. Further brick encasing took place in Gupata and post [[Gupta Dynasty|Gupta period]].

Adjoining tank has been identified as ''Market Hard''. This is supposedly dug for [[Buddha]] by [[monkey]]s. The bricks lined seven tiered tank which is approximately 65 X 35 meters in dimension having two bathing ghats on southern and western wings.

''Kutagarshala'' represents the spot where [[Buddha]] used to stay during rainy season at Vaishali. Excavations have discovered three phases of its construction. Originally it was a small Chaitya built during [[Shunga dynasty|Shunga]]-[[Kushan Dynasty|Kushan period]] in (2nd-3rd century A.D.). It was enlarged to a lofty temple in second phase during [[Gupta Dynasty|Gupta period]]. In the third phase it was converted to a monastery in post gupta times by providing a number of partition walls.

The other monastery which looks like a ''swastika'' has 12 rooms, 3 on each arm attached to a common veranda which is around an open central courtyard. This monastery has its entrance towards east and toilet chambers attached to its southern wall. It was constructed in [[Gupta Dynasty|Gupta period]] probably for [[nun]]s.

Antiquities like beads of semi-precious stones, terracotta figurines, seals and sealings, bricks embedded with semi-precious stones, inscribed polished and a unique terracotta figure of crowded monkey found during excavations of the sites are kept on display for visitors in local site museum run by ASI.

;Relic stupa

[[File:Relicstupa-vaishali.jpg|thumb|250px|Remains at ancient Vaishali]]

The stupa has been identified as one of the eight stupas which contain corporeal remains of Buddha. Excavation of this site was done by K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute 1957–58. Originally it was mud stupa, smaller in dimension, erected by Lichhavis over their share of relic of Buddha in circa 5th century B.C. Ayakas noticed that southern and eastern sides are probably the earliest example of its kind. A soap stone casket found in the core of stupa contains ashy earth, a small conch, two glass beads, a small piece of gold leaf and a chopper punch marked on a coin. In Maurya, Shunga and Kushan period the stupa got its enlargement and diameter of stupa was increased by 17.1 meter.

[[File:Vikramshila stupa.jpg|Right|thumb|250px|alt=A The Main stupa at the center|The Main stupa at the center, [[Bihar]]]]
;The Property
Excavations have revealed a huge square monastery with a cruciform stupa in its center, a library building and cluster of votive stupas. To the north of the monastery Tibetan and Hindu temple have been found. The monastery is huge square structure having each side of 330 meters. There are 208 rooms with 53 on each side of the monastery. The entire spread over is over hundred acres. On the wall there are decorative with mouldings and terracotta plaques which testify high excellent art of terracotta art of flouring in the region during [[Pala Empire|Pala period]] (8th-12th century A.D.). Over the plaques are depicted many Buddhist, Hindu deities and human figures, animals and birds.

The library building was air conditioned by cooled water from the adjoining reservoir through a range of vents in the black well.

==Buddhist remains at Kushinagar==
;Description
The remains at [[Kushinagar]] are distributed in three sites the main site, Matha-Kuar shine and the cremation stupa. The main site consist of Main stupa and Nirvana temple with the surrounding monuments.

'''Sokha''' (big plow) – a unit of land measure in [[Russia]] in 13th-17th centuries. Sokha was used as unit of taxation for worked land owned by someone else or the State. The term originated when [[Tatar]]s took rent from the actual plows - the land working tool which used 2-3 horses. 

At the end of 15th century [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] sokha equalled 3 [[обж]]s. A [[Moscow]] sokha was equal to 10 Novgorod ones and was paid according to the different sizes in various regions of the state.

In 1550 a new land-measure unit was established which kept the old name ''sokha''. The name was then used for a certain amount of exploited land. A sokha was divided into quarters.

There were several types of sokha:

# '''government''' – 800 quarters of best land;
# '''church''' – 600 quarters of best land;
# '''black''' – 400 quarters of best land.

Here, ''government'' meant someone who was working in government sectors, and ''black'' meant an average person (''"the masses"''), ''quarter'' or ''quart'' meant an area of land that is planted with a quarter of [[rye]]. The land was planted in such a way that the area of land  seeded with two ''quarters'' was equal to a [[:ru:Десятина|desyatina]] (an area of land approximately equal to one [[hectare]]).

Because of the different types of sokha, land owned by lower classes was worth less towards the tax, and most of the tax was paid by the peasants.  Given the same amount of land, they paid twice as much as government officials, and 1.5 times as much as church officials. 

In order to find out how many sokhas were in the state, a census measured and counted the rented lands. Quarters of land that were planted for personal use were free from payment. Until the beginning of the 17th century, a peasant who lived and worked on the land owned by a ''government'' employee, just like a peasant living on their own land or state land, paid equally for each exploited quarter of land. This section of land was called ''living''. At the beginning of the 17th century, the term ''living quarter'' was used not for the actual quarter of worked land, but for several whole farms in which more than a single quarter was planted. 

This was done in the interest of government officials - their lands were used to establish ''living quarters'' which constituted 10-16 yards. This means that if every yard was divided into 4 quarters (two desyatinas), then such a ''living quarter'' was then 40 to 64 quarters of ''actual'' quarters of utilized land. Therefore, 40 to 64 quarters of government official land paid the same amount of tax as one peasant paid from the single quarter that he lived on (whether self- or state-owned). 

In 1678–1679 the sokha was replaced with the ''yard count'', meaning taxes were to be paid for the number of peasant yards, rather than the area of the land occupied by the yards.

Taxes from small villages was also collected in sokhas. The term sokha remained but now it referred to a certain number of yards/houses. There were several types of sokha again: ''best'', ''average'', ''lesser'', and ''worst'' villagers. Sokha of the best villages was equal to 40 yards, average - 80, lesser - 160, and worst - 320 yards. Every sokha was charged the same amount of tax. Therefore, best villages paid the same amount for half the number of farms than the average ones. If there were not enough lesser or worst sokhas, then the tax was charged from the people that lived in average or best sokhas.

'''South America''' &lt;!-- Only put in English phonetics, do not list "South America" in other languages --&gt; is a [[continent]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It may also be considered a [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]],&lt;ref name=britannica-southamerica&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555844/South-America|title = South America|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is how it is viewed in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like [[Latin America]] or the [[Southern Cone]]) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal||url=https://www.academia.edu/12944490 |title=Unveiling the South American Balance  |journal=Estudos Internacionais  2(2): 215–232.|date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-08|last1=Schenoni |first1=Luis L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]), a [[Regions of France|part]] of [[France]] ([[French Guiana]]), and a non-sovereign area (the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] though this is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed]] by Argentina). In addition to this, the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Panama]] may also be considered part of South America.

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}} has been estimated at more than {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South America}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} South America [[List of continents by population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades Brazil has also concentrated half of the region's GDP and has become a first regional power.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the [[patagonia|far south]] are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Orinoco]], and [[Paraná River|Paraná]] flow. Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].

The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long [[European colonization of the Americas|history of colonialism]], the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and societies and states reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].

South America occupies the southern portion of the [[Americas]]. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the [[Darién Gap|Darién watershed]] along the [[Colombia–Panama border]], although some may consider the border instead to be the [[Panama Canal]].

South America's major mineral resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicuña]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the Earth's [[species]].

Brazil is the largest country in South America, encompassing around half of the continent's land area and population. The remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions: The [[Andean States]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Southern Cone]].

===Outlying islands===

Traditionally, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]], [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]] and are often considered part of the continent. Geo-politically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America, since they are more distant on the [[Caribbean Plate]], even though [[San Andrés (island)|San Andres]] and [[Providencia Island|Providencia]] are politically part of [[Colombia]] and [[Aves Island]] is controlled by [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="North America Atlas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w South America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49) |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other islands that are included with South America are the [[Galápagos Islands]] that belong to [[Ecuador]] and [[Easter Island]] (in [[Oceania]] but belonging to [[Chile]]), [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] (both Chilean) and [[Tierra del Fuego]] (split in between Chile and [[Argentina]]). In the Atlantic, [[Brazil]] owns [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], and the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] are governed by the [[United Kingdom]], whose sovereignty over the islands is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed by Argentina]]. [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] may be associated with either South America or [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South Georgia and theSouth Sandwich Islands|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Climate===

[[File:South America Köppen Map.png|thumb|[[Map]] of South America according to [[Köppen climate classification]]]]
[[File:Tropical cyclones 1945 2006 wikicolor.png|thumb|Map of all tropical cyclone tracks from 1945 to 2006.]]
The distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant regularity from the [[30th parallel south|30° of latitude south]], when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.&lt;ref name="Climate"&gt;O CLIMA. In: ''Atlas Mundial''. São Paulo: Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo, 1999, pp. 20–21 {{ISBN|85-06-02889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate latitudes, [[winter]]s are milder and [[summer]]s warmer than in North America. Because its most extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone, the region has more areas of equatorial plains than any other region.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27&amp;nbsp;°C, with low thermal amplitudes and high [[rainfall]] indices. Between the [[Maracaibo Lake]] and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an [[equatorial climate]] of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[tropical cyclone]]s are practically unknown in the South Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador are rainy regions. The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to [[extratropical cyclone]]s, and most of the Argentine [[Patagonia]] is [[desert]]. In the [[pampas]] of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

Important factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Know.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}
[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or ''Cave of the Hands'', in Argentina]]
South America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].

The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/&gt;

South American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicuña]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/&gt;

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]

The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.

One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chavín]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chavín de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

In the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&amp;nbsp;– 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&amp;nbsp;– 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.

Around the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.

The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Cañari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chimú Empire]] (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).

Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

The [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.

===European colonization===
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]

In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.

The treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca–Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) – to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&amp;nbsp;– caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

[[File:Desembarque de Pedro Álvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865–1939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].]]
[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]
[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]

The Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.

Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.

[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.

===Slavery in South America===
{{Slavery}}
{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}
[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]

Indigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.&lt;ref&gt;Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760–1810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informações disponíveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravidão no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D.

While the Portuguese, English and French settlers enslaved mainly African blacks, the Spaniards became very disposed of the natives. In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on so-called [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.

After independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.

===Independence from Spain and Portugal===

The European [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.

Many cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]], who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.

The independence of South America was secured by [[Simón Bolívar]] (Venezuela) and [[José de San Martín]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.

In the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Pará]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].

===Nation-building and fragmentation===
[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] proclaimed the independence of [[Cisplatine Province]].]]
[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]

The newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre Ríos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).

The first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], led by a [[caudillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the "Republic" in its title, [[Francisco Ramírez (governor)|General Ramírez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The "country" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.

In 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].

Later in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina and Brazil in the [[Paraguayan War]].

South American history in early [[19th century]] was built almost exclusively on wars. Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.

In 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.

Between 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.

Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that "there were two Argentines": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[Río de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.&lt;ref name="Latin America’s Wars"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1844&amp;dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%20twenty-five&amp;f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.

The Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano López]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/|title=A Guerra do Paraguai – História – Resumo|first=Daniel Arantes Loverde|last=daniel@loverde.com.br|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884. Chile annexed territories of both countries leaving Bolivia with no path to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002203/http://pt.shvoong.com/humanities/h_history/1628182-am%C3%A9rica-latina-guerra-pac%C3%ADfico/ | title=América Latina – Guerra do Pacífico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new century, as wars became less violent and less frequent, Brazil entered into a small conflict with Bolivia for the possession of the Acre, which was acquired by Brazil in 1902. In 1917 Brazil declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and join the allied side in the [[World War I]], sending a small fleet to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and some troops to be integrated with the British and French troops. Brazil was the only South American country that fought in WWI.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, James P.

In the same year Paraguay declared [[Chaco War|war]] on Bolivia for possession of the Chaco, in a conflict that ended three years later with Paraguay's victory. Between 1941 and 1942 Peru and Ecuador [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War|fought decisively for territories]] claimed by both that were annexed by Peru, usurping Ecuador's frontier with Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|date=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in this period the first naval battle of [[World War II]] was fought on the continent, in the [[Battle of the River Plate|River Plate]], between British forces and German submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1948, pp. 525–526.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans still made numerous attacks on Brazilian ships on the coast, causing Brazil to declare war on the [[Axis powers]] in 1942, being the only South American country to fight in this war (and in both World Wars). Brazil sent naval and air forces to [[Battle of the Atlantic|combat German and Italian submarines]] off the continent and throughout the South Atlantic, in addition to sending an [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] to fight in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Ibidem Maximiano 2011"&gt;Ibidem Maximiano, Bonalume, Ricardo N. &amp; Bujeiro, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. MacCann – 'Estudios Interdisciplinarios de America Latina y el Caribe', vol. 6, No. 2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibidem Maximiano 2011"/&gt;

A brief war was fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982, following an Argentine invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]], which ended with an Argentine defeat. The last international war to be fought on South American soil was the 1995 [[Cenepa War]] between Ecuador and the Peru along their mutual border.

===Rise and fall of military dictatorships===

[[File:Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes firing a broadside.jpg|left|thumb|The Brazilian [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes'' class]] kindled an [[South American dreadnought race|Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race]].]]

Wars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the [[ABC Powers|three wealthiest South American countries]] engaged in [[South American dreadnought race|a vastly expensive naval arms race]] which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type, the "[[dreadnought]]". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hough, ''The Big Battleship'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. {{oclc|8898108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810–1987'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. {{ISBN|0-87021-295-8}}. {{oclc|15696006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].

Argentina and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens.

Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cambridge History of Latin America", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-39525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.

[[File:Presidentes unasur (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Presidents of [[UNASUR]] member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008.]]
[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Bethell|title=Bibliographical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39525-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=November 2012}} The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards [[Integration of Latin America|regional integration]], with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the [[Andean Community]], [[Mercosur]] and [[Unasur]]. Notably, starting with the election of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a [[pink tide]] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.

[[File:Bandeiras UNASUL.jpg|thumb|South American flags]]
Historically, the Hispanic countries were founded as Republican dictatorships led by [[caudillo]]s. [[Brazil]] was the only exception, being a [[constitutional monarchy]] for its first 67 years of independence, until a [[coup d'état]] proclaimed a republic. In the late 19th century, the most democratic countries were [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]],{{sfn|Lira 1977, Vol 2|p=9}} [[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891–1925)|Chile]], Argentina and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1KBWX329uIC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=late+19th+century+most+democratic+South+American+countries#v=onepage&amp;q=late%2019th%20century%20most%20democratic%20South%20American%20countries&amp;f=false|title=Toward Pro-poor Policies: Aid, Institutions, and Globalization|last=Tungodden|first=Bertil|last2=Stern|first2=Nicholas Herbert|last3=Stern|first3=Nicholas|last4=Kolstad|first4=Ivar|date=2004|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0821353882|location=|page=219|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interwar period, nationalism grew stronger on the continent, influenced by countries like [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist Italy]]. A series of authoritarian rules broke out in South American countries with views bringing them closer to the [[Axis Powers]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennison de Oliveira, "Os soldados alemães de Vargas" Portuguese [Germans against Hitler; "The German soldiers of Vargas" ] 1st Chapter, Jurua print. 2008 {{ISBN|85-362-2076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Vargas Era|Vargas's Brazil]]. In the late 20th century, during the [[Cold War]], many countries became [[military dictatorships]] under American tutelage in attempts to avoid the influence of the Soviet Union. After the fall of the authoritarian regimes, these countries became democratic republics.

During the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with leftist leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Most South American countries are making increasing use of protectionist policies, helping local development.

All South American countries are [[presidential republic]]s with the exceptions of Peru, which is a [[semi-presidential republic]], and [[Suriname]], a [[parliamentary republic]]. [[French Guiana]] is a [[French overseas department]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are British overseas territories. It is currently the only inhabited continent in the world without [[monarchies]]; the [[Empire of Brazil]] existed during the 19th century and there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a [[Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia]] in southern Argentina and Chile. Also in the twentieth century, [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname]] was established as a constituent kingdom of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and [[Guyana (1966–1970)|Guyana]] retained the [[British monarch]] as [[head of state]] for 4 years after its independence.

Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]], thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/integrate/2008/1029newconsensus.htm |title=Globalpolicy.org |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new political organization, known as [[Union of South American Nations]], seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of [[tariff]]s.

==Demographics==
[[File:South America night.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite view of South America at night from [[NASA]].]]
South America has over {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South America}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million{{UN_Population|ref}} inhabitants and a population growth rate of about 0.6% per year. There are several areas of sparse demographics such as [[tropical forest]]s, the [[Atacama Desert]] and the icy portions of [[Patagonia]]. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Italians]]), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by French, English and Dutch in smaller numbers.

===Language===
[[File:Languages of South America (en).svg|thumb|left|Languages in South America]]

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the most spoken languages in South America, with approximately 200 million speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in some countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of [[Suriname]]; [[English language|English]] is the official language of [[Guyana]], although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and several native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/GY-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Guyana|website=Studylands|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is also spoken in the [[Falkland Islands]]. [[French language|French]] is the official language of [[French Guiana]] and the second language in [[Amapá]], Brazil.

[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] of South America include [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile and Colombia; [[Wayuunaiki]] in northern Colombia ([[La Guajira]]) and northwestern Venezuela ([[Zulia]]); [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and [[Mapudungun]] is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile and, more rarely, Argentina. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.

Other languages found in South America include [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela and Chile; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]] in the Argentine [[Patagonia]]. There are also small clusters of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speakers in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Arabic speakers, often of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian people|Syrian]], or [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent, can be found in Arab communities in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0022216X13001156|title=On the Trail and Trial of a Palestinian Diaspora: Mapping South America in the Arab–Israeli Conflict, 1967–1972|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |volume =45|issue =4 |year=2013|pages=751–777|author=Karam, John Tofik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Religion in Latin America}}
{{see also|History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean|Buddhism in Brazil|Islam in Argentina}}

An estimated 90% of South Americans are [[Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx|title=Christians|date=18 December 2012|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (82% [[Roman Catholic]], 8% other Christian denominations mainly traditional [[Protestants]] and [[Evangelicals]] but also [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]), accounting for c. 19% of Christians worldwide.

African descendent religions and Indigenous religions are also common throughout all South America, some examples of are [[Santo Daime]], [[Candomblé]], [[Umbanda]] and [[Encantados]].

[[Crypto-Jews]] or [[Marrano]]s, [[conversos]], and [[Anusim]] were an important part of colonial life in Latin America.

Both Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil figure among the largest [[Jewish population by urban areas|Jewish populations by urban area]].

Japanese Buddhism, [[Shintoism]], and [[Shinto|Shinto-derived]] [[Japanese New Religions]] are common in Brazil and Peru. [[Korean Confucianism]] is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism have spread throughout the continent.

[[Kardecism|Kardecist Spiritism]] can be found in several countries.

Genetic admixture occurs at very high levels in South America. In Argentina, the European influence accounts for 65–79% of the genetic background, Amerindian for 17–31% and sub-Saharan African for 2–4%. In Colombia, the sub-Saharan African genetic background varied from 1% to 89%, while the European genetic background varied from 20% to 79%, depending on the region.
In Peru, European ancestries ranged from 1% to 31%, while the African contribution was only 1% to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3983580 | pmid=24764751 | volume=37 | issue=1 Suppl | title=Interethnic admixture and the evolution of Latin American populations | year=2014 | journal=Genet.

The most populous country in South America is Brazil with {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Brazil}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. The second largest country is Colombia with a population of {{UN_Population|Colombia}}. Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.

While Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are São Paulo, Bogotá, and Lima. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Caracas, Buenos Aires and Salvador.

Five of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater São Paulo|São Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.

South America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.

South America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt; Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt;

Since 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.&lt;ref name="Economy"&gt;O Sistema Econômico / América do Sul. In: ''Atlas Mundial''. São Paulo: Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo, 1999, pp. 26–27, 88–107 {{ISBN|85-06-02889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agrarian crops are export crops, such as [[soy]] and [[wheat]]. The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

Only Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florianópolis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

Since the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment–factors that favor industry.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,&lt;ref name=share&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.10TH.10|title=Income share held by highest 10%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the poorest 20% receive 3% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.FRST.20/countries|title=Income share held by lowest 20%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine South Americans live on less than $2 per day (on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis).&lt;ref name=wb2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.2DAY/countries|title=Poverty headcount ratio at $2 a day (PPP) (% of population)|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe.

South American nations have a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[música sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canción]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. {{multiple image

}} People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Español|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.

The [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[João Guimarães Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in South America}}
[[File:Aerea2 maracana.jpg|thumb|[[Maracanã Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil]]
[[File:Stadion Rio de Janeiro Finale WM 2014 (22117945206).jpg|thumb|Panorama of the interior of the Maracanã stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

A wide range of sports are played in the continent of South America, with [[Association football|football]] being the most popular overall, while [[baseball]] is the most popular in Venezuela.

Other sports include [[basketball]], [[cycling]], [[polo]], [[volleyball]], [[futsal]], [[motorsports]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] (mostly in Argentina and Uruguay), [[handball]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[field hockey]], [[boxing]] and [[cricket]].

South America hosted its first [[Olympic Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in 2016 and will host the [[Youth Olympic Games]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 2018.

South America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in [[FIFA World Cup]] history and all winning teams in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).

South America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa América]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa América a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa América).

Also, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.

[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===

Due to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.

The [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Iguaçu and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&amp;nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.

Most of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.

===Transport===

[[File:Avenida General Paz entre Cabildo y Panamericana.jpg|thumb|Stretch of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Argentina]]
[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Peru]]
[[File:Línea Roja de Mi Teleférico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]

South American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.

Only two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valparaíso]], in Chile, and the Brazil–Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2015-04-02|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&amp;nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Brasilia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.

The Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.
South America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the São Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&amp;nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&amp;nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&amp;nbsp;km.

The two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bahía Blanca]], [[Rosario]], [[Valparaiso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranaguá]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Belém]] and [[Maracaibo]].

In South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo, and large airports, such as [[São Paulo–Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|São Paulo–Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (São Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Confins International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, Bogotá, Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Belém.

The main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires [[subte]], opened 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=A short history of world metro systems – in pictures|last=Lin|first=Luna|location=London|date=10 September 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/sep/10/-sp-history-metro-pictures-london-underground-new-york-beijing-seoul|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Santiago Metro|Santiago subway]]&lt;ref name="Home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrosantiago.cl/guia-viajero |title=Guía del Viajero |publisher=Metro de Santiago |language=Spanish |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest network in South America, with 103&amp;nbsp;km, while the [[São Paulo Metro|São Paulo subway]] is the largest in transportation, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day&lt;ref name="2014ridership"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/metro/numeros-pesquisa/demanda.aspx |title=Metro – Passengers |publisher=Companhia Do Metropolitano De São Paulo |language=Portuguese |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted the best in the Americas. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] was installed the first railroad of the continent, in 1854. Today the city has a vast and diversified system of metropolitan trains, integrated with buses and subway. Recently it was also inaugurated in the city a Light Rail System called [[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail|VLT]], a small electrical trams at low speed, while [[São Paulo]] inaugurated its [[Line 15 (São Paulo Metro)|monorail]], the first of South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!-- Empty reference &lt;ref name="spmetro_about" /&gt;--&gt; In Brazil, an express bus system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which operates in several cities, has also been developed.

The [[Cayman Islands]] requires its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s and display '''[[vehicle registration plate]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/world/CA_CAYM.html&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles plates usually have six numbers on them, separated into groups of three.  Most plates have 'Cayman Islands' written beneath the numbers and are [[Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_States#Designs_and_serial_formats|North American standard]] 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Mike Sells |url = http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/Cayman_Islands/caymany2k.html |title = Cayman Islands Y2K |publisher = Plateshack.com |date = 29 May 2004 |accessdate = 29 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2003, quincentennial plates (known as Q-plates) were issued; they had four blue numbers following a 'Q' on a background depicting a picturesque Cayman scene with celebratory logos.  Initially, Q-plates were issued with white characters but these were recalled and replaced.

[[File:Voivodeships_of_Poland.svg|thumb|300px|Polish voivodeships since 1999]]
[[File:Vojvodina map02.png|thumb|300px|Map of Serbian [[Vojvodina]]]]

A '''voivodeship''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɔɪ|ˌ|v|oʊ|d|ˌ|ʃ|ɪ|p}} is the area administered by a [[voivode]] (Governor) in several countries of central and eastern Europe. Voivodeships have existed since medieval times in &lt;!--please include only countries that were divided in voivodeships, not historical voivodeships--&gt;[[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Ukraine]], [[Russia]] and [[Serbia]]. The administrative level of area (territory) of voivodeship resembles that of a [[duchy]] in western medieval states, much as the title of voivode was equivalent to that of a [[duke]]. Other roughly equivalent titles and areas in medieval [[Eastern Europe]] included [[Ban_(title)|ban (bojan, vojin or bayan)]] and [[Banate (disambiguation)|banate]].

In a modern context, the word normally refers to one of the [[province]]s ''([[Voivodeships of Poland|województwa]])'' of Poland. Poland {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}} has 16 voivodeships.

==Terminology==
A [[voivode|voi(e)vod(e)]] (literally, "leader of warriors" or "war leader", equivalent to the [[Latin]] "''Dux Exercituum''" and the [[German language|German]] "''[[Herzog]]''") was originally a military commander who stood, in a state's structure, next to the ruler. Later the word came to denote an administrative official.

Words for "voivodeship" in various languages include the {{lang-pl|województwo}}; the {{lang-ro|voievodat}}; the [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''vojvodina'' (војводина), ''vojvodstvo'' (војводство) or ''vojvodovina'' (војводовина); the {{lang-hu|vajdaság}}; the {{lang-be|ваяводства}} (''vajаvodstva''); the {{lang-lt|vaivadija}}. Some of these words, or variants of them, may also be used in English.

Named for the word for "voivodeship" is the autonomous [[Serbia]]n province of [[Vojvodina]].

Though the word "voivodeship" (other spellings are "voievodship" and "voivodship") appears in English dictionaries such as the [[OED]] and [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's]], it is not in common general usage, and voivodeships in Poland and elsewhere are frequently referred to as "[[province]]s".&lt;ref&gt;"''Jednostki podziału administracyjnego Polski tłumaczymy tak: województwo''—province..." ("Polish administrative units are translated as follows:  ''województwo''—[[province]]...").  Arkadiusz Belczyk,[http://serwistlumacza.com/content/view/27/32/ "Tłumaczenie polskich nazw geograficznych na język angielski"] ("[[Translation]] of Polish Geographical Names into English"), 2002-2006. For examples see [http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~zbzw/ph/pro/plpro.html New Provinces of Poland (1998)]; [http://www.map-of-Poland.co.uk/ Map of Poland]; [http://serwistlumacza.com/content/view/78/ English names of Polish provinces].&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on context, historic voivodeships may also be referred to as "duchies", "palatinates" (the [[Latin]] word "''palatinatus''" was used for a voivodeship in Poland), "administrative districts" or "regions".

==Current Polish Voivodeships==
[[File:PolandSzczecinProvincialOffice2.JPG|thumb|The Office of [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] in [[Szczecin]]]]
Since 1999, Poland has been divided into the following 16 voivodeships or provinces (for more information see [[Administrative divisions of Poland]] and [[Voivodeships of Poland]]):

==Historical voivodeships==
===Outside Poland===
[[File:Romania 1600-mod.png|thumb|Principality of Transylvania and the voivodeships of Wallachia and Moldavia ruled by [[Mihai Viteazul]] in 1600]]
[[File:Vojvodina03.png|thumb|[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodina]] (1848–1849)]]
[[File:Map of Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar (1849-1860).png|thumb|[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]] (1849-1860)]]
In the territory of modern [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], the regions of [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Voivodeship of Transylvania|Transylvania]] were formerly voivodeships.

Historical voivodeships in the territory of modern [[Serbia]] include the [[Salan|Voivodeship of Salan]] (9th–10th centuries), [[Sermon (ruler)|Voivodeship of Sermon]] (11th century) and [[Radoslav Čelnik|Voivodeship of Syrmia of Radoslav Čelnik]] (1527–1530). A voivodeship called [[Serbian Vojvodina]] was established in 1848–1849; this was transformed into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]], a land within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1849 to 1860. This is the origin of the name of the present-day Serbian autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]].

Historical voivodeships in the territory of modern [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]] include the [[Glad (duke)|Voivodeship of Glad]] (9th–10th centuries) and the [[Ahtum|Voivodeship of Ahtum]] (11th centuries).
