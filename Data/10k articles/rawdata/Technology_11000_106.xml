'''Airbrush makeup''' is makeup sprayed onto the skin using an [[airbrush]] instead of being applied with sponges, brushes, fingers, or other methods.&lt;ref name="LluchLluch2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Lluch|author2=Elizabeth Lluch|title=1001 Most Popular Wedding Questions from WedSpace.com|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvVPUD-cSPMC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=30 January 2010|publisher=WS Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-934386-88-0|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An airbrush is characterized by 3 major parts. A powered compressor is used to create an even and controllable airflow through a medical grade hose. The hose connects to a metal, trigger-actioned gun. An airbrush system can be altered to suit every type of makeup application by changing the air pressure (typically measured in pounds per square inch) for lighter, heavier, detailed or broader makeups. It is popular in [[film]], [[theater]], bridal makeup and [[sunless tanning]]. Systems designed for personal cosmetic use in the home are also available.  Airbrush systems designed for home use are usually smaller and work at a lower pressures than systems used in industrial applications. The technique was first used in 1959 on actors in [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"/&gt; and has since grown in popularity in the entertainment business.

==History==
{{details|Airbrush}}

Airbrushed makeup was first used in the film 1959 ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', where the makeup artists used the technique to apply makeup to a large cast.&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Le Quesne|title=The make-up book: the official guide to make-up at levels 2 and 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2l8DNDG_1cC&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=8 February 2005|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=978-1-84480-144-2|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Airbrush makeup has become more popular with the advent of [[high-definition video]] and television (HD). Traditional powder or liquid based make-up can settle and appear in pores and wrinkles and be visible on HD film. As the makeup is sprayed on, it connects with the skin as millions of droplets of formula.&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"/&gt; The formula can create an even, sheer, natural appearance to the skin that, if applied properly for a natural look, can appear natural and non-heavy like traditional makeup. Airbrush makeup wears longer than traditional powder or liquid [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]], and is able to stay put upwards of 12–24 hours.&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"/&gt; It can be used to cover [[five o'clock shadow]]s for men. Airbrush makeup is also available for eye shadow, blush, eyebrows and lips and can be layered, shaded, highlighted and contoured.&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisHall2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gretchen Davis|author2=Mindy Hall|title=The makeup artist handbook: techniques for film, television, photography, and theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoBq8iJ9RhMC&amp;pg=PT189|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=14 February 2008|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=978-0-240-80941-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}} Application wise, the technique is more sanitary than traditional makeup application due the artist never having to touch the skin. It's also faster, if done by a trained artist. Fantasy and special effects are able to be stenciled or created by freehand.&lt;ref name="Quesne2005"/&gt;

==Benefits==

Airbrush makeup is characterized by its unique 'globular' &lt;ref name= "AirbrushGuru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbrushguru.com/airbrush-basics.html|title=Airbrush Basics|website=Airbrush Guru}}&lt;/ref&gt; application technique. The makeup is dispersed as an extremely fine mist through the airbrush gun. Millions of tiny little dots are created on the skin and when connected and layered together, create somewhat of a net over the entire face. This makes airbrush makeup to be a thin, light layer on the skin that is barely noticeable to the wearer. Certain formulas wear better than others and it is important to choose carefully when deciding what mixture is right for the job. Some airbrush makeups are entirely waterproof unless taken off with a specific remover that breaks down the active ingredient. For instance, silicone-based airbrush fluid is largely waterproof depending on how much, and how you set the makeup. It can be dunked in water (handy for fashion photography or film) or sweat through without removing or dislodging the airbrush base. It does however, take a specific silicone makeup remover to thoroughly take off (but will naturally come off over the course of many hours). In the contemporary makeup scene, airbrush makeup has become a preferred option for bridal and events makeup due to its long wearing and flawless appearance. 

==Ingredients==

Airbrush makeup comes in six different formulas:
:*Water based: Finely ground pigments dissipated in water.
:*Polymer-water-based: A mix of water, [[polymer]]s and pigment, when airbrushed on the skin the polymer dries leaving a continuous [[coating]] on the skin.
:*Polymer-SD40-alcohol based: Instead of using water like the polymer-water-based formula, it uses [[ethanol|alcohol]] which assists with drying of the makeup on the skin.
:*Alcohol based: Also called "temporary airbrush inks" alcohol based formulas are generally used when creating fake [[tattoo]]s.
:*Silicone-based: Uses [[Silicone#Personal_care|silicone]] for longer lasting wear and without fading. Silicone-based can be thinned with certain types of formula additives, for lighter coverage.&lt;ref name="DavisHall2008"/&gt;{{rp|189}}
Airbrush makeup can be removed by using a 50/50 mix of [[isopropyl alcohol]] and [[isopropyl myristate]].&lt;ref name="DavisHall2008"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

==Technique==
Airbrushing for makeup utilizes a freehand technique to apply makeup while manipulating aspects such as distance and air pressure to produce certain effects and coverage. Airbrush makeup artists will either use a circular motion or forward-back motion with the airgun when applying foundation. Both dual-action and single-action airbrushes can be used for airbrushing makeup and require slightly different techniques. 

A dual-action airbrush allows the user to control airflow by depressing the trigger with the index finger and drawing it backwards. This draws air from the compressor. The further the trigger is depressed, the more makeup is released. The advantage to using a dual-action airbrush is that one can use the air as a guide before allowing makeup to pass through the nozzle. Air is also used to dry the makeup after application. Makeup is also mixed in the cup by allowing a small amount of air to flow into it, thereby mixing two pigments. This technique is known as 'back-bubbling'. 

A single-action airbrush is generally considered easier to use because depressing the trigger releases a fixed ratio of makeup to air. However, in order to achieve different levels of coverage and detail the nozzle has to be changed between applications. 

Generally an airbrush makeup artist will work with a PSI range between 0-35 PSI. Many compressors designed for personal use in the home will not achieve airflow greater than 15 PSI. A low PSI is preferable when airbrushing makeup around the face and eyes while full body application (such as covering blemishes or tanning) is easier and faster with a higher PSI. 

Airbrush makeup is applied by layering several passes of makeup. This allows the artists to build upon previous layers to produce subtle changes. When applying foundation between 6-12 drops of makeup are used. The makeup is sprayed onto the face at a distance of 6-12 inches.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Harris, [http://thebestairbrushmakeup.com/  "How To Apply Airbrush Makeup Foundation Makeup"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medchitchat Health, [https://www.medchitchat.com/health/what-is-airbrush-makeup-how-to-do-airbrush-makeup.html  "How to do Airbrush Makeup"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stencils are commonly used to assist the application of difficult areas such as eye-liner. Stencils are also available for body-art and temporary tattoos.

An '''arming plug''' is a small plug that is fitted into [[flight hardware]] to enable functions that, for instrument or personnel safety, should not be activated before flight.  In the case of a [[missile]] or [[bomb]], the (lack of the) arming plug prevents [[explosion]] before flight; in the case of a [[spacecraft]] or scientific [[sounding rocket]], it might prevent premature firing of a [[hydrazine]] thruster system (hydrazine is extremely toxic) or block [[cryogenic]] or [[photographic film]] systems from operating before [[Rocket launch|launch]].

'''AutoTrack''' is a vehicle [[swept path analysis]] software program used for analysing the movements of steered and wheeled vehicles including [[Automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, [[trams]], [[aircraft]] and other more specialist vehicles such as [[fork lift]] trucks, [[wheelchairs]] and access platforms. AutoTrack was the world's first [[swept path analysis]] software program, originally being jointly developed by TRL&lt;ref&gt;The [[Transport Research Laboratory]] [http://www.trl.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; (the UK's [[Transport Research Laboratory]]) and British engineering consultants, Travers Morgan (acquired by Symonds in 1995 who are now part of Capita Symonds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/about_us/an_overview/our_history.aspx Capita Symonds company history]&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of TRACK. The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicle's simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, [[chassis]] and [[steering]] specification. AutoTrack has many similarities and performs the same function as the alternative swept path analysis program [[AutoTURN]], which is developed by Transoft Solutions, Inc..

AutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of [[highways]], [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s, [[buildings]] and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and [[geometry]] required to manoeuvre specified design [[vehicles]]. A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, rather being indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.

The AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the [[Road]], [[Rail transport|Rail]] and [[Airports]] industries and operates within several different [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems such as [[AutoCAD]] by [[Autodesk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[AutoCAD]] product page on the [[Autodesk]] website [http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microstation]] by [[Bentley Systems]],&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Microstation]] [http://communities.bentley.com/products/microstation/w/microstation__wiki/history-of-microstation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bricscad]] by Bricsys&lt;ref&gt;Bricsys company website (developer of [[Bricscad]] [http://www.bricsys.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (a former member of the [[IntelliCAD Technology Consortium]]) and standalone in [[Microsoft Windows]]. When the software was first developed it initially ran as a [[DOS]]-based application and when it was ported to operate within [[AutoCAD]], it was given the name AutoTrack. The software, initially developed for consulting purposes, was sold commercially and following the demise of the original company, a management buy out pre-empted the incorporation of Savoy Computing Services Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoycomputing.com Savoy Computing company website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110041309/http://www.savoycomputing.com/ |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996. Two of the surviving directors of Savoy Computing were involved with the original development of TRACK.

In August, 2013 [[Autodesk]] acquired the technology assets of Savoy Computing Services Ltd, including the AutoTrack technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-expands-infrastructure-design-and-analysis-portfolio Autodesk expands Infrastructure portfolio]&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk subsequently released Autodesk Vehicle Tracking, which directly superseded AutoTrack in November, 2013. At this point Savoy Computing Services ceased trading and the AutoTrack software product is since no longer supported.

== Brief history of AutoTrack ==
* 1988 - AutoTrack introduced "lock to lock" time as a critical factor used in the calculation of manoeuvrability of steered vehicles
* 1991 - AutoTrack archived all design data within the "parent" [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawing
* 1992 - AutoTrack introduced modelling of [[tram]] and [[light rail]] vehicle movements
* 1997 - First swept path program to calculate effective [[axle]] positions from vehicle dimensions
* 1999 - AutoTrack introduced AutoDrive (a mouse point and click system that calculates possible movements from one vehicle position to the next)
* 1999 - Grip editing was introduced to enable the editing of vehicle paths instead of their deletion
* 2002 - Recording of scaled animations containing multiple vehicles was introduced, with a [[movie]] file being able to be recorded from within the program
* 2004 - A standalone version that operated in [[Microsoft Windows]] was introduced for engineers without [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems
* 2007 - AutoTrack became the first [[64-bit]] [[swept path analysis]] software program
* 2013 - AutoTrack acquired by [[Autodesk]]

A '''buddle pit''' or '''buddle pond''' is a pit, often circular when specifically constructed, the purpose of which was to separate by sedimentation minerals from lighter rock dust in crushed [[ore]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121223033655/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/term_definitions.asp?thesaurus_code=ty&amp;term_id=3769 Sine Project - Term Definitions: BUDDLE]&lt;/ref&gt; and used in the mineral mining industry (such as in extracting [[tin]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]]).  Many of the relics seen today date from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times.

Early examples of buddle pits were often natural hollows in the ground, adapted by lining them with stone or clay to make them waterproof.

A purpose-built pit, constructed from stone or brick, cement and mortar, contained water, and a set of brushes, often powered by a [[water wheel]], which rotated in the water in order to agitate the mixture, the result of which was that the heavier and denser material - i.e. the ore - tended to collect at the centre of the pit, from where it could be retrieved. The worthless [[gangue]] was then disposed of, often by draining.&lt;ref&gt;''Undiscovered Wales: Fifteen Circular Walks'', by Kevin Walker, Francis Lincoln, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a set of buddle pits was utilised, with the richer central deposits in the pit being carried to another buddle, where they were treated in the same manner, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Mining and mining machinery: explaining the methods of obtaining minerals, precious stones, &amp;c., in all parts of the world'', by Sydney Ferris Walker, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the round buddle pit was the most common, there was a variation called the concave buddle, which had a concave bottom.&lt;ref&gt;''Machinery for Metalliferous Mines: A practical treatise for mining engineers, metallurgists and managers of mines'', by E. Henry Davies, C. Lockwood and son, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;


The following detailed extract comes from ''Machinery for Metalliferous Mines: A practical treatise for mining engineers, metallurgists and managers of mines'', by E. Henry Davies, C. Lockwood and son, 1902 :

{{quote
|'' The concentrating machine for slimes, which has hitherto been a great favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, bevel wheels, and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.

''The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head ; the liquid stream, which should be in a uniform thin film, falls over the edge of the fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.

''The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made ; for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.

''The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.''

A '''buffer''' in [[GIS]] is a zone around a map feature measured in units of distance or time. A buffer is useful for [[proximity analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, T. and Smmer, S. eds. ''[http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=868&amp;Category_ID=49 A to Z GIS]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A buffer is an area defined by the bounding region determined by a set of points at a specified maximum distance from all nodes along segments of an object.

Axial flow combines (also known as rotary harvesters) are a type of [[combine harvester]] that has been manufactured by [[International Harvester]], and later [[Case International]], [[Case Corporation]] and [[CNH Global]], used by farmers to harvest a wide range of [[grain]]s around the world.

Introduced in 1977, these harvesters marked a departure from traditional combine harvester design, in that threshing and separation was performed mainly by a rotor, as opposed to the drum and straw walker type models used previously.  This is shown in the image at right, where the bulk of the processing area is devoted to a cylinder, that spins and threshes grain from the grain heads and allows for far greater capacity than the previous drum and walker design of harvester.  This increase in capacity has led to a significant productivity increase of harvesters and therefore farmers who use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klancher|first1=Lee|title=Red Combines 1915-2015|publisher=Octane Press|isbn=978-1937747459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotary design by International Harvester was the first of its kind to be mass-produced and its patent over the design gave IH a competitive advantage over its rivals, including [[John Deere]], [[Massey Ferguson]], [[New Holland Machine Company|New Holland]] and others.

==Models==

The following is a summary of the model development of the Case IH harvester to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toytractorshow.com/ih_conventional_combine_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 14 series ===
International Harvester had launched the 15 series of conventional combine harvesters in 1968.  In 1977, after extensive engineering efforts and a bottom up design, IH released the 1440 and 1460 models of harvester.  In 1978, the larger model 1480 was released, as well as the specialty models 1470 (for hillside operation), and the 1482, designed to be pulled behind a tractor with PTO capability.  Further models were introduced as the series was developed including the 1420 in 1980,

=== The 16 series ===
In 1985, [[International Harvester]] and [[Case Corporation]] merged.

The 16 series was the first harvester series released by the new Case International and was an upgrade to the 14 series rather than a replacement.   All models of the 14 series had 16 series equivalents, in the 1620, 1640, 1660, 1670, 1680 and 1682.

=== The 16-4/6/8 series ===
Released in 1993, the 16 series was again upgraded to the 16-4/6/8 series.  Models included the 1644, 1666 and 1688, and incorporated many changes to improve processing capacity.

=== The 21 series ===
[[Tenneco]] demerged [[CaseIH]] in 1995 and the new [[Case Corporation]] released the 21 series combine harvesters, comprising the 2144, 2166, 2188.  These models represented a significant step forward in the model design featuring improved operator comfort, higher power engines and a range of other productivity and user ease improvements.

=== The 23 series ===
Making incremental improvements on the 21 series, the 23 series were quite similar to the 21 series featuring more upgrades to engine power and other improvements to harvester operation.  The series featured the 2344, 2366, 2377 and 2388 models. The 2377 was intended to replace the 2366, though the 2366 remained popular.

=== The 120 series ===
In 1999, [[CaseIH]] and [[New Holland AG]] merged to form [[CNH Global]].  As part of the post merger product simplification process, both harvester lines of CaseIH and New Holland were based on a common basic platform, with each model then customised to the features usually found on each harvester (e.g. cabin, external panelling, colouring, decals etc.).  These combine harvesters are manufactured in [[Grand Island, Nebraska]]

This series consisted of the 7120, 8120 and 9120 models and were based on a 5.4m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (7120) and 6.5m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (8120/9120) cleaning area.  Significant improvements were made to the design including replacing many chains and belts with hydraulic control, including the main rotor drive belt.  This hydraulic drive also allowed the fitting of an in cabin rotor reversing mechanism, allowing operators to reverse the entire rotor and feeder house in the event of a blockage.

=== The 88 series ===
The 88 series continued the 23 series line in parallel to the 120 series, and consisted of the 5088, 6088 and 7088 models.  This series had 5.48m2 of separation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caseiheurope.com/Media/490856a6-ee37-422f-bff2-0e5e02dd34f0/CaseIH_FlipViewer/en_gb/Axial_Flow_5088/Axial_Flow_5088/flipviewerxpress.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913160308/http://www.caseiheurope.com/Media/490856a6-ee37-422f-bff2-0e5e02dd34f0/CaseIH_FlipViewer/en_gb/Axial_Flow_5088/Axial_Flow_5088/flipviewerxpress.html |archivedate=2014-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  series has been phased out of production in most markets. Until they we stopped being made in 2009.

=== The 130/230 series ===
In 2009, the 130/230 series was released. It has a Tier 4a/Tier 4 interim engine emissions control.  This series has two sub-series with the difference based on total cleaning area.  The smaller sub-series uses a 5.9m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cleaning area and consists of the 5130 (Class V), 6130 (Class VI) and 7130 (Class VII) models.  The larger sub-series uses a 6.1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cleaning area and consists of the 7230 (Class VII), 8230 (Class VIII) and 9230 (Class IX) models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caseih.com/australia/Products/Harvesting/AxialFlowCombines/Documents/14AUSAFC001_Axial_Flow_0414_WEB.PDF{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4000 series ===

Based on the 66 series Axial-Flow harvesters, the 4000 series, 4077 and 4088 were produced from 2014 in CNH Industrial's Harbin plant in China

A '''cassette deck''' is a type of [[tape recorder|tape machine]] for playing and recording audio [[compact cassette]]s. Consumer electronics formerly used the term ''deck'' to distinguish them from a ''tape recorder'', the "deck" being part of a [[high fidelity|stereo component system]], while a "tape recorder" was more portable and usually had a self-contained power amplifier (and often speakers).

Although the two terms became interchangeable, a recorder is typically thought of as a low-fidelity portable device, while a deck is considered a [[high fidelity]] component.&lt;ref name=BILLREP1&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=1–28|edition=Vol 79., No. 14|type=28-page supplement|chapter=The Phillips cassette around the world: A Billboard report|date=1967-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--''Please note that this ref is for the whole para''--&gt;

=== Origins ===

[[Image:RadioShack-ctr-119.jpg|thumb|right|A typical portable desktop cassette recorder from [[RadioShack]].]]
The first consumer tape recorder to employ a tape reel permanently housed in a small removable cartridge was the [[RCA tape cartridge]], which appeared in 1958 as a predecessor to the cassette format. At that time, [[reel to reel]] recorders and players were commonly used by enthusiasts, but required large individual reels and tapes which had to be threaded by hand, making them less-accessible to the casual consumer. Both [[RCA]] and Bell Sound attempted to commercialize the cartridge format, but a few factors stalled adoption, including lower-than-advertised availability of selections in the prerecorded media catalog, delays in production setup, and a stand-alone design that was not considered by audiophiles to be truly hi-fi.&lt;ref name="rca cartridge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dianaschnuth.com/details/audio/cartridge.html |title=RCA Cartridges: 1958 - 1964 |last=Cook |first=Diana |last2=Morton |first2=David |publisher=Diana Cook |website=A History of Magnetic Audio Tape |access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "compact cassette" (a Philips trademark)&lt;ref name=BILLREP1 /&gt; was introduced by the [[Philips]] Corporation at the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harsmedia.com/SoundBlog/Archief/00793.php Mourning and Celebrating 50 years of Compact Cassette] - SoundBlog, 23 March 2013.

Time Magazine, 12 August 2013, p. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed as a device purely intended for portable speech-only [[dictation machine]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The tape width was &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;inch (actually 0.15&amp;nbsp;inch, 3.81&amp;nbsp;mm) and tape speed was 1.875&amp;nbsp;inches (4.8&amp;nbsp;cm) per second, giving a decidedly non Hi-Fi frequency response and quite high noise levels.&lt;ref name="cassettes 1963"&gt;{{cite web

Early recorders were  intended for dictation and journalists, and were typically hand-held battery-powered devices with built-in microphones and [[automatic gain control]] on recording. Tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s, and a cassette deck with manual level controls and [[VU meter]]s became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems.&lt;ref name=BILLREP1 /&gt; Eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced, in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size, expense, and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reels - cassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding. Cassettes became extremely popular for automotive and other  portable music applications.  Although pre-recorded cassettes were widely available, many users would combine ([[Dubbing (music)|dub]]) songs from their [[vinyl record]]s or cassettes to make a new custom [[mixtape]] cassette.

In 1970, the [[Advent Corporation]] combined [[Dolby Noise Reduction|Dolby B]] noise reduction system with [[chromium dioxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tape to create the [[Advent Model 200]], the first high-fidelity cassette deck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidreaton.com/Cassette_Decks.htm Advent cassette decks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625174438/http://www.davidreaton.com/Cassette_Decks.htm |date=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby B uses volume [[companding]] of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9&amp;nbsp;dB, reducing them (and the hiss) on playback.  CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used different bias and equalization settings to reduce the overall noise level and extend the high frequency response. Together these allowed a usefully flat frequency response beyond 15&amp;nbsp;kHz for the first time. This deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by Nakamichi, then soon replaced by the Model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by [[Wollensak]], a division of [[3M]], which was commonly used in audio/visual applications. Both featured an unusual single VU meter which could be switched between or for both channels. The Model 200 featured [[piano key]] style transport controls, with the Model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era.

Most manufacturers adopted a standard top-loading format with [[piano key]] controls, dual VU meters, and slider level controls. There was a variety of configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s, which settled on front-loading (see main picture) with cassette well on one side, dual VU meters on the other, and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle. Mechanical controls were replaced with electronic push buttons controlling [[solenoid]] mechanical actuators, though low cost models would retain mechanical controls. Some models could search and count gaps between songs.

=== Widespread use ===
Cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications, home audio systems, and for mobile use in cars, as well as portable recorders. From the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the cassette deck was the preferred music source for the [[automobile]]. Like an [[8-track cartridge]], it was relatively insensitive to vehicle motion, but it had reduced tape [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], as well as the obvious advantages of smaller physical size and fast forward/rewind capability.
A major boost to the cassette's popularity came with the release of the [[Sony Walkman]] "personal" cassette player in 1979, designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact "wearable" music source. Although the vast majority of such players eventually sold were not Sony products, the name "Walkman" has become synonymous with this type of device.

Cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio, and many in professional audio, 
with each company offering models of very high quality.

=== Performance improvements and additional features ===
Cassette decks reached their pinnacle of performance and complexity by the mid-1980s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Cassette decks from companies such as [[Nakamichi]], [[Revox]], and [[Tandberg]] incorporated advanced features such as multiple [[tape head]]s and dual [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] drive with separate reel motors. Auto-reversing decks became popular and were standard on most factory installed automobile decks. 

As a part of the [[Digital Revolution]], the ongoing development of [[Electronics|electronics technology]] [[Moore's Law|decreased the cost of digital circuitry]] to the point that the technology could be applied to [[Consumer electronics|consumer electronics]]. The application of such [[Digital electronics|digital electronics]] to cassette decks provides an early example of [[Mechatronics|mechatronic]] design, which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance, increase system flexibility, or reduce cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Amerongen |first=Job |editor-last=Bishop |editor-first=Robert H. |title=Mechatronics: An Introduction |publisher=CRC Press |date=2005 |page=12.1 |chapter=Chapter 12: The Role of Controls in Mechatronics |isbn=978-1-4200-3724-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTfQPQRooMgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of [[Logic gate|logic circuitry]] and [[Solenoid|solenoids]] into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks, often referred to "logic control," contrasts with earlier "piano-key" transport controls and mechanical linkages. One goal of using logic circuitry in cassette decks or recorders was to [[Error-tolerant design|minimize equipment damage upon incorrect user input]] by including [[Fail-safe|fail-safes]] into the transport and control mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = United States | number = 3347996 A | title = Control system for a magnetic recorder | pubdate = 1967-10-17 | fdate = 1963-10-25 | pridate = 1962-10-27 | inventor = Goji Uchikoshi | url = https://www.google.com/patents/US3347996}} "By the provision of a logical circuit in the control circuit for a magnetic recorder, even when the keys of the key board are actuated in any desired sequence, the magnetic recorder and its associated devices can be promptly and precisely controlled without causing any damages thereon."&lt;/ref&gt; Such fail-safe behavior was described in a review by [[Julian Hirsch]] of a particular cassette deck featuring logic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Hirsch |first1= Julian|author-link1=Julian Hirsch |date= May 1979 |title=Eumig 'CCD' Cassette Deck |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Poptronics/70s/1979/Poptronics-1979-05.pdf  |magazine=[[Popular Electronics]] |access-date=18 Dec 2017 |quote=The transport controls are fully logic operated through solenoids.

Three-head technology uses separate heads for recording and playback (the third of the three heads being the erase head). 
This allows different record and playback head gaps to be used. 
A narrower head gap is optimal for playback than for recording, so the head gap width of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise.  
Separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording, permitting immediate verification of the recording quality. 
(Such machines can be identified by the presence of a "monitor" switch with positions for "tape" and "source", or similar.) 
Three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks, but were more difficult to implement for cassettes, 
which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads. 
Some models squeezed a monitor head into the capstan area, and others combined separate record and playback gaps into a single headshell.

The [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby B noise reduction system]] was key to realizing low noise performance on slow, narrow, cassette tapes. It works by boosting the high frequencies on recording, especially low-level high-frequency sounds, with corresponding high frequency reduction on playback. This lowers the high frequency noise (hiss) by approximately 9&amp;nbsp;dB. Enhanced versions included [[Dolby C]] (in 1980) and [[Dolby S]] types. Of the three, however, only Dolby B became common on automobile decks.

[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] developed the [[HX Pro]] headroom extension system in conjunction with [[Dolby Laboratories]] in 1982. This was used in many higher-end decks. HX Pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content. Such a signal is self-biasing. Reducing the level of the bias signal permits the desired signal to be recorded at a higher level without saturating the tape, thus increasing "headroom" or maximum recording level.

Some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically.

In later years, an "auto reverse" feature appeared that allowed the deck to play (and, in some decks, record) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. 
Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. 
Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. 
Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase head, 
such decks must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.

In later auto reverse machines, the "auto reverse" mechanism uses an ordinary two-track, quarter-width head, 
but operates by mechanically rotating the head 180 degrees so that the two head gaps access the other tracks of the tape. 
There is usually an azimuth adjustment screw for each position. 
Nevertheless, due to the repeated movement, the alignment (in particular, the azimuth) deviates with usage. 
Even in a machine with a four channel head, slight asymmetries in the cassette shell make it difficult to align the 
head perfectly for both directions. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In one machine, the "Dragon", Nakamichi addressed the issue with a motor-driven automatic head alignment mechanism. 
This proved effective but very expensive. 
A later Nakamichi auto-reverse model was essentially a single-directional deck, 
but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport, flipped it over, and re-inserted it. 
Akai made a similar machine but doing it "flat" instead of "upright".&lt;!-- this begs explanation. There is only one axis of rotation that can have the desired result. --&gt; 
This permitted the convenience of auto-reverse with little compromise in record or playback quality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

New tape formulations were introduced. 
[[Chromium dioxide]] (referred to as CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Type II) was the first tape designed for extended high frequency response, but it required higher bias. Later, as the IEC Type II standard was defined, a different equalization settings was also mandated to reduce hiss, thus giving up some extension at the high end of the audio spectrum. 
Better-quality cassette recorders soon appeared with a switch for the tape type. 
Later decks incorporated coded holes in the shell to autodetect the tape type. 
Chromium dioxide tape was thought to cause increased wear on the heads, so TDK and Maxell adapted cobalt-doped ferric formulations to mimic CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
Sony briefly tried FerriChrome (Type III) which claimed to combine the best of both; some people, however, stated that the reverse was true because the Cr top layer seemed to wear off quickly, reducing this type to Fe in practice. Most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes (IEC Type IV) which require still higher bias for recording, though they will play back correctly at the II setting since the equalization is the same.

With all of these improvements, the best units could record and play the full audible spectrum from 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to over 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (although this was commonly quoted at -10, -20 or even -30&amp;nbsp;dB, not at full output level), with [[wow (recording)|wow and flutter]] less than 0.05% and very low noise. A high-quality recording on  cassette could rival the sound of an average commercial CD, though the quality of pre-recorded cassettes has been regarded by the general public as lower than could be achieved in a quality home recording.&lt;ref name=FORUM1&gt;{{cite news|title=Prerecorded cassette quality?|website=AudioKarma.org|type=Forum|date=2005-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a call for better sound quality in 1981, surprisingly by the head of [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], Russ Solomon. At a meeting of the [[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] (NARM) Retail Advisory Committee in [[Carlsbad, California]], Solomon played two recordings of a [[Santana (band)|Santana]] track; one he had recorded himself and the pre-recorded cassette release from [[Columbia Records]]. He used this technique to demonstrate what he called "the tunnel effect" in the audio range of pre-recorded cassettes and commented to the reporter Sam Sutherland, who wrote a news article printed in Billboard magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The buyer who is aware of sound quality is making his own." [...] "They won't be satisfied with the 'tunnel effect' of prerecorded tape. And home tape deck users don't use prerecorded tapes at all." Yet, contended Solomon, while Tower's own stores show strong blank tape sales gains, it's prerecorded sales have increased by only 2% to 3%. With an estimated 15% of the chain's total tape business now generated by the sales of blanks, "it would appear our added tape sales are going to TDK, Maxell and Sony, not you." he concluded. - Billboard Magazine, Vol. 93, No. 38, 26 Sep 1981.&lt;ref name=BILLBOARDSS1&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=Better Cassette Quality Urged|date=26 Sep 1981|volume=93|issue=38|pages=3, 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT5&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=pre+recorded+cassette+quality+v+home+recording&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9TyA8aBny&amp;sig=BEYN3h73kCsP0waJj46ts-u_MEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XVJ_UeynN8PYPbOXgPgD&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCA|accessdate=4 June 2013|first=Sam |last= Sutherland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Noise reduction and fidelity==
A variety of [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]] and other schemes are used to increase fidelity, with [[Dolby B]] being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording. Dolby B was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes,  and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium. At the same time, Dolby B provided acceptable performance when played back on decks that lacked Dolby circuitry, meaning there was little reason not to use it if it was available.

The main alternative to Dolby was the [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] noise reduction system, which achieved a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]], but was essentially unlistenable when played back on decks that lacked the dbx decoding circuitry.

[[Philips]] developed an alternative noise reduction system known as [[Dynamic Noise Limiter]] (DNL) which did not require the tapes to be processed during recording; this was also the basis of the later [[Dynamic Noise Reduction|DNR]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freespace.virgin.net/ljmayes.mal/comp/philips.htm Circuit and description of DNL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105073059/http://freespace.virgin.net/ljmayes.mal/comp/philips.htm |date=November 5, 2008 }} URL accessed August 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolby later introduced [[Dolby C]] and [[Dolby S]] noise reduction, which achieved higher levels of noise reduction; Dolby C became common on high-fidelity decks, but Dolby S, released when cassette sales had begun to decline, never achieved widespread use. It was only licensed for use on higher end tape decks that included dual motors, triple heads, and other refinements.

[[Dolby HX Pro]] headroom extension provided better high-frequency response by adjusting the inaudible [[tape bias]] during the recording of strong high-frequency sounds, which had a bias effect of their own. Developed by [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]], it did not require a decoder to play back. Since B&amp;O held patent rights and required paying license fees, many other manufacturers refrained from using it too.

Other refinements to improve cassette performance included Tandberg's DYNEQ, Toshiba's {{Interlanguage link multi|adres|ja}} and Telefunken's [[High Com]], and on some high-end decks, automatic [[recording bias]], fine pitch adjustment and (sometimes) head azimuth adjustment such as the Tandberg TCD-330 and TCD-340A.

By the late 1980s, thanks to such improvements in the electronics, the tape material and manufacturing techniques, as well as dramatic improvements to the precision of the cassette shell, [[tape head]]s and transport mechanics, sound fidelity on equipment from the top manufacturers far surpassed the levels originally expected of the medium. On suitable audio equipment, cassettes could produce a very pleasant listening experience. High-end cassette decks could achieve 15&amp;nbsp;Hz-22&amp;nbsp;kHz±3&amp;nbsp;dB [[frequency response]] with [[Wow (recording)|wow]] and [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] below 0.022%, and a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of up to 61&amp;nbsp;dB (for Type IV tape, without noise-reduction){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . With noise reduction typical signal-to-noise figures of 70-76&amp;nbsp;dB with Dolby C, 80-86&amp;nbsp;dB with Dolby S, and 85 - 90&amp;nbsp;dB with dbx could be achieved. Many casual listeners could not tell the difference between compact cassette and compact disc.

From the early 1980s, the fidelity of prerecorded cassettes began to improve dramatically. Whereas Dolby B was already in widespread use in the 1970s, prerecorded cassettes were duplicated onto rather poor quality tape stock at (often) high speed and did not compare in fidelity to high-grade LPs. However, systems such as [[XDR (audio)|XDR]], along with the adoption of higher-grade tape (such as chromium dioxide, but typically recorded in such a way as to play back at the normal 120 μs position), and the frequent use of Dolby HX Pro, meant that cassettes became a viable high-fidelity option, one that was more portable and required less maintenance than records. In addition, cover art, which had generally previously been restricted to a single image of the LP cover along with a minimum of text, began to be tailored to cassettes as well, with fold-out lyric sheets or librettos and fold-out sleeves becoming commonplace.

Some companies, such as [[Mobile Fidelity]], produced [[audiophile]] cassettes in the 1980s, which were recorded on high-grade tape and duplicated on premium equipment in real time from a digital master. Unlike audiophile LPs, which continue to attract a following, these became moot after the [[Compact Disc]] became widespread.

Almost all cassette decks have an [[MPX filter]] to improve the sound quality and the tracking of the noise reduction system when recording from a FM stereo broadcast. However, in many especially cheaper decks, this filter cannot be disabled, and because of that record/playback frequency response in those decks typically is limited to 16&amp;nbsp;kHz. In other decks, the MPX filter can be switched off or on independently from the Dolby switch. On yet other decks, the filter is off by default, and an option to switch it on or off is only provided when Dolby is activated; this prevents the MPX filter from being used when it's not required.

== In-car entertainment systems ==
A key element of the cassette's success was its use in [[in-car entertainment]] systems, where the small size of the tape was significantly more convenient than the competing [[8-track cartridge]] system. Cassette players in cars and for home use were often integrated with a [[radio receiver]], and the term "casseiver" was occasionally used for combination units for home use. In-car cassette players were the first to adopt automatic reverse ("auto-reverse") of the tape direction at each end, allowing a cassette to be played endlessly without manual intervention. Home cassette decks soon added the feature.  In-car cassette players are preferred by some particularly for their cheaper cost and serviceability.

[[Cassette tape adaptor]]s have been developed which allow newer media players to be played through existing cassette decks, in particular those in cars which generally do not have input jacks. These units do not suffer from reception problems from FM transmitter based system to play back media players through the FM radio, though supported frequencies for FM transmitters that aren't used on commercial broadcasters in a given region (e.g. any frequency below 88.1 in the US) somewhat eliminates that problem.

=== Maintenance ===
Cassette equipment needs regular maintenance, as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the [[tape head]] and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism. Without such maintenance, the high frequency response of the cassette equipment will suffer.

One problem occurs when iron oxide (or similar) particles from the tape itself become lodged in the playback head. As a result, the tape heads will require occasional cleaning to remove such particles. The metal [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] and the rubber pinch roller can become coated with these particles, leading them to pull the tape less precisely over the head; this in turn leads to misalignment of the tape over the head azimuth, producing noticeably unclear high tones, just as if the head itself were out of alignment.

The heads and other metallic components in the tape path (such as spindles and [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstans]]) may become magnetized with use, and require demagnetizing (see [[Cassette demagnetizer]]).

[[Isopropyl alcohol]] and [[Denatured alcohol]] are both suitable head-cleaning fluids. ([[Rubbing alcohol]] may contain oil which is not suitable.) Head cleaning fluid is a relatively expensive way to buy isopropyl alcohol.

== Decline in popularity ==
Analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the [[compact disc]] and other digital recording technologies such as [[digital audio tape]] (DAT), [[MiniDisc]], and the [[CD-R]] recorder drives. Philips responded with the [[digital compact cassette]], a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback, but it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn. One reason proposed for the lack of acceptance of digital recording formats such as DAT was a fear by content providers that the ability to make very high quality copies would hurt sales of copyrighted recordings.

The rapid transition was not realized and CDs and cassettes successfully co-existed for nearly 20 years.  A contributing factor may have been the inability of early CD players to reliably read discs with surface damage and offer anti-skipping features for applications where external vibration would be present, such as automotive and recreation environments.  Early CD playback equipment also tended to be expensive compared to cassette equipment of similar quality and did not offer recording capability.  Many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the CD playback to be recorded on cassette tape.  The rise of inexpensive all-solid-state portable digital music systems based on [[MP3]], [[LC-AAC|AAC]] and similar formats finally saw the eventual decline of the domestic cassette deck.  [[Tascam]], [[Marantz]], [[Yamaha]], [[Teac]], [[Denon]], [[Sony]], and [[JVC]] are among the companies still manufacturing cassette decks in relatively small quantities for professional and niche market use. By the late 1990s, automobiles were offered with entertainment systems that played both cassettes and CDs. By the end of the late 2000s, very few cars were offered with cassette decks. As radios became tightly integrated into dashboards, many cars lacked even standard openings that would accept aftermarket cassette player installations.

Despite the decline in the production of cassette decks, these products are still valued by some. Many [[blindness|blind]] and elderly people find the newest digital technologies very difficult to use compared to the cassette format. Cassette tapes are not vulnerable to scratching from handling (though the exposed magnetic tape is vulnerable to stretching from poking), and play from where they were last stopped (though some modern [[MP3 player]]s offer [[savestating]] electronically).  Cassette tapes can also be recorded multiple times (though some solid-state digital recorders are now offering that function).

Today, cassette decks are not considered by most people to be either the most versatile or highest fidelity sound recording devices available, as even very inexpensive CD or digital audio players can reproduce a wide frequency range with no speed variations. Many current budget-oriented cassette decks lack a tape selector to set proper bias and equalization settings to take best advantage of the extended high end of Type II [High Bias] and Type IV [Metal Bias] tapes.

Cassettes remain popular for audio-visual applications. Some CD recorders, particularly those intended for business use, incorporate a cassette deck to allow both formats for recording meetings, church sermons and books on tape.

A '''clapperboard''' is a device used in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] to assist in synchronizing of picture and sound, and to designate and mark the various [[Scene (fiction)|scene]]s and [[take]]s as they are filmed and audio-recorded.  Other names include '''clapper''', '''clapboard''', '''clacker''', '''slate''', '''slate board''', '''slapperboard''', '''sync slate''', '''time slate''', '''sticks''', '''board''', '''smart slate''', '''dumb slate'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2014/02/27/282934889/clap-on-set-the-signature-sound-of-the-slate npr.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''sound marker'''.

When a movie's sound and picture are out of synchronization, this is known as [[lip flap]].

== Overview ==
Clapperboards have been essential to filmmaking since the earliest [[sound film]]s because (until the advent of [[digital cinematography]]) visual and audio tracks were recorded on separate media by separate equipment. The clapperboard combines a '[[chalkboard]] slate' with a 'clapstick'. The [[slate]] displays the name of the production, the scene and "take" about to be performed, and similar information;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soniak |first1=Matt |title=Why Do They Click That Board Thing Before Filming A Movie Scene? |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31781/why-do-they-click-board-thing-filming-movie-scene |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate= 2015-12-27}}{{better source |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an assistant holds the clapperboard so the slate is in view of the cameras, speaks out information for the benefit of the audio recording, then opens the clapstick and claps it shut. The shutting of the clapstick is easily identified on the visual track, and the sharp "clap" noise is easily identified on the separate audio track; the two tracks can later be precisely synchronised by matching the sound and movement. And since each take is identified on both the visual and audio tracks, segments of film are easily matched with segments of audio.

Traditional clapperboards consisted of a wooden slate with a hinged clapstick attached to its top. Modern clapperboards generally use a pair of wooden sticks atop either a [[whiteboard]] or a translucent [[acrylic glass]] slate (the latter being easily legible via the light coming through it from the scene about to be shot). Smart slates or digislates are electronic [[SMPTE time code]] versions with digitally displayed information. The clapsticks traditionally have diagonally interleaved lines of black and white to ensure a clear visual of the clap in most lighting conditions. In recent years sticks with calibrated color stripes have become available. In some productions, particularly those created in the [[Digital data|digital]] domain, electronically superimposed versions of a clapperboard have supplanted the real thing.

The slate typically includes the date, the production title, the name of the [[film director|director]], the name of the [[director of photography]] (DP) and the scene information — which follows two popular systems:
# American: [[scene (fiction)|scene]] number, [[camera angle]] and [[take]] number; e.g. ''scene 24, C, take 3'';
# European: slate number, [[take]] number (with the letter of the camera shooting the slate if using [[multiple-camera setup]]); e.g. ''slate 256, take 3C''.
Often the European system will also include the scene number; however, a separate ''continuity sheet'' that maps the ''slate'' number to the scene number, camera angle and take number may be used if the scene number is not included on the slate. This is generally not as great a concern with short films, however. The [[clapper loader]] (or 2nd AC) is generally responsible for the maintenance and operation of the clapperboard, while the [[script supervisor]] is responsible for determining which system will be used and what numbers a given take should have. While these are usually fairly obvious once a system has been agreed upon, the script supervisor is usually considered the final arbiter in the event of an unclear situation.

A verbal identification of the numbers, known either as "voice slate" or "announcement", occurs after sound has reached speed. At the same time or shortly thereafter, the camera will start running, and the clapperboard is then filmed briefly at the start of the 'take' and the clapsticks are clapped sharply as soon as the camera has reached sync speed. Specific procedures vary depending on the nature of the production (documentary, television, feature, commercial, etc.) and the dominant [[Clapper loader|camera assisting]] conventions of the region; therefore it is not possible to describe a definitive practice aside from the general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cybercollege.org/tvp059.htm |title=Studio TV Production |publisher=Cybercollege.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, instead of preparing an actual slate, a voice slate will be announced (often by an actor in the scene) and then the actor will clap their hands together, to provide the synchronisation mark.

Sometimes a tail slate or end slate is filmed at the end of a take, during which the clapperboard is held upside-down. This is done when the clapperboard was not captured at the start of the take due to the camera being set up for the shot in such a way that the board cannot be captured, for example when a specific focus or frame is set up and cannot be altered until the take is complete.  A clapper board is generally used to identify all takes on a production, even takes that do not require synchronization, such as [[MOS (film)|MOS]] takes. When a slate is used to mark an MOS take, the slate is held half open, with a hand blocking the sticks, or closed, with a hand over the sticks.

The clapper (two sticks hinged together) was invented by [[F. W. Thring]] (father of actor [[Frank Thring]]), who was head of [[Efftee Studios]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Some mention that Efftee was not founded until 1931, not in the 1920s as sometimes stated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861930/bio Frank Thring (I) - Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the date of Efftee's founding does not assume the start of F.W. Thring's involvement in the industry. Consider the start of the Australian film industry with 1906's [[The Story of the Kelly Gang]], which was the first feature length narrative film in the world. The director of this film, [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]], was associated with [[J. C. Williamson]]. The former's production company, J. &amp; N. Tait, merged with the J. C. Williamson Film Company. F.W. Thring was managing director of J.C. Williamson Films in 1918. The clapboard with both the sticks and slate together was refined by Leon M. Leon (1903–1998) a pioneer sound engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0502499/bio imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coalbrookdale''' is a village in the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], England, containing a settlement of great significance in the history of iron ore smelting. It lies within the [[civil parish]] called [[The Gorge, Shropshire|the Gorge]].

This is where iron ore was first smelted by [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] using easily mined "coking coal". The coal was drawn from drift mines in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain, which was to become known as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the [[Ironbridge Institute]], a partnership between the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]] offering postgraduate and professional development courses in [[Industrial heritage|heritage]].

==Before Abraham Darby==
Before the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and the adjacent [[Little Wenlock]] belonged to [[Much Wenlock Priory]]. At the Dissolution there was a [[bloomery|bloomsmithy]] called "Caldebroke Smithy". The manor passed about 1572 to John Brooke, who developed coal mining in his manor on a substantial scale. His son Sir [[Basil Brooke (metallurgist)|Basil Brooke]] was a significant industrialist, and invested in ironworks elsewhere. It is probable that he also had ironworks at Coalbrookdale, but evidence is lacking. He also acquired an interest in the patent for the [[cementation process]] of making steel in about 1615. Though forced to surrender the patent in 1619, he continued making iron and steel until his estate was sequestrated during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], but the works continued in use.

In 1651, the manor was leased to Francis Wolfe, the clerk of the ironworks, and he and his son operated them as tenant of (or possibly manager for) Brooke's heirs. The surviving old [[blast furnace]] contains a cast-iron lintel bearing a date, which is currently painted as 1638, but an archive photograph has been found showing it as 1658. What ironworks existed at Coalbrookdale and from precisely what dates thus remains obscure. By 1688, the ironworks were operated by Lawrence Wellington, but a few years after the furnace was occupied by Shadrach Fox. He renewed the lease in 1696, letting the Great [[finery forge|Forge]] and Plate Forge to Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh (1985), p. 45-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence may suggest that Shadrach Fox smelted iron with mineral coal, though this remains controversial. Fox was evidently an [[iron founder]], as he supplied round shot and grenado shells to the [[Board of Ordnance]] during the [[Nine Years War]], but not later than April 1703, the furnace blew up. It remained derelict until the arrival of [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby the Elder]] in 1709. However the forges remained in use. A brass works was built sometime before 1712 (possibly as early as 1706), but closed in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;King (2002), p. 40-41; Cox (1990), p. 130-311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolution==
[[File:South West Prospect of Coalbrook Dale.jpg|thumb|280px|Coalbrookdale in 1758]]
In 1709, the first Abraham Darby rebuilt Coalbrookdale Furnace,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coalbrookdale|volume=6|page=593}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] as his fuel. His business was that of an ironfounder,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; making cast-iron pots and other goods, an activity in which he was particularly successful because of his patented foundry method, which enabled him to produce cheaper pots than his rivals. Coalbrookdale has been claimed as the home of the world's first coke-fired [[blast furnace]]; this is not strictly correct, but it was the first in Europe to operate successfully for more than a few years.&lt;ref&gt;King (2009), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darby renewed his lease of the works in 1714, forming a new partnership with John Chamberlain and [[Thomas Baylies]]. They built a second furnace in about 1715, which was intended to be followed up with a furnace at Dolgûn near [[Dolgellau]] and taking over [[Vale Royal Furnace]] in 1718. However, Darby died prematurely in 1717, followed quickly by his widow Mary. The partnership was dissolved before Mary's death, Baylies taking over Vale Royal. After Mary's death, Baylies had difficulty extracting his capital. The works then passed to a company led by his fellow [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Thomas Goldney II]] of [[Bristol]] and managed by [[Richard Ford (ironmaster)|Richard Ford]] (also a Quaker). Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II|Abraham Darby the Younger]] was brought into the business as an assistant manager when old enough.

The company's main business was producing [[cast iron|cast-iron]] goods. Molten iron for this foundry work was not only produced from the blast furnaces, but also by remelting [[pig iron]] in air furnaces, a variant of the [[reverberatory furnace]]. The Company also became early suppliers of [[steam engine]] cylinders in this period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

From 1720, the Company operated a forge at Coalbrookdale but this was not profitable. In about 1754, renewed experiments took place with the application of coke [[pig iron]] to the production of [[wrought iron|bar iron]] in [[charcoal]] [[finery forge]]s. This proved to be a success, and led to the partners building new furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]]. This was the beginning of a great expansion in coke ironmaking.

In 1767, the Company began to produce the first cast-iron [[Rail tracks|rails]] for [[History of rail transport|railway]]s. In 1778, [[Abraham Darby III]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; undertook the building of the world's first cast-iron bridge, the iconic [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]], opened 1 January 1781. The fame of this bridge leads many people today to associate the iron-making part of the Industrial Revolution with the neighbouring village of [[Ironbridge]], but in fact most of the work was done at Coalbrookdale, as there was no settlement at Ironbridge in the eighteenth century. Expansion of Coalbrookdale's industrial facilities continued, with the development of sophisticated ponds and culverts to provide water power, and even [[Resolution (beam engine)|''Resolution'']], a [[water-returning engine|water-returning]] beam engine to recirculate this water.

In 1795, the first porcelain factory near Coalbrookdale was founded at Coalport, east of the Iron Bridge, by [[William Reynolds (industrialist)|William Reynolds]] and John Rose,&lt;ref&gt;Trinder (2000), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; producing [[Coalport#Pottery|Coalport]] porcelain.

In the 19th century, Coalbrookdale was noted for its decorative ironwork.&lt;ref&gt;Trinder (1996), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is here (for example) that the gates of London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] were built. Other examples include the Coalbrookdale [[verandah]] at [[St John's, Monmouth|St John's]] in [[Monmouth]], Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Johns Garden, Monmouth|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/266092/details/ST+JOHNS+GARDEN%2C+MONMOUTH/|work=coflein.gov.uk|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as far away as the [[Peacock Fountain]] in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Art in Central Christchurch|url=http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2010_07/PublicArt-ChCh-1997.pdf#page=34|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blast furnaces were closed down, perhaps as early as the 1820s, but the foundries remained in use. The Coalbrookdale Company became part of an alliance of ironfounding companies called Light Castings Limited. This was absorbed by Allied Ironfounders Limited in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1990), p. 131-144; Raistrick (1989); Thomas (1999); Trinder (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; This was in turn taken over by Glynwed which has since become [[AGA cooker|Aga]] Foodservice.  The Coalbrookdale foundry closed in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coalbrookdale Aga foundry to close by end of November|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-42066878|accessdate=23 November 2017|agency=[[BBC]]|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Coalbrookdale's industrial heritage sites are to be found on the local trail: including: [[Coalbrookdale railway station]], the Quaker Burial Ground, the Darby Houses, Tea Kettle Row and the [[Great Western Railway]] Viaduct.

==Museum==
{{details|Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron}}
In the century after the Old Blast Furnace closed, it became buried. There was a proposal for the site to be cleared and the furnace dismantled, but instead, it was decided to excavate and preserve it. It and a small museum were opened to celebrate 250 years of the Company in 1959. This became part of a larger project, the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museums]]. Its Museum of Iron is based in the Great Warehouse constructed in 1838 and Ironbridge Institute is based in the Long Warehouse, these two form the sides of an open space. On another side of which is the Old Blast Furnace, now under a building (erected in 1981) to protect it from the weather. The fourth side is a viaduct carrying the railway that delivers coal to the [[Ironbridge Power Station]]. One of the two tracks is due to be taken over by [[Telford Steam Railway]] as part of its southern extension from Horsehay. The Museum's [https://web.archive.org/web/20060719232519/http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/ archaeology unit] continues to investigate the earlier history of Coalbrookdale, and has recently excavated the remains of the 17th century [[cementation process|cementation furnace]]s, near the site of the Upper (formerly Middle) [[finery forge|Forge]].

==Old Furnace==
The Old Furnace began life as a typical blast furnace, but went over to [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in 1709. [[Abraham Darby I]] used it to cast pots, kettles and other goods. His grandson [[Abraham Darby III]] [[smelting|smelted]] the iron here for the first [[The Iron Bridge|Ironbridge]], the world's first iron bridge.

[[File:The Old Furnace, Coalbrookdale - geograph.org.uk - 571126.jpg|thumb|280px|The lintels of the Old Furnace, with inscriptions]]
The lintels of the furnace bear dated inscriptions. The uppermost reads "Abraham Darby 1777", probably recording its enlargement for casting the Iron Bridge. It is unclear whether the date on one of the lower ones should be 1638 (as it is now painted) or 1658 (as shown on an old photo). The interior profile of the furnace is typical of its period, bulging around the middle, below which the boshes taper in again so that the charge descends into a narrower and hotter hearth, where the iron was molten. When Abraham Darby III enlarged the furnace, he only made the boshes wider on the front and left sides, but not on the right where doing so would have entailed moving the water wheel. The mouth of the furnace is thus off-centre.

Iron was now being made in large quantities for many customers. In the 1720s and 1730s, its main products were [[cast iron|cast-iron]] cooking pots, [[kettle]]s and other domestic articles. It also cast the cylinders for [[Newcomen steam engine|steam engines]], and [[pig iron]] for use by other [[foundry|foundries]]. In the late 18th century, it sometimes produced structural ironwork, including for [[Buildwas]] Bridge. This was built in 1795, 2 miles up the river from the original Ironbridge. Due to advances in technology, it used only half as much cast iron despite being 30 feet (9 m) wider than the Ironbridge. The year after that, in 1796, [[Thomas Telford]] began a new project, [[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]]. It carried the [[Shrewsbury Canal]] over the [[River Tern]] and was supported by cast-iron columns. [[Charles Bage]] designed and built the world's first multi-storey cast-iron-framed mill. It used only brick and iron, with no wood, to improve its fire-resistance. In the 19th century ornamental ironwork became a speciality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9886">'''The Control Arms Coalition''' is a campaign jointly run by a coalition of over 100 organisations including [[Amnesty International]], [[IANSA (NGO)|IANSA]], [[Oxfam International]] and [[Saferworld]].  
[[File:2000 people killed by arms every day.jpg|thumb|235x235px|A Control Arms campaigner with a picture of his son at a media stunt in New York.]]
The campaign has been active since 2003 in calling for an international [[Arms Trade Treaty]] (ATT). The campaign began due to the lack of regulation in the international trade in arms. Control Arms has argued that the lack of controls on the [[arms industry|arms trade]] is fuelling [[armed conflict]], [[poverty]] and [[human rights abuses]] worldwide. Even though existing treaties and pieces of international law exist that focus on the international arms trade, none of them, before the Arms Trade Treaty, were legally binding and fully international.

Since 2003 it has used a range of tactics to get its message across, including publicity stunts, mass public actions, petitions including the Million Faces campaign, worldwide public consultations, policy publications and the lobbying of politicians and diplomats across the world.

The process towards creating an international Arms Trade Treaty began in the [[United Nations]] in 2006. On April 2, 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] voted overwhelmingly to adopt an international Arms Trade Treaty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;United Nations News Centre (2013-04-02). [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44539&amp;Cr=arms+trade&amp;Cr1 "UN General Assembly approves global arms trade treaty".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Arms Trade Treaty began as an idea in an [[NGO]] meeting in the 1990s. At the end of the decade, after successfully lobbying to bring about the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exporters, [[civil society]] groups worked with a group of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureates to draft proposals for the regulation of the international arms trade. In 2001, they began to circulate a "Draft Framework Convention on International Arms Transfers" and sought the support of governments around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International (2013-03-04). [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/016/2013/en/ "Timeline of Arms Trade Treaty Campaign Landmarks".]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Control Arms campaign began, campaigning for an international ATT in more than one hundred countries. One of the main elements of the early campaign was the 'Million Faces' petition. The petition brought together people from around the world who had suffered from armed conflict and armed violence as well as other supporters. The petition reached its goal in 2006, and the petition was presented to [[UN Secretary General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] by 'Millionth Face' Julius Arile, from [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations News Centre (2006-06-26). [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18997#.UjiP2MbBOSo "Annan receives arms petition by one-millionth signer, vows to transmit call onward".]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, UN Members voted to consider states' views on a potential Treaty and convene an expert group, with only the [[United States]] against.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly. ''[http://www.undemocracy.com/generalassembly_61/meeting_67#pg031-bk02 Verbatim Report ]''[http://www.undemocracy.com/generalassembly_61/meeting_67#pg031-bk02 Meeting 67 Session 61] Page 31 on 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside this consultation Control Arms conducted a parallel 'People's Consultation', holding events in over one hundred countries. The intention was to use ordinary people's voices to influence government's responses to the UN consultation. Whereas similar consultations usually result in ten to fifteen responses, when the UN Secretary-General presented the findings in 2007, the ATT consultation had received over one hundred.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International UK (2007-06-26). [https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/control-arms-governments-show-overwhelming-support-arms-treaty "Governments show overwhelming support for Arms Treaty".]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009 the UN voted overwhelmingly in favour of convening negotiations on an ATT, with Zimbabwe the only vote against.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Charbonneau, Reuters (2009-10-30). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/30/us-arms-treaty-un-idUSTRE59T4QN20091030 "U.N. backs negotiations on global arms trade treaty"].&lt;/ref&gt; States finally met In 2012 and 2013 to negotiate an ATT, all the while receiving significant input from civil society groups including Control Arms. On April 2, 2013, despite the objections of [[North Korea]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]], the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to support the ATT, in a 156-3-22 vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ATT has been open for signature since June 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2013-06-03). [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2013/130603_ATT.doc.htm "Press Conference on Opening for Signature of Arms Trade Treaty".]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities during the UN process===
Throughout the Arms Trade Treaty process, Control Arms worked closely with supportive governments in their campaign for a strong ATT. The campaign has maintained close relations with the co-authors of the original [[UN resolution|Resolution]] in 2006 - [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]] and the [[United Kingdom]] - as well as working closely with other supportive governments.

The campaign, with teams focusing on legal and policy issues, has also provided expertise and support to states with limited resources at the United Nations.

In turn, members of Control Arms have also been members of delegations during the process, including with Finland, [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Palau]] and the [[Solomon Islands]].

Control Arms have had a presence at all major meetings on the Arms Trade Treaty. In particular, representatives of the campaign participated in both UN negotiating conferences in July 2012 and March 2013, including making presentations on the views of civil society during plenary sessions.

As part of the ongoing process, the campaign organised petitions and other activities to engage the public with the campaign, culminating in a global call to "Speak Out" to get states to support a strong Arms Trade Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Control Arms. [http://controlarms.org/speakout/ "Speak Out" Petition].&lt;/ref&gt;

Control Arms, alongside [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom|Reaching Critical Will]], also operated a website [http://armstreaty.org  tracking states' positions on the Arms Trade Treaty]. Since April 2013, it also holds a record of states' votes for the final Resolution adopting the ATT, as well as a record of state signatures and ratifications.

===Success===
The main aim of the Control Arms campaign, achieving an international Arms Trade Treaty, was effectively met on April 2, 2013 when the United Nations voted to adopt the text agreed at the negotiating conference the previous month.

The Treaty had been the work of a concerted campaign over the course of more than a decade, and is particularly noteworthy given the speed in which it was agreed, and that it was agreed through the UN system. The UN [[Conference on Disarmament]] has been at a stalemate for over 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;Arms Control Association (2012-04). [http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2012_04/Pakistan_Blocks_CD_Agenda_Again "Pakistan Blocks CD Agenda Again"].&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative treaties, such as the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] and the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]], have had to find agreement outside the UN process.

As an indication of the centrality of civil society groups including Control Arms to the success of the process, a number of states, the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], and the President of the final negotiating conference all praised civil society for their contributions. Ban Ki-moon said that he commended "the members of civil society for their tireless campaigns, expert contributions and unwavering support".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Public Information (2013-06-03). [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sgsm15075.doc.htm "As Arms Trade Treaty Opens for Signature, Secretary-General Says It Will Deter Destabilizing Arms Flows, Particularly in Conflict-Prone Regions".]&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement given whilst signing the Arms Trade Treaty as Australian [[Ambassador]] to the UN, the President of the final conference, [[Peter Woolcott]], said that "[s]tates did not do this alone. It is important we recognize the enormous contribution of civil society who have been advocating for this Treaty for many years, who informed our negotiations and who have an important role in the years ahead".&lt;ref&gt;Opening for Signature of the Arms Trade Treaty (2013-06-03). [http://www.pgaction.org/pdf/activity/2013-03-05_President-designat-message-to-PGA-event-in-Namibia.pdf "Remarks by H.E. Ambassador Peter Woolcott of Australia, President of the Final United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the campaign==
Although the main goal of the Control Arms campaign has been achieved - an international Arms Trade Treaty has been agreed - the campaign will continue to be involved in the Arms Trade Treaty process. Currently, Control Arms is pushing members to ask their state to sign the Arms Trade Treaty as soon as possible.

In the future, the campaign will seek to monitor states' compliance with the Arms Trade Treaty, and push for states to ensure strong and consistent application of the Treaty.

[[File:Diseqc-switch.jpg|thumb|2-way DiSEqC switch]]
[[File:Commutateur-diseqc4x1-switch.jpg|thumb|4-way DiSEqC switch with attached coaxial cables.]]

'''DiSEqC''' (Digital Satellite Equipment Control), pronounced "Die-Sec",{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} is a special communication protocol for use between a [[satellite]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] and a device such as a multi-dish [[switch]] or a small&lt;ref&gt;The maximum dish size that can generally be used with a DiSEqC motor is 1.2m; however, using a V-box as in interface, DiSEqC 1.2 can be used for very large dishes using 36V motors.&lt;/ref&gt; dish [[Rotor (antenna)|antenna rotor]]. DiSEqC was developed by European satellite provider [[Eutelsat]], which now acts as the standards agency for the protocol.

==History==
Eutelsat apparently developed the system to allow satellite users in [[Continental Europe]] to switch between the more popular [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]] and Eutelsat's own [[Hot Bird]] system at 13° east. As a result, the vast majority of European satellite receivers support DiSEqC 1.0 or higher, with the exception of all set top boxes manufactured under the Sky [[Digibox (Sky Digital)|Digibox]] name. All supporting receivers have received certification to carry a logo specifying which variation of DiSEqC they support.

==Protocol==
DiSEqC relies only upon a [[coaxial]] cable to transmit both [[Duplex (telecommunications)|bidirectional]] [[data]]/[[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s and [[electrical energy|power]]. DiSEqC is commonly used to control switches and motors, and is more flexible than 13/18 volt and 22&amp;nbsp;kHz tone or ToneBurst/MiniDiSEqC techniques. DiSEqC is also compatible with the actuators used to rotate large [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] dishes if used with a DiSEqC positioner. DiSEqC uses a pulsed (tone-burst) 22&amp;nbsp;kHz sine-wave at 0.65&amp;nbsp;V (± 0.25&amp;nbsp;V)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutelsat.com/files/live/sites/eutelsatv2/files/contributed/satellites/pdf/Diseqc/Reference%20docs/bus_spec.pdf|title=Digital Satellite Equipment Control (DiSEqC) Bus Functional Specification (Version 4.2)|work=Eutelsat|date=1998-02-25|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; peak to peak.

The "Di" (digital) part of the name refers to the digital nature of the signals used by the protocol and does not imply anything about the transmission that the dish is used to receive; DiSEqC may be used with both digital or analogue satellite systems.

==Versions and compatibility==
A number of versions of DiSEqC exist:
* DiSEqC 1.0, which allows switching between up to 4 satellite sources
* DiSEqC 1.1, which allows switching between up to 16 sources
* DiSEqC 1.2, which allows switching between up to 16 sources, and control of a single axis satellite motor
* DiSEqC 2.0, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.0
* DiSEqC 2.1, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.1
* DiSEqC 2.2, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.2
* DiSEqC 3.0, which adds remote management of receivers to DiSEqC 2.2 to enable broadcast house uses 

First four variations were standardized by February 1998, prior to general use of digital [[satellite television]]. The later versions are backwards compatible with the lower revisions, but the lower revisions are, as might be expected, not forwards compatible with the higher revision numbers. 1.x and 2.x versions are both backwards and forwards compatible.

The terms DiSEqC 1.3 and 2.3 are also often used by manufacturers and retailers to refer to the use of DiSEqC with other protocols. For example, 1.3 usually refers to a receiver which uses [[Universal Satellites Automatic Location System|USALS]] in conjunction with the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. Such terminology has not been authorised by [[Eutelsat]].

The following table shows compatibility between the various DiSEqC versions:

[[File:FIR Filter General.svg|thumb|250px|A general [[finite impulse response]] filter with ''n'' stages, each with an independent delay, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and amplification gain, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

In [[signal processing]], a '''digital filter''' is a system that performs mathematical operations on a [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]], [[discrete-time]] [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] to reduce or enhance certain aspects of that signal.  This is in contrast to the other major type of [[electronic filter]], the [[analog filter]], which is an [[electronic circuit]] operating on [[continuous-time]] [[analog signal]]s.

A digital filter system usually consists of an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) to sample the input signal, followed by a microprocessor and some peripheral components such as memory to store data and filter coefficients etc. Finally a [[digital-to-analog converter]] to complete the output stage.  Program Instructions (software) running on the microprocessor implement the digital filter by performing the necessary mathematical operations on the numbers received from the ADC.  In some high performance applications, an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] or [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] is used instead of a general purpose microprocessor, or a specialized [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) with specific paralleled architecture for expediting operations such as filtering.

Digital filters may be more expensive than an equivalent analog filter due to their increased complexity, but they make practical many designs that are impractical or impossible as analog filters. Digital filters can often be made very high order, and are often finite impulse response filters which allows for [[linear phase]] response. When used in the context of real-time analog systems, digital filters sometimes have problematic latency (the difference in time between the input and the response) due to the associated [[analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog]] conversions and [[anti-aliasing filter]]s, or due to other delays in their implementation.

Digital filters are commonplace and an essential element of everyday electronics such as [[radio]]s, [[cellphone]]s, and [[AV receivers]].

==Characterization==

A digital filter is characterized by its [[transfer function]], or equivalently, its [[difference equation]].  Mathematical analysis of the transfer function can describe how it will respond to any input.  As such, designing a filter consists of developing specifications appropriate to the problem (for example, a second-order low pass filter with a specific cut-off frequency), and then producing a transfer function which meets the specifications.

The [[transfer function]] for a linear, time-invariant, digital filter can be expressed as a transfer function in the [[Z-transform|''Z''-domain]]; if it is causal, then it has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)}  = \frac{{b_{0}+b_{1}z^{-1}+b_{2}z^{-2} + \cdots + b_{N}z^{-N}}}{{1+a_{1}z^{-1}+a_{2}z^{-2} + \cdots +a_{M}z^{-M}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the order of the filter is the greater of ''N'' or ''M''.
See [[Z-transform#Linear constant-coefficient difference equation|''Z''-transform's LCCD equation]] for further discussion of this [[transfer function]].

This is the form for a [[recursive filter]], which typically leads to an IIR [[infinite impulse response]] behaviour, but if the [[denominator]] is made equal to [[1 (number)|unity]] i.e. no feedback, then this becomes an FIR or [[finite impulse response]] filter.

===Analysis techniques===

A variety of mathematical techniques may be employed to analyze the behaviour of a given digital filter.  Many of these analysis techniques may also be employed in designs, and often form the basis of a filter specification.

Typically, one characterizes filters by calculating how they will respond to a simple input such as an impulse.  One can then extend this information to compute the filter's response to more complex signals.

====Impulse response====

The [[impulse response]], often denoted &lt;math&gt;h[k]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;h_k&lt;/math&gt;, is a measurement of how a filter will respond to the [[Kronecker delta]] function.  For example, given a difference equation, one would set &lt;math&gt;x_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_k = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; and evaluate. The impulse response is a characterization of the filter's behaviour.  Digital filters are typically considered in two categories: [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) and [[finite impulse response]] (FIR).
In the case of linear time-invariant FIR filters, the impulse response is exactly equal to the sequence of filter coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y_n= \sum_{k=0}^{N} h_{k} x_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

IIR filters on the other hand are recursive, with the output depending on both current and previous inputs as well as previous outputs. The general form of an IIR filter is thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \sum_{m=0}^{M} a_{m}y_{n-m} = \sum_{k=0}^{N} b_{k} x_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

Plotting the impulse response will reveal how a filter will respond to a sudden, momentary disturbance.

====Difference equation ====

In [[discrete-time]] systems, the digital filter is often implemented by converting the [[transfer function]] to a [[Z-transform#Linear constant-coefficient difference equation|linear constant-coefficient difference equation]] (LCCD) via the [[Z-transform]].  The discrete [[Frequency domain|frequency-domain]] transfer function is written as the ratio of two polynomials.  For example:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{(z+1)^2} {(z-\frac{1}{2}) (z+\frac{3}{4})}&lt;/math&gt;

This is expanded:
:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{z^2+ 2z +1} {z^2 +\frac{1}{4} z - \frac{3}{8}}&lt;/math&gt;

and to make the corresponding filter [[causal filter|causal]], the numerator and denominator are divided by the highest order of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(z) = \frac{1 + 2z^{-1} +z^{-2}} {1 +\frac{1}{4} z^{-1} - \frac{3}{8} z^{-2}} = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients of the denominator, &lt;math&gt;a_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, are the 'feed-backward' coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the 'feed-forward' coefficients, &lt;math&gt;b_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.  The resultant [[difference equation|linear difference equation]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;
y[n] = -\sum_{k=1}^{M} a_{k} y[n-k] + \sum_{k=0}^{N} b_{k} x[n-k]
&lt;/math&gt;

or, for the example above:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{1 + 2z^{-1} +z^{-2}} {1 +\frac{1}{4} z^{-1} - \frac{3}{8} z^{-2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

rearranging terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Rightarrow (1 +\frac{1}{4} z^{-1} - \frac{3}{8} z^{-2}) Y(z) = (1 + 2z^{-1} +z^{-2}) X(z) 
&lt;/math&gt;

then by taking the inverse ''z''-transform:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Rightarrow y[n] + \frac{1}{4} y[n-1] - \frac{3}{8} y[n-2] = x[n] + 2x[n-1] + x[n-2]
&lt;/math&gt;

and finally, by solving for &lt;math&gt;y[n]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
y[n] = - \frac{1}{4} y[n-1] + \frac{3}{8} y[n-2] + x[n] + 2x[n-1] + x[n-2] 
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation shows how to compute the next output sample, &lt;math&gt;y[n]&lt;/math&gt;, in terms of the past outputs, &lt;math&gt;y[n-p]&lt;/math&gt;, the present input, &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt;, and the past inputs, &lt;math&gt;x[n-p]&lt;/math&gt;.  Applying the filter to an input in this form is equivalent to a Direct Form I or II (see below) realization, depending on the exact order of evaluation.

In plain terms, for example, as used by a computer programmer implementing the above equation in code, it can be described as follows:

&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = the output, or filtered value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = the input, or incoming raw value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = the sample number, iteration number, or time period number

and therefore:

&lt;math&gt;y[n]&lt;/math&gt; = the current filtered (output) value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y[n-1]&lt;/math&gt; = the last filtered (output) value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y[n-2]&lt;/math&gt; = the 2nd-to-last filtered (output) value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; = the current raw input value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x[n-1]&lt;/math&gt; = the last raw input value&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x[n-2]&lt;/math&gt; = the 2nd-to-last raw input value

==Filter design==

{{main|Filter design}}
The design of digital filters is a deceptively complex topic.&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Valdez, [http://home.mchsi.com/~mikevald/Digfilt.html Digital Filters], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although filters are easily understood and calculated, the practical challenges of their design and implementation are significant and are the subject of much advanced research.

There are two categories of digital filter: the [[recursive filter]] and the [[nonrecursive filter]].  These are often referred to as [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) filters and [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filters, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Antoniou, ''Digital Filters: Analysis, Design, and Applications'', New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1993., chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filter realization==

After a filter is designed, it must be ''realized'' by developing a signal flow diagram that describes the filter in terms of operations on sample sequences.

A given transfer function may be realized in many ways.  Consider how a simple expression such as &lt;math&gt;ax + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; could be evaluated &amp;ndash; one could also compute the equivalent &lt;math&gt;x(a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt;.  In the same way, all realizations may be seen as "factorizations" of the same transfer function, but different realizations will have different numerical properties.  Specifically, some realizations are more efficient in terms of the number of operations or storage elements required for their implementation, and others provide advantages such as improved numerical stability and reduced round-off error.  Some structures are better for [[fixed-point arithmetic]] and others may be better for [[floating-point arithmetic]].

===Direct form I===

A straightforward approach for IIR filter realization is [[Digital biquad filter#Direct form 1|direct form I]], where the difference equation is evaluated directly.  This form is practical for small filters, but may be inefficient and impractical (numerically unstable) for complex designs.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Smith III, [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/filters/Direct_Form_I.html Direct Form I]&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, this form requires 2N delay elements (for both input and output signals) for a filter of order N.

[[File:Biquad filter DF-I.svg|400px]]

===Direct form II===

The alternate [[Digital biquad filter#Direct form 2|direct form II]] only needs ''N'' delay units, where ''N'' is the order of the filter – potentially half as much as direct form I.  This structure is obtained by reversing the order of the numerator and denominator sections of Direct Form I, since they are in fact two linear systems, and the commutativity property applies. Then, one will notice that there are two columns of delays (&lt;math&gt;z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) that tap off the center net, and these can be combined since they are redundant, yielding the implementation as shown below.

The disadvantage is that direct form II increases the possibility of arithmetic overflow for filters of high ''Q'' or resonance.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Smith III, [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/filters/Direct_Form_II.html Direct Form II]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that as ''Q'' increases,  the round-off noise of both direct form topologies increases without bounds.&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Jackson, "On the Interaction of Roundoff Noise and Dynamic Range in Digital Filters," ''Bell Sys. Tech. J.'', vol. 49 (1970 Feb.), reprinted in ''Digital Signal Process'', L. R. Rabiner and C. M. Rader, Eds. (IEEE Press, New York, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because, conceptually, the signal is first passed through an all-pole filter (which normally boosts gain at the resonant frequencies) before the result of that is saturated, then passed through an all-zero filter (which often attenuates much of what the all-pole half amplifies).

[[File:Biquad filter DF-II.svg|400px]]

===Cascaded second-order sections===

A common strategy is to realize a higher-order (greater than 2) digital filter as a cascaded series of second-order "biquadratric" (or "biquad") sections&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Smith III, [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/filters/Series_Second_Order_Sections.html Series Second Order Sections]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[digital biquad filter]]). The advantage of this strategy is that the coefficient range is limited.  Cascading direct form II sections results in ''N'' delay elements for filters of order ''N''.  Cascading direct form I sections results in ''N'' + 2 delay elements, since the delay elements of the input of any section (except the first section) are redundant with the delay elements of the output of the preceding section.

==Comparison of analog and digital filters==
Digital filters are not subject to the component non-linearities that greatly complicate the design of analog filters.  Analog filters consist of imperfect electronic components, whose values are specified to a limit tolerance (e.g. resistor values often have a tolerance of ±5%) and which may also change with temperature and drift with time.  As the order of an analog filter increases, and thus its component count, the effect of variable component errors is greatly magnified.  In digital filters, the coefficient values are stored in computer memory, making them far more stable and predictable.&lt;ref name="dspguide"&gt;http://www.dspguide.com/ch21/1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the coefficients of digital filters are definite, they can be used to achieve much more complex and selective designs &amp;ndash; specifically with digital filters, one can achieve a lower passband ripple, faster transition, and higher stopband attenuation than is practical with analog filters.  Even if the design could be achieved using analog filters, the engineering cost of designing an equivalent digital filter would likely be much lower.  Furthermore, one can readily modify the coefficients of a digital filter to make an [[adaptive filter]] or a user-controllable parametric filter.  While these techniques are possible in an analog filter, they are again considerably more difficult.

Digital filters can be used in the design of finite impulse response filters.  Equivalent analog filters are often more complicated, as these require delay elements.

Digital filters rely less on analog circuitry, potentially allowing for a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. A digital filter will introduce noise to a signal during analog low pass filtering, analog to digital conversion, digital to analog conversion and may introduce digital noise due to quantization.  With analog filters, every component is a source of thermal noise (such as [[Johnson noise]]), so as the filter complexity grows, so does the noise.

However, digital filters do introduce a higher fundamental latency to the system.  In an analog filter, latency is often negligible; strictly speaking it is the time for an electrical signal to propagate through the filter circuit. In digital systems, latency is introduced by delay elements in the digital signal path, and by [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s that enable the system to process analog signals.

In very simple cases, it is more cost effective to use an analog filter.  Introducing a digital filter requires considerable overhead circuitry, as previously discussed, including two low pass analog filters.

Another argument for analog filters is low power consumption. Analog filters require substantially less power and are therefore the only solution when power requirements are tight.

When making an electrical circuit on a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] it is generally easier to use a digital solution, because the processing units are highly optimized over the years. Making the same circuit with analog components would take up a lot more space when using [[Discrete circuit|discrete components]]. Two alternatives are [[Field-programmable analog array|FPAA's]]&lt;ref name=FPAA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bains|first=Sunny|title=Analog's answer to FPGA opens field to masses|journal=EETimes|date=July 2008|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1167814}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC's]], but they are expensive for low quantities.

==Types of digital filters==
Many digital filters are based on the [[fast Fourier transform]], a mathematical algorithm that quickly extracts the [[frequency spectrum]] of a signal, allowing the spectrum to be manipulated (such as to create very high order band-pass filters) before converting the modified spectrum back into a time-series signal with an inverse FFT operation. These filters give O(n log n) computational costs whereas conventional digital filters tend to be O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Another form of a digital filter is that of a [[state space (controls)|state-space]] model.
A well used state-space filter is the [[Kalman filter]] published by [[Rudolf Kalman]] in 1960.

Traditional linear filters are usually based on attenuation. Alternatively nonlinear filters can be designed, including energy transfer filters &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which allow the user to move energy in a designed way. So that unwanted noise or effects can be moved to new frequency bands either lower or higher in frequency, spread over a range of frequencies, split, or focused. Energy transfer filters complement traditional filter designs and introduce many more degrees of freedom in filter design. Digital energy transfer filters are relatively easy to design and to implement and exploit nonlinear dynamics.

A DMS publishes to web channels, usually in the form of a stand-alone website. It can manage any part of the web process, including web design, web hosting, domain registering, marketing, content creation and other standard methods of web promotion. The goal of web publication is to give the user a digital 'home' on the web, where clients, guests, fans and other web browsers arrive as a destination. Other methods of digital marketing often work to drive traffic to the web channel.

An example of a [[SaaS]] DMS services is [[HubSpot]].

== Social ==

A DMS publishes to popular social channels, including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] as a means to communicate with fans, friends, followers, and customers and drive traffic to the user's website. The social publication can take the form of a status update, a text message, a 'tweet', a photo, a video and many other means of social communication. The idea is to find browsers in social spaces who might not otherwise be targeted. And that of which helps to communicate including social media networks for [https://www.facebook.com/phomil/ example Click here]

== Mobile ==

A DMS publishes to mobile devices, offering unique content formatted for those devices, such as the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones. Mobile publication often takes the form of a mobile-optimized website theme, with larger navigation and a cleaner user interface. A mobile publication can also include 'apps' for devices that support them, 'push' notifications and [[SMS]] texting marketing.

Gaming is also a new form of Digital marketing, where creators custom makes games fit for a certain brand. It is used with larger navigation and an interface. It is the key factor to where mobile publication is included within the services.

== Scannable surface ==
A set of a scannable surface includes tablet PC, publishing material, TV etc media. QR code enables traditional marketing channels to be utilized for a new digital transform. A quick scan on the QR code can guide viewers directly to the information they need without spending time on browsing and be searching, and the most valuable method of using QR code scan is to link to purchase basket.

NFC or [[Near field communication]] is a growing technology used in information sharing, that is, cash transactions, access information and other personal information.

== Privacy issue ==
[[Digital marketing]] is considered as a challenge for privacy &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364915000047 Weber, R. (2015). The digital future – A challenge for privacy?. ''Computer Law &amp; Security Review'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; because consumers' information is searched, collected, and used in the process of digital marketing without consumers' awareness.&lt;ref name="tcp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.communicationsconsumerpanel.org.uk/downloads/what-we-do/previous-projects/internet/online-personal-data/Online%20personal%20data%20final%20240511.pdf|title=Online personal data:the consumer perspective|website=communicationsconsumerpanel.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy of customers is important because that it is related to customers' [[perceived value]], satisfaction, loyalty,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09593969.2016.1251482 Leppäniemi, M., Karjaluoto, H. and Saarijärvi, H. (2016). Customer perceived value, satisfaction, and loyalty: the role of willingness to share information.

(2017). Data Privacy: Effects on Customer and Firm Performance. ''Journal of Marketing'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of information ===

'''Basic information：'''

In the traditional sense, private information mainly includes gender, age, education background, marital status and other basic information.&lt;ref name="CYJK"&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917303855 Wang, C., Zheng, Y., Jiang, J. and Ren, K. (2018). Toward Privacy-Preserving Personalized Recommendation Services. ''Engineering'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the network society, private information also includes personalized digital information such as account passwords.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300347  Mamonov, S. and Benbunan-Fich, R. (2018). The impact of information security threat awareness on privacy-protective behaviors. ''Computers in Human Behavior'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Activity information：'''

Private information refers to browsing history, purchasing records, location, social activities and so on &lt;ref name="CYJK"/&gt;

=== Illegal use of information ===
At present, the discussion on the consequences of privacy issues caused by digital marketing technology is increasingly focused on the possibility of illegal use of information.&lt;ref name="MCP"&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094996817300191 Krafft, M., Arden, C. and Verhoef, P. (2017). Permission Marketing and Privacy Concerns — Why Do Customers (Not) Grant Permissions?. ''Journal of Interactive Marketing''  ]&lt;/ref&gt; The information of consumers may become commodities, which will be exchanged or traded without the consumer's awareness and authorization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3f25/584aff38afc92e7caf61b30c0272ff70ce87.pdf Taylor, C. (2004). Consumer Privacy and the Market for Customer Information. ''The RAND Journal of Economics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The consumers' information is mainly exchanged or transacted in two forms. 
One is that the related merchants share those data between each other. The other is that those data are sold by certain recommenders to a third party.&lt;ref name="CYJK"/&gt; For example, the data that can identify the financial status of consumers is very attractive to credit agencies. All these above increases the risk of consumer privacy.

===Customer attitude===
Some customers tend to choose the latter between a right of privacy and other favorable conditions. Pieces of evidence show that some customers are willing to allow merchants to use their personal information if they can have something to gain in return, even just small rewards, even though they do worry about their privacy may be invaded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404815001017 Kokolakis, S.(2017).Privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour: A review of current research on the privacy paradox phenomenon.''Computers &amp; Security'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, digital marketing provide convenience to people.&lt;ref name="tcp"/&gt; In the minds of some customers, this convenience is more important than their privacy, especially for teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.adestra.com/hubfs/2017_Reports_and_eGuides/2017%20Consumer_digital_usage_and_behavior_study.pdf|title=2017 Consumer Digital Usage and Behavior Study|website=adestra.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, most people are very concerned about whether their privacy is protected.&lt;ref name="tcp"/&gt; It allows your brand to deliver relevant and targeted content to your customers, which leads to better conversation and customer retention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcraz.com/2018/06/top-8-secrets-behind-success-of-any-digital-marketing-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervision and administrationr===
[[Permission marketing]] seems to be a good way to solve legal issues and privacy issues. It provides a suitable way to let merchants could connect with customers. Consumers can grant licenses only to a few merchants which are chosen from a large number of merchants. Permission marketing aims to make digital marketing matches the request of the law and provide consumers with information autonomy and.&lt;ref name="MCP"/ &gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094996817300191 Krafft, M., Arden, C. and Verhoef, P. (2017). Permission Marketing and Privacy Concerns — Why Do Customers (Not) Grant Permissions?. ''Journal of Interactive Marketing'']&lt;/ref&gt; The other solution is that merchants post privacy logs to promote transparency and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826818300088 Samavi, R. and Consens, M. (2018). Publishing privacy logs to facilitate transparency and accountability. ''Journal of Web Semantics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] ([[GDPR]]) is an example which meets the above requirements. It stipulates that merchants can collect customers' information only for specific, clear and legitimate purposes and deal with them only in a fair, transparent, and legal manner and merchants must protect these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/|title=Principles|date=21 November 2017|website=ico.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers should be informed that how will their data be used, what will be the effects and other relevant information in a concise, easy-to-understand and freeway so that they can clearly determine whether it is necessary to grant authorization or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/|title=Right to be informed|date=20 March 2018|website=ico.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except the right to be informed, the GDPR also provide customers with seven other rights such us the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to restrict processing, the right to object and establishes corresponding accountability system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/|title=Individual rights|date=20 March 2018|website=ico.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of passive solar building design}}

A '''double envelope house''' is a passive solar house design which collects solar energy in a solarium and passively allows the warm air to circulate around the house between two sets of walls, a double [[building envelope]]. This design is from 1975 by Lee Porter Butler in the United States.

==History==
Lee Porter Butler's 1975 Double Envelope (Shell) design &lt;ref&gt;http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/1982-03-01/The-Double-Envelope-House.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; received wide publicity after the U.S. solar energy tax credits were created in 1978. Versions were on the cover of ''Better Homes and Gardens'' and ''Popular Science'' &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091026191932/http://geocities.com/betadolphin/&lt;/ref&gt; magazines.

Butler was an artistic/ecological building designer, a self-proclaimed "Ekotect." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/betadolphin/LeePorterButlerVitae.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+13:28:55&lt;/ref&gt; He did not hold formal qualifications as an energy engineer.
Lee had built hundreds of homes, shopping centers and business buildings including banks and schools by the time he entered North Carolina State University to study architecture.  He had studied engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. Lee did not even have a high school diploma, but ended up teaching his invention of "the gravity geo-thermal envelope" at The University of California Berkeley in the Graduate School of design and Planning. Lee went to school for the education, not for the diploma. He was asked to speak at The Royal College of Science in London, where Sir Isaac Newton delivered [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]].

Lee's facile and curious mind led him his entire life to question methods by which humanity could live on the earth in harmony with the earth, and with each other.  His most recent contribution to humanity "Ekotecture" is a totally self-sufficient way to live in harmony on the planet and to safeguard human life no matter what the external conditions.  Lee felt that if we talk about sustainability we must talk about not just sustaining the earth, but the sustaining of human life.  His contributions include a method whereby humanity can live peaceably and safely on the planet in cooperation.

==Design and theory==
Butler's experimental design was a form of isolated [[passive solar design]] that incorporated a passive heat distribution system.  It attempted to address the problem of unequal distribution of heat that was associated with some direct gain systems.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070807075315/http://users.chartertn.net/dhrivnak/first_home.htm].  This phenomenon is observed particularly in designs with inadequate thermal mass, poor cross ventilation and excessive polar facing windows.&lt;ref&gt;Chiras, D. The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling. Chelsea Green Publishing Company; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler's design essentially composed of a house within a house.  Thermal energy was captured from a south-facing [[sunroom#Solarium|solarium]] and heat was circulated by a natural [[convection]] flow loop in the cavity between the two building envelopes and through a sub-floor or via [[earth cooling tubes]].&lt;ref name="The Double-Envelope House"&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/1982-03-01/The-Double-Envelope-House.aspx The Double-Envelope House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recirculating air flow path resulted from the warm (less-dense) air rising in a south-side solarium, and cooler (denser) air falling on the north side to create pressure differentials that automatically moved excess solar thermal gain from the south to the north side of the building without forced convection systems.  [[Stack effect|Air flow]] was proportional to the differences in temperature between the two convection paths.

In the summer, shading devices eliminate all direct solar gain. Vents are opened at the top to exhaust hot air. Fresh air intake uses ambient temperature Earth to cool and dehumidify replacement air at the base.

In winter, the air in the cavity is buffered by warm ambient-temperature Earth under the floor (which is partially recharged by the natural convection flow loop during each winter day). In the summer, the convective flow is replaced with cooler near-ambient-temperature Earth replacement air, and the warm air exhausts by natural convection.

== Criticisms ==
The original explanation provided for its efficiency was the thermal buffer that existed in the double envelope cavity.  However, observers have also commented that the overall insulation of the design is higher with two walls instead of just one.&lt;ref name="The Double-Envelope House"/&gt;

While the design can perform better than a conventional home, formal performance monitoring suggested there were some problems with the original design. [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6367356].

Commentators have criticised the design on various grounds:{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* The rock bed under the house interfered with the geothermal night time effect and slowed warming in the morning.
* Roof-angled glass (See [[sun path]]) made it difficult to control summer heat gain and winter heat loss.
* An equator-side porch excessively shaded the lower floor from solar gain
* The additional cavity on the north wall was excluded from the conditioned area (and created a potential fire hazard).
* Dark roofs and absent radiant barrier was not adequate to inhibit summer solar gain
* The presence of a fireplace, chimney and clothes dryer were a source of convective heat loss
* The design was not adequate to function in polar climates.
* Concerns about condensation and moisture issues forming in the convection loop leading to maintenance or health issues.
*  The additional materials and thermal mass used in construction
* Warm air rises by natural convection. It does not go down and around. They are fire traps and are against building codes in places like Aurora CO.

Subsequent modifications have attempted to address these issues.[http://100khouse.com/2008/01/05/zero-energy-design-binge/]

== Thermal buffer zone house ==
A modification based on Butler's original design has been described&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeroenergydesign.com/Passive%20Solar%20Cooling.html#c22 Zero Energy Design's Passive Solar Cooling Techniques, Abundant Energy In Harmony With Nature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet formally evaluated. It attempted to eliminate some of the initial issues.

An important difference is the polar limb of the convection loop (thermal buffer zone/TBZ) is employed as a utility area e.g.  laundry room, closets, pantry, and storage space.  The laundry room also doubled as an area for clothes drying.

An external window is located on the polar side which can be opened to admit mild air into the TBZ during summer.  An additional internal window separates the equatorial side living quarters.  This can be opened to admit warm winter air from the solarium to enter directly into polar rooms.

The designer states that on cold winter days, the TBZ tempered with solar-heated air could be often above 85 degrees F, while the outside air was below freezing.

== Performance evaluation ==
Current technology makes it difficult to model the effects of these convective flow designs because computer performance simulation software does not presently incorporate these processes in their calculations.

An '''ESD simulator''', also known as an '''ESD gun''', is a handheld unit used to test the immunity of devices to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD). These simulators are used in special [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) laboratories.&lt;ref name="ptltl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-testlab.de/en/testlabs/index.jsp|title=Test Laboratory|publisher=Phoenix Testlab|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taafla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2la.org/scopepdf/1954-01.pdf|title=The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESD pulses are fast, high-voltage pulses created when two objects with different electrical charges come into close proximity or contact. Recreating them in a test environment helps to verify that the [[device under test]] is immune to [[static electricity]] discharges.

ESD testing is necessary to receive a [[CE mark]], and for most suppliers of components for motor vehicles as part of required [[electromagnetic compatibility]] testing.&lt;ref name="esd standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esda.org/esd_fundamentals.html|title=Fundamentals of ESD - Part Six ESD Standards|year=2001|publisher=Electrostatic Discharge Association|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often useful to automate these tests to eliminate the [[human factor]].&lt;ref name="teseq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teseq.com/com/en/service_support/technical_information/07_AN_NSG_439.pdf|title=Automated ESD testing improves product reliability and safety|publisher=teseq|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three distinct test models for electrostatic discharge: human-body, machine, and charged-devices models. The human-body model emulates the action of a human body discharging static electricity, the machine model simulates static discharge from a machine, and the charged-device model simulates the charging and discharging events that occur in production processes and equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Many ESD guns have interchangeable modules containing different discharge Networks or RC Modules (Specific [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values) to simulate different discharges. These modules typically slide into the handle of the pistol portion of the ESD simulator, much like loading some handguns. They change the characteristics of the waveshape discharged from the pistol and are called out in general standards like [[Emc directives|IEC 61000-4-2]], SAE J113 and industry specific standards like ISO 10605. Resistance is referred to in ohms (Ω), capacitance is referred to in [[picofarad]] (pF or "puff"). The most commonly used discharge network is for IEC 61000-4-2 and ISO 10605, expressed as 150pF/330Ω. There are over 50 combinations of resistance and capacitance depending on the standards and the applicable electronics.&lt;ref name="esdguns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdguns.com/order-online/discharge-rc-modules|title=RC Modules / Discharge Networks|publisher=ESDGuns.com|accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date the Company has 37,250 acres of bamboo farms under ownership, in Central American, Western and Southern Africa, with larger scale [[plantation]]s underway.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is a privately owned United States Company, registered in Delaware and with corporate headquarters located outside of Chicago, Illinois. It is a US Series LLC allowing each geographic region and individual bamboo plantation to be funded and operated separately but under the same umbrella.

The Company has been recognized for its social impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131017005822/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Wins-IAIR-Award-Sustainability|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Wins IAIR Award for Sustainability|website=Businesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created more than 750 jobs and operates in some of the poorest parts of the world in [[Nicaragua]], South Africa and [[Ghana]].

EcoPlanet Bamboo plants species of tropical clumping ([[sympodial]]) bamboos, using only highly degraded&lt;ref&gt;''EcoPlanet Bamboo uses the UNFCCC tool for the Identification of Degraded Land.''&lt;/ref&gt; and marginal land to produce a tree free, [[deforestation]] free fiber. The Company has developed a framework for what sustainability means in respect to [[bamboo]]. Farms reach maturity in 5–7 years and the fiber is targeted towards [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]] dependent on wood and fiber as their raw resource.

The company is highly decentralized with individual bamboo plantations operating under EcoPlanet Bamboo Groups standardized operational framework to achieve [[Forest restoration|Forest Landscape Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfrn.org/file.php/302/4.6-ecoplanet-bamboo.pdf|format=PDF|title=4.6 Commercial bamboo plantations as a tool for restoring landscapes|website=Etfrn.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full set of qualified managerial staff exists on each farm and is overseen by a core managerial team.

==Bamboo in China==
Although bamboo is a plant that has been grown and harvested in China for generations, it occurs only within a smallholder model. There are few commercial or large scale managed plantations. The majority of area under bamboo comprises plots of a few Mu in size, owned by individual farmers or families, and managed as part of a [[Crop diversity|diverse]] mix of livelihood crops. Throughout China bamboo has been planted only in areas not suitable for agriculture, which generally mean mountainous land that is often inaccessible. Most of China's bamboo industry is focused on a single iconic species – [[Phyllostachys edulis|Moso (''Phyllostachys edulis'')]]

The processing of bamboo in China is dominated by low and medium level processing, with a large focus on two very different markets (1) the global handicraft industry and (2) the production of [[Bamboo shoot|edible bamboo shoots]] for the food industry. In recent years there has been an increase in the production of [[bamboo floor]]ing.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is working in a different manner growing certified bamboo fiber for the [[pulp and paper industry]], textiles and [[Engineered wood|engineered timber]].

EcoPlanet Bamboo claims to have overcome many barriers to industrialize bamboo as a commercial crop:
# A lack of planting material.  See “[[Bamboo#Mass flowering|bamboo mass flowering]]".
# Lack of knowledge on the growth, ecology and yields of bamboos other than Moso.
# High investment required to take bamboo through the 6–7 years required to reach maturity.
# Difficulty of operating in remote parts of the developing world.

==Bamboo sustainability==
EcoPlanet Bamboo is a triple bottom line company promoting the concept of conscious capitalism. The company has pioneered the concept of sustainability certification for commercially produced bamboo. Nicaraguan farms are certified under the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), the [[Verified Carbon Standard]] (VCS) and have gold level Climate Community Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) stamp of approval. EcoPlanet Bamboo is the first entity to have received these certifications for application to bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121115006752/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Acquires-FSC-Certification-Enabling-Supply|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Acquires FSC Certification, Enabling Supply of a Sustainable Alternative Fiber to US &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Multinational&amp;nbsp;Manufacturing Industries|website=Bsinesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company has been insured by the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency|World Bank's Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (MIGA)]], holding a $48&amp;nbsp;million policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agriinvestor.com/miga-increases-ecoplanet-bamboo-guarantee/|title=MIGA increases EcoPlanet Bamboo guarantee - Agri Investor|date=June 25, 2015|website=Agriinvestor.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIGA has featured EcoPlanet Bamboo for strong social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miga.org/Lists/General/CustomDisp.aspx?ID=1488|title=General|website=Miga.org|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EcoPlanet Bamboo's farms are examples of private [[Forest restoration#Forest landscape restoration|sector forest landscape restoration]], with planted bamboo [[Habitat conservation|conserving]] and reconnecting remnant forest patches and scattered native vegetation, restoring soil functioning, water tables and carbon sinks.

'''Electric guitar design''' is a type of [[industrial design]] where the looks and efficiency of the shape as well as the acoustical aspects of the guitar are important factors. In the past many guitars have been designed with all kinds of odd shapes as well as very practical and convenient solutions to improve the [[usability]] of the object.

==History==
The first electrified fretted [[Guitar|guitars]] were hollow-bodied [[archtop]] acoustic guitars to which some form of electromagnetic [[transducer]] had been attached.{{whom|date=July 2018}} [[George Beauchamp]] invented the [[electric guitar]] by designing a [[lap steel guitar]] with a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

===Early years===
[[Image:RickenbackerFryingpanPatentDiagram.png|right|thumb|Sketch of Rickenbacker "frying pan" lap steel guitar from 1934 patent application]]

At least one company, [[Audiovox]], built and may have offered an electric solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc&lt;ref name="Paul Tutmarc"&gt;[http://tutmarc.tripod.com/paultutmarc.html] Bud Tutmarc's remarks concerning his father's role in developing the first magnetic pickup for a guitar and the first fretted electric bass guitar.&lt;/ref&gt; who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, "Bud-Electro" until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled ''Rickenbacker'' and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed '''The Frying Pan''' or '''The Pancake Guitar''', beginning in 1933.

Another early solid body electric guitar was designed and built by musician and inventor [[Les Paul]] in the early 1940s, working after hours in the [[Epiphone|Epiphone Guitar]] factory. His '''log guitar''' (so called because it consisted of a simple 4x4 wood post with a neck attached to it and homemade pickups and hardware, with two detachable Swedish hollow body halves attached to the sides for appearance only) was patented and is often considered to be the first of its kind, although it shares nothing in design or hardware with the solid body "Les Paul" model sold by Gibson.

===Fender===
{{main|Fender Musical Instruments Corporation}}

[[Image:FenderGuitarPatentDiagram.png|left|thumb|Sketch of Fender lap steel guitar from 1944 patent application.]]
In 1950 and 1951, electronics and instrument amplifier maker [[Leo Fender]] through his company, designed the first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar with a single magnetic pickup, which was initially named the "[[Fender Esquire|Esquire]]". The two-pickup version of the Esquire was called the "Broadcaster". The bolt-on neck was consistent with Leo Fender's belief that the instrument design should be modular to allow cost-effective and consistent manufacture and assembly, as well as simple repair or replacement. The Broadcaster name was changed to Telecaster because of a legal dispute over the name. 

In 1954, Fender introduced the [[Fender Stratocaster]], or "Strat". It was positioned as a deluxe model and offered various product improvements and innovations over the Telecaster. These innovations included an ash or alder double-cutaway body design for badge assembly with an integrated [[vibrato]] mechanism (called a ''[[synchronized tremolo]]'' by Fender, thus beginning a confusion of the terms that still continues), three single-coil pickups, and body comfort contours. Leo Fender is also credited with developing the first commercially successful [[bass guitar|electric bass]] called the [[Fender Precision Bass]], introduced in 1951.

===Gibson===
{{main|Gibson Guitar Corporation}}
Gibson, like many guitar manufacturers, had long offered semi-acoustic guitars with pickups, and previously rejected [[Les Paul]] and his "log" electric in the 1940s. In apparent response to the [[Telecaster]], Gibson introduced the first [[Gibson Les Paul]] solid body guitar in 1952 (although Les Paul was actually brought in only towards the end of the design process for expert fine tuning of the nearly complete design and for marketing endorsement [http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/Stories/LesPaul.html]). Features of the Les Paul include a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top (much like a [[violin]] and earlier Gibson archtop hollow body electric guitars) and contrasting edge binding, two single-coil "soapbar" [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]], a 24¾" scale mahogany neck with a more traditional glued-in [[set-in neck|"set" neck joint]], binding on the edges of the [[fretboard]], and a tilt-back [[headstock]] with three machine heads (tuners) to a side. The earliest models had a combination bridge and trapeze-tailpiece design that was in fact designed by Les Paul himself, but was largely disliked and discontinued after the first year. Gibson then developed the [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge and separate stop tailpiece, an adjustable non-vibrato design that has endured. By 1957, Gibson had made the final major change to the Les Paul as we know it today - the [[humbucking pickup]], or humbucker. The humbucker, invented by [[Seth Lover]], was a dual-coil pickup which featured two windings connected out of phase and reverse-wound, in order to cancel the 60-cycle hum associated with single-coil pickups; as a byproduct, however, it also produces a distinctive, more "mellow" tone which appeals to many guitarists. The more traditionally designed and styled Gibson solid-body instruments were a contrast to Leo Fender's modular designs, with the most notable differentiator being the method of neck attachment and the scale of the neck (Gibson-24.75", Fender-25.5"). Each design has its own merits.

===Vox===
In 1962 Vox introduced the pentagonal Phantom guitar, originally made in England but soon after made by EKO of Italy. It was followed a year later by the teardrop-shaped Mark VI, the prototype of which was used by [[Brian Jones (musician)|Brian Jones]] of [[The Rolling Stones]]. Vox guitars also experimented with onboard effects and electronics. The Teardrop won a prize for its design. In the mid 1960s, as the sound of electric 12 string guitar became popular, Vox introduced the [[Phantom XII]] and [[Vox Mark III#Mark XII|Mark XII]] electric 12 string guitars. Vox produced many more traditional 6 and 12 string electric guitars in both England and Italy. It may be noted that the Phantom guitar shape was quite similar to that of first fretted electric bass guitar, the Audiovox "Electric Bass Fiddle" of 1934.

'''GuitarOrgan'''

In 1966 Vox introduced the revolutionary but problematic [[GuitarOrgan]], a Phantom VI guitar with internal organ electronics. The instrument's trigger mechanism required a specially-wired plectrum that completed circuit connections to each fret, resulting in a very wide and unwieldy neck. [[John Lennon]] was given one in a bid to secure an endorsement, though this never panned out. According to ''Up-Tight: the [[Velvet Underground]] Story'', [[Brian Jones]] of the [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] also tried one; when asked by the Velvets if it "worked", his answer was negative. The instrument never became popular, but it was a precursor to the modern guitar synthesizer.

===Multiscale/Fanned-Fret Guitars===
In recent years,{{when|date=April 2018}} guitars and basses with [[Multi-scale fingerboard|multi-scale]] or [[Fret|fanned-fret]] fingerboards started to appear. These instruments are supposed to offer an advantage over the classical fixed-scale guitars and basses by providing more freedom in setting the tension of each string at the design and manufacturing phases. This may result{{according to whom|date=April 2018}} in a more uniform tension of the strings, as well as possibly{{weasel inline|date=April 2018}} offer timbre and tonal characteristics somewhat different from the usual fixed-scale instruments.

==Other guitars==
Also other materials than wood were used. [[Travis Bean]] as well as [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] built guitars with aluminium necks. [[Danelectro]] used masonite bodies. Also plastic and [[carbon]] bodied guitars have been made in the past. The [[Gittler guitar]] was a design guitar made in the 80s. 

1991 saw the introduction of guitar designer [[Jol Dantzig]]'s first truly workable acoustic-electric hybrid guitar design. The instrument, called the DuoTone, was conceived while Dantzig was at [[Hamer Guitars]]. (Dantzig was also the designer of the first 12 string bass.)  Adapted by players like Ty Tabor, Stone Gossard, Elvis Costello and Jeff Tweedy, the DuoTone was a full "duplex" instrument that could switch between acoustic and electric tones. Recently there have been many entries in the hybrid category (capable of both acoustic and electric tones) including the T5 by Taylor, Michael Kelly's "Hybrid," the Parker Fly and the Anderson Crowdster. 

In the 90s the band [[Neptune (band)|Neptune]] began building weird looking metal guitar with [[3rd bridge]] options incorporated. A predecessor of this type of guitars is the [[Pencilina]]. [[Linda Manzer]] designed the [[Pikasso guitar]] with multiple necks.

An '''electric water boiler''', also called a '''thermo pot''', is a [[consumer electronics]] [[small appliance]] used for boiling water&lt;ref name="Cryer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Cryer|title=The Godzone Dictionary: Of Favourite New Zealand Words and Phrases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDSVbv4ZIpIC&amp;pg=PA64|date=8 October 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4587-7952-6|accessdate=2014-03-25|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reznik1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon Reznik|title=Fuzzy Controllers Handbook: How to Design Them, How They Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ar0-84SktfQC&amp;pg=PA10|date=21 August 1997|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0-08-050716-3|accessdate=2014-03-25|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining it at a constant temperature.  It is typically used to provide an immediate source of hot water for making [[tea]],&lt;ref name="Cryer"/&gt; [[hot chocolate]], [[coffee]],&lt;ref name="Cryer"/&gt; [[instant noodles]], or [[baby formula]], or for any other household use where clean hot water is required. They are a common component of [[Japanese kitchen]]s and the kitchens of many East Asian countries but are found in varying use globally. Some thermo pots are designed with a feature that can purify water.&lt;ref name="America1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matsushita Electric Corporation of America|title=Annual report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icuRAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22thermo+pot%22|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black tea]] is typically steeped at {{convert|95|C|F}}
while [[green tea]] is steeped at under {{convert|80|C|F}}. A number of thermo pot models offer an adjustable target temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gourmetretailer.com/article-the_tide_in_tea-7129.html|title=The Tide in Tea - Features - Gourmet Retailer Magazine|publisher=|quote=As tea drinkers become increasingly sophisticated, so too do the equipment and brewing techniques for this aromatic beverage. A number of companies [offer] precision temperature control}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Components==
An electric water boiler consists of a water reservoir with a [[heating element]] at the bottom. Some models offer multiple temperature settings. Other models are part of larger water systems that boil water and provide hot, cold, and [[room temperature|lukewarm]] water. Water may be dispensed in various ways, e.g. by pouring, an electric pump or by pressing a large button that functions as a [[diaphragm pump]]. Electric water boilers have a built in thermostat that detects when water has reached its boiling point of {{convert|100|C}} to automatically shut off{{citation needed|reason=that would mean that at high altitude the water boiler won't work (water boils there at 90°C) but that's not true. Also if you leave the lid open water is boiling but it not automatically shut off. In many devices there is a bimetal that measures the amount of steam.|date=September 2014}}.

==Sedimentation==
Sedimentation is the accumulation within the water reservoir of natural minerals that exist in trace amounts in municipal water mains, mainly [[calcium carbonate]]. Heating the water causes the minerals to separate and fall to the bottom of the reservoir. This buildup can eventually create a variety of noises in gas boilers, reduce the efficiency of the unit and give rise to a sulfur (or rotten-egg) smell. Vinegar has been used to descale electric kettles.&lt;ref name="Goodall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Goodall|title=How to Live a Low-Carbon Life: The Individual's Guide to Stopping Climate Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0Ai9p2_-xgC&amp;pg=PA157|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-56406-2|page=157|accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

In 2010 Shevinsky defended her company against ''[[New York Times]]'', as co-owner of Neighborhoodies, over the use of the "New York Herald Tribune" logo on T-shirts. Shevinsky argued that the trademark had been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ny.racked.com/2010/6/23/7795637/nyt-sues-neighborhoodies-over-logo-tees-but-what-does-this-mean-for | publisher=NY Racked | title=Times Sues Neighborhoodies Over Same Logo Used by Rodarte | accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-New-York-Times-Sues-Neighborhoodies-Over-Logo-96974309.html | publisher=NBC New York | title=New York Times Sues Neighborhoodies Over Herald Tribune Logo | accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2010/06/22/holy-shirt-ny-times-threatens-dumbo-biz-over-logo/ | publisher=NY Post| title=Holy shirt!

Shevinsky co-founded Glimpse, an encrypted photo and video sharing app,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/08/glimpse/| publisher=Techcrunch| title=With An Extra Focus On Security, Glimpse Joins The Ephemeral Messaging Battle | accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Pax Dickinson in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html
| publisher=New York Times| title=Technology's Man Problem | accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Glimpse, Shevinksy served as chief executive of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html|title=Technology’s Man Problem|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|date=2014-04-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at Glimpse, she experienced conflict with Dickinson over his defense of a pair of app developers accused of misogyny. He wrote on Twitter, "It is not misogyny to tell a sexist joke, or to fail to take a woman seriously, or to enjoy boobies". A few days afterwards, Shevinsky quit her job at Glimpse, citing the Twitter controversy as her reasoning. Shevinsky returned to Glimpse in December 2013, after Dickinson published an apology letter. In an agreement formed with Dickinson, Shevinsky would be the chief executive and public face of the company, would have to sign off on what he said in press conferences, and Glimpse would support women in technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]]'s (MBARI's)] '''Environmental Sample Processor''' (ESP) is a "lab in a can" designed for autonomous deployment. The ESP—provides on-site (in situ) collection and analysis of [[Water sampling|water samples]] from the [[subsurface ocean]]. The instrument is an electromechanical/fluidic system designed to collect discrete water samples, concentrate [[microorganism]]s or particles, and automate application of [[molecular probe]]s which identify microorganisms and their gene products. The ESP also archives samples so that further analyses may be done after the instrument is recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbari.org/technology/emerging-current-tools/instruments/environmental-sample-processor-esp/|title=MBARI {{!}}   Environmental Sample Processor|website=www.mbari.org|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HAB-related toxin detection with an Environmental Sample Processor ==

The MBARI-designed Environmental Sample Processor was the first underwater robotic instrument to provide autonomous detection of both a HAB species and its toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doucette|first1=Gregory J.|last2=Mikulski|first2=Christine M.|last3=Jones|first3=Kelly L.|last4=King|first4=Kristen L.|last5=Greenfield|first5=Dianne I.|last6=Marin III|first6=Roman|last7=Jensen|first7=Scott|last8=Roman|first8=Brent|last9=Elliott|first9=Christopher T.|last10=Scholin|first10=Christopher A.|title=Remote, subsurface detection of the algal toxin domoic acid onboard the Environmental Sample Processor: Assay development and field trials|journal=Harmful Algae|date=September 2009|volume=8|issue=6|pages=880–888|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2009.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability allows scientists, in near real-time, to determine whether or not an [[algal bloom]] is toxic, thus allowing better prediction and treatment of public or [[ecosystem]] health threats.

=== The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory ===
The [[NOAA]] [[Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory]]  (GLERL) will deploy the first ever freshwater ESP in [[Lake Erie]]. This ESP will measure concentrations of particulate [[microcystin]]s in the western basin of the lake, every other day. It can also genetically detect Microcystis and archive samples for future processing. With the addition of information from the ESPs,  NOAA's suite of Lake Erie HAB products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/HABs_and_Hypoxia/|title=HABs and Hypoxia|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Cooperative Institute for Limnology and Ecosystems|last=Research|website=www.glerl.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. weekly Lake Erie HAB bulletin),&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.nccos.noaa.gov/coast/lakeerie/bulletin/bulletin_current.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Experimental HAB Tracker]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/HABs_and_Hypoxia/habsTracker.html&lt;/ref&gt; will have the ability to provide [[water manager]]s with bloom location, projected direction, intensity, AND [[toxicity]] before the water reaches the intake.

==== Deployments ====
Initial deployments of the ESP took place in 2016: the first field tests of the communications and the [[microcystin]] detection happened in July. The ESP was re-deployed in August near the [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] water intake crib for its first full mission. The Lake Erie ESP is deployed on a custom-built, underwater stationary mooring assembly. It samples the surface and in the water column, allowing the detection of microcystins as they relate to recreational risk (surface concentrations) or drinking water intake risk (at depth concentrations). After QC/QA, data is  uploaded to NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) [https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/HABs_and_Hypoxia/habsMonWLE.html "HABs and Hypoxia" page] to inform decision making by water managers and other stakeholders in near real-time.

==== Advantages over other monitoring methods ====
Managers without access to ESP data rely on 'in house' toxin testing, weekly sampling, surrogates (i.e. using algal pigment concentrations to infer risk of microcystins), or a combination of those. Toxins detected 'in house' are already either just outside the intake or present in the system. The ESP can provide managers earlier warning of blooms and toxicity. Correlations between data collected on toxicity and [[chlorophyll]] concentrations will be monitored in an effort to develop an experimental forecast of bloom toxicity.

==== Development and Funding ====
The Lake Erie ESP was purchased by GLERL with funding from  the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA's]] [[National Park Service#Great Lakes Restoration Initiative|Great Lakes Restoration Initiative]]. NOAA's [[National Ocean Service#National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science|National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science]] (NCCOS)] leads development of [[algal toxin]] sensors for ESPs. The technology to detect microcystins by [[ELISA assay]]) was developed by NCCOS, GLERL, and the [[Cooperative Institute for Limnology and Ecosystems Research]]. The viability of ESP technology to assist in monitoring and forecasting of marine HABs and their related toxins in California and the [[Gulf of Maine]] has been supported by NCCOS funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">The '''Historically Black Colleges and Universities Photographic Preservation Project''' began in 2007 as a four-phase initiative to improve the preservation of significant photographic collections held within [[historically black colleges and universities]] in the United States ("HBCUs"). These collections document the visual and institutional history and legacy of HBCUs and form a core of primary research materials for the study of African American history. Ten HBCU institutions are participants.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association, [http://www.ftrf.org/ala/mgrps/divs/ascla/asclapubs/interface/archives/contentlistingby/volume29a/hbcu1.cfm Interface newsletter], Volume 29, Number 4, Winter 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBCU project is funded by a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. Partners in the administration of the project include [[LYRASIS]], the Art Conservation Department at the [[University of Delaware]], the HBCU Library Alliance, the [[Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts]], and the [[Image Permanence Institute]].

The project empowers the stewards of important collections by providing practical training in photograph preservation, assisting with prioritization of needed projects, stabilization of at-risk collections, and encouraging investment in preservation capacity-building within their institutions.

[[File:History_of_aviation.svg|thumb|250px|right|Aviation timeline]]

The '''history of aviation''' extends for more than two thousand years, from the earliest forms of [[aviation]] such as [[kite]]s and attempts at tower jumping to [[super sonic flight|supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] flight by powered, [[heavier-than-air flight|heavier-than-air]] [[jet aircraft|jets]].

Kite flying in [[China]] dates back to several hundred years BC and slowly spread around the world. It is thought to be the earliest example of man-made flight.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s 15th-century dream of flight found expression in several rational but unscientific designs, though he did not attempt to construct any of them.

The discovery of [[hydrogen]] gas in the 18th century led to the invention of the [[hydrogen balloon]], at almost exactly the same time that [[Montgolfier brothers|the Montgolfier brothers]] rediscovered the hot-air balloon and began manned flights.&lt;ref name="wings-tom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crouch |first1=Tom |title=Wings: A History of Aviation from Kites to the Space Age |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |year=2004 |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-393-32620-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories in [[mechanics]] by physicists during the same period of time, notably [[fluid dynamics]] and [[Newton's laws of motion]], led to the foundation of modern [[aerodynamics]], most notably by [[Sir George Cayley]].

Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with the French government establishing Balloon Companies during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].&lt;ref name="hallion"&gt;Hallion (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term aviation, noun of action from stem of Latin avis "bird" with suffix -ation meaning action or progress, was coined in 1863 by French pioneer Guillaume Joseph Gabriel de La Landelle (1812–1886) in "Aviation ou Navigation aérienne sans ballons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term%3Daviation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061354/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aviation |archivedate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|last=Vreizh|first=Skol|title=Dictionnaire d’histoire de Bretagne |year=2008 |location=Morlaix |isbn=978-2-915623-45-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments with gliders provided the groundwork for heavier-than-air craft, and by the early-20th century, advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered flight possible for the first time. The modern [[aeroplane]] with its characteristic tail was established by 1909 and from then on the history of the aeroplane became tied to the development of more and more powerful engines.

The first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], which soon became synonymous with [[airship]]s and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large [[flying boat]]s became popular. After [[World War II]], the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the new and immensely powerful [[jet engine]] revolutionised both air travel and [[military aviation]].

In the latter part of the 20th century the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in flight instrumentation and "fly-by-wire" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless drones for military, civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings became possible.

==Primitive beginnings==
{{Main article|Early flying machines}}

===Tower jumping===
[[File:Daedalus und Ikarus MK1888.png|thumb|[[Daedalus]] working on [[Icarus]]' wings.]]
From the earliest legends there have been stories of men strapping birdlike wings, stiffened cloaks or other devices to themselves and attempting to fly, typically by jumping off a tower. The Greek legend of [[Daedalus and Icarus#Daedalus and Icarus|Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] is one of the earliest known; others originated from India, China and the European Middle Age. During this early period the issues of lift, stability and control were not understood, and most attempts ended in serious injury or death.

In the seventeenth century, the [[Algeria|Algerian]] historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]] stated that the Andalusian scientist [[Abbas ibn Firnas]] (810–887 A.D.) made a jump in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba, Spain]], covering his body with vulture feathers and attaching two wings to his arms.&lt;ref name="LynnWhite" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite journal |title=First Flights |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]] |date=January–February 1964 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=8–9 |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196401/first.flights.htm |access-date=2008-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503200416/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196401/first.flights.htm |archive-date=2008-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No other sources record the event.&lt;ref name="LynnWhite"&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (Spring, 1961). "Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition", ''Technology and Culture'' '''2''' (2), p.  97-111 [101]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the twelfth century, [[William of Malmesbury]] stated that the eleventh century Benedictine monk [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a short distance. Beyond those based on William's account, there are no other known sources documenting Eilmer's life.&lt;ref name="LynnWhite" /&gt;

Many others made well-documented jumps in the following centuries. As late as 1811, [[Albrecht Berblinger]] constructed an [[ornithopter]] and jumped into the Danube at Ulm.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=57}}

===Kites===

The [[kite]] may have been the first form of man-made aircraft.&lt;ref name="wings-tom" /&gt; It was invented in China possibly as far back as the 5th century BC by [[Mozi]] (Mo Di) and [[Lu Ban]] (Gongshu Ban).{{sfn|Deng|Wang|2005|p=122}} Later designs often emulated flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. Some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cambodiaphilately.blogspot.com/2010/01/amazing-musical-kites.html |title=Amazing Musical Kites |website=Cambodia Philately}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/21/104991903.pdf|format=pdf |title=Kite Flying for Fun and Science |year=1907 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subvision.net/sky/planetkite/asia/cambodia/khmer-kitebook.htm#VariousKinds |title=Khmer Kites |first=Sim |last=Sarak |first2=Cheang |last2=Yarin |website=Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, Cambodia |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used to measure distances, test the wind, lift men, signal, and communicate and send messages.{{sfn|Needham|1965a|p=127}}

Kites spread from China around the world. After its introduction into [[India]], the kite further evolved into the [[fighter kite]], where an abrasive line is used to cut down other kites.

====Man-carrying kites====
Man-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China, for both civil and military purposes and sometimes enforced as a punishment. An early recorded flight was that of the prisoner [[Yuan Huangtou]], a Chinese prince, in the 6th Century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Hallion (2003) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of man-carrying kites also occur in Japan, following the introduction of the kite from China around the seventh century AD. It is said that at one time there was a Japanese law against man-carrying kites.&lt;ref name="pelham"&gt;Pelham, D.; ''The Penguin book of kites'', Penguin (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotor wings ===
{{main article|Bamboo-copter}}
The use of a [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] for vertical flight has existed since 400 BC in the form of the [[bamboo-copter]], an ancient Chinese toy.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leishman |first=J.

===Hot air balloons===
[[File:SkyLanternRichy01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A [[sky lantern]].]]
From ancient times the Chinese have understood that hot air rises and have applied the principle to a type of small [[hot air balloon]] called a [[sky lantern]]. A sky lantern consists of a paper balloon under or just inside which a small lamp is placed. Sky lanterns are traditionally launched for pleasure and during festivals. According to [[Joseph Needham]], such lanterns were known in China from the 3rd century BC. Their military use is attributed to the general [[Zhuge Liang]] (180–234 AD, honorific title ''Kongming''), who is said to have used them to scare the enemy troops.{{sfn|Deng|Wang|2005|p=113}}

There is evidence that the Chinese also "solved the problem of aerial navigation" using balloons, hundreds of years before the 18th century.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=6}}

=== The Renaissance ===
[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|One of Leonardo's sketches]]

Eventually some investigators began to discover and define some of the basics of rational aircraft design. Most notable of these was [[Leonardo da Vinci]], although his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on developments over the next three hundred years. While his designs were at least rational, they were not based on particularly good science.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=11}}

Leonardo studied bird flight, analyzing it and anticipating many principles of aerodynamics. He did at least understand that "An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object."{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965|p=163}} [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] would not publish the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|Third law of motion]] until 1687.

From the last years of the 15th century on he wrote about and sketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including ornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft and parachutes. His early designs were man-powered types including ornithopters and rotorcraft, however he came to realise the impracticality of this and later turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a spring.&lt;ref name="popham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popham |first=A.E. |title=The drawings of Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Jonathan Cape |edition=2nd |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lighter than air==

===Beginnings of modern theories===
In 1670 [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] published a work that suggested lighter than air flight would be possible by using copper foil spheres that, containing a vacuum, would be lighter than the displaced air to lift an [[airship]]. While theoretically sound, his design was not feasible: the pressure of the surrounding air would crush the spheres.  The idea of using vacuum to produce lift is now known as [[vacuum airship]] but remains unfeasible with any current [[materials science|materials]].
 
In 1709 [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] presented a petition to King [[John V of Portugal]], begging for support for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The public test of the machine, which was set for June 24, 1709, did not take place. According to contemporary reports, however, Gusmão appears to have made several less ambitious experiments with this machine, descending from eminences. It is certain that Gusmão was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on August 8, 1709, in the hall of the [[Casa da Índia]] in [[Lisbon]], when he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}

=== Balloons ===
{{Main article|History of ballooning}}
1783 was a watershed year for ballooning and aviation. Between June 4 and December 1, five aviation firsts were achieved in France:
* On 4 June, the [[Montgolfier brothers]] demonstrated their unmanned [[hot air balloon]] at [[Annonay]], France.
* On 27 August, [[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Robert brothers]] (''[[Robert brothers|Les Freres Robert]]'') launched the world's first unmanned hydrogen-filled balloon, from the [[Champ de Mars]], Paris.
* On 19 October, the Montgolfiers launched the first manned flight, a tethered balloon with humans on board, at the ''[[Folie Titon]]'' in Paris. The aviators were the scientist [[Pilâtre de Rozier|Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier]], the manufacture manager [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]], and Giroud de Villette.
* On 21 November, the Montgolfiers launched the first free flight with human passengers. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier, along with the [[François Laurent d'Arlandes|Marquis François d'Arlandes]], successfully petitioned for the honor. They drifted {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a balloon powered by a wood fire.
* On 1 December, Jacques Charles and the [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]] launched their manned hydrogen balloon from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] in Paris, as a crowd of 400,000 witnessed. They ascended to a height of about {{convert|1,800|ft|m}}[15] and landed at sunset in [[Nesles-la-Vallée]] after a flight of 2 hours and 5 minutes, covering 36&amp;nbsp;km. After Robert alighted Charles decided to ascend alone. This time he ascended rapidly to an altitude of about {{convert|9,800|ft|m}}, where he saw the sun again, suffered extreme pain in his ears, and never flew again.

Ballooning became a major "rage" in Europe in the late 18th century, providing the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the atmosphere.

Non-steerable balloons were employed during the [[American Civil War]] by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]]. The young [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin#Army career|Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] first flew as a balloon passenger with the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1863.

In the early 1900s ballooning was a popular sport in Britain. These privately owned balloons usually used [[coal gas]] as the lifting gas. This has half the lifting power of hydrogen so the balloons had to be larger, however coal gas was far more readily available and the local gas works sometimes provided a special lightweight formula for ballooning events.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1971) Volume I, Page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airships ===
{{Main article|Airship|Zeppelin}}

[[File:Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1901) - Flickr 18436256195.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Santos-Dumont's "Number 6" rounding the Eiffel Tower in the process of winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe Prize, October 1901.]]
Airships were originally called "dirigible balloons" and are still sometimes called dirigibles today.

Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when [[Henri Giffard]] flew {{convert|15|mi|km}} in France, with a steam engine driven craft.

Another advance was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, ''[[La France (airship)|La France]]'', by [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]]. The {{Convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{Convert|66000|cuft|m3|adj=on}} airship covered {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8½ horsepower electric motor.

However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights would not occur until the advent of the internal combustion engine (see below.)

The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were [[non-rigid airship]]s (sometimes called "blimps".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft was the Brazilian [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] who effectively combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On October 19, 1901 he flew his airship ''Number 6'' over Paris from the [[Parc de Saint Cloud]] around the [[Eiffel Tower]] and back in under 30 minutes to win the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]]. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. Subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.

At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These would be far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]].

Construction of the first [[Zeppelin]] airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, [[Friedrichshafen]]. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship ''[[Zeppelin LZ1|LZ 1]]'' (LZ for "Luftschiff Zeppelin") had a length of {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on}} was driven by two {{convert|10.6|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.

Its first flight, on July 2, 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent flights, bettering the 6&amp;nbsp;m/s speed attained by the French airship ''La France'' by 3&amp;nbsp;m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It would be several years before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.

Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft.

===The 17th and 18th centuries===
Italian inventor [[Tito Livio Burattini]], invited by the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] to his court in [[Warsaw]], built a model aircraft with four fixed [[Glider aircraft|glider]] wings in 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=IV (part 2)|year=1965|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGyrCfYs2AC&amp;pg=PA591 591]|isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Described as "four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.&lt;ref name="harrison27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=James Pinckney|year=2000|title=Mastering the Sky|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwJsr5QjkRMC&amp;pg=PA27 27]|isbn=978-1-885119-68-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised that "only the most minor injuries" would result from landing the craft.&lt;ref name="oconner-1985"&gt;Qtd. in {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-nonfiction-man-was-meant-to-fly-but-not-at-first.html|title=In Short: Nonfiction; Man Was Meant to Fly, But Not at First|last=O'Conner|first=Patricia T.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1985-11-17|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "Dragon Volant" is considered "the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century".&lt;ref&gt;["Burattini's Flying Dragon", FLIGHT International, 9 May 1963 | {{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819221108/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |archivedate=2016-08-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published paper on aviation was [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)|"Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air"]] by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. He wrote: "It seems easier to talk of such a machine than to put it into actuality, for it requires greater force and less weight than exists in a human body. The science of mechanics might perhaps suggest a means, namely, a strong spiral spring. If these advantages and requisites are observed, perhaps in time to come some one might know how better to utilize our sketch and cause some addition to be made so as to accomplish that which we can only suggest. Yet there are sufficient proofs and examples from nature that such flights can take place without danger, although when the first trials are made you may have to pay for the experience, and not mind an arm or leg." Swedenborg would prove prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one of the critical problems to be overcome.

===The 19th century===
Balloon jumping replaced tower jumping, also demonstrating with typically fatal results that man-power and flapping wings were useless in achieving flight. At the same time scientific study of heavier-than-air flight began in earnest. In 1837 French mathematician and brigadier general [[:fr:Isidore Didion|Isidore Didion]] stated, "Aviation will be successful only if one finds an engine whose ratio with the weight of the device to be supported will be larger than current steam machines or the strength developed by humans or most of the animals."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore Didion ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k411514q/f541 Rapport sur la plus grande vitesse que l'on peut obtenir par la navigation aérienne]'', Congrès scientifique de France, 5th session, Metz, September 1837. He answered to the [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k411514q/f27.item 12th and last question] of the congress (Mathematics and Physic Sciences section) : ''"Will it be possible to improve the aerostatic art, by a better combination of means used until now, in order to leave up aerostats and conduct them"'', thus showing the interest of the scientists of that time (first half of the XIXth) century on that question.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sir George Cayley and the first modern aircraft ====
[[Sir George Cayley]] was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846.{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965|p=158}} During the last years of the previous century he had begun the first rigorous study of the [[Aerodynamics|physics of flight]] and would later design the first modern heavier-than-air craft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to aeronautics include:
*Clarifying our ideas and laying down the principles of heavier-than-air flight.
*Reaching a scientific understanding of the principles of bird flight.
*Conducting scientific aerodynamic experiments demonstrating drag and streamlining, movement of the centre of pressure, and the increase in lift from curving the wing surface.
*Defining the modern aeroplane configuration comprising a fixed wing, fuselage and tail assembly.
*Demonstrations of manned, gliding flight.
*Setting out the principles of power-to-weight ratio in sustaining flight.

Cayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a complete design.

In 1799 he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Aviation History| url = http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm| publisher = | accessdate  =26 July 2009| quote = In 1799 he set forth for the first time in history the concept of the modern aeroplane.

Cayley established the modern configuration of an aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control as early as 1799.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804 Cayley constructed a model glider which was the first modern heavier-than-air flying machine, having the layout of a conventional modern aircraft with an inclined wing towards the front and adjustable tail at the back with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model's [[centre of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs-Smith 2003, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Governableparachute.jpg|thumb|upright|"Governable parachute" design of 1852]]
In 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries (see above), he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation" (1809–1810).&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''.

Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air." He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: ''[[thrust]]'', ''[[Lift (force)|lift]]'', ''[[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]'' and ''[[weight]]'' and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also identified and described the importance of the [[camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] [[aerofoil]], [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of [[ornithopter]]s and [[parachute]]s.

In 1848 he had progressed far enough to construct a glider in the form of a [[triplane]] large and safe enough to carry a child. A local boy was chosen but his name is not known.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=60}}{{sfn|Angelucci|Matricardi|1977|p=14}}

He went on to publish in 1852 the design for a full-size manned glider or "governable parachute" to be launched from a balloon and then to construct a version capable of launching from the top of a hill, which carried the first adult aviator across Brompton Dale in 1853.

Minor inventions included [[Free flight (model aircraft)#Rubber-powered|the rubber-powered motor]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} which provided a reliable power source for [[Free flight (model aircraft)|research models]]. By 1808 he had even re-invented the wheel, devising the [[Wire wheels|tension-spoked wheel]] in which all compression loads are carried by the rim, allowing a lightweight undercarriage.&lt;ref name="FG54"&gt;Pritchard, J. Laurence.

"In thinking of how to construct the lightest possible wheel for aerial navigation cars, an entirely new mode of manufacturing this most useful part of locomotive machines occurred to me: vide, to do away with wooden spokes altogether, and refer the whole firmness of the wheel to the strength of the rim only, by the intervention of tight cording."&lt;/ref&gt;

====The age of steam====
Drawing directly from Cayley's work, Henson's 1842 design for an [[aerial steam carriage]] broke new ground. Although only a design, it was the first in history for a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft.

1866 saw the founding of the [[Aeronautical Society of Great Britain]] and two years later the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], London, where [[John Stringfellow]] was awarded a £100 prize for the steam engine with the best power-to-weight ratio.&lt;ref name="Jarret3 p53"&gt;Jarrett 2002, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stokes9 p163-6,7-8"&gt;Stokes 2002, pp. 163–166, 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 Stringfellow achieved the first powered flight using an unmanned 10&amp;nbsp;ft wingspan steam-powered monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guide wire to fly freely, achieving some thirty yards of straight and level powered flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyingmachines.org/strng.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zrpb67qFXUIC&amp;pg=PT63&amp;dq=1857+Temple+flight&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U0s2bWJVVIn6IEYDXat5SKBPh93UA ''First to Fly'' By Thomas C Parramore, p.46]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1591057.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]), ''On Aerial Locomotion''. He advanced Cayley's work on cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five stacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones because they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is known as the [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of a wing.

The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study, characterized by the "[[gentleman scientist]]s" who represented most research efforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British scientist-philosopher and inventor [[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton]], who studied lateral flight control and was the first to patent an [[Aileron|aileron control system]] in 1868.&lt;ref name="Magoun"&gt;{{cite book |last=Magoun |first=F.

Meanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857 [[Félix du Temple]] proposed a monoplane with a tail plane and retractable undercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and later by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned craft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the first successful powered glide in history.

In 1865 [[Louis Pierre Mouillard]] published an influential book The Empire Of The Air (''l'Empire de l'Air'').

[[File:LeBris1868.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Marie Le Bris]] and his flying machine, Albatros II, 1868.]]
In 1856, Frenchman [[Jean-Marie Le Bris]] made the first flight higher than his point of departure, by having his glider "''L'Albatros artificiel''{{-"}} pulled by a horse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 meters, over a distance of 200 meters.

[[File:AlphonsePenaudPlanaphore.png|thumb|right|200px|''Planophore'' model aeroplane by Alphonse Pénaud, 1871]]
[[Alphonse Pénaud]], a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and aerodynamics and constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters and ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing aeroplane, a model monoplane he called the "Planophore", a distance of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Pénaud's model incorporated several of Cayley's discoveries, including the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber power. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that the tailplane was set at a smaller [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] than the wings, an original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation|last=Gibbs-Smith |first=C.H. |authorlink=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith |year=2000 |publisher=NMSI |location=London |isbn=1900747529 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pénaud's later project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated other modern features. A [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin tractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces, retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.

[[File:Victor Tatin aeroplane 1879.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''Aeroplane'' of Victor Tatin, 1879.]]
Equally authoritative as a theorist was Pénaud's fellow countryman [[Victor Tatin]]. In 1879 he flew a model which, like Pénaud's project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also had a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air.  Flown tethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power.

In 1884 Alexandre Goupil published his work ''La Locomotion Aérienne'' (''Aerial Locomotion''), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly.

In 1890 the French engineer [[Clément Ader]] completed the first of three steam-driven flying machines, the Éole.  On October 9, 1890 Ader made an uncontrolled hop of around 50&amp;nbsp;m (165&amp;nbsp;ft); this was the first manned airplane to take off under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation|last=Gibbs-Smith |first=C.H. |authorlink=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith |year=2000 |publisher=NMSI |location=London |isbn=1 900747 52 9 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His [[Ader Avion III|Avion III]] of 1897, notable only for having twin steam engines, failed to fly:&lt;ref name="Jarrett5 p87"&gt;Jarrett 2002, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Ader would later claim success and was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his attempt.
[[File:maxim.gif|thumb|right|Maxim's flying machine]]
Sir [[Hiram Maxim]] was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own whirling arm rig and wind tunnel, and constructed a large machine with a wingspan of {{Convert|105|ft|m}}, a length of {{convert|145|ft|m}}, fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound [[steam engine]]s each delivering {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Overall weight was {{Convert|8000|lb|kg}}.  It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift: lacking flight controls it ran on rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it.  Completed in 1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200 yards at two to three feet of altitude&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmachines.org/maxim.html Flyingmachines.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407075521/http://www.flyingmachines.org/maxim.html |date=April 7, 2016 }}. Retrieved March 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation|last=Gibbs-Smith |first=C.H. |authorlink=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith |year=2000 |publisher=NMSI |location=London |isbn=1 900747 52 9 |pages=76–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Learning to glide====
[[File:Planeur Biot Massia Musee du Bourget P1010388.JPG|thumb|The Biot-Massia glider, restored and on display in the Musee de l'Air.]]

In the last decade or so of the 19th century, a number of key figures were refining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879 Biot constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly. It is preserved in the [[Musee de l'Air]], France, and is claimed to be the earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.

The Englishman [[Horatio Phillips]] made key contributions to aerodynamics. He conducted extensive wind tunnel research on [[aerofoil]] sections, proving the principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings underpin all modern aerofoil design.

[[File:More otho flying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Otto Lilienthal]], May 29, 1895.]]
[[Otto Lilienthal]] became known as the "Glider King" or "Flying Man" of Germany. He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his research in 1889 as ''Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation'' (''Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst''). He also produced a series of [[hang glider]]s, including bat-wing, monoplane and biplane forms, such as the [[Derwitzer Glider]] and [[Normal soaring apparatus]]. Starting in 1891 he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air machine, stimulating interest around the world. He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000 glides until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider crash.

Picking up where Lilienthal left off, [[Octave Chanute]] took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896 his team flew several of their designs eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented and photographed his work.

In Britain [[Percy Pilcher]], who had worked for Maxim, built and successfully flew several [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] during the mid to late 1890s.

The invention of the [[box kite]] during this period by the Australian [[Lawrence Hargrave]] would lead to the development of the practical [[biplane]]. In 1894 Hargrave linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and flew {{convert|16|ft|m}}. Later pioneers of manned kite flying included [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] in England and Captain Génie Saconney in France.

=== Langley ===
{{Main article|Samuel Pierpont Langley}}
[[File:Samuel Pierpont Langley - Potomac experiment 1903.jpeg|thumb|right|First failure of Langley's manned ''Aerodrome'' on the [[Potomac River]], October 7, 1903]]

After a distinguished career in [[astronomy]] and shortly before becoming Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] started a serious investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1891 he published ''Experiments in Aerodynamics'' detailing his research, and then turned to building his designs. He hoped to achieve automatic aerodynamic stability, so he gave little consideration to in-flight control.&lt;ref name=Anderson2004&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=IYnl_XPggZYC&amp;pg=PA145 |page=145 |last=Anderson |first=John David |title=Inventing Flight: The Wright Brothers &amp; Their Predecessors |publisher=JHU Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8018-6875-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, 1896, Langley's ''Aerodrome No. 5'' made the first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of {{Convert|1005|m|ft}} and a second of {{Convert|700|m|ft}}, at a speed of approximately {{Convert|25|mi/h|km/h}}. On both occasions the ''Aerodrome No. 5'' landed in the water as planned, because in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On November 28, 1896, another successful flight was made with the ''Aerodrome No.&amp;nbsp;6''. This flight, of {{Convert|1460|m|ft}}, was witnessed and photographed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The ''Aerodrome No.&amp;nbsp;6'' was actually ''Aerodrome No.&amp;nbsp;4'' greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.

With the successes of the ''Aerodrome No.&amp;nbsp;5'' and ''No.&amp;nbsp;6'', Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the [[Spanish–American War]], the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the '''Aerodrome&amp;nbsp;A''', and started with the smaller '''Quarter-scale Aerodrome''', which flew twice on June 18, 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903.

With the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but was disappointed when it delivered only {{convert|8|hp|kW|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|12|hp|kW|abbr=on}} he expected. Langley's assistant, [[Charles M. Manly]], then reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered {{convert|52|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 950&amp;nbsp;rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes.

To his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the ''Aerodrome'' immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the ''Aerodrome''{{'}}s aerial stability was marginal.&lt;ref name=Anderson2004 /&gt;

Langley's attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second abortive launch on December 8, the [[Wright brothers]] successfully flew their ''Flyer''. [[Glenn Curtiss]] made 93 modifications to the ''Aerodrome'' and flew this very different aircraft in 1914.&lt;ref name=Anderson2004 /&gt; Without acknowledging the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley's ''Aerodrome'' was the first machine "capable of flight".&lt;ref&gt;Hallion (2003) pages 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitehead===
{{Main article|Gustave Whitehead}}
[[File:Plane rear w crew.jpg|thumb|right|The No. 21 monoplane seen from the rear. Whitehead sits beside it with daughter Rose in his lap; others in the photo are not identified.]]
Gustave Weißkopf was a German who emigrated to the U.S., where he soon changed his name to Whitehead. From 1897 to 1915 he designed and built early flying machines and engines. On August 14, 1901, two and a half years before the Wright Brothers' flight, he claimed to have carried out a controlled, powered flight in his [[Whitehead No. 21|Number 21 monoplane]] at [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], Connecticut. The flight was reported in the ''Bridgeport Sunday Herald'' local newspaper. About 30 years later, several people questioned by a researcher claimed to have seen that or other Whitehead flights.

In March 2013 ''[[Jane's All the World's Aircraft]]'', an authoritative source for contemporary aviation, published an editorial which accepted Whitehead's flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jackson; [http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 ''Executive Overview: Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development &amp; Production – 'Justice delayed is justice denied' ''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313075911/http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 |date=March 13, 2013 }} (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]] (custodians of the original [[Wright Flyer]]) and many aviation historians continue to maintain that Whitehead did not fly as suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Budd Davisson; [http://www.flightjournal.com/blog/2013/03/25/who-was-first-the-wrights-or-whitehead/ ''Who Was First?

=== The Wright brothers ===
{{Main article|Wright brothers}}
Using a methodological approach and concentrating on the controllability of the aircraft, the brothers built and tested a series of kite and glider designs from 1900 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered design. The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their 19th-century predecessors. Their first glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own [[wind tunnel]] and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested.&lt;ref name=Dodson&gt;{{Citation |author=Dodson, MG |title=An Historical and Applied Aerodynamic Study of the Wright Brothers' Wind Tunnel Test Program and Application to Successful Manned Flight |journal=[[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]] Technical Report |volume=USNA-334 |year=2005 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher [[aspect ratio]] and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft, the [[Wright Flyer]], but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering.

[[File:First flight2.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Wright Flyer]]: the first sustained flight with a powered, controlled aircraft.]]
The Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by inventing [[wing warping]] for [[Aircraft principal axes#Longitudinal axis (roll)|roll]] control, combined with simultaneous [[Yaw axis|yaw]] control with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a head wind. Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design, because the [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] could not be highly loaded; [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.

The first flight by [[Orville Wright]], of {{Convert|120|ft|m}} in 12 seconds, was recorded in a famous photograph. In the fourth flight of the same day, [[Wilbur Wright]] flew {{Convert|852|ft|m}} in 59 seconds. The flights were witnessed by three coastal lifesaving crewmen, a local businessman, and a boy from the village, making these the first public flights and the first well-documented ones.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

Orville described the final flight of the day: "The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, but by the time three hundred feet had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitching]] again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be {{Convert|852|ft|m|0}}; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Fred C. ''The Wright Brothers: A Biography'' Chp. IV, p.101–102 (Dover Publications, NY 1943).&lt;/ref&gt; They flew only about ten feet above the ground as a safety precaution, so they had little room to maneuver, and all four flights in the gusty winds ended in a bumpy and unintended "landing". Modern analysis by Professor Fred E. C. Culick and Henry R. Rex (1985) has demonstrated that the 1903 Wright Flyer was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider.&lt;ref&gt;Abzug, Malcolm J. and E.

The Wrights continued flying at Huffman Prairie near [[Dayton, Ohio]] in 1904–05. In May 1904 they introduced the [[Wright Flyer II|Flyer II]], a heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On June 23, 1905 they first flew a third machine, the [[Wright Flyer III|Flyer III]]. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called "blinkers") between the elevators, and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage. On 5 October 1905, Wilbur flew {{Convert|24|mi|km}} in 39 minutes 23 seconds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.dayton.lib.oh.us/archives/wbcollection/wbscrapbooks1/WBScrapbooks10006.html Dayton Metro Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213024229/http://home.dayton.lib.oh.us/archives/wbcollection/wbscrapbooks1/WBScrapbooks10006.html |date=February 13, 2009 }} Aero Club of America press release&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the April 1907 issue of the ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in ''Scientific American'', April 2007, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the Wright brothers seemed to have the most advanced knowledge of heavier-than-air navigation at the time. However, the same magazine issue also claimed that no public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue. Hence, they devised the Scientific American Aeronautic Trophy in order to encourage the development of a heavier-than-air flying machine.

== The Pioneer Era (1903–1914) ==
{{Main article|Aviation in the pioneer era}}
This period saw the development of practical aeroplanes and airships and their early application, alongside balloons and kites, for private, sport and military use.

===European pioneers===
[[File:14-bis de Alberto Santos Dumont.jpg|left|thumb|The 14-bis, or ''Oiseau de proie''.]]
Although full details of the Wright Brothers' system of flight control had been published in [[l'Aerophile]] in January 1906, the importance of this advance was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on attempting to produce inherently stable machines.

Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer [[Traian Vuia]] on March 18 and August 19, 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 meters, respectively, in a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a fully wheeled undercarriage.&lt;ref name="L'Aérophile Apr Vuia1906"&gt;{{citation |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000520243 |title=Nouveaux essais de l'Aéroplane Vuia |work=L'Aérophile v.14 1906 |date=April 1906 |pages=105–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L'Aérophile Sep Vuia1906"&gt;{{citation |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000520243 |title=L'Aéroplane à moteur de M.

On September 13, 1906, a day after Ellehammer's tethered flight and three years after the Wright Brothers' flight, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] made a public flight in Paris with the [[14-bis]], also known as ''Oiseau de proie'' (French for "bird of prey"). This was of [[canard (aeronautics)|canard configuration]] with pronounced wing dihedral, and covered a distance of {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the grounds of the [[Chateau de Bagatelle]] in Paris' [[Bois de Boulogne]] before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented event was the first flight verified by the [[Aéro-Club de France]] of a powered heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially observed flight greater than {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

===Flight as an established technology===

[[File:Alberto Santos Dumont flying the Demoiselle (1909).jpg|thumb|Alberto Santos-Dumont flying the Demoiselle over Paris]]
Santos-Dumont later added [[aileron]]s, between the wings in an effort to gain more lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of [[Santos-Dumont Demoiselle|Demoiselle]] monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The ''Demoiselle No 19'' could be constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name="Hydro"&gt;Hartmann, Gérard. [http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/clement-bayard.pdf "Clément-Bayard, sans peur et sans reproche" (French).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101064312/http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/clement-bayard.pdf |date=November 1, 2016 }} ''hydroretro.net''. Retrieved: November 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fuselage consisted of three specially reinforced bamboo booms: the pilot sat a seat between the main wheels of a [[conventional landing gear]] whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by a [[cruciform tail]] unit hinged on a form of [[universal joint]] at the aft end of the fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping "down".

In 1908 Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a series of flight demonstrations at [[Le Mans]] in France.  The first demonstration, made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the Wright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled turns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs-Smith|first=C. H.|authorlink=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith|title=Aviation: An Historical Survey|page=158|location=London|publisher=NMSI|isbn=1 900747 52 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction business, whose first product was the influential [[Farman III]] biplane.

The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics.  On 25 July [[Louis Blériot]] won worldwide fame by winning a £1,000 prize offered by the British ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper for a flight across the [[English Channel]], and in August around half a million people, including the President of France [[Armand Fallières]] and [[David Lloyd George]], attended one of the first aviation meetings, the [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne|Grande Semaine d'Aviation]] at [[Reims]].

=== Rotorcraft ===
In 1877, [[Enrico Forlanini]] developed an unmanned [[helicopter]] powered by a steam engine. It rose to a height of 13 meters, where it remained for some 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan.
[[File:HE2G8.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Cornu]]'s [[Cornu helicopter|helicopter]], built in 1907, was the first manned flying machine to have risen from the ground using rotating wings instead of fixed wings.]]
The first time a manned helicopter is known to have risen off the ground was on a tethered flight in 1907 by the [[Breguet-Richet Gyroplane]]. Later the same year the [[Cornu helicopter]], also French, made the first rotary-winged free flight at Lisenux, France. However, these were not practical designs.

=== Military use ===
{{Main article|Early flying machines}}
Almost as soon as they were invented, airplanes were used for military purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the [[Italian-Turkish war]] (September 1911 – October 1912). The first mission (a reconnaissance) occurred on 23 October 1911. The first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinando Pedriali. "Aerei italiani in Libia (1911–1912)"(Italian planes in Libya (1911–1912)). ''Storia Militare'' (Military History), N° 170/novembre 2007, p.31–40&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Bulgaria]] followed this example. Its airplanes attacked and reconnoitered the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] positions during the [[First Balkan War|First Balkan War 1912–13]]. The first war to see major use of airplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was [[World War I]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] both used airplanes and airships extensively.

While the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I,&lt;ref&gt;with the exception of Clément Ader, who had visionary views about this: "L'affaire de l'aviation militaire" (Military aviation concern), 1898 and "La première étape de l'aviation militaire en France" (The first step of military aviation en France), 1906&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their [[reconnaissance]] departments. [[Radiotelephone]]s were also being explored on airplanes, notably the [[SCR-68 Airplane Radio Telephone|SCR-68]], as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.

=== Combat schemes ===
{{See also|Flying ace|List of World War I flying aces|Aerial victory standards of World War I}}

It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late 1914, [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane, but while [[Adolphe Pegoud]] would become known as the first "[[flying ace|ace]]", getting credit for five victories, before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was German [[Luftstreitkräfte]] Leutnant [[Kurt Wintgens]], who, on July 1, 1915, scored the very first aerial victory by a [[Fokker E.I|purpose-built fighter plane]], with a [[synchronization gear|synchronized machine gun]].

Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is [[Manfred von Richthofen]], better known as the '''Red Baron''', who shot down 80 planes in [[air-to-air combat]] with several different planes, the most celebrated of which was the [[Fokker Dr.I]]. On the Allied side, [[René Paul Fonck]] is credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are considered.

France, Britain, Germany and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php WWI airplane statistics by nation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035345/http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php |date=March 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with German aviation technologist [[Hugo Junkers]] showing the way to the future  through his [[Junkers J 1|pioneering use of all-metal aircraft]] from late 1915.

==Between the World Wars (1918–1939)==
{{main article|Aviation between the World Wars}}
The years between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw great advancements in aircraft technology. Airplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from wood and fabric to sleek, high-powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based primarily on the founding work of [[Hugo Junkers]] during the World War I period and its adoption by American designer [[William Bushnell Stout]] and Soviet designer [[Andrei Tupolev]]. The age of the great rigid airships came and went. The first successful rotorcraft appeared in the form of the [[autogyro]], invented by Spanish engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] and first flown in 1919. In this design, the rotor is not powered but is spun like a windmill by its passage through the air. A separate powerplant is used to propel the aircraft forwards.

[[File:Flagg biplane.jpg|thumb|left|Flagg biplane from 1933.]]
After World War I, experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their skills. Many American pilots became [[barnstorming|barnstormers]], flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking paying passengers for rides. Eventually the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races, acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and airframe development—the [[Schneider Trophy]], for example, led to a series of ever faster and sleeker [[monoplane]] designs culminating in the [[Supermarine S.6B]]. With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster. [[Amelia Earhart]] was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

[[File:DeHavilland DH50 biplane.jpg|thumb|Qantas De Havilland biplane, c. 1930]]
Other prizes, for distance and speed records, also drove development forwards. For example, on June 14, 1919, Captain [[Alcock and Brown|John Alcock]] and Lieutenant [[Alcock and Brown|Arthur Brown]] co-piloted a [[Vickers Vimy]] non-stop from St. John's, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to Clifden, Ireland, winning the £13,000 ($65,000)&lt;ref&gt;Nevin, David. "Two Daring Flyers Beat the Atlantic before Lindbergh." ''Journal of Contemporary History' 28: (1) 1993, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|Northcliffe prize]]. The first flight across the South Atlantic and the first aerial crossing using astronomical navigation, was made by the naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922, from [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], with only internal means of navigation, in an aircraft specifically fitted for himself with an [[artificial horizon]] for aeronautical use, an invention that revolutionized air navigation at the time (Gago Coutinho invented a type of [[sextant]] incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon).&lt;ref name="FIDEHAE"&gt;[http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf CAMBESES JÚNIOR, Manuel, ''A Primeira Travessia Aérea do Atlântico Sul'', Brasília: INCAER, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211206/http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf |date=March 14, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm History of the Sextant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200611/http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }} includes a photograph of a Gago Coutinho spirit level attachment.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later [[Charles Lindbergh]] took the [[Orteig Prize]] of $25,000 for the first ''solo'' non-stop crossing of the Atlantic. Months after Lindbergh, Paul Redfern was the first to solo the Caribbean Sea and was last seen flying over Venezuela.

Australian Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] was the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia in three stages. The first (from Oakland to Hawaii) was 2,400 miles, took 27 hours 25 minutes and was uneventful. They then flew to Suva, Fiji 3,100 miles away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the toughest part of the journey as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. They then flew on to Brisbane in 20 hours, where they landed on 9 June 1928 after approximately 7,400 miles total flight. On arrival, Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 25,000 at Eagle Farm Airport in his hometown of Brisbane. Accompanying him were Australian aviator [[Charles Ulm]] as the relief pilot, and the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator, navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to [[First aerial circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]], crossing the equator twice.

The first lighter-than-air crossings of the Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty's Airship [[R34 (airship)|R34]] and crew when they flew from [[East Lothian]], Scotland to [[Long Island]], New York and then back to [[RNAS Pulham|Pulham]], England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first commercial transatlantic service. However, the age of the rigid airship ended following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin LZ 129 [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] just before landing at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]] on May 6, 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the ''[[Wingfoot Air Express Crash|Wingfoot Express]]'' disaster (1919) to the loss of the [[R101]] (1930), the [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|''Akron'']] (1933) and the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']] (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety, but with the disasters of the U.S. Navy's rigids showing the importance of solely using [[helium]] as the lifting medium; following the destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making [[international flight]]s, the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship ''[[Graf Zeppelin II]]'', made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began [[World War II]]. Both remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German [[Luftwaffe]]; the last American rigid airship, the ''[[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|Los Angeles]]'', which had not flown since 1932, was dismantled in late 1939.

Meanwhile, Germany, which was restricted by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in its development of powered aircraft, developed [[gliding]] as a sport, especially at the [[Wasserkuppe]], during the 1920s. In its various forms, in the 21st century sailplane aviation now has over 400,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| title = FAI membership summary| accessdate = 2006-08-24| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810060357/http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| archivedate = 2006-08-10| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges FAI web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811162150/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 [[Jimmy Doolittle#Instrument flight|Jimmy Doolittle]] developed [[Flight instruments|instrument flight]].

1929 also saw the first flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the [[Dornier Do X]] with a wing span of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on October 21 there were 169 people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years.

Less than a decade after the development of the first practical rotorcraft of any type with the autogyro, in the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two aeronautical engineers working at the ''[[TsAGI|Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut]]'', constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single rotor helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four blade main rotor, and twin sets of {{convert|1.8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter anti-torque rotors; one set of two at the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-rated copies of the [[Gnome Monosoupape]] rotary radial engine of World War I, the TsAGI 1-EA [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx565dqF-5M made several successful low altitude flights]. By 14 August 1932, Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of {{convert|605|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with what is likely to be the first successful single-lift rotor helicopter design ever tested and flown.

Only five years after the German Dornier Do-X had flown, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era, the [[Tupolev ANT-20|''Maksim Gorky'']] in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction.

In the 1930s development of the [[jet engine]] began in Germany and in Britain – both countries would go on to develop jet aircraft by the end of World War II.

{{main article|Aviation in World War II}}
{{See also|Air warfare of World War II|List of aircraft of World War II|List of helicopters used in World War II|World War II aircraft production}}
[[World War II]] saw a great increase in the pace of development and production, not only of aircraft but also the associated flight-based weapon delivery systems. Air combat tactics and doctrines took advantage. Large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaigns were launched, [[Fighter aircraft#World War II|fighter escorts]] introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with [[dive bomber]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, and [[ground-attack aircraft]]. New technologies like [[radar]] also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defense.

[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwable.jpg|right|thumb|[[Me 262]], world first operational jet fighter]]

The first jet aircraft to fly was the [[Heinkel He 178]] (Germany), flown by [[Erich Warsitz]] in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the [[Me 262]], in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the [[Arado Ar 234]], in June 1943. British developments, like the [[Gloster Meteor]], followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile ([[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]), the first ballistic missile ([[V-2 rocket|V-2]]), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-powered combat aircraft [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163]]—with attained velocities of up to {{convert|1130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in test flights—and the first vertical take-off manned point-defense interceptor, the [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'', were also [[Vergeltungswaffe|developed by Germany]]. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of Germany.

Not only airplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second World War, with the introduction of the [[Focke Achgelis Fa 223]], the [[Flettner Fl 282]] [[synchropter]] in 1941 in Germany and the [[Sikorsky R-4]] in 1942 in the USA.

== The postwar era (1945–1979) ==

{{Main article|Postwar aviation}}

After World War II, [[commercial aviation]] grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the B-29 and [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] that could be converted into commercial aircraft.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[DC-3]] also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British [[de Havilland Comet]]. By 1952, the British state airline [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. The fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the cabin, and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies.

USSR's [[Aeroflot]] became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on September 15, 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]]. The [[Boeing 707]] and [[DC-8]] which established new levels of comfort, safety and passenger expectations, ushered in the age of mass commercial air travel, dubbed the [[Jet Age]].

In October 1947 [[Chuck Yeager]] took the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]] through the [[sound barrier]]. Although anecdotal evidence exists that some fighter pilots may have done so while dive bombing ground targets during the war,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} this was the first controlled, level flight to exceed the speed of sound. Further barriers of distance fell in 1948 and 1952 with the first jet crossing of the Atlantic and the first nonstop flight to Australia.

The 1945 invention of [[nuclear bomb]]s briefly increased the strategic importance of military aircraft in the [[Cold War]] between East and West. Even a moderate fleet of long-range [[bomber]]s could deliver a deadly blow to the enemy, so great efforts were made to develop countermeasures. At first, the [[supersonic]] [[interceptor aircraft]] were produced in considerable numbers. By 1955 most development efforts shifted to guided [[surface-to-air missile]]s. However, the approach diametrically changed when a new type of nuclear-carrying platform appeared that could not be stopped in any feasible way: [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. The possibility of these was demonstrated in 1957 with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. This action started the [[Space Race]] between the nations.

In 1961, the sky was no longer the limit for manned flight, as [[Yuri Gagarin]] orbited once around the planet within 108 minutes, and then used the descent module of [[Vostok 1|Vostok I]] to safely [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter]] the atmosphere and reduce speed from [[Mach number|Mach]] 25 using friction and converting the kinetic energy of the velocity into heat. The United States responded by launching [[Alan Shepard]] into space on a suborbital flight in a [[Mercury program|Mercury]] space capsule. With the launch of the [[Alouette I]] in 1963, Canada became the third country to send a satellite into space. The space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] would ultimately lead to the [[Apollo 11|landing]] of men on the moon in 1969.

In 1967, the [[X-15]] set the air speed record for an aircraft at {{Convert|4534|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} or [[Mach number|Mach]] 6.1. Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by [[NASA X-43|X-43]] in the 21st century.
[[File:Ksc-69pc-442.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Apollo 11]] lifts off on its mission to land a man on the moon]]
The [[Harrier Jump Jet]], often referred to as just "Harrier" or "the Jump Jet", is a British designed military jet aircraft capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It first flew in 1969, the same year that [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] set foot on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the [[Boeing 747]] and the Aérospatiale-BAC [[Concorde]] supersonic passenger airliner had its [[maiden flight]]. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the [[Airbus A380]], which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975 Aeroflot started regular service on the [[Tu-144]]—the first supersonic passenger plane. In 1976 [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] began supersonic service across the Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the [[SR-71]] Blackbird had set the record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its footsteps.

In 1979 the [[Gossamer Albatross]] became the first human powered aircraft to cross the English channel. This achievement finally saw the realization of centuries of dreams of human flight.

[[File:concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde, ''G-BOAB'', in storage at [[London Heathrow Airport]] following the end of all Concorde flying. This aircraft flew for 22,296 hours between its first flight in 1976 and final flight in 2000.]]

The last quarter of the 20th century saw a change of emphasis.  No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds, distances and materials technology.  This part of the century instead saw the spreading of the digital revolution both in flight [[avionics]] and in aircraft design and manufacturing techniques.

In 1986 [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] flew an aircraft, the [[Rutan Voyager]], around the world unrefuelled, and without landing. In 1999 [[Bertrand Piccard]] became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon.

Digital [[fly-by-wire]] systems allow an aircraft to be designed with [[relaxed static stability]]. Initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], this is now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners.

The ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'' was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation.

==21st century==
21st century aviation has seen increasing interest in fuel savings and fuel diversification, as well as [[low cost airlines]] and [[low cost carrier terminal|facilities]].  Additionally, much of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has been steadily adding aircraft and facilities, though severe congestion remains a problem in many up and coming nations.  Some [https://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/276065/global-city-pairs-top-20000-for-the-first-time-/ 20,000 city pairs] are served by commercial aviation, up from less than 10,000 as recently as 1996.

There appears to be [https://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/276059/japan-airlines-buys-into-supersonic-dream/ newfound interest] in returning to the supersonic era whereby waning demand and bureaucratic hurdles in the turn of the 20th century made flights unprofitable, as well as the final commercial stoppage of the [[Concorde]] due to a fatal accident.

In the beginning of the 21st century, digital technology allowed subsonic military aviation to begin eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs). In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft [[Global Hawk]] flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft, and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003 the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established feature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a remote operator.

Major disruptions to [[air travel]] in the 21st century included the [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closing of U.S. airspace]] due to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the closing of most of European airspace after the [[2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull]].

In 2015, André Borschberg flew a record distance of 4481 miles (7212&amp;nbsp;km) from Nagoya, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii in a solar-powered plane, [[Solar Impulse|Solar Impulse 2]]. The flight took nearly five days; during the nights the aircraft used its batteries and the potential energy gained during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.solarimpulse.com/leg-8-from-Nagoya-to-Hawaii | title = 8th leg from Nagoya to Hawaii | publisher = Solar Impulse RTW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iGeoSIT''', the Interim Geo-Spatial Intelligence Tool, is a [[situational awareness]] tool developed by the [[NATO Communications and Information Agency]] (NCIA) used widely within [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2004SPIE.5403..734T | title=Development and implementation of a NATO-wide state-of-the-art interim geospatial intelligence support tool | volume=5403 | page=734 | year=2004 | authors=Teufert, John F.| doi=10.1117/12.542311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geogra.uah.es/inicio/revista/pdfrevista14/17-otan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

iGeoSIT consists of a web-enabled Java server client and a central server, running Apache and Tomcat.  When a NATO person enters the URL for an iGeoSIT server, it checks first to see if the user has a locally cached copy of the client, a mapping utility.  If the local cache exists, the Java application is loaded.  If it does not, the Apache server send the java client application.  The Java on the server side runs on Tomcat with proposed plans to one day run on a newer Java engine.

iGeoSIT servers respond similarly as ArcGIS, and other GIS servers, to WMS requests.  WMS requests are tcp/IP messages where the server instructions are contained within the URL request to the webserver.  It will contain requests for data layers, opacity, and different base maps.  The request is replied with a JPG image and a redirect if there is a live overlay, such as current positions of a patrol or aircraft.

iGeoSIT clients are used by analysts and operators to geospatially reference events or perform terrain analysis.  For example, a units current location can be visually compared to a SQL response which contains the geospatial data point for a nearby military outpost.  The Java tool has things like rulers to physically measure distance(s), or draw shapes for export to PowerPoint for a mission brief, or event log.

Subfields of control theory include [[classical control theory|classical control]], [[optimal control]], and [[nonlinear control]].

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of [[signals]], which could take many forms such as [[image processing|image]], [[sound processing|sound]], electrical, or biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Digital Signal Processing|last=Lyons|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0137027415|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Use of Fourier transformation chest radiography.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=An example of how image processing can be applied to radiography.|An example of how the [[Fourier_transform#Fourier_transform_on_Euclidean_space|2D Fourier transform]] can be used to remove unwanted information from an [[Projectional radiography|X-ray scan]].]]

===Information theory===
{{Main article|Information theory}}
Information theory studies the analysis, transmission, and storage of information. Major subfields of information theory include [[code|coding]] and [[data compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of Information Theory|last=Cover|first=Thomas|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2006|isbn=978-0471241959|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Japanese facial tissue, introduced in 1918 and originally marketed as a way to remove [[cold cream]] (it had been in use for centuries before in Japan; see [[Facial tissue#History|History of facial tissue]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.toiletpaperworld.com/toilet-paper-history/complete-historical-timeline "Toilet Paper History – Complete Historical Timeline"].

Kleenex is introduced by Cellucotton and first marketed to women as a disposable towel to use when removing cold cream."&lt;/ref&gt; It was a disposable substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing "the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars...". A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for [[common cold|colds]] and [[hay fever]]. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan “Don’t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket” and its use as a disposable [[handkerchief]] replacement became predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kleenex.com/NA/About/Brand-Story.aspx Kleenex history |title=Kleenex Brand Story |publisher=Kleenex.com |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the [[Little Lulu]] cartoon character to popularize the brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/marge-and-lulu-the-art-of-the-deal/ "Marge and Lulu: The Art of the Deal," Jennifer Gotwals, ''Hogan's Alley'' #15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleenex trademark==
[[File:Original Kleenex-mark1925-trademarkia.jpeg|thumb|right|Original 1925 Kleenex trademark]]The original Kleenex trademark application at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) was filed in the class of Medical, Beauty, &amp; Agricultural Services by Cellucotton Products Company of [[Neenah, Wisconsin]], on Saturday, July 12, 1924. The description provided to the USPTO was "absorbent pads or sheets for removing cold cream".

The first use for the drawing and stylized word mark was on June 12, 1924, and its first use in commerce on June 12, 1924, as well. USPTO granted trademark registration on November 25, 1924. International Cellucotton Products Company officially assigned trademark interest and good will of the business to Kimberly-Clark Corporation on September 30, 1955. Kimberly-Clark Corporation of [[Neenah]], Wisconsin is the current registered owner of the Kleenex trademark.&lt;ref name="USPTO_Kleenex"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/ |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office, registration #s 0019194;0022859;0029753;0038458;0408618 |date=1924-06-12 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the Kleenex name has become—in common usage but ''not'' in law—[[Genericized trademark|genericized]]: the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any facial tissue, regardless of the brand. Many dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster and Oxford, now include definitions in their publications defining it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/kleenex||title=Kleenex|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Kleenex/|title=Kleenex|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mouthing cattle.jpg|thumb|Chin (or neck) bar in operation during [[Cattle age determination|mouthing]].]]
A '''cattle crush''' (in [[UK]], [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]] and [[Australia]]), '''squeeze chute''' ([[North America]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowmanenterprisesnet.com/|title=Bowman MFG Inc. - Cattle and livestock handling equipment - Cattle Chutes and Cattle Equipment|website=www.bowmanenterprisesnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filsonlivestockequip.com/sweeps_&amp;_alleys.htm|title=Sweeps &amp; Alleys|website=www.filsonlivestockequip.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''standing stock''', or simply '''stock''' (North America, [[Ireland]]) is a strongly built stall or cage for holding [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, or other [[livestock]] safely while they are [[Cattle age determination|examined]], marked, or given veterinary treatment. Cows may be made to suckle calves in a crush. For the safety of the animal and the people attending it, a close-fitting crush may be used to ensure the animal stands "stock still". The overall purpose of a crush is to hold an animal still to minimise the risk of injury to both the animal  and the operator while work on the animal is performed.

==Construction==
[[File:Cattle inspected for ticks.jpg|thumb|left|A portable crush]]
Crushes were traditionally manufactured from wood; this, however, was prone to deterioration from the elements over time, as well as having the potential to splinter and cause injury to the animal. In recent years, most budget-quality crushes have been built using standard heavy steel pipe that is welded together, while superior quality crushes are now manufactured using doubly symmetric oval tubing for increasing bending strength, bruise minimisation and stiffness in stockyard applications. In Australia, the steel itself should ideally be manufactured to High Tensile Grade 350LO - 450LO and conform to Australian Standards AS 1163 for structural steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalstockyards.com.au/features-benefits.htm#thesteel | publisher=National Stockyard Systems | title=Cattle Yard Features &amp; Options | accessdate=31 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle crushes may be fully fixed or mobile; however, most crushes are best classified as semipermanent, being potentially movable but designed to primarily stay in one place. A cattle crush is typically linked to a ''[[cattle race]]'' (also known as an ''alley''). The front end has a ''head bail'' (or ''neck yoke'' or ''head gate'') to catch the animal and may have a baulk gate that swings aside to assist in catching the beast. The bail is often adjustable to accommodate animals of different sizes. This bail may incorporate a chin or neck bar to hold the animal's head still. A side lever operates the head bail to capture the animals, with the better types having a rear drop-away safety lever for easier movement of the cattle into the bail. Usually, smaller animals can walk through the head bails incorporated in crushes.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;Doyle, Philip W., Beef Cattle Yards, NSW Dept. of Agriculture, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cattle crush 2.JPG|thumb|left|Scanning and weighing crush with timber and belting sides to increase the accuracy of [[ear tag]] scanning.]]

Lower side panels and/or gates of sheet metal, timber or conveyor belting are used in some cases to ensure animals’ legs do not get caught and reduce the likelihood of operator injury.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; At least one side gate is usually split to allow access to various parts of the animal being held, as well as providing access to feed a calf, amongst other things. A ''squeeze crush'' has a manual or hydraulic mechanism to squeeze the animal from the sides, immobilizing the animal while keeping bruising to a minimum. A sliding entrance gate, operated from the side of the crush, is set a few feet behind the captured animal to allow for clearance and prevent other animals entering. Crushes will, in many cases, have a single or split veterinary gate that swings behind the animal to improve operator safety, while preventing the animal from moving backwards by a horizontal  ''rump bar'' inserted just behind its haunches into one of a series of slots. If this arrangement is absent, a palpation cage can be added to the crush for veterinary use when [[artificial insemination]] or pregnancy testing is being performed, or for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beavervalleysupply.com/sectionj/wwchutes.htm CHUTES and ACCESSORIES] Retrieved on 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Older crushes can also be found to have a guillotine gate that is also operated from the side via rope or chain where the gate is raised up for the animal to go under upon entering the crush, and then let down behind the animal.

A crush is a permanent fixture in [[slaughterhouse]]s, because the animal is carried on a conveyor restrainer under its belly, with its legs dangling in a slot on either side. Carried in this manner, the animal is unable to move either forward or backward by its own volition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/restrain/new.conv.rest.html Conveyor Restrainer] Retrieved on 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mobile crushes are equipped with a set of wheels so they can be towed from yard to yard. A few of these portable crushes are built so the crush may also be used as a portable loading ramp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=William A.| title=Beef Cattle Breeding &amp; Management|publisher=Popular Books, Frenchs Forest|year=1990|isbn=0-7301-0040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile crush must incorporate a strong floor, to prevent the animal moving it by walking along the ground.

Crushes vary in sophistication, according to requirements and cost. The simplest are just a part of a cattle race (alley) with a suitable head bail. More complex ones incorporate features such as automatic catching systems, hatches (to gain access to various parts of the animal), [[winch]]es (to raise the feet or the whole animal), constricting sides to hold the animal firmly (normal in North American slaughterhouses), a rocking floor to prevent kicking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestockcontroller.co.uk|title=The "Livestock Controller" crush, designed to prevent kicking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a weighing mechanism.

==Specialist crushes==
[[File:AELEC (6).JPG|thumb|Indoor rough-riding chutes, [[Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre|AELEC]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales]].]]

Specialist crushes are made for various purposes. For example, those designed for cattle with very long horns (such as [[Highland cattle]] or [[Texas Longhorn cattle]]) are low-sided or very wide, to avoid damage to the horns. Other specialist crushes include those for tasks such as automatic scanning, foot-trimming or clipping the hair under the belly, and smaller crushes (calf cradles) for calves.

Standing stocks for cattle and horses are more commonly stand-alone units, not connected to races (alleys) except for handling animals not accustomed to being handled. These stand-alone units may be permanent or portable. Some portable units disassemble for transport to shows and sales. These units are used during grooming and also with veterinary procedures performed with the animal standing, especially if it requires heavy sedation, or to permit surgery under sedation rather than [[general anesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11994846 | volume=31 | issue=3 | title=Arthroscopic removal of dorsoproximal chip fractures of the proximal phalanx in standing horses | year=2002 | journal=Vet Surg | pages=195–200 | doi=10.1053/jvet.2002.32393}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some surgical procedures, this is reported to be efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-950X.2008.00387.x | pmid = 18564258 | volume=37 | issue=4 | title=Surgical technique to repair grade IV rectal tears in post-parturient mares |date=June 2008 | journal=Vet Surg | pages=345–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These units also are used during some procedures that require a horse to stand still, but without sedation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2460/javma.229.9.1458 | pmid = 17078809 | volume=229 | issue=9 | title=Changes in central venous pressure and blood lactate concentration in response to acute blood loss in horses |date=November 2006 | journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. | pages=1458–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different types of specialised crushes used in [[rodeo]] arenas. Those for the "rough stock" events, such as [[bronc riding]] and [[bull riding]], are known as bucking chutes or rough-riding chutes. For events such as [[steer roping]], the crush is called a roping chute. The rough-riding chutes are notably higher in order to hold [[horse]]s and adult bulls, and have platforms and rail spacing that allows riders and assistants to access the animal from above. These chutes release the animal and the rider through a side gate. A roping chute is large enough to contain a steer of the size used in [[steer wrestling]] and may have a seat above the chute for an operator. The steer or calf is released through the front of the chute.

==Hoof trimming crush==

A hoof trimming crush, also called a hoof trimming chute or hoof trimming stalls,&lt;ref name="Appleton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Steel Hoof Trimming Chutes |url=http://www.appletonsteel.com/hoof-trimming-chute-models/appleton-steel-vet-tech/ |website=Appleton Steel |publisher=www.appletonsteel.com |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a crush specifically designed for the task of [[Cow hoof#Hoof trimming|caring for cattle hooves]], specifically trimming excess hoof material and cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hoof Trimming Chutes |url=https://rileybuilt.com/hoof-trimming-chutes |website=Riley Built |publisher=www.rileybuilt.com |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such crushes range from simple standing frameworks to highly complex fixed or portable devices where much or all of the process is mechanised. Many standard crushes now come with optional fitting kits &lt;ref name=IAE&gt;{{cite web|last=Naylor|first=Steve|title=Crush options|url=http://www.iae.co.uk/agricultural/crushes/options.htm|publisher=iae|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to add to a non foot trimming crush.

==Integrated weighing systems==
In recent years, crushes are often integrated with &lt;ref name=iae&gt;{{cite web|last=Naylor|first=Steven|title=weighing systems|url=http://www.iae.co.uk/agricultural/crushes/weighers.htm|publisher=iae|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing systems. The crush provides the ideal opportunity to weigh and measure the animal while it is safely contained within the unit.

==History==

Many cattle producers managed herds with nothing more than a race (alley) and a headgate (or a rope) until tagging requirements and disease control necessitated the installation of crushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squeeze Chutes|url=http://www.agriculture.com/ag/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/ag/story/data/1157661577608.xml|website=Agriculture Online|publisher=www.agriculture.com|accessdate=24 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615182753/http://www.agriculture.com/ag/story.jhtml?storyid=%2Ftemplatedata%2Fag%2Fstory%2Fdata%2F1157661577608.xml|archivedate=15 June 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Crushes|url=http://www.starkeng.com.au/crushes.php|website=www.starkeng.com.au|publisher=Warwick Cattle Crushes|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past the principal use of the crush, in England also known as a trevis,&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Martin|title=Working oxen|year=1999|publisher=Shire|location=Princes Risborough|isbn=0-7478-0415-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u86yjr-J-hAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; was for the shoeing of [[ox]]en. Crushes were, and in places still are, used for this purpose in North America and in many European countries. They were usually stand-alone constructions of heavy timbers or stone columns and beams. Some were simple, without a head bail or yoke, while others had more sophisticated restraints and mechanisms; a common feature is a belly sling which allows the animal to be partly or wholly raised from the ground.  In Spain, the crush was a village community resource and is called [[:es:potro de herrar|''potro de herrar'']], or "shoeing frame". In France it is called [[:fr:travail à ferrer|''travail à ferrer'']] (plural ''travails'', not ''travaux'') or "shoeing trevis", and was associated with [[blacksmith]] shops.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Although the word ''travail'' derives from Latin ''tripalium'', "three beams", all surviving examples but that at [[Roissard]] have four columns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In central Italy it is called a ''travaglio'',&lt;ref name=tac&gt;{{cite web|last=Tacchini|first=Alvaro|title=La ferratura dei buoi|url=http://wwwstoriatifernate.it/pubblicazioni.php?&amp;id=578|accessdate=9 May 2011|language=Italian|quote=The shoeing of the oxen}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[Sardinia]] is referred to as {{lang-sc|sa macchina po ferrai is boisi}}, or "the machine for shoeing the oxen".&lt;ref name=serr&gt;{{cite web|title=Tradizioni - Serramanna|url=http://www.serramanna.altervista.org/tradizioni.htm|accessdate=9 May 2011|language=Italian, Sardinian|quote=Serramanna: traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it was called an ox sling, an ox press or shoeing stalls.&lt;ref name="osv"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Andrew|title=Well Trained to the Yoke: Working Oxen on the Village's Historical Farm|url=http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?Action=View&amp;DocID=899|website=Old Sturbridge Village|publisher=www.osv.org|accessdate=24 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314212228/http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?Action=View&amp;DocID=899|archivedate=14 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wet2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Wet/Dry Routes Chapter Newsletter|publisher =Santa Fe Trail Research Site|title=Did you know?|year= 1999|volume=6|issue=4|url= http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/wet/vol-06-no-4.html|accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, including the Netherlands&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Dutch Horseshoeing Cage|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=July 1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_90DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA102&amp;dq=dutch+horseshoeing+cage&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mlfcTa2AB4r2sgaIs8TnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=dutch%20horseshoeing%20cage&amp;f=false|page=102|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt; and France, horses were commonly shod in the same structures. In the United States similar but smaller structures, usually called horse shoeing stocks, are still in use, primarily to assist farriers in supporting the weight of the horse's hoof and leg when shoeing [[draft horse]]s.&lt;ref name=dhj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Steve|title=Draft Horse Shoeing...

'''Magnetic self-protection''' (MSP), also "mine protection" is an active measure to reduce the magnetic signature of a [[ship]]. This is needed so that the magnetic ignition mechanism of [[naval mines]] or [[torpedo]]es are not triggered.

The mere [[demagnetization]] is to be distinguished from that with which the permanent magnetic orientation of a metal hulk can be lifted with a strong magnetic field for some time.

==History==

The first magnetic self-protection equipment was developed at the beginning of [[World War II]] because of the advent of magnetically detonated mines. This was initially a cable which was placed along the entire length to the hull of the vessel and the application of direct current produced a magnetic field that counteracted the magnetic field of the steel mass of the vessel.

During the second world war these methods of mine protection were standard for all large battle ships. A simple [[magnetic coil]], however, was no longer capable of adequately compensating for the increasingly sophisticated magneto ignition, for the non-uniform magnetic field of a ship and for the variable effects of the Earth's magnetic field in different regions of the world.

==Present==

Modern MSP systems consist of a plurality of electromagnetic coils which suppress the magnetic signature in several directions. For that, the signature of the vessel is accurately measured under various conditions first, so that the signature of counteracting magnetic fields can be suitably generated. For the majority of the vessels of the German Navy, this is done in the two magnetic measurement and treatment centers in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel.

Not only must the uneven distribution of magnetic disturbances in the hull and the variable magnetic field in various areas of the world be taken into account, but also the movements of vessels (speed, rolling movements) or magnetic effects caused by units not constantly in use.

Accordingly, an MSP system today does not generate a static magnetic field any more, but a magnetic field which is tailored depending on the location and movement, as well as various internal processes of the ship.

In so-called highly protected vessels, such as anti-mine vessels or submarines that by construction already have a low magnetic signature, it can be almost completely eliminated with the aid of MSP systems. The German Navy maintains an Earth's magnetic field simulator for this purpose in the Borgsted narrows at Schirnau-Lehmbek, in which the MSP system is adjusted accordingly for the entire vessel in various operating states and for different measured latitudes.

The '''mousehole''' is the storage area on a [[drilling rig]] where the next joint of drilling pipe is held until needed.  This hole is in the floor of the rig, bored into the earth for a short way, and usually lined with a metal casing known as a scabbard.

The purpose is to have the top of the piece of drill pipe on a level with the [[kelly drive|kelly]] when the time comes to add the new piece of drill pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/m/mousehole.aspx|title=mousehole|work=slb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-channel analytics''' refers to the business process whereby multiple sets of data from different sources (i.e. channels) are linked and/or housed together and then analysed to provide business and in particular customer and marketing intelligence - thereby guiding effective and successful decision-making.

Businesses interact with their users and potential clients across multiple channels including [[television]], [[telephone]]s, the [[Internet]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[retail store]]s. Multi-channel analytics allows businesses to take data from all these sources and where possible make sense of it. This allows them to better understand, segment and therefore target their customers and potential users.

== Providers ==
Multi-channel analytics services are provided by a number of businesses including:

*[[Omniture]]
*[[Webtrends]]
*[The Porter Consultancy]

The '''National Air Duct Cleaners Association''' ('''NADCA''') is a non-profit organization committed to publishing standards for [[safety]], [[evaluation]], and [[:wikt:cleaning|cleaning]] of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts. They also offer several certifications for HVAC companies and professionals, as well as maintain an anti-[[fraud]] [[task force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hidden Camera Investigation Reveals Technician Charging $700 For Easy Air Vent Fix|url = http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/12810-hidden-camera-investigation-reveals-technician-charging-700-for-easy-air-vent-fix|website = Inside Edition|publisher = |access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the [[United States Department of Labor]] recommends hiring only duct cleaning professionals who are NADCA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/Documents/HVACDuctCleaning.pdf|title = DOHS Fact Sheet on HVAC Duct Cleaning|date = 2015-05-14|access-date = 2016-01-18|website = National Institutes of Health|publisher = Office of Research Services (ORS)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The NADCA was founded in 1989 when Pringle Power Vac owner John Sumerlin gathered 25 HVAC professionals to discuss the professional duct cleaning [[industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of NADCA {{!}} NADCA|url = http://nadca.com/en/about-nadca/history-nadca|website = nadca.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded to promote the source removal method of duct cleaning and the establishment of industry standards, the NADCA currently offers training courses, publishes standards, provides professional resources, maintains an HVAC professional locator tool, and more.

The NADCA first published a standard, “Standard 1992-01, Mechanical Cleaning of Non-[[Porosity|Porous]] Air Conveyance System Components,” in 1992. They currently publish “Standard for the Assessment, Cleaning, and Restoration of HVAC Systems,” called ACR: the NADCA Standard. The ACR provides guidelines for assessing HVAC systems, evaluating cleanliness, preventing hazards, cleaning methods, and cleaning equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Duct-cleaning Services Require a Contracting Commitment|url = http://www.achrnews.com/articles/130606-duct-cleaning-services-require-a-contracting-commitment|website = www.achrnews.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the members of the NADCA are over 1,000 HVAC cleaning companies with one or more certified ASCS technicians.

== Certification ==
In 1995, the NADCA began their first [[certification]] program, administering examinations for Air Systems Cleaning Specialist (ASCS) in [[Baltimore]], [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and [[Los Angeles]].

In 2003, they launched a Ventilation System [[Mold]] Remediator (VSMR) training and certification program, as well as a Certified Ventilation [[Inspector]] (CVI) training and certification program.

In 2013 NADCA decided to combine the ASCS and VSMR certifications into one certification, the ASCS. The present ASCS course has been revised to include the necessary VSMR training.

The ASCS and CVI programs are currently being offered.

'''Open Programming Language''' ('''OPL''') is an [[embedded system|embedded]] [[programming language]] for portable devices that run the [[Symbian OS|Symbian Operating System]].

==Usage==
It can be found on the [[Nokia]] 9200, [[Nokia 9300|9300]] and [[Nokia 9500|9500]] Communicator series [[mobile telephone]]/[[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) and the [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson P800|P800]], [[Sony Ericsson P900|P900]], [[Sony Ericsson P910|P910]] series. On classic [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] PDAs such as the [[Psion 3|Series 3]], [[Psion 5|5/5mx]], [[Psion Series 7|Series 7]], and netBook/netPad, as well as the [[Ericsson MC218|MC218]], OPL is part of the standard application suite. OPL is also included in Psion Teklogix industrial handhelds such as the [[Psion Workabout|Workabout mx]]. OPL is an [[interpreted language]] similar to [[BASIC]]. A fully [[Visual Basic]]-compatible language OVAL has been also developed.

==History==
The language was originally called '''Organiser Programming Language,''' developed by [[Psion (computers)|Psion Ltd]] for the [[Psion Organiser]]. Designed by Colly Myers with the first iteration implemented by Richard Harrison and Martin Stamp. The first implementation (without graphics) was for the original Psion Organiser (now referred to as the Psion Organiser I, 1984), and it came bundled with the Science, Finance and Math [[data pack]]s. It became truly accessible as built-in software in the Psion Organiser II (1986), and the language went on to be used in the [[Psion 3|Psion Series 3]] and later.  After [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] retired from the [[portable digital assistant]] market, the project was delayed until 2003, when the fledgling Symbian Developer Program released it as [[Open-source software|open source]]. The language is now developed on [[SourceForge]] in the opl-dev project.{{huh|date=October 2013}}

The language is not available from Symbian OS v8 and later, mainly due to lack of interest and support from major Symbian licencees Nokia and Sony Ericsson.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Hence, OPL will most likely never be made available for the newer generation of Symbian OS phones such as Sony Ericsson [[Sony Ericsson P990|P990]], [[Sony Ericsson M600|M600]],{{fact|date=October 2013}} [[Sony Ericsson W950|W950]], [[Sony Ericsson P1i|P1i]] and Nokia [[Nokia E61|E61i]] and [[Nokia E90|E90]]. As of 2010, Nokia device developers are encouraged to use [[Python (programming language)|Python]] for S60 instead (See [[Python for S60]]).{{fact|date=October 2013}}

==Examples==
Here is the console version of a [[Hello world program]]:

 PROC main:
   PRINT "Hello World!"
   PAUSE 40
 ENDP

&lt;small&gt;''(Source code taken from the PCDevPrimer in the OPL Wiki.)''&lt;/small&gt;

And here is a GUI version for Nokia's Series 80 user interface:

 CONST KKeyEnter%=13
 
 PROC hello:
   dINIT "Hello"
   dTEXT "","Hello World!"
   dBUTTONS "OK",KKeyEnter%
   DIALOG
 ENDP

OPL is a [[structured programming]] language. OPL programs contain PROCedures, which are much like [[subroutine|functions]] in other programming languages.
* The dINIT keyword in this example initializes a dialog box (intuitively enough, all dialog-box related functions begin with a letter 'd'; for clarity, this letter is in lower case, but the language is case independent). The first argument of the dialog is an optional string, which is used for the title of the dialog, displayed in the title bar.
* The dTEXT function displays text, with two compulsory arguments: a left-aligned 'prompt' string, and a main string.
* The dBUTTONS keyword allows you to put buttons on the dialog box - here there is a button with the text "OK". The second argument to each button is both the special notation of the shortcut key for that button and the dialog's return code, in this case the "Enter" key.
* Finally, the DIALOG keyword is required for the previously initialized dialog box to be shown on the screen.

===Testing dialog responses===
An example:
&lt;source lang="basic"&gt;
 PROC test:
   dINIT "Your Challenge"
   dTEXT "","Will your answer to this question be no?"
   dBUTTONS "Yes",%y,"No",%n
   IF DIALOG=%y
      PRINT "No it wasn't!"
   ELSE
      PRINT "Yes it was!"
   ENDIF
   GET
 ENDP
&lt;/source&gt;
In this cruel interrogative program, the Yes button is assigned the shortcut of Ctrl+y, while No has Ctrl+n, represented by %y and %n respectively. The user's input from the DIALOG is tested in the IF statement, PRINTing appropriate responses to the screen. Note that the 'GET' keyword, which gets user input without using a dialog box, is here used simply to wait for a keypress before terminating the program (otherwise it would end immediately without giving time for the user to read the text). The output from DIALOG can also be stored in a variable.

Variables specific to a procedure must be declared with the LOCAL keyword; global variables are defined with the GLOBAL keyword.

===Variable types===
The table below uses an example variable called 'var'.

{| border="1px" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; text-align: center;"
|-----
! Data Type
! Syntax
|-----
| Floating Point || var
|-----
| Integer || var%
|-----
| Long Integer || var&amp;
|-----
| String || var$(''length'')
|}

==Minutiae==

OPL interfaced with advanced Psion Series 3 features by means of [[operating system]] CALLs, but in the later [[Psion 5|Psion Series 5mx]] this was changed to a so-called 'OPX' library, stored in the system [[read-only memory|ROM]] (the Z drive). 'OPX' libraries were also made available for the [[Nokia 9210]], [[Nokia 9300]] and [[Nokia 9500]] Communicators, adding OPXs routines for handling SMS and managing Bluetooth communication.

Other OPL features include those with a letter 'g' at the beginning, for graphical functions; those with a letter 'm', for menus; and those with a letter 'd', for dialogs.

'''Out of Wallet''' refers to private data used for [[authentication]] in activities such as [[telephone banking]] or [[internet banking]] to prevent [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Out Of Wallet {{!}} Credit Bureau Connection|url = https://www.creditbureauconnection.com/compliance_solutions/index.php?category=compliance_solutions&amp;content=out_of_wallet|website = www.creditbureauconnection.com|accessdate = 2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice may part of a [[knowledge-based authentication]] process.

Ideally, out of wallet information is easily recallable by a user but obscure to most other persons and difficult for them to uncover. Prompts for out of wallet questions are now often generated automatically through convergence of [[database]]s containing users' financial transactions, vehicle registrations, and other records.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certain ID - ID Analytics|url = http://www.idanalytics.com/solutions/authentication-and-verification/certain-id/|accessdate = 2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical out of wallet questions a user may be asked include:

#What was the color of your first car?
#What is the name of the first school you attended?
#What is the name of the hospital you were born in?

Such information is available to a database compiler but may not be readily available to [[criminal]]s attempting to commit identity theft.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Package testing''' or '''packaging testing''' involves the measurement of a characteristic or property involved with [[packaging]]. This  includes packaging materials, packaging components,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Testing measures the effects and interactions of the levels of packaging, the package contents, external forces, and end-use.

It can involve controlled [[laboratory]] [[experiment]]s, subjective evaluations by people, or field testing.  Documentation is important:  formal [[test method]], test report, photographs, video, etc.

Testing can be a [[qualitative property|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] procedure.  Package testing is often a [[physical test]]. With some types of packaging such as food and pharmaceuticals, [[chemical test]]s are conducted to determine suitability of [[food contact materials]].  Testing programs range from simple tests with little [[replication (statistics)|replication]] to more thorough [[experimental design]]s.

Package testing can extend for the full life cycle.  Packages can be tested for their ability to be [[recycle]]d and their ability to degrade as surface [[litter]], in a sealed [[landfill]] or under [[compost]]ing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D6954 Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes ==
Packaging testing might have a variety of purposes, such as:
* Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a [[specification]], [[regulation]], or [[contract]] are met
* Decide if a [[new product development]] program is on track: Demonstrate [[proof of concept]]
* Provide [[Technical standard|standard]] [[data]] for other scientific, engineering, and [[quality assurance]] functions
* Validate suitability for end-use
* Provide a basis for  [[technical communication]]
* Provide a technical means of comparison of several options
* Provide [[evidence]] in legal proceedings: [[product liability]], [[patents]], product claims, etc.
* Help solve problems with current packaging
* Help identify potential cost savings in packaging

Packaging tests can be used for:
* Subjecting packages (and contents) to stresses and dynamics found in the field
* Reproducing the types of damage to packages and contents found in actual shipments
* Controlling the uniformity of production of packages or components

== Importance of testing ==

For some types of products, package testing is mandated by regulations: [[food]]. [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[dangerous goods]], etc.  This may cover both the design qualification, periodic retesting, and control of the packaging processes.  Processes may be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], validation protocols, ISO 9000, etc.

For unregulated products, testing can be required by a contract or governing specification.  The degree of package testing can often be a business decision.  [[Risk management]] may involve factors such as
* costs of packaging
* costs of package testing
* value of contents being shipped
* value of customer’s good will
* product liability exposure
* other potential costs of inadequate packaging
* etc.

With distribution packaging, one vital [[Packaging and labeling#Package development considerations|packaging development consideration]] is to determine if a packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process of getting to the final customer. A primary purpose of a package is to ensure the safety of a product during transportation and storage. If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kiyohide |first=Hasegawa |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Recent Trend of Transport Packaging Test |journal=JPI Journal|volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=716–722 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200419/000020041904A0658492.php |accessdate=16 Feb 2010 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Package testing is often a formal part of [[Project management]] programs.  Packages are usually tested when there is a new packaging design, a revision to a current design, a change in packaging material, and various other reasons. Testing a new packaging design before full scale manufacturing can save  time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicaldesign.com/contract-manufacturing/packaging/package_testing_risk_0608/ |title=Package Testing as Risk Management |accessdate=2010-02-16 |last= Dvorak|first= Paul|date=  June 1, 2008 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory affiliation ==
Many suppliers or vendors offer limited material and package testing as a free service to customers.  It is common for packagers to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as [[ISO 9000]] or allow customers to conduct  technical and quality audits.  Data from testing is commonly shared.  There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial.

Large companies often have their own packaging staff and a package testing and development [[laboratory]].  Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best.  Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Another option is to use a paid [[consultant]], [[Independent contractor]], and third-party [[independent testing laboratory]].  They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required.  Many have certifications and accreditations:  ISO 9000, [[ISO/IEC 17025]], and various governing agencies.

== Procedures ==
Several [[standards organizations]] publish test methods for package testing.  Included are:
* [[International Organization for Standardization]], ISO
* [[ASTM International]]
* [[European Committee for Standardization]]. CEN
* [[TAPPI]]
* Military Standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [http://www.ista.org/ ISTA (International Safe Transit Association)]
* etc.
Governments and regulators publish some packaging test methods.  There are also many corporate test standards in use.  A review of technical literature and patents provides good options to consider for test procedures.

Researchers are not restricted to the use of published standards but can modify existing test methods or develop procedures specific to their particular needs.  If a test is conducted with a deviation from a published test method or if a new method is employed, the test report must fully disclose the procedure.

== Materials testing ==
[[File:Inspekt desk 50kN IMGP8563.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Materials and components are often evaluated on a [[universal testing machine]]]]

The basis of packaging design and performance is the component materials.  The [[physical properties]], and sometimes [[chemical properties]], of the materials need to be communicated to [[packaging engineer]]s to aid in the design process.  Suppliers publish [[data sheet]]s and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon.  Sometimes these are adequate.  Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.

When a final package design is complete, the specifications for the component materials needs to be communicated to suppliers.  Packaging materials testing is often needed to identify the critical material characteristics and [[engineering tolerance]]s. These are used to prepare and enforce specifications.

For example, [[shrink film]] data might include: [[tensile strength]] (MD and CD), [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]],  [[Elastic modulus]], [[surface energy]],  thickness, [[Moisture vapor transmission rate]], [[Oxygen transmission rate]], heat seal strength, heat sealing conditions, heat shrinking conditions, etc.  Average and [[process capability]] are often provided. The chemical properties related for use as  Food contact materials may be necessary.

== Testing with people ==
Some types of package testing do not use scientific instruments but use people for the evaluation.

The regulations for [[child-resistant packaging]] require a test protocol that involves children. Samples of the test packages are given to a prescribed population of children. With specified 50-child panels, a high percentage must be unable to open a test package within 5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | format = PDF
  | doi =
  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adults are also tested for their ability to open a child-resistant package.

Consumer packages are often evaluated by [[focus group]]s. People evaluate the package features in a room monitored by video cameras.  The consumer responses are treated qualitatively for feedback into the new packaging process.

Some food packagers use [[organoleptic]] evaluations.  People use their senses (taste, smell, etc.) to determine if a package component has tainted the food in the package.

A new package may be evaluated in a [[test market]] that uses people to try the packages at home.  Consumers have the opportunity to buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount.  Return [[postcard]]s or [[Internet]] sites provide feedback to package developers.  Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations are an important part of [[marketing research]].

Legibility of text on packaging and labels is always subjective due to the inherent variations of people. Efforts have been made to help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D7298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some laboratory tests are conducted but still result in an [[observation]] by people.  Some test procedures call for a judgment by test engineers whether or not pre-established acceptance criteria have been met.

== Conditioning, testing atmosphere ==
[[File:Environmental chamber.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Environmental chamber]] to simulate temperatures and humidities encountered by packages]]

The environmental conditions of testing are critical.  The measured performance of many packages is affected by the conditioning and testing atmospheres.  For example, [[paper]] based products are strongly affected by their moisture content:  [[Relative humidity]] needs to be controlled.  Plastic products are often strongly affected by [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marcondes |first=Jorge |author2=Hatton |author3=Graham |author4=Schueueman |date=July 2003|title=Effect of temperature on the cushioning properties of some foamed plastic materials|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=69–76 |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions of 23&amp;nbsp;°C (73.4&amp;nbsp;°F) and 50% relative humidity are common but other standard testing conditions are also published in material and package test standards. Engineering tolerances for the conditions are also specified.  Often the package is conditioned to the specified environment and tested under those conditions.  This can be in a conditioned room or in a chamber enclosing the test.  With some testing, the package is conditioned to a specified environment, then is removed to ambient conditions and quickly tested.  The test report needs to state the actual conditions used.

Engineers have found it important to know the effects of the full range of expected conditions on package performance.  This can be through investigating published technical literature, obtaining supplier documentation, or by conducting controlled tests at diverse conditions.

== Degradation of product ==
[[File:Heat Sealing Film for Permeability Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px| [[Heat sealer]] used to prepare  bag of  lettuce for shelf life testing]]
Laboratory tests can help determine the [[shelf life]] of a package and its contents under a variety of conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing.  The ability of packaging to control product degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.

=== Relevant tests ===

=== Barrier Properties ===
{{Main|Moisture vapor transmission rate| Oxygen transmission rate|  Carbon dioxide transmission rate}}

Many products degrade with exposure to the atmosphere: foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc.   The ability of a package to control the [[permeation]] and penetration of gasses is vital for many types of products.  Tests are often conducted on the packaging materials but also on the completed packages, sometimes after being subjected to flexing, handling, vibration, or temperature.

== Degradation of Packages ==
Packages can degrade with exposure to temperature, humidity, time, sterlization (steam, radiation, gas, etc.), sunlight, and other environmental factors. For some types of packaging, it is common to test for possible [[corrosion]] of metals, [[polymer degradation]], and [[weather testing of polymers]].  Several types of [[accelerated aging]]  of packaging and materials can be accomplished in a laboratory.

Exposure to elevated temperatures accelerates some degradation mechanisms.  An [[Arrhenius equation]] is often used to correlate certain chemical reactions at different temperatures, based on the proper choice of  [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] coefficients.

As with any laboratory testing, validating field trials are important.

== Vacuum testing ==
[[File:Vacuum Chamber Package testing.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Vacuum chamber for testing leaks in packaging component]]
[[Vacuum chamber]]s are used to test the ability of a package to withstand low pressures.  This can be to:
# Determine the ability of packages to withstand low pressures that might be encountered.  this could be in an air shipment or high altitude truck shipment.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, P., Burgess, G., Kremer, M. and Lockhart, H.

== Shock and impact ==
[[File:Instrumented Drop Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Instrumented drop test of cushioned package to measure the transmitted shock]]
Both primary (consumer) packages and shipping containers have a risk of being dropped or being [[impact (mechanics)|impacted]] by other items.  Package integrity and product protection are important packaging functions. Tests are conducted to measure the resistance of packages and products to controlled laboratory shock and impact.

Testing also determines the effectiveness of package [[cushioning]] to isolate fragile products from [[shock (mechanics)|shock]]. [[Instrumentation]] is used to measure the shock transmitted to a cushioned product.

:ASTM D6537- Standard Practice for Instrumented Package Shock Testing For Determination of Package Performance

== Package Insulation ==
Many packages are used for products that are sensitive to temperature.  The ability of [[insulated shipping container]]s to protect their contents from exposure to temperature fluctuations can be measured in a laboratory. The testing can be of empty containers or of full containers with appropriate jell or [[ice pack]]s, contents, etc.  Ovens, freezers, and environmental chambers are commonly used for this and other types of packaging.

Digital [[temperature data logger]]s are used to measure temperatures experienced in different distribution systems.  This data is sometimes used to develop unique laboratory  test methods for that distribution system.

=== Relevant tests ===

:ISTA 7E – Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System Shipment

==Thermal shock==
Some packages, particularly glass, can be sensitive to sudden changes in temperature: [[Thermal shock]].   One method of testing involves rapid movement from cold to hot water baths, and back.

===Relevant tests===
:ASTM C149  -Standard Test Method for Thermal Shock Resistance of Glass Containers
:[[MIL-STD-810]]G METHOD 503.5

==Handles==
[[Package handle]]s (and hand holes in packages) assist carrying and handling packages. Objective laboratory  procedures are frequently used to help determine performance.  [[Test fixture|Fixtured]] ‘’hands’’ of various designs are used to hold a handle (sometimes two handles for a box).  Most common are “jerk testing’’ by modified drop test procedures or use of  the constant pull rates of a [[universal testing machine]].  Other procedures use a static force by hanging a heavily loaded package for an extended time or even using a [[centrifuge]].

===Relevant tests===

== Vibration ==
[[File:Vibration tester.png|thumb|right|170px|Vibration tester to simulate vibration
[[Frequency|frequencies]] at which packaged products are subjected during shipments]]

[[Vibration]] is encountered during shipping (vehicle vibration, rough roads, etc.) and movement on [[conveyor]]s.  Potential vibration damage may include:
* fractures and [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] damage
* loose wires, screw caps, etc.
* bruises on soft products (fruit, etc.)
* surface abrasion
* etc.
The ability of a package to withstand these vibrations and to protect the contents can be measured by several laboratory test procedures.  Some allow searching for the particular frequencies of vibration that have potential for damage. [[Modal testing]] methodologies are sometimes employed. Others use specified bands of random vibration to better represent complex vibrations measured in field studies of distribution environments.

== Compression ==
[[File:Army.mil-2007-02-07-153623.jpg|thumb|150 px|Compression test for steel drum]]
{{Main|Container compression test}}
Compression testing relates to stacking or crushing of packages, particularly shipping containers.  It usually measures of the force required to crush a package, stack of packages, or a unit load.  Packages can be empty or filled as for shipment.   A force-deflection curve used to obtain the peak load or other desired points.  Other tests use a constant load and measure the time to failure or to a critical deflection.

Dynamic compression is sometimes tested by shock or impact testing with an additional load to crush the test package.  Dynamic compression also takes place in stacked vibration testing.

== Large loads ==
[[File:Shipping container - rotary drop test.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Rotational corner drop test of [[wooden box]]]]

Large [[pallet]] loads, [[bulk box]]es,  [[wooden box]]es, and [[crate]]s can be evaluated by many of the other test procedures previously listed.  In addition, some special test methods are available for these larger loads.

== Test Protocols for Shipping Containers ==
Shipping containers are often subjected to sequential tests involving a combination of individual test methods.  A variety of standard  test schedules or protocols are available for evaluating transport packaging.  They are used to help determine the ability of complete and filled shipping containers to various types of [[logistics]] systems.  Some test the general ruggedness of the shipping container while others have been shown to reproduce the types of damage encountered in distribution.  Some base the type and severity of testing on formal studies of the distribution environment: [[instrumentation]], data loggers, and observation. Test cycles with these documented elements better simulate parts of certain logistics shipping environments.

=== Field trials ===
:Laboratory testing can often help identify shipping container constructions that, in general, should perform well in the field.  Of course, laboratory tests cannot fully reproduce the full range of field hazards, their magnitudes, nor their frequency.  [[Field experiment]]s are often conducted to help validate the laboratory testing.

:The advantage of laboratory testing is that it subjects replicate packages to identical sets of test sequences: a relatively small number of samples often can suffice.  Field hazards, by their nature, are highly variable: thus repeated shipments do not receive the same types or magnitudes of drops, vibrations, kicks, impacts, abrasion, etc.  Because of this uncontrolled variability, more replicate sample shipments are often necessary.

:Larger scale test markets are used to give additional assurance of performance and acceptability for a new or revised packaged-product.  Feedback is carefully obtained and evaluated.   Feedback on package performance continues when full production and distribution have been achieved.

== Product requirements ==
In addition, package testing often relates to the specific product inside the package.  Some broad categories of products and special package testing considerations follow:

=== Food packaging ===
Foods categories such as fresh [[produce]], [[frozen food]]s, [[irradiated food]]s, fresh fish, [[canned food]]s, etc. have regulatory requirements and special packaging needs.  Package testing often relates to:
:::[[Food safety]]
:::Compatibility of the package with the food
:::Migration of material from the packaging to the food
:::Shelf life
:::Barrier properties, porosity, package atmosphere, etc
:::Special quality assurance needs, [[good manufacturing practice]]s, HACCP, validation protocols, etc

=== Pharmaceutical packaging ===
Packaging for drugs and [[pharmaceutical]]s is highly regulated.  Special testing needs include:
:::Safety of drugs and pharmaceuticals
:::Barrier properties
:::Shelf life
:::Compatibility of package with the drugs
:::Sterility
:::Tamper resistance, child resistance, etc
:::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, validation protocols, etc
{{Main|Validation (drug manufacture)}}

=== Medical Packaging ===
Packaging for medical materials, [[medical devices]], [[health care]] supplies, etc., have special user requirements and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, sterility and strength need to be controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production.

Assurance of sterility and suitability for use are critical.  For example, medical devices and products are often sterilized in the package.  The sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians.  A series of special packaging tests is used to measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility.  [[Verification and validation]] protocols are rigidly maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="943">'''Power Pro''' a type of [[braided fishing line]] made out of a material called [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|Spectra fiber]]s. It has an equivalent diameter of nearly 1/5 of [[monofilament fishing line|monofilament]]. Thus the diameter of a piece of Power Pro testing at 50 pounds is equivalent to monofilaments' diameter testing at around 12 pounds. It lacks stretch that monofilament has, giving the fisherman a better "feel" and also helps set the hook faster. [[Environmentalist]]s have criticized the use of spectra fiber, as it takes a long time to degrade thus harming the environment. Spectra is a form of gel-spun polyethylene.

One note in using Power Pro, the drag has to be set at a much lighter strength than compared to monofilament due to the propensity for Power Pro to dig into itself while fighting large fish.

A '''rat trap''' is a [[Animal trapping|trap]] designed to catch [[rat]]s.

==Types of traps==
[[File:Rat caged.webm|thumb|Rat trapped in a cage]]
[[Spring (device)|Spring]] traps for large [[rodent]]s such as rats or [[squirrel]]s are powerful enough to break the animal's neck or spine. They may break human fingers as well, whereas an ordinary spring-based [[mousetrap]] is very unlikely to break a human finger. Rat spring traps may not be sensitive enough to spring when a mouse takes the bait.

A ''rat cage trap'' is a metal cage box-shaped device that is designed primarily to catch rats without killing them. Food [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]] (not poisoned) is put in the cage trap.  When an animal enters the cage and moves toward the bait, the mechanism triggers and closes a door over the entry point. The animal is caught alive and without injury. The animal can be transported and released elsewhere or subsequently killed.

Glue traps are non-poisonous sticky glue spread over card boards and the like and kept in places rats frequent, which gets them stuck to it when they pass over it.  The rat will subsequently die from dehydration and asphyxiation.  A bait may also be placed on the cardboard to attract the rats.

Another form of non-lethal trap is one where the wires it is constructed of are cut and formed into a funnel shape directed into the body of the cage. This design is usually dome shaped with the funnel at the crown. Rats are extremely flexible and can push through the narrower opening into the cage, but cannot escape due to the ends of the wires poking them in the face. The advantage of this design is that it can catch more than one rat at a setting.

Other types of traps (as shown below) are designed to kill the animal.

Electronic rat traps detect the presence of a rodent via metal plates on the floor of the trap, then deliver a lethal dose of high-voltage electricity stepped up from batteries to several thousand volts. Some brands offer remote indication to tell you when the trap has operated. The Eliminator (South Africa) and Victor (US) are two brands of electronic rat traps.

Glue traps, however, are not considered a humane method of rodent control, especially if the rodent is left to die. They can also harm non-targeted animals.

Another trap design, often considered more humane, is a self-resetting rat trap like the [[Goodnature]] A24. These traps kill rodents with an impact from a [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-powered piston and are self-resetting.

'''Rigs-to-Reefs''' ('''RTR''') is the practice of converting decommissioned offshore [[Oil platform|oil and petroleum rigs]] into [[artificial reef]]s. Such biotic [[reef]]s have been created from oil rigs in the United States, [[Brunei]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="Artificial Reefs"&gt;Brian Twomey, [http://www.ccop.or.th/eppm/projects/40/docs/6%20Artifical%20reefs%2014June12%20BT%20issued.pdf Artificial Reefs], CCOP/EPPM Workshop on End of Concession &amp; Decommissioning, 12–14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, where the practice started and is most common, Rigs-to-Reefs is a nationwide program developed by the former [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS),&lt;ref name=RRinfo&gt;{{cite web |title=Rigs-to-Reefs Information: What is Rigs-to-Reefs and how does it relate to the mission of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement? |url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/rigs-to-reefs/information.html |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; now [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]] (BSEE), of the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].

The program has been generally popular with fishermen, the oil industry, and government regulators in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where offshore platforms develop into [[coral reef]]s, and as of September 2012, 420 former oil platforms, about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs.&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat_conservation/documents/pdfs/efh/gulf_decommissioning_and_rigs_to_reefs_faqs_final.pdf Gulf decomissioning and Rigs-to-Reefs, FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109224846/http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat_conservation/documents/pdfs/efh/gulf_decommissioning_and_rigs_to_reefs_faqs_final.pdf |date=2013-11-09 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition in California has prevented a rigs-to-reefs program on the West Coast of the US.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna D. E. Athanassopoulos, James Stanwood Dalton, and Adam P. Fischer, [http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/research/1999Group_Projects/rigs2reefs/rigs2reefs_final.pdf Off Shore Oil Platform Decommissioning], M.S. Thesis, June 1999, University of California Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmental opposition has prevented implementation of Rigs-to-Reefs in the [[North Sea]].

==Overview==
Inevitably, marine organisms attach themselves to the underwater portions of oil production platforms, transforming them into artificial reefs.

These platforms continue to function as long as the reservoirs underneath them provide oil at a profitable rate. At the end of their productive lives they must be decommissioned and removed (in the US within one year).&lt;ref name=Dauterive&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dauterive, Les |title=Rigs-To-Reef Policy, Progress, and Perspective |journal=OCS Report |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |year=2000 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to removal is to turn the rig into a reef through the Rigs-to-Reef (RTR) program. All coastal states in the US have such [[artificial reef]] programs in the interest of increasing ocean [[Fishery|fisheries]] but not all participate in RTR.&lt;ref name=MMS2000-073&gt;{{cite report |author=U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region |title=Rigs-to-Reefs Policy, Progress, and Perspective |volume=OCS Report MMS 2000-073 |url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/techann/000073.html |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slc.ca.gov/Division_Pages/MRM/Rigs_to_Reef/Whitepaper.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821205828/http://slc.ca.gov/Division_Pages/MRM/Rigs_to_Reef/Whitepaper.html |date=21 August 2008 }} State of California State and Lands Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The rig's steel structures are stable and durable.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; They create shelter for marine life in open waters where there was none.

Note that production platforms are often called "rigs"; that terminology is used occasionally in this article—and indeed in the term Rigs-to-Reefs. However, within the industry "rigs" refers to apparatus with a derrick that can drill and service wells.  (Most production platforms do not have such equipment installed.)

==Process==
Once a rig stops producing at economic rates, the site is usually abandoned.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaiser, Mark J. |title=The Louisiana Artificial Reef Program |journal=Marine Policy |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=605–623 |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2005.04.005 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VCD-4K8Y74R-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1cc2a7885e53d9771c9668d537048a04 |accessdate=2009-03-06 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS) requires the operator to remove the rig within a year of abandonment (stopped production&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt;) and lease end.&lt;ref name=Dauterive/&gt; MMS supports and encourages RTR as an alternative to total removal.&lt;ref name=Dauterive/&gt; RTR recognizes that during a rig's productive years, significant marine life comes to live on and around its structure. RTR preserves much of that marine life and encourages further growth. The operator benefits by avoiding the substantial cost of removal. Cumulative costs of removal had reached an estimated $1 billion by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, Mel|title=Guidelines for Marine Artificial Reef Materials |publisher=Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission |date=Jan 1997 |pages=1–123|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape and complexity of the structure may lead to significant species diversity.

===Decommissioning a platform===

Officially, decommissioning an oil rig is the act of removal according to regulatory requirements and includes flushing, plugging and cementing wells to make them safe.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; Decommissioning is complicated by factors such as cost, safety, operational duration, environmental issues, risk, experience, and historical relationship between operator and state.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt;

As part of decommissioning, the operator must deal with the [[shell mound]] that collects on the bottom surrounding the rig.  The mound forms on the pile of cuttings discharged from the original drilling operations, shells that have fallen from the platform's underwater structure, and material that has fallen and/or leaked from the platform, occasionally mixed with well seepage. Mounds can contain significant levels of toxic metals including, [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[lead]], [[zinc]], and poly-nuclear [[hydrocarbon]]s. Removing the rig structure does not eliminate the need to address the mound.&lt;ref name=Watchdog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilwatchdog.org/articles/?storyId=24233|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415142203/http://www.oilwatchdog.org/articles/?storyId=24233|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-15|title=Oil watchdog}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The method of decommissioning depends on water depth and structure type&lt;ref&gt;Sector Notebook Project; Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and is a three-step process that includes planning, permitting, and implementation.&lt;ref name=Schroeder&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schroeder, Donna M., &amp; Love, Milton S. |title=Ecological and political issues surrounding decommissioning of offshore oil facilities in the Southern California Bight |journal=Ocean and Coastal Management |volume=47 |year=2004 |pages=21–48 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VG5-4CB09CM-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d0fe36ce17d00b78b5a7f712e4c67f37 |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2004.03.002 |accessdate=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A party other than the operator usually administers the process.

In [[Louisiana]], costs as well as the risk involved are the primary factors in determining how to decommission rigs. If the savings are large enough, the operator typically chooses reefing and donates 1/2 the savings to maintain the reef.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; Decommissioning a shallow water rig typically costs $10–15 million&lt;ref name=Issues&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=1394|title=Rigs-to-Reefs issues|access-date=24 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525035912/http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=1394|archive-date=25 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the amounts can be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slc.ca.gov/Division_Pages/MRM/Rigs_to_Reef/Whitepaper.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821205828/http://slc.ca.gov/Division_Pages/MRM/Rigs_to_Reef/Whitepaper.html |date=21 August 2008 }} CA.gov Rigs-to-Reefs Workshop&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana Artificial Reef program from its inception through 1998 received roughly $9.7 million in donations and has not taken taxpayer money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5281/is_199811/ai_n24344412] The Greater Baton Rouge Business Report 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of reefing===
[[File:Tow and Place.png|thumb|Method of rig-to-reef conversion by tow and place.]]
[[File:Partial removal.png|thumb|Method of rig-to-reef decommissioning by partial removal]]
[[File:Topple-in-Place.png|thumb|Method of rig-to-reef decommissioning by toppling in place.]]

Severing the rig from the bottom using explosives is the easiest approach, but has the potential to harm marine life. This potential is greatly reduced if the explosives are all placed deep below the seafloor. Current requirements place the explosives a minimum of {{convert|5|m}} below the seafloor which eliminates the threat to all but the closest sea turtles. [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) marine observers and [[helicopter]] surveys hours preceding the event keep most sea turtles away from the area. Alternatively, [[commercial diver]]s can use mechanical and abrasive cutters, which preserves marine life, but places the divers at considerable risk.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt;

Reefing involves one of three methods.:

* Tow and Place: Sever the structure from the sea floor and tow it to a state-approved location.
*Partial Removal: Remove the top portion of the submerged platform and either remove to the shore for salvage or place it on the sea floor nearby or at another site.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; Partial removal can result in a loss of the shell mound community and fish that live in the top section but the rest (the majority) of the habitat remains intact.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;
* Toppling: Toppling involves uses explosives to sever the base of the structure below the mud line in a matter such that it simply falls over. Toppling eliminates shallow and mid-ocean habitats. However, these portions of the rig are quickly occupied by other creatures.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;
* Augmentation and Integration: Augmentation and Integration involves adding additional structure to the reef site to enhance its value as a habitat and deliver additional ecosystem services.

==United States==
Offshore drilling began in California in the late 1800s from piers built out over the ocean. The first offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico was built in 1947 off the Louisiana coast.

The United States began extracting oil offshore in the early 20th Century;&lt;ref name=Love&gt;{{cite journal |author=Love, Milton|title=Fish assemblages around seven oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel area |publisher=Marine Science Institute University of California |date=August 1999 |pages=96–117|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Today over 4,500 offshore oil and gas platforms have been installed supplying 25% of the United States' production of [[natural gas]] and 10% of its oil."&lt;ref name="wlf.louisiana.gov"&gt;[http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fishing/programs/habitat/artificialreef.cfm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513072533/http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fishing/programs/habitat/artificialreef.cfm |date=13 May 2008 }} Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concern over abandoned oil rigs surfaced only in the 1980s.

The US Congress passed the [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]] (OCSLA) in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mms.gov/aboutmms/OCSLA/ocslahistory.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708211100/http://www.mms.gov/aboutmms/OCSLA/ocslahistory.htm |archive-date=8 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to control [[Offshore oil and gas in the United States|leasing]] of exploration rights in the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS).&lt;ref name=Rothbach&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothbach, Dan |title=Rigs-to-Reefs: Refocusing the Debate in California |journal=Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum |volume=17 |issue=283 |year=2007 |pages=283–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCSLA did not contain any real environmental provisions associated with drilling and the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]] triggered the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/basics/nepa.html |title=Basic Information &amp;#124; Compliance and Enforcement &amp;#124; U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required that every major federal action (i.e.: oil exploration on the OCS) required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).&lt;ref name=Rothbach/&gt; In 1982, The U.S. [[Department of the Interior]] created the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS) to monitor development on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].&lt;ref name=Rothbach/&gt; The MMS leases submerged federal lands and assesses the environmental effects of exploration and drilling (by issuing an EIS).&lt;ref name=Rothbach/&gt; In 1984 Congress passed the National Fishing Enhancement Act (NFEA) which provided the basis for artificial reef programs.&lt;ref name=Rothbach/&gt; The NFEA spawned the National Artificial Reef Plan of 1985. This plan cleared the way for government-endorsed artificial reef projects and subsequently the Minerals Management Services' Rigs-to-Reef program.&lt;ref name=RRinfo/&gt;

Following a number of hurricanes from 2004 to 2008, including Katrina, Ike, Ivan, and Rita, that damaged oil production platforms, offshore oil operators filed numerous applications to abandon unused platforms in place.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, [http://www.boem.gov/BOEM-Newsroom/Speeches/101101_BOEMRE-Rigs-to-Reefs-Program-pdf.aspx Rigs-toReefs program]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government responded by placing a moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, and requiring unused platforms to be speedily decommissioned by removal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/us/a-fight-to-convert-high-island-a-platform-into-a-reef.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the BSEE lifted its moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, subject to Coast Guard determination that the structure would not pose a threat to navigation, and acceptance of ownership and liability by the state government.&lt;ref name="Interim policy document"&gt;James A. Watson, [http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=36507222478 "Interim policy document"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043307/http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=36507222478 |date=10 November 2013 }}, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Rigs-to-Reefs option is expected to be less expensive than removal, the platform owner pays half the estimated savings to the state agency receiving the former platform.

===Gulf of Mexico===
[[Image:Gulf Coast Platforms.jpg|thumb|250px|right|NOAA map of the 3,858 oil and gas platforms extant in US federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in 2006]]

The more than 4,500 oil production platforms in the US portion of the Gulf of Mexico are the largest concentration of offshore platforms in the world, having more offshore platforms than the rest of the world combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/decommissioning/FRB/Eng/Facts.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209022508/http://info.ogp.org.uk/decommissioning/frb/eng/Facts.html |archive-date=9 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil production platforms in the Gulf have also been called the largest artificial reef complex in the world.&lt;ref name=Dauterive/&gt;

In 1979, [[Exxon]] relocated their experimental subsea production system from offshore Louisiana to a permitted artificial reef site off [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], Florida.&lt;ref name=Dauterive2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dauterive, Les |title=Rigs-To-Reefs policy, progress, and perspective. |journal=In: Hallock and French (eds). Diving for Science...2000. Proceedings of the 20th Annual Scientific Diving Symposium |publisher=[[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] |year=2000 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8995 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first platform jacket was donated by [[Tenneco]] and towed from Louisiana to [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], Florida.&lt;ref name=Dauterive2000/&gt;

By 2000, 151 platforms had been converted to permanent reefs. Of these, 90 were towed to new locations and 61 were abandoned in place. Louisiana had 94 of the platforms-turned reefs, Texas 50, Alabama 4, and Florida 3.&lt;ref name=Dauterive2000/&gt; Florida, which has a long-standing ban on offshore oil production, has requested and received a number of decommissioned oil platforms for creation of artificial reefs in Florida state waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.api.org/aboutoilgas/sectors/explore/rigstoreef.cfm] API Energy: Rigs to Reef Programs Create Valuable Fish Habitat&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offshore California===
In contrast to the Gulf of Mexico states, old oil platforms have not been converted to artificial reefs in offshore California, the only other offshore oil-producing area in the contiguous 48 states. A number of reasons have been cited for this, primarily the strength of the environmental movement in California, its antagonistic relationship with the oil industry, and its reluctance to support any measure that would financially benefit the offshore oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Polakovic, [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/28/news/mn-2543/2 Legacy of an Offshore Disaster], Los Angeles Times, 28 Jan. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences include the smaller number of offshore platforms (27 off California, versus approximately 4,500 in the Gulf of Mexico), and the smaller portion of the California economy made up by oil and fishing.

The California legislature passed a bill allowing conditional partial removal of oil platforms in 2010, and the measure was signed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. A.B. 2503 “allows a platform owner or operator to design a ‘partial removal’ plan for a platform and to apply for permission to implement it”.&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hecht|first=Sean B.|title=California's New Rigs-to-Reef Laws|url=http://www.environment.ucla.edu/reportcard/article.asp?parentid=9389|publisher=UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan requires the approval of three agencies: The Department of Fish and Game (DFG), The Department of Ocean Protection Council (OPC), and the California State Lands Commission.&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; As of 2013, no oil platforms have been converted to permanent reefs.&lt;ref name="Artificial Reefs"/&gt;

==Brunei==
Brunei has had a rigs-to-reefs policy since 1988. Offshore operator [[Shell oil|Shell]] Brunei Petroleum has towed numerous old platforms and jackets to two designated artificial reef areas located away from shipping lanes.&lt;ref name="Artificial Reefs"/&gt;

==Malaysia==
The Baram-8 platform was damaged in a storm and collapsed to the seabed in 1975. It was made into an artificial reef.&lt;ref name="Artificial Reefs"/&gt; As of 2013, Malaysia has no rigs-to-reefs program, but was studying the Baram-8 reef as an example.

In 2017, Dana and D30 Platform was laid out for rigs-to-reef in offshore Sarawak.

==North Sea==
Studies have concluded that oil platforms in the North Sea attract fish, and that a rigs-to-reefs policy there would benefit fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Aud Vold Soldal, Ingvald Svellingen, Terje Jørgensen, and Svein Løkkeborg, [http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/supplement/S281.full.pdf “Rigs-to-reefs in the North Sea: hydroacoustic quantification of fish in the vicinity of a ‘semi-cold’ platform”], ICES Journal of Marine Science, 59: S281–S287, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the highly publicized occupation of the [[Brent Spar]] North Sea oil platform by [[Greenpeace]] in 1995 has been highly influential in Europe. Despite scientific findings of the potential value of rigs-to-reefs in the North Sea, the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR), which has jurisdiction over North Sea oil development, has blocked rigs-to-reefs.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Jørgensen, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569111002080 OSPAR’s exclusion of rigs-to-reefs in the North Sea] Ocean &amp; Coastal Management, v.58, Mar. 2012, p.57–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/23964 “Sinking Prospect: Oil Rigs and Greenpeace in the North Sea”], Solutions Journal, v.4 n.4, Sept. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
Opposition to, and also support for, Rigs-to-Reefs comes from environmentalists, fisherman, oil companies, and others. California and the North Sea are each debating RTR. In California, legislation was proposed during the 2010 session to clear legal hurdles for RTR; the [[California Coastal Commission|Coastal Commission]] held hearings, but then the legislation was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;Baine, Mark. “Short Communication: The North Sea Rigs-to-Reef debate,” Journal of Marine Science 59 (2002): S277-S280.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the RTR successes in the Gulf of Mexico and Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;Ranjith, M.W.; De Silva, N., “The Coastal Resources Management Program in Brunei Darussalam. Ocean and Coastal Management 38 (1998) 147-160&lt;/ref&gt; differences in terrain, government entities, and concerned citizens generated conflict.

===Fisheries===
Some point out that the title “Rigs to Reefs” is somewhat of a misnomer. As Milton Love, a biologist with the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute noted, the oil production platforms are not just potential artificial reefs: "They are in fact artificial reefs right now." The question to Rigs-to-Reef supporters is whether it is good public policy to remove established artificial reefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Ann Connell, [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/20/news/mn-48471 “Is Rigs-to-Reefs Best Plan for Oil Rigs?”], Los Angeles Times, 20 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 MMS report lists research that shows fish densities 20 to 50 times higher around oil and gas platforms than in nearby open water.&lt;ref name=Dauterive/&gt; [[Scientific diving|Divers]] assess [[fish]] populations surrounding platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=SA Cox |author2=CR Beaver |author3=QR Dokken |author4=JR Rooker.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Diver-based under water survey techniques used to assess fish populations and fouling community development on offshore oil and gas platform structures. |journal=In: MA Lang, CC Baldwin (Eds.) the Diving for Science…1996, "Methods and Techniques of Underwater Research". |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=16th Annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1996 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4689 |accessdate=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report encourages recreational fisherman, divers and others who benefit from the increased density. Opponents claim that the greater density comes from an influx of nearby fish rather than increased total population.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; Research on rockfish populations on oil rigs offshore California supports both theories.&lt;ref name=Love/&gt;

The high fish populations make both active and inactive oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California popular destinations for sport fishermen and the charter fishing industry.&lt;ref&gt;Voodoo Fishing Charters, [http://www.outerlimitcharters.com/Fishing-Rig-Fishing.htm Offshore rig fishing in Louisiana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919135341/http://www.outerlimitcharters.com/Fishing-Rig-Fishing.htm |date=19 September 2013 }}, accessed 6 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Venice Outdoors, [http://www.veniceoutdoors.com/offshore-fishing/fishing-offshore-oil-platforms Oil rigs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725050718/http://www.veniceoutdoors.com/offshore-fishing/fishing-offshore-oil-platforms |date=25 July 2013 }}, accessed 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of aquatic life on and near the platforms attracts recreational divers.&lt;ref&gt;Channel Island Adventures, [http://channelislandsdiveadventures.com/dive-spots/oil-rigs/ Oil rigs], accessed 6 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups tend to support Rigs-to-Reefs, and fear the loss of coral and fish habitat if the oil platforms are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Gaskill, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/us/a-fight-to-convert-high-island-a-platform-into-a-reef.html?_r=1&amp; "In Its First Life, an Oil Platform; in Its Next, a Reef?"], ''New York Times'', 17 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial fishing for [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]] in the Gulf of Mexico is seen as highly dependent on oil platform habitat, which provides a hard substrate for aquatic life that is otherwise scarce in much of the Gulf. Dr. Bob Shipp, chairman of the [[University of South Alabama]] Department of Marine Sciences, and director of the Alabama Center for Estuarine Studies, would like to see 100 percent participation in Rigs-to-Reefs, and said of removing unused oil rigs from the Gulf: “As a fisheries scientist, I think it’s a very big mistake,” He elaborated:

:“(The rigs) are all essential habitat really, from the mouth of the (Mississippi) River to (South) Padre Island, snapper are totally reliant upon artificial structure. Before the 1940s, when those rigs started going in, there was practically no snapper in the northwest Gulf. Now, more than half of the catch is from that area.”&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Fisher, [http://www.louisianasportsman.com/details.php?id=4849 "359 rigs slated for decommissioning, leading scientist says action is detrimental to red snapper plan"], ''The Louisiana Sportsman'', Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those commercial fisherman who [[trawl]] generally oppose Rigs-to-Reefs because their nets may snag a rig, creating a hazardous situation. This is particularly the case in offshore California with [[bottom trawling]] commercial fishermen, who can foul their nets on the shell mounds that build up on the sea floor near the rig.&lt;ref name=CDNN&gt;[http://www.cdnn.info/news/article/a010927.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719195504/http://www.cdnn.info/news/article/a010927.html |date=19 July 2008 }} CDNN-"California Rigs to Reefs Battle Creates Strange Alliances"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- CDNN has been accused of making up new stories in the past or outright copyright violations. Please check for source. Google "CDNN copyright" --&gt; Several fisherman have reported tangling their nets on submerged rigs.&lt;ref name=Watchdog/&gt;

===Liability===
Navigational mishaps and diving accidents may also occur around an artificial reef. Gulf of Mexico Rigs-to-Reefs participants have not yet reported any liability problems.&lt;ref name=CDNN/&gt;

Rigs-to-Reefs was first explored in 1979 when the first oil rig was transported from Louisiana to a Florida site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/offshore/egom/rigsreef.html] Minerals Management Service: History of Rigs to Reefs offshore Florida&lt;/ref&gt; This rig was the first of 5 Rigs-to-Reefs towed to Florida's coast. Louisiana was the first state to develop a program that allowed transfer of liability and ownership from the operator to the state.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; Texas later followed this example. Rigs-to-Reef is now the core of both Louisiana and Texas' artificial reef programs.&lt;ref name="wlf.louisiana.gov"/&gt;

Under the original guidelines, the Minerals Management Service would not release an operator from liability unless another entity accepts ongoing liability for the rig.&lt;ref name=Dauterive/&gt; If the reef is in state waters, the state typically accepts liability. In federal waters, liability typically goes to a private entity or to another MMS-approved agency.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt; Critics claim that the primary reason that operators support RTR is their desire to offload decommissioning costs and liability.&lt;ref name=Issues/&gt; In 2001, the California legislature passed, although the governor then vetoed, a bill that would allow operators to transfer liability to another entity, while retaining liability for any pollution from the underlying well.&lt;ref name=Issues/&gt;

Under the new policy issued June 2013, oil platforms in the Rigs-to-Reefs program must be deeded, and liability accepted by, the state government.&lt;ref name="Interim policy document"/&gt;

===Environmental groups===
As with [[cap-and-trade]] and [[ecotourism]], RTR attempts to enlist the private sector in helping the environment. To many environmentalists, any program which benefits the oil industry, by lower decommissioning costs, is suspect. Some charge that rigs-to-reefs is an excuse for [[ocean dumping]]. Environmental groups have long opposed oil companies and frame their critique around distrust of the industry, particularly with regard to Rigs-to-Reefs in offshore California.&lt;ref name=Rothbach/&gt; "No other industry is allowed to leave a toxic mess for the state to manage and maintain at taxpayer expense" said Linda Krop, Chief council for the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center.&lt;ref name=CDNN/&gt;

The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] supports Rigs-to-Reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, as a way to preserve the existing reef habitat of the oil platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Sterne, [http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/04/24/edf-stands-with-fishermen-in-calling-for-suspension-of-rig-removal-policy/ "EDF stands with fishermen in calling for suspension of rig removal policy"], ''EDF Oceans'', 24 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Guppy''', née '''Beach''' (1770 – 24 August 1852) was an English inventor who developed a number of domestic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dresser|first1=Madge|title=Guppy, Sarah (bap. 1770, d. 1852|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=April 2016|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/109112|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/109112|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of an erroneous entry in the ONDB in 2016, Guppy has in recent times been incorrectly credited with the design of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. She designed and patented her own chain bridge in 1811 (before the announcement of the first competition for a bridge across the Avon Gorge) but this design was never realised. &lt;ref name="Cork"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cork|first1=Tristan|title=Recognition at last for the mum-of-six who designed Bristol's Clifton Suspension Bridge - not Brunel|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Recognition-mum-designed-Bristol-s-Clifton/story-29325251-detail/story.html|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=Bristol Post|date=27 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528144235/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Recognition-mum-designed-Bristol-s-Clifton/story-29325251-detail/story.html|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel’s winning design for a bridge across the Avon Gorge differed from Guppy's patent in several significant ways: it had a deck suspended from flat wrought iron bar links rather than resting on top of chains like Guppy's; and it did not feature riverbed foundations (a key component of Guppy's design) as it was constructed 75 metres above high tide where the piers were not at risk of damage from water erosion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Sarah Guppy Design the Clifton Suspension Bridge?|url=https://www.cliftonbridge.org.uk/did-sarah-guppy-design-clifton-suspension-bridge/|publisher=Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and inventions==

Sarah Maria Beach was born in [[Birmingham]], England, and baptised in November 1770.  She married Samuel Guppy in 1795. In 1811 she patented the first of her inventions, a method of making safe piling for bridges. [[Thomas Telford]] asked her for permission to use her patented design for suspension bridge foundations, and she granted it to him free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rendell|first1=Mike|title=Sarah Guppy, Eclectic English Inventor|url=http://www.amazingwomeninhistory.com/sarah-guppy-eclectic-english-inventor/|publisher=Amazing women in History|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a friend of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] and his family she became involved in the [[Great Western Railway]], writing to the directors with ideas and giving her support. In 1841 she wrote a letter recommending planting [[willow]]s and [[Populus|poplars]] to stabilise [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s. She continued to offer technical advice despite the fact that, as she wrote, "it is unpleasant to speak of oneself—it may seem boastful particularly in a woman."&lt;ref&gt;PRO RAIL 1014/8/7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents and publications==

The family took out 10 patents in the first half of the nineteenth century, including a method of keeping ships free of [[barnacle]]s that led to a government contract worth £40,000. Other inventions included a bed with built-in exercise equipment, a device for a tea or [[coffee urn]] which would cook eggs in the steam as well as having a small dish to keep toast warm and a device for "improvements in [[caulking]] ships, boats and other vessels." In later life she wrote ''[[The Cottagers and Labourers Friend]]'' and ''[[Dialogues for Children]]'', invented the [[Exhaust hood|fire hood]] or Cook's Comforter, and patented a new type of [[candlestick]] that enabled candles to burn longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2290950/One-Hundred-Key-Facts-on-the-Bristol-City-region-and-Science One Hundred Key Facts on the Bristol City – region and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openplaques.org/plaques/932 Plaque #932 – Open Plaques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==

After marrying [[Bristol]] merchant Samuel Guppy they lived in [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] and Prince Street,&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Record Office BCC/F/E/3285, BCC/F/E/3140&lt;/ref&gt; a leading light of the Bristol and [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] social scene. The couple had six children, including Thomas Richard, who with older brother Samuel operated the Friars Sugar Refinery in Bristol (1826–42) before becoming an engineer and associate of Brunel, contributing significantly to the design of [[SS Great Western|SS ''Great Western'']] and [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']]. Brunel painted a portrait of the younger Sarah Guppy c. 1836.&lt;ref&gt;''Brunel: 'In Love with the Impossible{{'}}'' {{ISBN|978-0955074202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

In 1837 the widowed Sarah, now 67, married Richard Eyre Coote, 28 years her junior. For a while they lived at [[Arnos Court]], [[Brislington]], but Richard ran through his rich wife's money at a rapid rate, spending on horses and neglecting her. Sarah moved into 7 [[Richmond Hill, Clifton]], in 1842. She bought the land opposite the house for the benefit of Clifton residents and it still remains green space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2006/03/28/showstrength_feature.shtml BBC – Bristol – Entertainment – Shows of strength]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Showco''' was a sound equipment provider of touring sound reinforcement equipment and services to the concert touring industry. It was based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States. In 2000, Showco was acquired by [[Clair Global]].

Showco was established in 1970 by Jack Maxson and Rusty Brutsche, and Jack Calmes, and is known for helping to pioneer post [[Woodstock]]-era [[arena rock|stadium rock]] shows by providing state-of-the-art sound equipment for famous acts beginning with [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Three Dog Night]] and [[James Taylor]].&lt;ref name=Showco&gt;{{cite journal |title=Showco Marks 30th Anniversary; Concert Sound Pioneer Set the Stage for Concert Touring Industry |journal=Business Wire  |date=March 2, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_March_2/ai_59702713 |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brutsche:

{{cquote|We were one of the first to realize the amount and scale of equipment that the major arena concerts required. Jack [Maxson] was a recording engineer and I was a musician. We learned that most public address systems were built for the amplification of a single announcer over crowd noise. The dynamics of live music and the power required to generate the sounds we hear at concerts today were almost unthinkable at that time.&lt;ref name="Showco" /&gt;}}

With Showco equipment and services, the star performers could count on reliable and consistent sound reproduction at different venues. Showco introduced such features as mixing gear and stage monitors to aid the musicians. The equipment was also built to handle rugged touring schedules, outdoor weather conditions and quick assembly and disassembly.&lt;ref name="Showco" /&gt;

Later forays into [[stage lighting]] led to the 1981 formation of sister company [[Vari-Lite]], Inc.&lt;ref name="Showco" /&gt;

The list of artists that Showco has provided equipment for is extensive, including [[Jesus Christ Superstar]]; [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]]; [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]; [[Lee Michaels]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]]; the Osmonds; [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]; [[Cat Stevens]]; [[David Cassidy]]; [[Little Feat]]; [[The Band]]; [[Wishbone Ash]]; [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]; [[Eric Clapton]]; [[Leon Russell]]; [[Linda Ronstadt]]; [[Carole King]]; [[Jackson Browne]]; [[The Kinks]]; [[Commodores]]; [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]]; [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]; [[The Average White Band]]; [[Black Oak Arkansas]]; [[Thin Lizzy]]; [[Golden Earring]]; [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]; [[The Moody Blues]]; [[Yoko Ono]]; [[REO Speedwagon]]; [[Ted Nugent]]; [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]; [[Willie Nelson]]; [[the Beach Boys]]; [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]; [[Bad Company]]; [[Freddie King]]; [[Alice Cooper]]; [[Van Halen]]; [[Peter Gabriel]]; [[ZZ Top]]; [[Bee Gees]]; [[Wings (band)|Wings]]; [[Paul McCartney]]; [[The Rolling Stones]]; [[David Bowie]]; [[The Who]]; [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]; [[Julian Lennon]]; [[Bob Seger]]; [[Diana Ross]]; [[Janet Jackson]]; [[Reba McEntire]]; [[Vince Gill]]; [[Alan Jackson]]; [[Clint Black]]; [[George Michael]]; [[INXS]]; [[Phil Collins]]; [[Mick Jagger]]; [[Boston (band)|Boston]]; [[Santana (band)|Santana]]; [[Bon Jovi]]; [[Guns N' Roses]]; [[Britney Spears]]; [['N Sync]]; [[Ozzy Osbourne]] &amp; [[Ozzfest]]; [[Korn]]; [[Limp Bizkit]].&lt;ref name=Reunion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Short |first=Chari |title=Showco Reunion |journal=Total Production US |date=May 2005 |url=http://www.totalproductionus.com/sitefiles/May05_showco.htm |accessdate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828230555/http://www.totalproductionus.com/SiteFiles/May05_showco.htm |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by Clair Brothers in 2000==
Showco was acquired by [[Clair Brothers (Audio)|Clair Brothers]] in late 2000.  Showco was merged into the touring arm of Clair Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_current_2/ Current], mixonline.com. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024124127/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_current_2/ |date=2006-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined division was then renamed ClairShowco.  In 2008 the name was changed once again to '''[[Clair Global|Clair]]''' and given the corporate tagline "Global Service and Live Shows Since 1966."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundnetwork.com/article/ClairShowco-Rebranded-As-Clair/8396 ClairShowco Rebranded As Clair], www.prosoundnetwork.com. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909022215/http://www.prosoundnetwork.com/article/ClairShowco-Rebranded-As-Clair/8396 |date=2015-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6563">{{About|the artificial intelligence initiative of 1983–1993|the exascale computing initiative started in 2015|National Strategic Computing Initiative}}

The [[United States]] government's  '''Strategic Computing Initiative''' funded research into advanced computer hardware and [[artificial intelligence]] from 1983 to 1993. The initiative was designed to support various projects that were required to develop machine intelligence in a prescribed ten-year time frame, from [[integrated circuit|chip design and manufacture]], [[computer architecture]] to [[artificial intelligence]] software. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spent a total of $1 billion on the project.{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=2}}

The inspiration for the program was Japan's [[fifth generation computer]] project, an enormous initiative that set aside billions for research into computing and artificial intelligence. As with [[Sputnik]] in 1959, the American government saw the Japanese project as a challenge to its technological dominance.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=426–429}} The British government also funded a program of their own around the same time, known as [[Alvey]], and a consortium of U.S. companies funded another similar project, the [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]].{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=240}}{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}

The goal of SCI, and other contemporary projects, was nothing less than full machine intelligence. "The machine envisioned by SC", according to Alex Roland and Philip Shiman, "would run ten billion instructions per second to see, hear, speak, and think like a human. The degree of integration required would rival that achieved by the human brain, the most complex instrument known to man."{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=4}}

The initiative was conceived as an integrated program, similar to the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon program]],{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=4}}  where different subsystems would be created by various companies and academic projects and eventually brought together into a single integrated system. Roland and Shiman wrote that "While most research programs entail tactics or strategy, SC boasted grand strategy, a master plan for an entire campaign."{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=2}}

The project was funded by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] and directed by the [[Information Processing Technology Office]] (IPTO). By 1985 it had spent $100 million, and 92 projects were underway at 60 institutions: half in industry, half in universities and government labs.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=426–429}} [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]], who directed IPTO in those years, provided the project with its early leadership and inspiration.{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=7}} Clint Kelly managed the SC Initiative for three years and developed many of the specific application programs for DARPA, such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48449800|title=Strategic computing : DARPA and the quest for machine intelligence, 1983-1993|last=1944-|first=Roland, Alex,|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|others=Shiman, Philip.|isbn=0262182262|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=48449800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, it became apparent that the project would not succeed in creating machine intelligence at the levels that had been hoped for. Insiders in the program cited problems in communication, organization, and integration.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=430–431}} When Jack Schwarz ascended to the leadership of IPTO in 1987, he cut funding to [[artificial intelligence]] research (the software component) "deeply and brutally", "eviscerating" the program (wrote [[Pamela McCorduck]]).{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=430–431}} Schwarz felt that DARPA should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise. In his words, DARPA should "surf", rather than "dog paddle", and he felt strongly AI was not "the next wave".{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=430–431}}

Although the program failed to meet its goal of high-level machine intelligence,{{sfn|Roland|Shiman|2002|p=2}} it did meet some of its specific technical objectives, for example those of autonomous land navigation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/ALV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The Autonomous Land Vehicle program and its sister [[Navlab]] project at Carnegie Mellon University, in particular, laid the scientific and technical foundation for many of the driverless vehicle programs that came after it, such as the Demo II and III programs (ALV being Demo I), Perceptor, and the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56118249|title=Technology development for Army unmanned ground vehicles|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.)|isbn=0309503655|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=56118249}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The use of video cameras plus laser scanners and inertial navigation units pioneered by the SCI ALV program form the basis of almost all commercial [[Autonomous car|driverless car]] developments today. It also helped to advance the state of the art of computer hardware to a considerable degree. On the software side, the initiative funded development of the [[Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool]], a program that handled [[logistics]] using [[artificial intelligence]] techniques. This was a huge success, saving the Department of Defense billions during [[Desert Storm]].{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}

The project was superseded in the 1990s by the [[Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative]] and then by the [[Advanced Simulation and Computing Program]]. These later programs did not include artificial general intelligence as a goal, but instead focused on [[supercomputing]] for large scale simulation, such as [[atomic bomb]] simulations. The Strategic Computing Initiative of the 1980s is distinct from the 2015 [[National Strategic Computing Initiative]] -- the two are unrelated.

[[File:Pitchfork in July 2006.jpg|thumb|A three-tine pitchfork]]

'''Tines''' or '''prongs''' or '''teeth''' are parallel or branching spikes forming parts of a tool or natural object.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Tine, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used to spear, hook, move or otherwise act on other objects. They may be made of metal, wood, bone or other hard, strong materials.

The number of tines (also written tynes) on tools varies widely &amp;ndash; a [[pitchfork]] may have just two, a [[garden fork]] may have four, and a [[Rake (tool)|rake]] or [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]] many. Tines may be blunt, such as those on a [[fork]] used as an eating utensil; or sharp, as on a [[pitchfork]]; or even barbed, as on a [[trident]]. The terms "tine" and "prong" are mostly interchangeable. A tooth of a comb is a tine.

Tines and prongs occur in nature—for example, forming the branched bony [[antler]]s of [[deer]] or the forked [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s of [[pronghorn]] antelopes. The term "tine" is also used for mountains, such as the fictional [[Silvertine]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

In [[chaos theory]] ([[physics]], [[non-linear dynamics]]), the branches of a [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] diagram are called ''tines'' and ''subtines''.

[[File:20060513 toolbox.jpg|250px|thumb|A modern [[toolbox]]]]

A '''tool''' is an object of whatever relatively simple construction is necessary for its user to hold and operate easily to perform a simple task (like moving, lifting, breaking, holding, turning, bending) not as effectively performed or not possible, safe, or desirable to perform using a bodily member alone.  Although many animals use [[tool use by animals|simple tools]], only human beings, whose use of [[stone tool]]s dates back [[Paleolithic|hundreds of millennia]], use tools to make other tools.  The set of tools needed to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or [[equipment]].

While one may apply the term ''tool'' loosely to many things that are means to an end (e.g., a [[fork]]), strictly speaking an object is a tool only if, besides being constructed to be held, it is also made of a material that allows its user to apply to it various degrees of force. If repeated use wears part of the tool ''down'' (like a knife blade), it may be possible to restore it; if it wears the tool ''out'' or breaks it, the tool must be replaced.   Thus ''tool'' falls under the  taxonomic category ''implement'', and is on the same taxonomic rank as ''[[wikt:instrument|instrument]]'', ''[[wikt:utensil|utensil]]'', ''[[wikt:Special:Search/device|device]]'', or ware.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] believe that the use of tools was an important step in the [[human evolution|evolution of mankind]].&lt;ref name=lilley&gt;Sam Lilley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj0EAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tools+history&amp;dq=tools+history&amp;pgis=1 Men, Machines and History: The Story of Tools and Machines in Relation to Social Progress]'', 1948 Cobbett Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because tools are used extensively by both humans and wild [[chimpanzee]]s, it is widely assumed that the first routine use of tools took place prior to the divergence between the two species.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A., J. Goodall, W.C. McGrew, T. Nishida, V. Reynolds, Y. Sugiyama, C.E.G. Tutin, R.W. Wrangham, and C. Boesch. 1999. Cultures in Chimpanzees. ''Nature'' 399:682—85. Panger, M.A., A.S. Brooks, B.G. Richmond, and B. Wood. 2002. Older than the Oldowan? Rethinking the emergence of hominin tool use. ''Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews'' 11:235–45.&lt;/ref&gt; These early tools, however, were likely made of perishable materials such as sticks, or consisted of unmodified stones that cannot be distinguished from other stones as tools.

Stone artifacts only date back to about 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="encylopediahumanevolution"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution |editors=Jones, S., Martin, R. &amp; Pilbeam, D. |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-32370-3}} Also {{ISBN|0-521-46786-1}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2010 study suggests the [[hominin]] species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements. This finding pushes back the earliest known use of stone tools among hominins to about 3.4 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature09248 |volume=466 |issue=7308 |pages=857–60 |last=McPherron |pmid=20703305 |first=Shannon P. |author2=Zeresenay Alemseged |author3=Curtis W.

Finds of actual tools date back at least 2.6 million years in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Semaw, S., M.J. Rogers, J. Quade, P.R. Renne, R.F. Butler, M. Domínguez-Rodrigo, D. Stout, W.S. Hart, T.

''Journal of Human Evolution'' 45:169–77.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest distinguishable stone tool forms is the [[hand axe]].

Up until recently, weapons found in digs were the only tools of “early man” that were studied and given importance. Now, more tools are recognized as culturally and historically relevant. As well as hunting, other activities required tools such as preparing food, “…nutting, leatherworking, grain harvesting and woodworking…” Included in this group are “flake stone tools".

Tools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the [[food chain]]; by inventing tools, they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not, such as using a [[spear]] or [[archery|bow and arrow]] to kill prey, since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals' skins. “Man the hunter” as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned. Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites, it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators' carcasses rather than killing their own food.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Bob |title=Man's early hunting role in doubt |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3222-mans-early-hunting-role-in-doubt.html |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mechanics|Mechanical]] devices experienced a major expansion in their use in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] with the systematic employment of new energy sources, especially [[waterwheel]]s. Their use expanded through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] with the addition of [[windmill]]s.

[[Machine tool]]s occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the [[industrial revolution]]. Advocates of [[nanotechnology]] expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003855/http://www.forbes.com/2004/01/28/cx_dw_0129pollnanotechmidas04_xyz.html Nanotechnology: Big Potential In Tiny Particles], David Whelan.

==Functions==
One can classify tools according to their basic functions:
* Cutting and edge tools, such as the [[knife]], [[scythe]] or [[sickle]], are wedge-shaped implements that produce a [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along a narrow face. Ideally, the edge of the tool needs to be [[Hardness|harder]] than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use. But even resilient tools will require periodic [[sharpening]], which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge. Other examples of cutting tools include [[Chisel#Gouge|gouges]] and [[drill bit]]s.
* Moving tools move large and tiny items. Many are [[lever]]s which give the user a [[mechanical advantage]]. Examples of force-concentrating tools include the [[hammer]] which moves a nail or the [[Post maul|maul]] which moves a stake. These operate by applying [[compression (physical)|physical compression]] to a surface. In the case of the [[screwdriver]], the force is rotational and called [[torque]]. By contrast, an [[anvil]] concentrates force on an object being hammered by ''preventing'' it from moving away when struck.  [[Writing implement]]s deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge. Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with [[pliers]], a glove, a [[wrench]], etc. likewise move items by some kind of force.
* Tools that enact chemical changes, including temperature and ignition, such as [[lighter]]s and [[blowtorch]]es.
* Guiding, measuring and perception tools include the [[ruler]], [[glasses]], [[set square]], [[sensor]]s, [[straightedge]], [[theodolite]], [[microscope]], [[Computer monitor|monitor]], [[clock]], phone, [[printer (computing)|printer]]
* Shaping tools, such as [[Molding (process)|molds]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[trowel]]s.
* Fastening tools, such as [[welder]]s, [[rivet gun]]s, [[nail gun]]s, or [[glue gun]]s.
* Information and data manipulation tools, such as computers, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[spreadsheet]]s

Some tools may be combinations of other tools. An alarm-clock is for example a combination of a measuring tool (the clock) and a perception tool (the alarm). This enables the alarm-clock to be a tool that falls outside of all the categories mentioned above.

There is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work.  [[Personal protective equipment]] includes such items as gloves, [[safety glasses]], [[earplug|ear defenders]] and [[biohazard]] suits.

===Tool substitution===
Often, by design or coincidence, a tool may share key functional attributes with one or more other tools. In this case, some tools can substitute for other tools, either as a makeshift solution or as a matter of practical efficiency. "One tool does it all" is a motto of some importance for workers who cannot practically carry every specialized tool to the location of every work task; such as a carpenter who does not necessarily work in a shop all day and needs to do jobs in a customer's house. Tool substitution may be divided broadly into two classes: substitution "by-design", or "multi-purpose", and substitution as makeshift. Substitution "by-design" would be tools that are designed specifically to accomplish multiple tasks using only that one tool.

Substitution as makeshift is when human ingenuity comes into play and a tool is used for its unintended purpose such as a mechanic using a long screw driver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. As an example of the former, many wood-cutting [[hand saws]] integrate a [[carpenter's square]] by incorporating a specially shaped handle that allows 90° and 45° angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying "All tools can be used as hammers." Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though very few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.

Tools are also often used to substitute for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices.  In many cases a cheap tool could be used to occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could easily be replaced with a pair of [[Locking pliers|vise-grips]] or regular [[pliers]]. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screw-driver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a [[rotary tool]] would be considered the substitution "by-design", or "multi-purpose". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. "Multi-purpose" tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so you could say that a power drill is a "multi-purpose" tool because you can do more than just one thing with a power drill.

===Multi-use tools===
[[File:Bicycle multi-tool.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Bicycle multi-tool]]

A [[multi-tool]] is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the [[Swiss army knife]] represents one of the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality – for example, [[lineman's pliers]] incorporate a gripper and cutter, and are often used as a hammer; and some [[hand saw]]s incorporate a [[Set square|carpenter's square]] in the right-angle between the blade's dull edge and the saw's handle. This would also be the category of "multi-purpose" tools, since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably – compare [[hand axe]]). These types of tools were specifically made{{by whom|date=September 2018}} to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, in that their space would be limited to the vehicle or to the beast of burden they were driving. Multi-use tools solve the problem of having to deal with many different tools.

==Use by other animals==

{{Main|Tool use by animals}}

Observation has confirmed that [[Tool use by animals|a number of species can use tools]] including [[monkey]]s, [[ape]]s, elephants, several birds, and [[sea otter]]s. Philosophers originally thought that only humans had the ability to ''make'' tools, until [[zoologist]]s observed birds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/3330gpu0w5tb7alc/fulltext.html/ Selection of tool diameter by New Caledonian crows ''Corvus moneduloides''], Jackie Chappell and Alex Kacelnik November 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and apes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://williamcalvin.com/bk2/bk2ch3.htm |title=The Throwing Madonna: Essays on the Brain |last=Calvin |first=William H |ref=refCalvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers |name=Chimp Minds |credits=Host: [[Alan Alda]] |network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |airdate=02-09-2005 |season=15 |episode=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollinghillswildlife.com/animals/c/chimpanzee/ |title=Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure: Chimpanzee |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523173500/http://www.rollinghillswildlife.com/animals/c/chimpanzee/ |archivedate=2016-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making tools. Now the unique relationship of humans with tools is considered to be that we are the only species that uses tools to make ''other'' tools.&lt;ref name="CooperRobertson1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjorklund |first1=David F. |last2=Bering |first2=Jesse M. |editor=Cooper, Cary L. |others=Robertson, Ivan T. |title=International review of industrial and organizational psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jd8d-i13CnUC |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jd8d-i13CnUC&amp;pg=PA113 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |date=5 June 1997 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-96111-6 |page=113 |chapter=Big brains, slow development and social complexity:The development and evolutionary origins of social cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool metaphors==
A telephone is a communication tool that interfaces between two people engaged in conversation at one level. It also interfaces between each user and the communication network at another level. It is in the domain of media and communications technology that a counter-intuitive aspect of our relationships with our tools first began to gain popular recognition. [[Marshall McLuhan]] famously said "We shape our tools. And then our tools shape us." McLuhan was referring to the fact that our social practices co-evolve with our use of new tools and the refinements we make to existing tools.

'''VHPready''' (abbreviation for '''V'''irtual '''H'''eat and '''P'''ower '''Ready''') is an open industry standard for the control of decentralised power generation plants, consumers and energy storage systems via a central control centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2018|website=VHPready|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform use of this standard enables the flexible connection of decentralized power plants to [[Virtual power plant|virtual power plants]] and [[Smart grid|Smart Grid]] applications.

VHPready was originally developed by Vattenfall on the basis of international communication standards and was initially used to network its own plants. At the beginning of 2014, Vattenfall handed over the standard with all rights to the Industrieforum VHPready e. V., which had been significantly prepared by the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems]] (FOKUS) and took over the further development and dissemination as an international industry standard.

== Background==
In the wake of the energy revolution, decentralised power generation plants such as [[Wind power|wind power plants]], [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] plants, [[biogas]] plants, small hydropower plants and mini or micro [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power]] plants, as well as controllable [[Consumers Energy|consumers]] and [[energy storage]] systems, are becoming increasingly important. One approach to integrating them into the energy supply and exploiting synergies is to interconnect these decentralised plants to form [[Virtual power plant|virtual power plants]]. These can help to intelligently orchestrate and reconcile consumption and generation, which should lead to better integration of renewable energies and decentralised plants, a reduction in the maximum load on the grids and cost advantages for market participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060018601|title=Germany adds 'virtual power plants' to experiments with its grid|last=Marx|first=Eric|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intelligent power grid (see [[Smart grid|Smart Grid]]) plays a key role in this. Various price mechanisms, some of which are already in use today (see [[Operating reserve|standard power]]), can serve as an incentive for providing this so-called flexibility.

Up to now, the connection of the plants has been carried out by manufacturer-specific information and communication standards using different data models. With the aid of an open industry standard and certification of the decentralised plants, the process for connection and pre-qualification is to be facilitated and shortened.

== History==
'''2011'''

* Vattenfall develops the standard on the basis of international communication standards, initially to network its own plants.

'''2012'''

* Vattenfall releases version 3.0 of the VHPready specification

'''2013'''

* Due to the interest in the specification, it was decided to develop an open industry standard for general use.

'''2014'''

* Foundation of the Industrieforum VHPready e.V. as a competition-neutral and cross-sector platform for the further development of the standard and the certification of standard-compliant plant components.
* Vattenfall hands over the standard with all results and rights to the industrial forum VHPready e. V.

'''2015'''

* Publication of the white paper of the specification VHPready 4.0, developed by the members.
* Foundation of VHPready Services GmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/press/archive/article/industry-alliance-vhpready-ev-establishes-service-company-1/|title=Industry Alliance VHPready e.V. establishes service company|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2015|website=VHPready|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is responsible for the implementation and international dissemination of the standard.

'''2017'''

* Publication of the specification VHPready 4.0 at the E-world energy &amp; water

== Scope and certification ==
VHPready comprises different requirements regarding system configuration as well as necessary control and measuring elements. Supported plant types range from power generation plants to energy storage units and consumers. 

Certification is carried out by VHPready Services GmbH and accredited testing laboratories. After receipt of an application for the VHPready certificate, testing laboratories are commissioned to test the respective systems on the basis of the technical requirements. 

The process is divided into two stages: first, the systems are tested against specifications by means of conformity tests. They begin with the static testing of the properties specified by the manufacturer. This is followed by the verification of the dynamic properties, i.e. tests under controlled conditions. In the second stage, end-to-end tests are carried out using reference systems. After successful testing and acceptance of the test report by VHPready Services GmbH, the systems receive a product-related VHPready certificate. Changed products require recertification. 

== Technical details ==
In order to obtain the VHPready certificate, the plants must meet certain minimum requirements. These ensure that a technical connection to a [[virtual power plant]] runs smoothly. They concern, among other things, the connection protocols used, technical performance requirements, security of data transmission and types of commands to the plants. The focus is on data communication, remote monitoring and remote control of the equipment.

The current version of the specification is VHPready 4.0. The functional core of VHPready 4.0 is an extensive data point list. It supports the integration of different energy systems into [[Virtual power plant|virtual power plants]]. The telecontrol protocol [[IEC 60870-5-104]] or a modelling according to [[IEC 61850-7-420]] is used for this purpose. In addition to a plant park with a network of different energy systems, this data point list enables the integration of block-type thermal power stations ([[Combined Heat And Power|CHP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), wind power and solar plants, heat pumps, batteries, electric heaters, boiler and buffer storage. In addition, there are data points for meters and external signalling contacts.[8] The security of data transmission is guaranteed by the establishment of a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) based on [[OpenVPN]] with SSL/TLS connections ([[Secure Sockets Layer]], [[Transport Layer Security]]).[9]

An essential goal of VHPready is the definition of subsets or profiles of the standards used, so that only the profile has to be named during certification and project realization. Project-specific agreements on the details of the standards are thus largely eliminated. All tests for certification to the VHPready standard follow internationally standardized methods and techniques as defined by [[ISO/IEC]] and [[ETSI]].

== Members of Industry Alliance VHPready e.V. ==
Currently 47 member companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/members/|title=List of Members of Industry Alliance VHPready e.V.|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2018|website=VHPready|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are participating in the initiative for the integration and standardization of decentralized energy systems. Among the members are manufacturers of system components, providers of software and IT services, network operators, test service providers as well as companies from research and development.

The members of the Industry Alliance VHPready e.V. actively design all new application areas for new use cases of the VHPready specifications. In working groups the technical advancements of the industry standard are compiled together, application scenarios are developed, testing and certification processes are modeled as well as positions and strategies of the industry forum for the public work are conceived. The new development statuses are available to the member companies ahead of time. This allows them to test the VHPready communication in their products and in interaction with the systems of other member companies even before the publication of new applications, for example during a Plugfest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/press/article/1st-plugfest-of-the-industry-alliance-vhpready-ev-in-berlin-1/|title=Press Release "1st Plugfest of the Industry Alliance VHPready e.V. in Berlin"|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2018|website=VHPready|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zymo Research''' is a privately held American manufacturer of molecular biology research tools used for [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] research and analysis.  The company also supports [[epigenetics]] research, the field of medicine studying stable heritable traits that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence.

== History ==
Zymo Research Corporation was founded by Larry Jia in 1994. The company started its home base in [[Orange, California|Orange, CA]] in a garage, manufacturing products for DNA and RNA extraction and purification and other specialty products for [[E. coli]] and [[yeast]] based research. It expanded its product offerings to include tools for epigenetics research. In December 2010, the company relocated to [[Irvine, California|Irvine, CA]].

In 2009, Zymo Research Europe was established in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. It works as a distribution support hub for Europe and the Middle East and will also be initiating research and development programs at a new facility, intended for [[state-of-the-art]] researching.{{when|date=May 2017}}
