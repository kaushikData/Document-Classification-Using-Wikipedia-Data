The '''2010 Oklahoma political corruption investigation''' was a [[criminal investigation]] that focused on whether Oklahoma State Representative [[Randy Terrill]] (R-Moore), State Representative [[Mike Christian (politician)|Mike Christian]] (R-Oklahoma City), and State Senator [[Debbe Leftwich]] (D-Oklahoma City) engaged in [[political corruption]] involving the [[Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner|Office of the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner]].

==Background==
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) had suffered from a large backlog of cases due to a low number of physicians. In early 2010, the Board of Medicolegal Investigations, which is the governing body of OCME, placed Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Collie Trant, M.D., on [[administrative leave]] for undisclosed reasons. Within days, the Board terminated Dr. Trant.

Soon after Dr. Trants' termination, [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Brad Henry]] directed State Health Commissioner [[Terry Cline]] to review the operations of OCEM and make a report recommending both operational and statutory changes. In late March, Commissioner Cline released his report on OCME. In his report, Cline recommended both greater oversight authority on the part of the Medicolegal Investigations Board as well as restructuring the organization of OCME. Cline outline three models for possible reorganization but recommended the model that made the most sweeping changes. Under currently State law, the Chief Medical Examiner, who must be a licensed physician, is the executive head of OCME, responsible for all operations and administration of the agency. Cline recommended that State law be changed to establish a non-physician Administrator as head of OCME who would be responsible for all agency operations, with the position of Chief Medical Examiner overseeing all medical operations and reporting to the Administrator. Cline pointed to the [[Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services]] and the [[Oklahoma State Department of Health]] as examples of this model.

Following the release of Cline's report, [[President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate]] [[Glenn Coffee]] and [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]] [[Chris Benge]] proposed Senate Bill 738 which would have enacted many of Cline's recommendations, including the establishment of a Transition Coordinator. The Transition Cooridnator, as provided by SB738, was to oversee the transition of OCME from its current location in Oklahoma City to Edmond and received an annual salary of $80,000. SB738 passed the Senate 45-0 and passed House of Representatives 58-40. Following the passage of the bill, Democratic State Senator [[Debbe Leftwich]] announced that she would not seek reelection. On the same day, Republican State Representative [[Mike Christian (politician)|Mike Christian]] announced that he would seek Leftwich's seat.

Citing legislative misconduct, Governor Henry vetoed SB 738 on June 6 after being briefed by [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] [[District Attorney]] David Prater on his ongoing investigation over political corruption involving the legislation. Days later, DA Prater announced that he had launched a political corruption investigation of State Representative [[Randy Terrill]] (R-Moore), State Senator Leftwich and State Representative Christian over allegations that those legislators conspired to use SB738 to create a state job specifically for Senator Leftwich in OCME in exchange for her agreeing not to seek re-election. This, according to allegations, would make way for Representative Christian to fill her vacant Senate seat.

==Reaction==
*{{flagicon|United States}} The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks in a statement: "The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis. The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism."&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

The theatre stood on a plot of land 60 x 100 feet (20 x 30 meters). The façade was "plain and substantial, rather than ornamental."&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 /&gt; It was made of [[Philadelphia]] brick with trimmings of [[Nova Scotia]] stone.&lt;!-- granite, probably.--&gt;

The auditorium was 60 x 60 feet (20 x 20 m) with a parquet or orchestra circle, dress circle, and gallery. There were 12 proscenium boxes, six on each side of the stage.&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 /&gt; The stage was 34 x 60 feet and 52 feet to the girders. The proscenium was 26 feet wide and 24 feet to the top of the arch. The cost of the building (exclusive of the plot of land upon which it stood) was expected to be $100,000.&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 /&gt;

The color scheme in the auditorium was French gray, and gold, with lines of red for relief.&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 /&gt;

==History==
===Construction===
[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Henry E. Abbey TCS 1.6.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Henry Eugene Abbey|Henry E. Abbey]] in c1896 ]]

The New Park Theatre, designed by Frederic Draper, was built on the site of a previous theatre from May 1873 – March 1874 by [[Dion Boucicault]] and [[Edmund O'Flaherty|William Stuart]] at a cost of $100,000.&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 /&gt;{{sfn|Dimmick|1913|p=51}} They had previously been involved with the [[Winter Garden Theatre]], which Boucicault left in 1860 and was destroyed in March 1867 in a fire which almost cost Stuart his life.&lt;ref name=NYT_Fire &gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |date=24 March 1867 |page=1 |title=Total Destruction of the Winter Garden Theatre—Considerable Damage Occasioned to the Southern Hotel—Aggregate Loss about $250,000 |url=https://www.musicingotham.org/event/105970 |others=(hosted at Music in Gotham) |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I think this is wrong, probably the New Park Theatre at 1331 Broadway.   ...of [[William H. McElfatrick|J. B. McElfatrick and Son]], who were responsible for many theatres of improved design in New York City, Brooklyn and all over the US. Their offices were in the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Henry Abbey's Theatre]] building, later the Knickerbocker Theatre after 1896.{{sfn|Cahn|1898|p=53}} --&gt;

An advance description of the New Park appeared in the ''New York Times'' on 31 May 1872.&lt;ref name=NYT_26_Sep_73 &gt;{{cite news |title=The New Park Theatre |newspaper=New York Times |date=28 September 1873 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1873/09/28/archives/the-new-park-theatre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1872 Draper, the architect, put forward an enlarged design. This included buying an adjacent plot of land, whose rightful ownership was mired in litigation.&lt;ref name=NYT_26_Sep_73 /&gt;  The theatre was meant to open in October 1873 but a deadlock in litigation dragged on for so long that Boucicault and Stuart cancelled the opening. In the end another suitable plot came up for sale, and work progressed. The available artistes were re-engaged.&lt;ref name=NYT_26_Sep_73 /&gt; By the end of March 1874 the work was nearly complete.
&lt;ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 &gt;{{cite news |title=The New Park Theatre |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 March 1874 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1874/03/30/archives/the-new-park-theatre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening===
Boucicault had been announced to be interested in the management, but withdrew just before the theatre opened: and Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager [[Charles Fechter]] to run the house.&lt;ref name=NYT_Stuart_Obit &gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/12/29/103655189.pdf “Death of William Stuart”,] ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 29, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Park Theatre opened on 13 April{{sfn|Watermeier|2015|p=48}} or 15 April 1874{{sfn|Dimmick|1913|p=51}} with William Stuart as manager, and Fechter appearing in his own play ''Love's Penance'', an adaptation of ''Le médecin des enfants'' by Count d'Avrigny.{{sfn|Watermeier|2015|p=48}} [[Edwin Booth]], who had been with Stuart at the Winter Garden, was fairly scathing about the whole enterprise:

:"I should like to hear of Stuart's success – but I doubt it, for I fear Fechter is ''unlucky'', &amp; Stuart really possesses very little, if any theatrical business capacity. F's remarkable talents both as actor and as stage manager shd. ensure the success of any theatre – could ''he'' be managed; otherwise I doubts the safety of any enterprise he has to do with."{{sfn|Watermeier|2015|p=48}}&lt;ref&gt;Fechter was noted for an uncontrollable temper, and had left two or three other theatres after arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love's Penance'' closed on May 6, 1874, and shortly after Fechter withdrew from the management and retired. Stuart suffered financial embarrassments, and the theatre may have been shut down by the Sheriff on more than one occasion.&lt;ref name=IDBD &gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/theatre/abbeys-park-theatre-1642 Abbey's Park Theatre]. International Broadway Database. Retrieved 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The house remained closed until the fall of 1874, when [[John T. Raymond]] performed [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Colonel Sellers]]'' for 100 nights. This was followed by the Grau-Chizzola company in [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', and George Fawcett Rowe appeared in his own play ''Brass''.{{sfn|Fisher|2015|p=382}}&lt;ref name=NYT_Stuart_Obit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amusements: 'Brass' at the Park Theatre |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 February 1876 |url=http://article.archive.nytimes.com/1876/02/18/81682479.pdf |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season Stuart presented Mr. &amp; Mrs. [[William J. Florence]] in Benjamin E. Woolf's ''The Mighty Dollar'' which reached its 100th performance on 13 December 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf wrote the libretto for one of the first modern Broadway [[Musical theatre|musical]]s, ''The Doctor of Alacantra''.

===Henry E. Abbey===
In November 1876 [[Henry Eugene Abbey|Henry E. Abbey]] took over the management of the house and renamed the New Park Theatre to '''Abbey's Park Theatre'''.{{sfn|Dimmick|1913|p=}} Abbey was associated with [[John B. Schoeffel]], and later with [[Maurice Grau]] in the theatrical management partnership of [[Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau]].

The shows were light comedies and farces; and the theatre saw the beginning of the combination of [[Stuart Robson]] and  [[William Henry Crane|W. H. Crane]]. Acts like [[Helena Modjeska]], and Thomas W. Keene in Shakespeare (especially Richard III) performed there.

Abbey put on popular successes like ''[[Our Boarding House]]'', set in Chicago, by Leonard Grover, starring [[Stuart Robson]], [[William Henry Crane|W. H. Crane]] and [[William E. Sheridan]].&lt;ref&gt;His only stage success. Grover appeared in [[The Day of Days (film)]] (1914, lost).&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 29 January 1877 and played for 104 performances, running for at least eight weeks to March 1877.{{sfn|Fisher|2004|p=336}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Park Theatre |journal=The Stage |volume=XXIV |issue=44 |date= 23 March 1877 |url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mar-23-1877-Henry-Abbeys-PARK-THEATRE-NYC-Program-Playbill-OUR-BOARDING-HOUSE-/352092781499 |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Abbey's many artistes one of the biggest names was [[Lotta Crabtree|Lotta]], a light-comedy star. She was one of the highest-paid actress in America, earning sums of up to $5,000 per week.

Boucicault's ''Dot'', a dramatisation of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'' with [[John E. Owens]] played at the Park Theatre from 20 January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.archive.nytimes.com/1879/01/21/80743566.pdf "Park Theatre"].  ''New York Times'', 21 January 1879.

Performing Arts Archive. Retrieved 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This ad calls it "Abbey's (new) Park Theatre": [http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%207/New%20York%20NY%20Wilkes%20Spirit%20Of%20The%20Times/New%20York%20NY%20Spirit%20Of%20Times%201882%20Jan-Dec%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Spirit%20Of%20Times%201882%20Jan-Dec%20Grayscale%20-%200250.pdf "Amusements"]. ''Spirit of the Tines'', 8 April 1882, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction===
On one of his trips to Europe looking for new stars, Abbey saw [[Lilly Langtry]] perform in [[Edinburgh]], and offered her a season in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Lillie_Langtry_-_a_biography "Lillie Langtry – a biography"]. ''theislandwiki.org''. Retrieved 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Langtry's tour of the US was due to open at the Park Theatre on 30 October 1882, but during the day the building was completely demolished by fire and was never rebuilt.{{sfn|Dimmick|1913|p=51}}

The next day the papers implicated Langtry in the misfortune. They declared that the burning of the Park Theatre was the biggest and costliest advertisement ever designed to welcome a star to America's shores.{{sfn|Head|1970|p=11}} Langtry presented [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''An Unequal Match'' a week later to capacity houses at [[Wallack's Theatre]] instead.{{sfn|Head|1970|p=11}}

==Aftermath== 
With Abbey's theatre—and one main source of income—gone, he and Schoeffel invited [[Maurice Grau]] to join them in partnership.&lt;ref name=Sun_Obit &gt;{{cite news |title=Impresario Grau Is Dead |newspaper=The Sun |place=New York City |date=15 March 1907|p=9a |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1907-03-15/ed-1/seq-9/ }} [NB The article says (incorrectly) that his father was Hermann Grau, and not Emmanuel.]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatrical management firm of [[Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau]] went on to lease and manage the brand-new [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]] (the 'Old Met') for its opening season of 1883–4. It was a critical success but a financial disaster: Abbey as manager was personally responsible for losses of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herx |first=Stephen |title=Marcella Sembrich and Three Great Events at the Metropolitan |journal=Opera Quarterly |year=1999 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pp=49–71 |doi=10.1093/oq/15.1.49}}&amp;nbsp;(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
Soon after Abbey's Park Theatre burned down in October 1882, another New Park Theatre opened at 1331 Broadway in 1883. It was leased by [[David Belasco]], who survived the 1883-1884 season with a new version of his ''The Stranglers of Paris'', adapted form a story by [[Adolphe Belot]]. It played at his New Park Theatre on November 12, 1883. Belasco's adaptation of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (a '[[Tom show]]') probably also played there.{{sfn|Belasco|1925|pp=15, 18}} The New Park Theatre was renamed as the [[Herald Square Theatre]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.ibdb.com/venue.php?id=1199 "Herald Square Theatre"].

[[Barack Obama]] has appeared as a character in comic books published by a number of publishing companies, sometimes appearing as a realistic fictionalized version of himself and sometimes as a spoof.

==Publication history==
Obama made his first appearance as a comic book character in July 2007 in ''Licensable BearTM'' No. 4 by [[Nat Gertler]], where he appeared as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. The comic only had a print-run of 1,050 issues. A year later, in September 2008, Obama appeared in [[Erik Larsen]]’s ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' No. 137.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan V. |last=Last |title=It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's...

In November 2008, two things led to an explosion in popularity of the Obama comic book character. One of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' titled, "Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know." In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects "[[Spider-Man]] and [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then later that month, on November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.

When [[Marvel Comics]] discovered the president-elect was an avid collector of [[Spider-Man]] comics, they decided to have Obama the comic book character be put on the cover of their ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 583 (January 2009), for the story "[[Spidey Meets the President!]]" written by [[Zeb Wells]]. This particular release proved extremely popular and sold out in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Lining Up for Obama and Spider-Man|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/hundreds-brave-chill-for-obama-comic/?hp|accessdate=7 November 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the release, the edition was sold for $300 on [[eBay]]. Prior to the Spider-Man story, the president-elect was featured in Secret Invasion #8; this is the first appearance of president-elect Barack Obama in a Marvel comic.

Obama the comic book character has been put on the cover and pages of many other comics including ''Savage Dragon'' No. 145 (February 2008) by Erik Larsen and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' No. 8 (February 2008) by [[Rob Liefeld]]. The ''Savage Dragon'' No. 145 had a special edition variant only offered at the WonderCon 2009 in San Francisco in March 2009 (only 1,500 were produced). On the cover, Barack Obama can be seen holding an American flag and punching Osama Bin Laden in the face.

Barack Obama is the subject of graphic novel "Barack Hussein Obama" by [[Steven Weissman]]. In this, President Obama and his cast of characters (Secretary Clinton, VP Joe Biden, his family) experience life in a parallel universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Weissman |url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/barackhusseinobama |title=Barack Hussein Obama |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |isbn=978-1-60699-623-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barack Obama has also appeared in [[Archie Comics]] Veronica #199, and Archie #616 and #617.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/issue/418372/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicmix.com/news/2010/09/22/obama-and-palin-meet-archie-andrews/&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama was in the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] Storyline of DC comics of 2011. He discusses the earth members of The Green Lantern Corp with [[Amanda Waller]].

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
The first '''Battle of Ramla''' (or '''Ramleh''') took place on 7 September 1101 between the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[Fatimids]] of [[Egypt]]. The town of [[Ramla]] lay on the road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], the latter of which was the largest Fatimid fortress in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. It was thrice the case that the two armies met each other at Ramla. 

==Battle==
The Egyptians were led by Saad el-Dawleh, former governor of [[Beirut]], while the Crusaders were under the command of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|King Baldwin I]]. Baldwin had only 260 cavalry and 900 foot soldiers under his command, leaving him severely outnumbered by the Egyptian army, why was estimated at 32,000 men by [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and downgraded to 3,000–5,000 by modern historians.{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=39}} Upon sighting the Fatimid army Baldwin arrayed his forced in six divisions, commanding the reserve force himself.&lt;ref name="Asbridge"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |author=Thomas Asbridge |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24YvdweHYAhWmDsAKHZNzDUQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20asbridge%20the%20crusades&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-1-84983-688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial attack the first two Crusader divisions were wiped out while the vanguard took heavy casualties too, with [[Geldemar Carpenel|Geldemar Carpinel]] among the slain. The battle seemed to be lost but when the third division was pursued after being routed by the Egyptians, Baldwin ordered a counter-attack and committed his reserve. In vicious close-quarter combat, the Crusaders repulsed the Egyptian forces, who retreated in panic as rank after rank buckled under the force of Baldwin's attack. After pursuing the fleeing Fatimids to Ascalon, Baldwin returned to Ramla to plunder the Egyptian camp. This success secured the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Fatimid Caliphate's advances for the campaigning season. According to [[Fulcher of Chartres]], who was present at the battle, The Fatimids lost around 5,000 men in the battle including their general Saad al-Daulah.  However, Crusader losses were heavy too, losing 80 knights and a large amount of infantry.&lt;ref name="Asbridge" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The battle had so nearly been a defeat for the Crusaders, and while the Fatimid survivors fled to Ascalon the remnants of the vanguard that was crushed earlier in the battle themselves fled to [[Jaffa]]. So great was the confusion after the battle that around 500 Fatimid troops advanced to the walls of Jaffa, where survivors of the Latin vanguard informed Baldwin's wife [[Arda of Armenia|Arda]] that the king and all his men were dead. A letter was immediately sent north to [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]] to ask [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]], regent of Antioch in the place of [[Bohemond I of Antioch| Bohemond of Antioch]], for assistance. Jaffa did not immediately capitulate, and when Baldwin returned victorious the following day the remaining Egyptian forces quickly scattered.&lt;ref name="Asbridge" /&gt;. Ascalon remained in Fatimid hands, however, and a miscalculation would prove very costly to Baldwin when the two sides once again [[Battle of Ramla (1102)|met]] at Ramla the following year.

==Fatimid armies==
Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Except for the [[Battle of Ramla (1105)|third battle of Ramla in 1105]], when [[Toghtekin of Damascus]] sent a contingent of Turks to help the Egyptians, the Fatimids did not use horse archers. 

Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. "The Franks never, until the reign of [[Saladin]], feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

From review: " The exuberant chronicle of the exploits of Bowleg Bill, an eight-foot cowboy who rides herd on tuna fish and she-whales and he-whales, makes the most of two professions given to tall tales -- whaling and bronco-busting. The mixture of the jargon of the range and the poop-deck add to the incongruity of this beef-and-blubber comedy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/harold-w-felton-4/bowleg-bill-2/ A review] at [[Kirkus Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bregenzer Festspiele''' ({{IPA-de|ˌbreːɡɛntsɐ ˈfɛst.ʃpiːlə}}; '''Bregenz Festival''') is a performing arts festival which is held every July and August in [[Bregenz]], [[Austria]].

== Festival Basics ==
Founded in 1946, one year after World War II, the festival presents a wide variety of musical and theatrical events in several venues:

* '''''Seebühne''''' (or floating stage), with its 7,000 seat open-air [[amphitheatre]], is the location for large-scale [[opera]] or [[musical theater|musical]] performances on a stage over water on the shores of [[Lake Constance]]. 
:Opera or musical productions on the floating stage generally tend to come from the popular operatic repertoire, but often are extravagantly original and innovative productions/ stagings, frequently using the waters of the lake as an extension of the stage. Recent productions have included ''[[Aida]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in 2009 &amp; 2010; ''[[Tosca]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]] in 2007–2008; ''[[Il trovatore]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in 2005–2006; ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' by [[Leonard Bernstein]] in 2003-2004; ''[[La bohème]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]] in 2001–2002, and ''Ein Maskenball'' (''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'') by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in 1999–2000.
* '''''Festspielhaus''''' presents performances of rarely performed opera and concerts. 
* '''''Werkstattbühne''''' presents performances of contemporary theatre and opera.
* '''''Theater am Kornmarkt''''' presents [[operetta]] and drama performances.
* '''''shed8/Theater Kosmos''''' venue for drama and crossculture performances.

The Festival became an international event in its first year 1946. People from Germany, Switzerland and France came to the festival. Two stages were created out of floating barges. One barge for the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the other barge for carrying stage structures.

The [[Vienna Symphony]] Orchestra  is the biggest contributor to the Festival. This orchestra has a performance spot every year since the beginning of the festival. They have their own stage area and other venues used thorough out the festival. Every year the orchestra has a different conductor for each piece because it is considered the conductors performance. Kornmarktplatz, vorarlberg museum is the venture they are using for the 2016 Festival.

In 2001, the festival created a handful of contemporary arts events to go along with their usual performances. These events were a new collaboration with the [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]]  that revolved around the theme of "America of the 20th century", and The Art of Our Times program, also known as KAZ, that brought together contemporary theatre with Workshop Theatre while collaborating with Hamburg’s Thalia Theater. Other add-ons that the festival created for more variety and entertainment are the Children's Festival, the opera and band workshops, and family and school-group concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bregenzerfestspiele.com/en/company/history|title=HISTORY OF THE BREGENZ FESTIVAL|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2003 until 2014, [[David Pountney]] has been the artistic director of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bregenz Festival: the world’s splashiest opera?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8681827/Bregenz-Festival-the-worlds-splashiest-opera.html |publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over April and May 2008, scenes for the 22nd [[James Bond]] film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' were filmed on the Seebühne during a performance of ''[[Tosca]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presse.bregenzerfestspiele.com/en/bond-quantum-solace-20080520-0|title=James Bond in the eye of Tosca|publisher=bregenzerfestspiele.com|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2008 the German broadcasting corporation [[ZDF]] hosted its [[2008 European Football Championship]] live broadcast studio on the floating stage.

In 2010, the festival offered about 100 performances that drew an audience of close to 200,000.

2015 was the first year for Elisabeth Sobotka as artistic director. She started with 80 events and by end of August 2015, further founded the Opera Studio with the goal "to help young singers with their professional and personal development in a highly professional environment and also to create a staging that the audience will really enjoy". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pressefoyer.at/en/bregenz-festival-opens-70th-season_20150723|title=Bregenz Festival opens for 70th season {{!}} Bregenz Festival|website=pressefoyer.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season of year drew an audience of approx. 257,000. ''Carmen'' proofed to be very popular and was mostly fully booked with a total audience number of 193,642 people, already including the dress rehearsal and crossculture night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pressefoyer.at/en/history-bregenz-festival_20161123|title=History of Bregenz Festival {{!}} Bregenz Festival|website=pressefoyer.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2018, the 73rd season of the Bregenzer Festival starts with ''Carmen'' once more and runs from 18 July to 20 August. 75% of the 210.000 Tickets have already been sold by the beginning of June 2018. 

The Bregenzer Festspiele continues to show a series of popular Puccini works: ''La Bohème'' was the first performance in 2001/02), followed by ''Tosca in'' 2007/08 and most recently ''Turandot'' in 2015 and 2016, ''Madame Butterfly'' in 2021/22 will be the fourth opera by the Italian composer, born in Lucca in Tuscany, to feature on the programme.

The '''British Comic Art Convention''' (usually known by the moniker '''Comicon''') was an annual [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comic book]] convention which was held between 1968 and 1981, usually in [[London]]. The earliest British fan convention devoted entirely to comics, it was also the birthplace of the [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Awards]].

Most editions of Comicon took place over two days, usually on a Saturday and Sunday. The convention featured floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, one of the highlights of Comicon was the Saturday all-night film show. 

==History==
The first Comicon was organized by Phil Clarke and was held 30 August – 2 September 1968 in [[Birmingham, England]]. The first show attracted both professional and amateur creators of the time, including [[Alan Moore]], [[Paul Neary]], [[Jim Baikie]], [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]], and [[Nick Landau]].&lt;ref name=Dez&gt;Skinn, Dez. [http://dezskinn.com/fanzines-3/ "Early days of UK comics conventions and marts,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201083457/http://dezskinn.com/fanzines-3/# |date=2012-02-01 }} DezSkinn.com. Accessed Mar. 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured a "fancy dress" contest, in which contestants dressed up as characters from the comic books.&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt;

Comicon '69, held in [[London]], was organized by [[Bram Stokes]], "Godfather of British fandom"&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt; Frank Dobson, and [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. Comicon '70 was organized by Sam Plumb and held in [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt; Comicon '71 returned to London (where it stayed, except for a one-year return to Birmingham in 1979), and was organized by retailer [[Bram Stokes]] and later-[[Marvel UK]] editor [[Dez Skinn]].&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt; 

Comicon '72, the fifth annual show, was organized by [[Nick Landau]], later to become publisher of [[Titan Books]].&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt; The Comicon '72 program booklet featured artwork by [[Robert Crumb]], [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], and [[Mike Higgs]].

Comicon '73, planned and promoted by [[Bram Stokes]] and John Mansfield, was scheduled for the weekend of 21–22 July at London's Regent Centre Hotel, with special guests [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Morris (comics)|Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Peter (21 October 1972).

Retrieved 2008-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The show being abruptly canceled shortly before it was scheduled, however, the event was salvaged by [[Nick Landau]] and [[Rob Barrow]], who by that time were promoters of the competing London [[Comic Mart]] shows. Landau and Barrow managed to put on a one-day show on 22 July at the usual location of the Waverley Hotel.&lt;ref name=Dez /&gt; Barrow organized the convention for at least the next four years.

'''Cattle mutilation''' (also known as '''bovine excision'''&lt;ref&gt;Levengood W C, "A Study of Bovine Excision Sites from 1993 to 1997" (1997), Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; and '''unexplained livestock death'''&lt;ref&gt;The Mysterious Valley, St. Martin's Press, 1996, 0-312-95883-8&lt;/ref&gt;) is the killing and [[mutilation]] of [[cattle]] under unusual, usually bloodless and anomalous circumstances. Worldwide,  [[sheep]], [[horse]]s, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, bison, deer and elk have been reported mutilated with similar bloodless excisions; often an ear, eyeball, jaw flesh, tongue, lymph nodes, genitals and rectum are removed. 

Since the first reports of animal mutilations, various explanations have been offered, ranging from natural [[decomposition]] and normal [[predation]] to [[cult]]s and secretive governmental and military agencies, to a range of speculations, including [[cryptid]] predators (like the [[Chupacabra]]) and [[extraterrestrials]]. Mutilations have been the subject of two independent federal investigations in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation Animal Mutilation Project], FBI, Released under FOIA&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in early 1606 "...about the city of London and some of the shires adjoining. Whole slaughters of sheep have been made, in some places to number 100, in others less, where nothing is taken from the sheep but their tallow and some inward parts, the whole carcasses, and fleece remaining still behind. Of this sundry conjectures, but most agree that it tendeth towards some fireworks." The outbreak was noted in the official records of the Court of [[James I]] of England.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Christopher|title=Stalking the Herd|date=November 2014|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|location=Kempton, IL|isbn=978-1-939149-06-0|page=50|edition=1st &lt;!-- |accessdate=30 August 2016 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Charles Fort]] collected many accounts of cattle mutilations that occurred in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
John Keel mentioned investigating animal mutilation cases in 1966 (while with Ivan T. Sanderson) that were being reported in the Upper [[Ohio River]] Valley, around Gallipolis, [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Keel, John A. The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings, 1994, Doubleday, NYC, NY&lt;/ref&gt; 
The phenomenon remained largely unknown outside cattle-raising communities until 1967, when the ''[[Pueblo Chieftain]]'' in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], published a story about a horse named Lady near [[Alamosa, Colorado]], that was mysteriously killed and mutilated.  The story was republished by the wider press and distributed nationwide; this case was the first to feature speculation that [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] beings and [[unidentified flying object]]s were associated with mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Saunders and R. Roger Harkins; ''UFO's? Yes! Where the Condon Committee Went Wrong''; World Publishing, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Snippy (Lady) mutilation===

On September 9, 1967, Agnes King and her son Harry found the dead body of their three-year-old horse, Lady. Lady's head and neck had been skinned and defleshed, and the body displayed cuts that, to King, looked very precise. No blood was at the scene, according to Harry, and a strong medicinal odor was in the air. A subsequent investigation concluded there were "No unearthly causes" of the death. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} When the Lewis' called Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips he told them that the death was probably due to "a lightning strike," and never bothered to visit the site. &lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;  Early press coverage of the case misnamed Lady as Snippy. Snippy was Lady's sire and belonged to Nellie's husband, Berle Lewis.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;  Later press coverage mentions that the horse had been shot in the behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/12/08/town-gets-snippy-about-skeleton-of-mutilated-horse/|title=Town gets Snippy about skeleton of mutilated horse|first=Rich |last=Tosches |date=8 December 2006|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
Democratic senator [[Floyd K. Haskell]] contacted the [[FBI]] asking for help in 1975 due to public concern regarding the issue. He claimed there had been 130 mutilations in Colorado alone, and further reports across nine states.&lt;ref name=fbi1&gt;[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%201%20of%205/view Operation Cattle Mutilation, Section 1], FBI, Released under FOIA&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1979 FBI report indicated that, according to investigations by the New Mexico State Police, there had been an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1,000,000 damage.&lt;ref name=fbi4&gt;[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%204%20of%205/view Operation Cattle Mutilation, Section 4] FBI report on cattle mutilations&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, 200 goats were mutilated in Panggang District of [[Gunung Kidul Regency]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{id}}{{cite web |url=http://siezhien.wen.ru/mistery/pulung.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122058/http://siezhien.wen.ru/mistery/pulung.html |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical characteristics===

In most cases, mutilation wounds appear to be clean and carried out surgically. Mutilated animals are sometimes, though not always,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1096&amp;category=Environment First Pregnant Cow Mutilation Discovered] (February 13, 2006), Earthfiles&lt;/ref&gt; reported to have been drained of blood and show no sign of blood in the immediate area or around their wounds.

George E. Onet, a doctor of veterinary microbiology and cattle mutilation investigator, claims that mutilated cattle are avoided by large scavengers "such as coyotes, wolves, foxes, dogs, skunks, badgers, and bobcats" for several days after their death. Similarly, domestic animals are also reported to be "visibly agitated" and "fearful" of the carcasses.&lt;ref name=onetknow&gt;Onet George E, DVM PhD, [http://www.nidsci.org/articles/animal1.php Animal mutilations: What we know]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey taken by the [[National Institute for Discovery Science]] (NIDS), mutilation of the eye occurred in 59 percent of cases, mutilation of the tongue in 42 percent of cases, the genitals in 85 percent of cases, and the rectum in 76 percent of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidsci.org/articles/bovinepractioners.php Results of a Survey Among Bovine Practitioners Concerning Animal Mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510144242/http://www.nidsci.org/articles/bovinepractioners.php |date=2008-05-10 }} G. E. Onet, NIDS&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Howard Burgess, nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old.&lt;ref&gt;Good Timothy, Alien contact: top-secret UFO files revealed, William Morrow &amp; Co., {{ISBN|0-688-12223-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mutilations are said to occur in very brief periods. A 2002 NIDS report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/mutilationofcalves.pdf Three Reports of Unusual Killings and Mutilation of Calves] (2002), NIDS&lt;/ref&gt; relates a 1997 case from Utah. Two ranchers tagged a specific calf, then continued tagging other animals in the same pasture. The ranchers were, at the most, about 300 yards (275 m) from the calf. Less than an hour later, the first calf was discovered completely eviscerated—most muscle and all internal organs were missing. There was no blood, entrails, or apparent disturbance at the scene. Independent analysts both uncovered marks on the calf's remains consistent with two different types of tools: a large, [[machete]]-type blade, and smaller, more delicate [[scissor]]s.

The absence of tracks or footprints around the site of the mutilated carcass is often considered a hallmark of cattle mutilation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, in some cases, strange marks or imprints near the site have been found. In the famous "Snippy" case, there was an absolute absence of tracks in a 100&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) radius of the carcass (even the horse's own tracks disappeared within 100&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) of the body.) But within this radius, several small holes were found seemingly "punched" in the ground and two bushes were absolutely flattened.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.172-75&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rio Arriba County, New Mexico]], June 1976, a "trail of suction cup-like impressions" was found leading from a mutilated three-year-old cow. The indentations were in a tripod form, 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10 cm) in diameter, 28&amp;nbsp;inches (70 cm) apart, and disappeared 500 feet (150 m) from the dead cow. Similar incidents were reported in the area in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;The Albuquerque Tribune, June 15, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory reports===
Laboratory reports carried out on some mutilated animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;

In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI,&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt; an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of [[Dulce, New Mexico]], was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. It displayed "classic" mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appeared to be “a sharp and precise instrument” and its internal organs were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation.

:"Both the liver and the heart were white and mushy. Both organs had the texture and consistency of peanut butter"
:Gabriel L Veldez, New Mexico Police

The animal's heart as well as bone and muscle samples were sent to the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal's liver were sent to two separate private laboratories.

Los Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring [[Clostridium]] bacteria in the heart, but was unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represented postmortem contamination. They did not directly investigate the heart's unusual color or texture.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;

Samples from the animal's liver were found to be completely devoid of [[copper]] and to contain 4 times the normal level of [[zinc]], [[potassium]] and [[phosphorus]]. The scientists performing the analysis were unable to explain these anomalies.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;

Blood samples taken at the scene were reported to be "light pink in color" and “Did not clot after several days” while the animal's hide was found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath was found to be discolored.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;

None of the laboratories were able to report any firm conclusions on the cause of the blood or tissue damage. At the time, it was suggested that a burst of radiation may have been used to kill the animal, blowing apart its red blood cells in the process. This hypothesis was later discarded as subsequent reports from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory later confirmed the presence of anti-coagulants in samples&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt; taken from other cows mutilated in the region.

==Conventional explanations==
As with most disputed phenomena, there are a number of potential explanations to cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.

===U.S. governmental explanation===
After coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.&lt;ref name=opanmuthome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/ufoanim.htm|title=Freedom of Information/Privacy Act|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1979, the case was passed on to the FBI, which granted jurisdiction under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I.html Title 18] (codes [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1152- 1152] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1153- 1153]). The investigation was dubbed "Operation Animal Mutilation".

The investigation was funded by a US$44,170 grant from the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]], and was headed by FBI agent [[Kenneth Rommel]]. It had five key objectives:

# To determine the reliability of the information on which the grant was based, which entailed gathering as much information as possible about the cases reported in New Mexico prior to May 1979
# To determine the cause of as many mutilations as possible, especially those reported in New Mexico
# To determine if livestock mutilations as described constitute a major law enforcement problem
# If these mutilations do constitute a major law enforcement problem, to determine the scope of the problem and to offer recommendations on how to deal with it
# If it is shown that the mutilation phenomenon is not a law enforcement problem, to recommend that no further law enforcement investigations be funded.

Rommel's final report was 297 pages long and cost approximately US$45,000. It concluded that mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but that some contained anomalies that could not be accounted for by conventional wisdom. The FBI was unable to identify any individuals responsible for the mutilations. Details of the investigation are now available under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].  The released material includes correspondence from Rommel where he states that "most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%205%20of%205/view Animal Mutilation Project] FBI correspondence, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the involvement of the FBI, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] launched their own investigation of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=clarkstrange1&gt;Clark J, Pear N (1997), "Strange and unexplained phenomena", Visible Ink Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Both federal investigations were preceded (and followed, to some extent) by a state level investigation carried out by enforcement officials in New Mexico. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;{{rp|13}} It also contended that alleged surgical techniques performed during mutilations had become "more professional" over time.&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;{{rp|13}} However, officers in charge were unable to determine responsibility or motive.

The ATF investigation was headed by ATF Agent Donald Flickinger. The New Mexico investigation was headed by Officer Gabriel L Veldez of the New Mexico Police, with the assistance of [[Cattle Inspector]] Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the [[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish]].

===Natural causes===
[[Image:Blowfly-head2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Blowflies have been implicated as possible scavengers involved in making livestock carcasses look "mutilated."]]
While many unconventional explanations have been put forward to explain cattle mutilations, a variety of scientists, veterinary workers, and knowledgeable observers (including farmers and other agricultural workers) have suggested more conventional ideas, most of which revolve around the hypothesis that "mutilated" animals died of natural causes and were subjected to known terrestrial phenomena – including the action of predators, parasites, and scavengers.&lt;ref name=sceptdict&gt;Carroll Robert T, [http://www.skepdic.com/cattle.html Skeptic's Dictionary: Cattle Mutilation] (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as:
*Contraction of missing/damaged areas due to dehydration.
*The actions of small scavengers and burrowing parasites seeking to enter or consume the body in areas where skin is at its thinnest.

Missing/mutilated eyes and soft internal organs are explained as:
*The action of carrion feeding insects such as [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]], and opportunistic or carrion birds such as [[vulture]]s, which are known to direct themselves toward an animal's eyes, and to enter the body through the openings of the mouth and anus in order to feed on soft internal organs.

Absence of blood is explained as:
*Blood pooling in the lowest points in the body where it will break down into its basic organic components.
*Blood that is external to the body, or in the area of a wound being consumed by insects or reduced by solar desiccation.

Surgical incisions in the skin are explained as:
*Tears in the skin created when it is stretched by postmortem bloat and/or as dehydration causes the animal's hide to shrink and split, often in linear cuts.
*Incisions caused by scavengers or predators, possibly exacerbated by the above.

The hypothesis that natural phenomena account for most mutilation characteristics has been validated by a number of experiments, including one cited by long-time [[scientific skepticism|scientific skeptic]] [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert T. Carroll]], conducted by Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff's Department. In the experiment, the body of a recently deceased cow was left in a field and observed for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, postmortem bloating was reported to have caused incision-like tears in the cow's skin that matched the "surgical" cuts reported on mutilated cows, while the action of blowflies and maggots reportedly matched the soft tissue damage observed on mutilated cows. No explanation was made however, for the entire absence of any blood.

Experiments have also been conducted to compare the different reactions of surgically cut hide/flesh and predated hide/flesh to natural exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Onet George E, DVM, PhD, Kelleher Colm, PhD, (1997), Histological Changes in Bovine Skin Exposed to Natural Environmental Conditions&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated pronounced differences between surgical cut and non surgical cuts over time. This article does not address tearing due to bloating.

Some ranchers have disputed the more scientifically mainstream "natural causes hypothesis" on the grounds that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no sign of disease prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.&lt;ref name=pbc&gt;[http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 Costilla County officials probe cattle mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070801062328/http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 |date=2007-08-01 }} (July 22, 2006), Pueblo Chieftain&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the accepted position include investigators involved in paranormal and UFO research organizations, such as National Institute for Discovery Science which report the discovery of anomalies in necropsies which, they claim, cannot be explained by natural processes.

===Human intervention===

====Animal cruelty and human activity====
It is alternatively hypothesised that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated [[deviant]] phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.

Attacks against animals are a recognized phenomenon. There have been many recorded cases around the world, and many convictions. Typically the victims of such attacks are cats, dogs, and other family pets,&lt;ref name=catdogs1&gt;[http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1132&amp;category= More Cat and Dog Mutilations], (2006), Linda Moulton Howe&lt;/ref&gt; and the actions of humans are usually limited to acts of cruelty such as striking, burning, or beating animals. However, attacks have also been recorded against larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses.&lt;ref name=horse1&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?channel_id=3&amp;story_id=25281 Life term sought for killer, horse mutilator], Expatica, November 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
Humans, particularly those with [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways&lt;ref name=catdogs1/&gt; using knives or surgical instruments.

On April 20, 1979, Dr. C Hibbs of the [[New Mexico]] State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory spoke before a hearing chaired by Senator [[Harrison Schmitt]]. Dr. Hibbs testified that mutilation fell into three categories, one of which was animals mutilated by humans&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt; (page 25). FBI records did not record the percentage of mutilated animals that fell into this category.

The standard criminal charge for mutilating an animal, including cattle, is [[animal cruelty]].

====Cults====
Closely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity.&lt;ref name=metarel&gt;[http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm Meta Religion.com: Cattle Mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075308/http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}, (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, which holds that cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.

Beliefs held by proponents of the cult hypothesis vary, but may include:

*That the apparent absence of blood at mutilation sites may indicate cult members harvest it&lt;ref name=mstp&gt;Mystery Stalks the Prairie (1976), Donovan Roberta, Wolverton Keith, ASIN B0006WH8CA&lt;/ref&gt;
*That organs have been removed from cattle for use in rituals&lt;ref name=sceptdict/&gt;
*That unborn calves have been harvested from mutilated cattle.

The hypothesis that cults were responsible for cattle mutilation was developed in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of growing national concern over cults (such as the [[Peoples Temple]] and [[Jonestown]]) and [[ritual satanic abuse]] ("Satanic panic").&lt;ref&gt;Bromley David G. and Anson Shupe (1981), Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare. Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|0-8070-3256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden J.K (2002) [http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anticounter.htm Cult Group Controversies: Conceptualizing "Anti-Cult" and "Counter-Cult"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827231058/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anticounter.htm |date=August 27, 2006 }}, University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the US Treasury Department assigned [[Donald Flickinger]] to investigate the existence of connections between cults and the mutilation of cattle.&lt;ref name=clarkstrange1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi2/&gt;{{rp|23}} The operation came under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Flickinger recorded a number of 'unusual' incidents and circumstantial evidence, but was unable to find sufficient evidence of cult involvement for the ATF to take further action.&lt;ref name=clarkstrange1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi2/&gt; Media reports of the time reported his investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a co-ordinated campaign against elected officials by cult members.&lt;ref name=fbi2/&gt;{{rp|23}}

However, there were various reports during the time of menacing groups prowling around mutilation sites. In September 1975, a forestry service employee in [[Blaine County, Idaho]], reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.&lt;ref&gt;D. Albers, Michael, The Terror, pp. 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest in the cult hypothesis waned during the 1980s, but interest was maintained by proponents such as the [[Colorado]] based [[televangelism|television evangelist]] [[Bob Larson]], who campaigned to raise public awareness of links between cattle mutilations and cult activity through his ministry and radio shows.

Another proponent of the cult hypothesis is [[Montana]] author [[Roberta Donovan]]. In her 1976 publication ''Mystery Stalks the Prairie'' she documents the experiences of Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], [[Cascade County, Montana|Cascade County]], investigating cattle mutilations with suspected cult involvement.

Since the beginning of the cult hypothesis, law enforcement agents in several states and provinces, including [[Alberta]], [[Idaho]], Montana, and [[Iowa]] have reported evidence implicating cults in several instances of cattle mutilations.&lt;ref&gt;Clark J (1999), Unexplained! Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences, and Puzzling Physical Phenomena, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|1-57859-070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their investigations, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort. They were also unable to determine how or why a cult would perform procedures that would result in the anomalies reported in some necropsies,&lt;ref name=fbi4/&gt;{{rp|3}} or to verify that the anomalies were 1) connected to the mutilations themselves 2) the result of human intervention.&lt;ref name=opanmuthome/&gt;

In most cases, mutilations were either ruled due to natural causes, or the cattle were too far decayed for any useful conclusions to be drawn. Some cases of cult hysteria were traced back to fabrication by individuals unrelated to the incident. In one case it was concluded that claims had been falsified by a convict seeking favorable terms on his sentence in exchange for information.&lt;ref name=mstp/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}&lt;ref name=fbi2&gt;[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%202%20of%205/view Operation Cattle Mutilation, Section 2], FBI, Released under FOIA&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23–24}} In another case, claims were traced back to local high school students who had circulated rumors as a joke.&lt;ref name=mstp/&gt;{{rp|21}}

===Government or military experimentation===
In his 1997 article “Dead Cows I've Known”,&lt;ref name=oliphant1&gt;Dean Trimboli T(1997), Dead Cows I've Known.&lt;/ref&gt; cattle mutilation researcher Charles T. Oliphant speculates cattle mutilation to be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases, and the possibility they could be transmitted to humans.

Oliphant posits the NIH, CDC, or other federally funded bodies, may be involved, and they are supported by the US military. Part of his hypothesis is based on allegations that human pharmaceuticals have been found in mutilated cattle, and on the necropsies that show cattle mutilations commonly involve areas of the animal that relate to “input, output and reproduction”. To support his hypothesis, Oliphant cites the [[Reston ebolavirus]] case in which plain clothes military officers, traveling in unmarked vehicles, entered a research facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], to secretly retrieve and destroy animals that were contaminated with a highly infectious disease.

Additionally, a 2002 NIDS report&lt;ref name=anonymous&gt;Anonymous, [http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf Report on Unusual Animal Injuries in Cache County, Utah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222013047/http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf |date=2005-12-22 }} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; relates the eyewitness testimony of two [[Cache County, Utah]], police officers. The area had seen many unusual cattle deaths, and ranchers had organized armed patrols to surveil the unmarked aircraft which they claimed were associated with the livestock deaths. The police witnesses claim to have encountered several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter in 1976 at a small community airport in Cache County. The witnesses asserted that after this heated encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years.

Biochemist [[Colm Kelleher]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelleher, Colm, ''Brain Trust: The Hidden Connection Between Mad Cow and Misdiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease'' Paraview, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7434-9935-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has investigated several purported mutilations first-hand, argues that the mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] ("mad cow disease") and related diseases, such as [[scrapie]].

Theories of government involvement in cattle mutilation have been further fueled by "[[black helicopter]]" sightings near mutilation sites. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of mutilation which claimed 16 cows. On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters, a white helicopter and a black twin-engine aircraft, opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in [[Honey Creek, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Honey Creek, Iowa]]. This attack followed a rash of mutilations in the area and across the nearby border in Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Albers, Michael, The Terror, pp.13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;W. Smith, Fredrick, Cattle Mutilation, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The reports of "helicopter" involvement have been used to explain why some cattle appear to have been "dropped" from considerable heights.

==Other explanations==

===Aliens and UFOs===
In 1974, a few months after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, multiple farmers in [[Nebraska]] claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. One claimed he saw an object which “looked as if it had a little bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it.” The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goleman | first = Michael J. | title = Wave of Mutilation: The Cattle Mutilation Phenomenon of the 1970s. | journal = Agricultural History | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 398–417 | date = 2011 | language = English | jstor = 10.3098/ah.2011.85.3.398 | doi = 10.3098/ah.2011.85.3.398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government Interference===
At the same time that UFO reports were being filed with law enforcement and larger number of ranchers claimed to see black helicopters around their fields, coinciding with the cattle mutilations. Although some initially thought these were used by cattle rustlers, suspicion soon pointed toward a military operation running out of [[Fort Riley]], Kansas. Reporter Dane Edwards spread the theory that the government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons to use in Vietnam, going so far as to write to [[Floyd K. Haskell]] during his investigation to accuse agents of threatening him into silence. Vigilante groups were formed.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt;

===Unknown creatures explanation===
Local folklore has attributed the mutilations to chupacabras or similar creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sieveking | first = Paul | title = 100 WEIRD YEARS; AS YOU LOOK BACK ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND ATROCITIES OF THE 20TH CENTURY, SPARE A THOUGHT FOR ONE OF ITS MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: UNEXPLAINED EVENTS.

'''Customer support''' is a range of [[customer service]]s to assist customers in making cost effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/customer-support.html|title=What is customer support? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding technology products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"/&gt;

Customer support is considered as one of the main data channels for [[customer satisfaction research]] and a way to increase [[customer retention]].

==Automation==&lt;!--[[Support automation]] redirects here--&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

[[Automation]] of service organizations aim to achieve, for example, lower [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR).

Customer support automation involves the building of a [[knowledge base]] of known [[issue (computers)|issue]]s and their resolution to support [[incident management|incident]]s with delivery mechanisms, often by [[expert system]]s. A service automation platform includes a suite of support solutions including proactive support, assisted support and self-support. 

With automated support, service organizations can make their services available to their customers [[24/7|24 hours a day and 7 days a week]], by monitoring [[alarm]]s, identifying problems at an early stage and resolving issues before they become problems. Automated assisted support enables remote access to sites that need instant problem solving. By automating the collection of information of devices and applications coexisting with the supported application, problems can be quickly detected and fixed. 

Automated self-support, automates the self-support process, freeing users from self-help diagnostics and troubleshooting from [[digital library|on-line libraries]] or knowledge bases.
Support automation solutions can be integrated with [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[network management system]]s (NMS), and provide full customer reports to management tallying problems and incidents that were solved mechanically ensuring compliance to industry regulations like [[Sarbanes Oxley]], [[Title 21 CFR Part 11|21 CFR part 11]], and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

===Types===
*'''Proactive Support Automation''' refers to support automation solutions that minimize downtime and enable 24x7 [[availability]]. This is achieved by constant health check tracking with diagnostic procedures to enable issue monitoring and problem solving.
*'''Preemptive Support Automation''' refers to a support solution that utilizes information that is either generated or culled from an application or service, e.g. log files, database queries, configuration changes, etc. This information can then be exploited to predict service degradations or interruptions. The upshot of this is a higher level of service/application availability for the underlying application
*'''Self Support Automation''' is the term organizations give to their support structures that provide on-line libraries and tools for self-help and easy troubleshooting solutions to automatically and precisely diagnose and resolve problems and incidents.
*'''Assisted Support Automation''' is the software that enables support personnel to remotely access their customers desktop or server for diagnostics and trouble ticket resolution.

==Communication Channels==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Channels of communication that companies may offer to customers for support:

; Phone support
: Customers speak directly to customer support representatives over the phone. For inbound calls, an IVR (Integrated Voice Response) can be programmed to route captured calls in a variety of ways with the potential goal of quickest resolution of a customer’s request/problem.
: Phone Support is often used for order taking, pre-sales queries, upselling and [[cross-selling]], troubleshooting etc.
: Outbound calls are calls made to customers from the [[call center]] to give or take information. 
; Live chat support
: With live chat support a web visitor seeks assistance, a text chat session is started by clicking on a link on the provider's website. The customer support representative interacts with the web visitor, understands the requirements, resolves the query and closes the interaction. Alternatively, based on the requirements the customer support representative could also trigger a chat session with the web visitor. Live chat support assists with language barriers as both parties involved in the chat session may be able to use an online translation service to communicate. It is also considered less intrusive than phone support.{{POV-statement|date=December 2014}}  Live chat support is often used for lead generation and fulfillment, campaign management, pre-sales and post-sales enquiries, complaint registration, tech support etc.
; Email support
: Email is the primary means to offer web-based assistance for your customers when matters do not require an immediate answer. Low-cost, non-intrusive and anywhere-anytime access are some of the advantages of email-based communications. Trouble Ticketing System and CRM Applications help keep track of a series of follow-up correspondence with a particular customer. Services offered via email response management is claims processing, polling/media analysis, subscription services, troubleshooting, complaint registrations etc.
; Remote support
: Solving problems of a computer at a particular location from a computer at another location is remote support. Companies can save considerable amounts of money on logistics through remote support. IT technicians are empowered with several tools that allow them to gain access to customers’ computers at various parts of the world. They are able to gain access and repair software related problems from remote locations. The need for a technician to visit the customers’ premises is mitigated. With the movement of applications from the desktop to the cloud, newer forms of browser based remote support have developed such as [[Cobrowsing]].
; On-site support
: On-site support is the opposite of remote support. Certain kinds of assistance cannot be rendered remotely, like, hardware related problems. repairing a TV, replacing a spare part, servicing of air conditioners etc. In some occasions, a service provider might choose to take devices or gadgets back to their warehouse for repair.
; Social media
: Since the arrival of social media platforms like [[Facebook]] &amp; [[Twitter]], service providers have found that many of their customers spend plenty of time on them daily. To make it convenient to customers, many service providers have set up a [[webcare]] team as support channel on their social media profiles. Customers are able to ask questions, register complaints, clarify doubts etc. by interacting with the company’s staff through these social media platforms. With millions of users now gaining access to social media, this platform has become as prominent as traditional media like phone, live chat and email.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5632">The '''Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms''' was a document issued by the [[Second Continental Congress]] on July 6, 1775, to explain why the [[Thirteen Colonies]] had taken up arms in what had become the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The final draft of the Declaration was written by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], who incorporated language from an earlier draft by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian P. Boyd|Boyd, Julian P.]], ed. ''[[The Papers of Thomas Jefferson]]'', vol. 1. Princeton University Press, 1950. Includes two drafts by Jefferson, one by Dickinson, and the version adopted by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==  
{{Wikisource|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms}}
The Declaration describes what colonists viewed as the unconstitutional effort of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] to extend its jurisdiction into the colonies following the [[Seven Years' War]]. Objectionable policies listed in the Declaration include [[taxation without representation]], extended use of [[vice admiralty court]]s, the several [[Coercive Acts]], and the [[Declaratory Act]]. The Declaration describes how the colonists had, for ten years, repeatedly petitioned for the redress of their grievances, only to have their pleas ignored or rejected by the British government. Even though British troops have been sent to enforce these unconstitutional acts, the Declaration insists that the colonists do not yet seek independence from the mother country. They have taken up arms "in defence of the Freedom that is our Birthright and which we ever enjoyed until the late Violation of it", and will "lay them down when Hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors". The very first sentence of the declaration includes a condemnation of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=Harry V. Jaffa |url=http://claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1540/article_detail.asp |title=God Bless America |date=April 18, 2008 |first=Harry V. |last=Jaffa |work=Writings: Claremont Review of Books |publisher=The Claremont Institute |accessdate=May 16, 2008 |quote=In its first sentence, the Second Continental Congress affirmed without equivocation that the idea of the ownership of some human beings by other human beings was an utter absurdity, and that to think otherwise was incompatible with reason or revelation. Thus from the outset—a year before the Declaration of Independence—the American people were committed to the antislavery cause, and to the inseparability of personal freedom and free government. The American people knew from the outset that the cause of their own freedom and that of the slaves was inseparable. This would become the message that Abraham Lincoln would bring to the American people, and to the world, for all time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516193906/http://claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1540/article_detail.asp |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
In the 19th century, the authorship of the Declaration was disputed. In a collection of his works first published in 1801, John Dickinson took credit for writing the Declaration. This claim went unchallenged by Thomas Jefferson until many years later, when Jefferson was nearly 80 years old. In his autobiography, Jefferson claimed that he wrote the first draft, but Dickinson objected that it was too radical, and so Congress allowed Dickinson to write a more moderate version, keeping only the last four-and-a-half paragraphs of Jefferson's draft. Jefferson's version of events was accepted by historians for many years. In 1950, [[Julian P. Boyd]], the editor of Jefferson's papers, examined the extant drafts and determined that Jefferson's memory was faulty and that Dickinson claimed too much credit for the final text.

According to Boyd, an initial draft was reportedly written by [[John Rutledge]], a member of a committee of five appointed to create the Declaration. Rutledge's draft was not accepted and does not survive. Jefferson and Dickinson were then added to the committee. Jefferson was appointed to write a draft; how much he drew upon the lost Rutledge draft, if at all, is unknown. Jefferson then apparently submitted his draft to Dickinson, who suggested some changes, which Jefferson, for the most part, decided not to use. The result was that Dickinson rewrote the Declaration, keeping some passages written by Jefferson. Contrary to Jefferson's recollection in his old age, Dickinson's version was not less radical; according to Boyd, in some respects Dickinson's draft was more blunt. The bold statement near the end was written by Dickinson: "Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable." The disagreement in 1775 between Dickinson and Jefferson appears to have been primarily a matter of style, not content.

'''Declawing of crabs''' is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab (including [[king crab]]s) are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the [[Florida stone crab]] (''Menippe mercenaria'') fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (''[[Chaceon affinis]]'') fishery and in southern [[Iberia]], where the major claws of the fiddler crab ''[[Uca tangeri]]'' are harvested. Around [[Northern Europe]], an extensive fishery exists for claws of the edible crab (''[[Cancer pagurus]])''. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally [[autotomy|autotomise]] (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] these limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfwc.com/research/saltwater/crustaceans-marine-arthropods/stone-crabs/faq/ |title=Stone crabs FAQs |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in [[fishing net]]s and cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Patterson et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lynsey Patterson |author2=Jaimie T. A. Dick |author3=Robert W. Elwood |year=2009 |title=Claw removal and feeding ability in the edible crab, ''Cancer pagurus'': implications for fishery practice |journal=[[Applied Animal Behaviour Science]] |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=302–305 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2008.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwood, (2007)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071007210836.htm |author=Queen's University, Belfast |date=10 October 2007 |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |title=Declawing crabs may lead to their death |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/regulations/stone-crabs/ |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |title=Recreational stone crabbing information |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
[[File:Fiddler crab anatomy-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|General anatomy of a [[fiddler crab]]]]
To perform declawing, the claws are snapped downward away from the crab. To ensure a clean break along the natural fracture plane, one finger is placed on the basal [[cheliped]] joint. With the cheliped fully extended, a quick, firm downward motion normally removes the claw cleanly. The break usually occurs at the [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|basi-ischum]] between the [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|coxa]] at the base of the leg and the [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|merus]].

==Production==
In the 1976–77 trapping season, about 50,000&amp;nbsp;kg of claws were harvested in the [[Everglades National Park]].&lt;ref name="Davis and Thue, (1977)"&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. E. Davis |author2=E. B. Thue |year=1977 |title=Annual fishery management report for Everglades National Park, Florida, No. 1 |publisher=[[Everglades National Park]], U. S. National Park Service |location=Homestead, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably less than 5% of the total Floridian harvest, which has averaged more than 1,000,000 kilograms since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Florida Department of Natural Resources]] |year=1977 |title=Florida landings, annual summary, 1975 |series=Current Fisheries Statistics |volume=6919 |publisher=NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida during the 1995–96 to 2004–05 fishing seasons, fishers declawed approximately 10.5 million crabs during each 7-month fishing season. The weight of crab claws landings varied without trend since 1989–90. Peak landings were 1.6 million kg statewide in the 1997–98 fishing season. Statewide landings for 2004–05 were 1.4 million kg of claws.&lt;ref name="Florida_2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myfwc.com/research/saltwater/stock-assessments/invertebrate/2006-stone-crab/ |title=The 2006 Stock Assessment Update for the Stone Crab, ''Menippe'' spp., Fishery in Florida |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on mortality==
[[File:2017 Sarasota Mar Vista Stone Crab 1 FRD 6870.jpg|thumb|right|[[Florida stone crab]] claws served as food]]

Under experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of [[Florida stone crab]]s that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing. The claws constituted 51% of the total weight of the crabs before declawing.&lt;ref name="Davis et al., (1978)"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gary E. Davis |author2=Douglas S. Baughman |author3=James D. Chapman |author4=Donald MacArthur |author5=Alan C. Pierce |year=1978 |url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/FI/44/44/00/02/00001/FI44440002.pdf |title=Mortality associated with declawing stone crabs, ''Menippe mercenaria'' |publisher=US National Park Service |id=Report T-522}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, where declawed crabs must compete for food, mates, and shelter, and avoid predators, the mortality rate is likely to be higher. Declawed crabs survive by switching from predation to scavenging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myfwc.com/research/saltwater/crustaceans-marine-arthropods/stone-crabs/faq/ Stone Crab FAQ]: If a stone crab looses [sic] both claws how can it eat and defend itself?&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of regenerated claws in the fishery harvest is low, with studies calculating from less than 10% (1978),&lt;ref name="Davis et al., (1978)" /&gt; 13% (2006),&lt;ref name="Florida_2006"/&gt; to 20% (2010).&lt;ref name=speciesaccount&gt;[http://myfwc.com/research/saltwater/status-trends/invertebrates/ Species Account - Invertebrates]: [http://myfwc.com/media/195801/florida_stone_crab.pdf Florida Stone Crab (Menippe mercenaria) and Gulf Stone Crab (M. adina)]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger, older crabs generally do not survive long enough to regrow their claws, as they are near the end of their lifespan.

==Effects on feeding==
Most crabs use their claws for capturing and eating prey. A crab with one claw removed would therefore be disadvantaged in subsequent feeding and a crab with both claws removed even more so. In a study on the effects of declawing on feeding, autotomy induced (declawed) crabs consumed significantly fewer [[mussel]]s and less mussel mass, but ate more mass of fish (a more readily handled food source). This indicates that the effect of autotomy was a reduction of the ability to feed on mussels, rather than a general reduction of feeding motivation.&lt;ref name="Patterson et al., (2009)"/&gt; In a second study, there was no discernible difference in the amount of food consumed by crabs surviving declawing and control crabs.&lt;ref name="Davis et al., (1978)"/&gt; It has been argued that should a crab survive declawing it will not be able to feed effectively and may subsequently die of starvation.&lt;ref name="Elwood, (2007)" /&gt;

==Effects on activity==
Declawed crabs show significantly lower activity levels than [[negative control]]s.&lt;ref name="Davis et al., (1978)"/&gt;

==Pain and stress caused by declawing==
There is debate about whether [[Pain in invertebrates|invertebrates can experience pain]]. Some of the most compelling evidence for pain in invertebrates exists [[Pain in crustaceans|for crustaceans]] in terms of [[Pain in invertebrates#Trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements|trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} Evidence of the ability for crabs to feel pain is supported by their possessing an opioid receptor system, showing learned avoidance to putatively painful stimuli, and responding appropriately to [[Analgesic|analagesics]] and [[Anesthetic|anaesthetics]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} These all indicate it is likely that crabs can experience pain during declawing.

It has been argued that because crabs can [[Autotomy|autotomise]] (self-amputate) their claws, manual declawing along these natural fracture planes will not cause pain. However, a lack or reduction of pain during autotomy remains to be verified. Moreover, declawing results in a physiological stress response in the edible crab,{{fact|date=May 2018}} as indicated by increases in [[haemolymph]] [[glucose]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] and a decrease in [[glycogen]]. This stress is evident both in the short term (&lt;&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min) and the long term (24&amp;nbsp;h). Further, declawing is more stressful, results in bigger wounds and causes significant mortality compared to induced autotomy.&lt;ref name="Patterson et al., (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lynsey Patterson |author2=Jaimie T. A. Dick |author3=Robert W. Elwood |year=2007 |title=Physiological stress responses in the edible crab, ''Cancer pagurus'', to the fishery practice of de-clawing |journal=[[Marine Biology (journal)|Marine Biology]] |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=265–272 |doi=10.1007/s00227-007-0681-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1956''' was the first edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]], held at the [[Teatro Kursaal]] in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]] on Thursday 24 May.

Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]], the pan-European music competition was inspired by the Italian [[Sanremo Music Festival]]. [[Lohengrin Filipello]] hosted the first contest which lasted approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. Seven countries participated, with each of them performing two songs. Two jury members from all participating countries cast their votes in secret, based on which song was their favourite.

This first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest included several procedures that were not repeated in any subsequent edition: Two songs for each country, secret voting, double voting of one country on behalf of another, optional inclusion of the jury members' own represented country in their voting, only "Grand Prix" title reception for the winner, and a single male presenter to host the show.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Eurovision Song Contest}}
During a meeting in [[Monaco]] in 1955, members of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] discussed ideas to organise a pan-European music competition, taking inspiration from the Italian [[Sanremo Music Festival]]. From that meeting, the concept of the Eurovision Song Contest was born. A decision was reached to hold the first ever contest the following year in [[Lugano]], in the Italian cultural region of [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=ESC1956&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurovision History – Lugano 1956 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273#Participants |publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugano is a city in southern Switzerland, located in the [[Italian language|Italian speaking]] [[canton of Ticino]]. The 9th largest Swiss city, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlistmania.com/top-20-cities-in-switzerland-on-population/|title=List of Major Cities in Switzerland on Population|website=worldlistmania.com|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city lies on [[Lake Lugano]], surrounded by the mountains of the [[Lugano Prealps]].

=== Venue ===
The inaugural Eurovision Song Contest took place at the [[Teatro Kursaal]], a [[casino]] and former theatre, on 24 May 1956. The theatre, designed by Italian architect [[Achille Sfondrini]], was used for theatrical and musical performances, [[ballroom dance]] and other shows. The theatre closed shortly after the last show in April 1997 and was demolished in 2001 to make room for the extension of the Casino. Now known as Casinò Lugano, it opened again on 29 November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinolugano.ch/en/story/|title=History - Casinò Lugano|website=casinolugano.ch|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
The programme was hosted in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[Lohengrin Filipello]],&lt;ref name=ESC1956 /&gt; making it the only Eurovision Song Contest to have a solo male presenter and up until the 2017 edition with a male trio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Paul |title=Let's hear it for the boys! Meet the hosts of Eurovision 2017 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=257553 |website=eurovision.tv |publisher=European Broadcasting Union |accessdate=27 February 2017 |date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only edition without a female presenter. The programme lasted approximately one hour and 40 minutes. Although it was mainly a [[radio]] programme, there were cameras in the studio for the benefit of the few Europeans who possessed a television.&lt;ref name=ESC1956 /&gt;

Only solo artists were allowed to enter the contest, and their songs were not to exceed three and a half minutes in length, and were accompanied by a 24-musician orchestra, which was led by Fernando Paggi, along with four guest conductors, which came from Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Italy. The interval act, whistling by the Joyeux Rossignols, had to be extended due to a delay in the voting procedure. It had been strongly recommended that each participating country have a preliminary national song contest.&lt;ref name=ESC1956 /&gt;

=== Voting controversy ===
{{Further|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}
Two jury members from each participating country travelled to Lugano to cast their vote on the songs, except for Luxembourg which was unable to send juries. The EBU conducted a secret voting and a system allowing the juries to also vote for the two songs representing their own country, as well as allowing the Swiss jury to vote on behalf of Luxembourg. Claims were raised that the Swiss entry won as a result of these procedures.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jan Feddersen: Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein. 1. Auflage. Hoffmann und Campe Verlag, Hamburg 2002, {{ISBN|3-455-09350-7}}. S. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; This system was never repeated, as from the second edition of the contest onwards the voting is visible, excludes the jury's own competing country from their voting and includes individual jury members for each country.&lt;ref name=ESC1956/&gt;

=== Lost tapes ===
While the contest was shown and recorded for television broadcasting in certain European countries (as television sets were somewhat uncommon still at this time), no copies have survived, with the exception of Lys Assia's repeat performance at the end of the contest. It is one of only two contests to not have survived completely, along with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964 contest]] (of which the tapes were destroyed in a fire).

== Participating countries ==
{{Further|List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
Seven countries participated in the first ever contest, each were represented with two songs.&lt;ref name=ESC1956 /&gt;  Two more countries, [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]], and [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest|Denmark]] were also expected to take part in the contest, but they missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part.&lt;ref name=ESC1956 /&gt;  Although it was thought that the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}} had also missed the participation deadline, it was later revealed by the EBU in January 2017 that it was a mythical fact created by fans of the contest.&lt;ref name="UK BBC"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Paul |title=Shining a light on the United Kingdom: 60 Years at Eurovision |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=shining_a_light_on_the_united_kingdom_60_years_at_eurovision |website=eurovision.tv |publisher=European Broadcasting Union |accessdate=13 January 2017 |date=11 January 2017 |quote=Contrary to popular fan myths, the UK did not intend to enter in 1956 as the BBC had previously created their own separate contest, the Festival Of British Popular Songs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU further went on to explain that the ''"Festival of British Popular Song"'', a contest created by the [[BBC]] for the United Kingdom, was the inspiration that brought in changes to the contest format from {{Escyr|1957}}.&lt;ref name="UK BBC" /&gt;

=== Conductors ===
Each performance had a [[maestro]] who conducted the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andtheconductoris.eu/|title=http://www.andtheconductoris.eu|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductors listed conducted both performances for the indicated countries.

== Results ==
Except for the winning song, the results have never been published. Simon Barclay's book ''The Complete and Independent Guide to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010'' includes a table with what appears to be the rankings, but the author does not give a source. Under the chart he writes that "the votes awarded have never been disclosed."&lt;ref name="Barclay 24"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barclay |first=Simon |title=The Complete and Independent Guide to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 |publisher=Silverthorn Press |date=17 June 2010 |page=24 |isbn=978-1-4457-8415-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfuBF7fOnyoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Jan Feddersen, "[[Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück]]" was probably voted No. 2 behind Lys Assia.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

'''Exsanguination'''  is the loss of blood to a degree sufficient to cause [[death]]. One does not have to lose all of one's blood to cause death. Depending upon the age, health, and fitness level of the individual, people can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood; a loss of roughly one-third of the blood volume is considered very serious. Even a single deep cut can warrant [[Surgical suture|suturing]] and [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]], especially if [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], a [[vein]] or [[artery]], or another [[comorbidity]] is involved. It is most commonly known as "[[bleeding]] to death" or colloquially as "bleeding out". The word itself originated from Latin: ''ex'' ("out of") and ''sanguis'' ("blood").

== Slaughtering animals ==
Exsanguination is used as a method of [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]].  Before the fatal incision is made, the animal may be rendered insensible to pain by various methods, including [[Captive bolt pistol|captive bolt]], electricity or chemical. Without prior sedation, stunning or anesthetic, this method of slaughter causes a high degree of [[anxiety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition|year=2013|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|isbn=978-1-882691-21-0|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other religiously funded studies contradict these findings.&lt;ref name="schulze_halastudy"&gt;Schulze W, Schultze-Petzold H, Hazem AS, Gross R. ''Experiments for the objectification of pain and consciousness during conventional (captive bolt stunning) and religiously mandated (“ritual cutting”) slaughter procedures for sheep and calves.'' Deutsche Tierärztliche Wochenschrift 1978 Feb 5;85(2):62-6. [http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/halalstudy.htm English translation by Dr Sahib M. Bleher]&lt;/ref&gt; The captive bolt is placed against the skull of the animal, and penetrates to cause tissue destruction in the [[brain]], incapacitating the animal so that the procedure may take place. Electricity is used mostly to incapacitate [[Domestic pig|swine]], [[poultry]] and [[domestic sheep]], whereas a chemical is used for injured [[livestock]].

Continued pumping operation of the [[heart]] during exsanguination increases the rate of depletion, and thus hastens [[Clinical death|death]], by raising the fluid pressure of the blood.  Because the heart operates like a [[positive displacement pump]], reduction of blood volume will not affect efficiency of cardiac output—deprivation of blood to the heart does gradually result in [[Ischemia|diminished function]], but concurrently with similar death of other parts in the body.{{cit|date=June 2015}}

Quickly after the animal is incapacitated it is hung upside down by its hind limbs and an extremely sharp knife, in an orientation parallel to the ground, is fully inserted through the skin just behind the point of the [[jaw]] and below the neck bones. From this position, the knife is drawn forward away from the spine to sever the [[jugular veins]], [[carotid arteries]], and [[windpipe|trachea]]. Properly performed, blood will flow freely and [[death]] will occur within seconds. Sheep and swine will reach brain death in under 10 seconds; however, larger animals, notably cattle may take up to 40 seconds to reach brain death. This period may extend to a couple of minutes if complications, such as arterial occlusion, occur. However, the animal's inverted position allows blood to flow more precipitously and thus makes an animal regaining consciousness before it is fully exsanguinated highly unlikely. In any case, animal welfare advisory councils clearly emphasize that the time from incapacitation to start of exsanguination should be prompt; recommending a time under 15 seconds.&lt;ref name="FAWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb8347.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121007104210/http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb8347.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-07|year=2003|title=Report on the Welfare of Farmed Animals at Slaughter or Killing. Part 1: Red Meat Animals|publisher=Defra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the initial cost of purchasing a captive bolt, continued usage of the method is very inexpensive. The animal is incapacitated for the duration of the procedure, so it is one of the safest methods for the slaughterer.

Slaughter by exsanguination is mandated by Judaic [[kashrut]] (kosher) and Islamic [[dhabihah]] (halal) dietary laws. The double edged pointed knife is prohibited. Instead, a long knife with a squared off end is used that in Jewish law must be at least twice the width of the animal's neck. The operation of sticking or exsanguination is executed faster than when using the pointed knife, as four large blood vessels in the neck are severed simultaneously. 

A 1978 study at the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover]] indicates that these traditional methods, when executed as prescribed by the religious authorities, gave results which proved "...pain and suffering to the extent as has since long been generally associated in public with this kind of slaughter cannot be registered..." and that "[a complete loss of consciousness] occurred generally within considerably less time than during the slaughter method after captive bolt stunning."&lt;ref name="schulze_halastudy"&gt;Schulze W, Schultze-Petzold H, Hazem AS, Gross R. ''Experiments for the objectification of pain and consciousness during conventional (captive bolt stunning) and religiously mandated (“ritual cutting”) slaughter procedures for sheep and calves.'' Deutsche Tierärztliche Wochenschrift 1978 Feb 5;85(2):62-6. [http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/halalstudy.htm English translation by Dr Sahib M. Bleher]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Sharia|Islamic]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]], captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, as consumption of animals found dead are regarded as [[carrion]] and stunned animals that are later killed will come into this category. 

Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed [[fail-safe]] system of head-only stunning using a mushroom shaped hammer head that delivers a blow that is not fatal, proved by it being possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Masood Khawaja|title=Definition of Halal|publisher=Halal Food Authority|date=6 October 2001|url=http://www.halalfoodauthority.co.uk/define.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090427045541/http://www.halalfoodauthority.co.uk/define.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 April 2009|accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Garrett Theatre''' (Portuguese: ''Teatro Garrett'' or ''Cine-Teatro Garrett'', archaic and original Portuguese naming '''Theatro Garrett''') is a theatre located at Rua José Malgueira Street (former rua da Senra street) in [[rua da Junqueira|Junqueira]] quarter, [[Póvoa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]] which is often referred simply as '''Garrett'''. It is one of the historic theatres of Portugal, and some of the best performers of Portuguese, Brazilian and Spanish drama staged there, including [[Ary Fontoura]], [[João Villaret]], [[Laura Alves]], [[Procópio Ferreira]], and [[Ruy de Carvalho]]. Orchestras, [[Tuna (music)|tunas]], variety shows, political meetings were also common in Garrett history.

The theatre is named in honor of famed 19th-century Portuguese playwright [[Almeida Garrett]], who got inspiration to write his most famous work ''Frei Luís de Sousa'' after watching a play in Póvoa around this location. The current location is from 1890 and was, by far, the theater with most longevity and social impact in the city and its vicinity. In the middle of the 20th century, with the popularization of cinema, it became known as Cine-Teatro Garrett or Cinema Garrett.


==History==
===Origins===
[[image:Companhia_de_Variedades.jpg|thumb|left|175px|August 1913 Poster from a Companhia de Variedades artist, from Águia d'Ouro, Porto. During that month, Garrett also staged shows from the Lisbon companies Theatro d`Avenida and Grande Guignol, and foreign artists.]]

The earliest known theatre in Póvoa de Varzim was built in 1793 in [[Rua Santos Minho|Campo das Cobras]], location of all early theaters of Póvoa de Varzim. Theater in Póvoa was already common entertainment for beach-goers in the summers of early 19th century. [[Almeida Garrett]] most famous work ''Frei Luís de Sousa'' was based in one of those plays he watched in Póvoa. Almeida Garrett was also a personal friend of Povoan Francisco Gomes de Amorim. Early ''Teatro Garrett'' (Garrett Theater) was an initiative from a society of five citizens from the city of [[Porto]], who built an elegant woodwork building on August 22, 1873 in [[Praça do Almada]].&lt;ref name="monograf"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Baptista de Lima, João | title = Póvoa de Varzim - Monografia e Materiais para a sua história | publisher = Na Linha do horizonte - Biblioteca Poveira CMPV | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 4th,  1876, Teatro Sá da Bandeira was built, also using wood frame construction. This venue was located in the intersection between rua do Norte (currently Rua da Alegria) and Largo do Rego (currently [[Largo David Alves]]). The popularity of Póvoa de Varzim as a main beach resort, lead to the construction of a permanent edifice for the theatre in 1890, the ''Theatro Garrett'', in an area near the old Sá da Bandeira Theater, which would be the reason for the demolition of the later. All the great and famed Portuguese actors and world fame artists that staged in Póvoa de Varzim transitioned to ''Theatro Garrett''.

It was a fundamental venue for the Povoan society at the time, with impact felt also in Northern Portugal, that came to Póvoa for sea-baths, and several people watched plays, cinema and concerts in there, for the first time in their lives. Several good-will actions were organized in there.

[[image:Teatro_Garrett_Povoa.jpg|thumb|Garrett Theatre as seen from Santos Minho street.]]
In the early years of the 20th century, Póvoa was the preferential route for the great national and international artists, especially Spanish. it was in Póvoa that the stars of the period initiated their tour in Portugal. It was, in Northern Portugal, the location with more show venues, especially coffee houses with musical entertainment, the ''café-concerto''. Each coffee house brought to Póvoa the best in music, drama, and dance. Garrett Theater was the great theater of this period. The national press highlighted the [[operetta]] companies, [[revue]] theatrical entertainment and [[zarzuela]] that were presented in Garrett. Some of these companies included the Sociedade Artística de Lucinda Simões, Lisbon's Teatro Ginásio and Porto's Teatro Nacional presented in there quality plays, and some premiered in there.&lt;ref name="poveirinhos"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Azevedo, José de | title = Poveirinhos pela Graça de Deus | publisher = Na Linha do horizonte - Biblioteca Poveira CMPV | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">The '''General Noble Tree''' was a [[Giant Sequoia]] tree formerly within the [[Converse Basin]] Grove, with its site located in [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], in [[Fresno County, California]].  

The General Noble Tree was cut down in 1892 to create an exhibit for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago. &lt;ref&gt;''See'' McGraw, Donald J., "The Tree That Crossed A Continent", California History, Volume LXI, Number 2 (Summer 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The General Noble Tree, with a ground perimeter of {{convert|95|ft|m}} (measured on a slope), was the second largest tree in the Converse Basin Grove (after the [[Boole (tree)|Boole Tree]]) and it was the largest tree ever cut down.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Flint, Wendell D., "To Find The Biggest Tree", Sequoia Natural History Association (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although not among the very largest [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'')]], the General Noble Tree was perhaps among the top 30 largest Giant Sequoias by volume before it was cut down.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Flint, Wendell D., "To Find The Biggest Tree", Sequoia Natural History Association (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Site===
The remains of the General Noble Tree are known as the '''Chicago Stump''', which can be seen in the Converse Basin Grove.

'''Kay's Cross''' was a large stone [[cross]] (roughly {{convert|20|ft|m}} high by {{convert|13|ft|m}} wide) located at the base of a hollow in northeastern [[Kaysville]], [[Utah]], United States.&lt;ref name="Weeks2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andy Weeks|title=Haunted Utah: Ghosts and Strange Phenomena of the Beehive State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dguvc3MitQC&amp;pg=PT35|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-4875-9|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are disputed, and several urban legends are tied to the site.&lt;ref name="SceurmanMoran2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Sceurman|author2=Mark Moran|author3=Matt Lake|title=Weird U.S.: The Oddyssey Continues : Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCQ_rQmzqfgC&amp;pg=PA286|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-4544-7|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross was demolished with explosives by unknown persons in 1992.

==Origin==
One account of the origin of the cross states it was built in 1946 by locals influenced by [[Krishna Venta]], a religious leader in the 1940s and 50s, who [[List of people claimed to be Jesus|claimed to be the Second Coming of Christ]] and led a small sect based out of [[Simi Valley, California]]. However other locals dispute this and say the cross was built by followers of a Mormon offshoot group lead by a man named Kingston.&lt;ref name="Deseret"&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/219287/ANOTHER-ANGLE-SURFACES-IN-KAYS-CROSS-SAGA.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition==
[[File:K on Kay's Cross.jpg|right|thumb|The 'K' on Kay's Cross in 2010]]

On 15 February 1992, the cross was destroyed by an explosion; police made no immediate arrests.&lt;ref name="Deseret"/&gt;

In 2013, a "haunted" tour of Kay's Cross and the surrounding forest was started, stirring interest again in the decades-old legend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hauntedkayscross.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kayla Mendoza''' is an American woman who was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2015 after being convicted of killing two women while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], on November 17, 2013. She was 20 years old and not licensed to drive at the time. Mendoza is infamously known for [[Twitter|tweeting]]: "2 drunk 2 care" hours before the fatal accident.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/05/kayla-mendoza-2-drunk-2-care_n_7212462.html |title=Driver Who Tweeted '2 Drunk 2 Care' Sentenced To 24 Years For Killing 2 In Wrong-Way Car Crash |author=Jaurequi, Andres |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |date=2015-05-05 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash and sentence==
On the night of November 16, 2013, Mendoza, who was 20 years old at the time, went with her manager and co-workers from her job at a [[T-Mobile US]] store to the Tijuana Taxi Co., a local bar in [[Coral Springs, Florida|Coral Springs]], where she reportedly drank two "fishbowl" margaritas. Hours later, she got into a [[Hyundai Sonata#Fourth generation (1998–2004)|Hyundai Sonata]] and drove into the [[Florida State Road 869|Sawgrass Expressway]] the wrong way at 80&amp;nbsp;mph before colliding with a [[Toyota Camry (XV50)|2012 Toyota Camry]] driven by Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio, both aged 21, just after 1:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on November 17. Catronio was instantly killed in the crash while Ferrante died in the hospital days later.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami New Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/alleged-killer-kayla-mendoza-tweets-2-drunk-2-care-before-causing-horrific-accident-6546983 |title=Alleged Killer Kayla Mendoza Tweets "2 Drunk 2 Care" Before Causing Horrific Accident |author=McCoy, Terrence |publisher=''[[Miami New Times]]'' |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendoza broke both legs in the crash and was confined to a wheelchair for over a year. She was charged with two counts of DUI manslaughter while impaired, two counts of DUI manslaughter with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, two counts of vehicular homicide, and two counts of driving without a license, causing death.&lt;ref name="Broward-Palm Beach New Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/parents-of-victims-of-kayla-2-drunk-2-care-mendoza-suing-her-former-job-6446898 |title=Parents of Victims of Kayla "2 Drunk 2 Care" Mendoza Suing Her Former Job |author=Joseph, Chris |publisher=''[[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]]'' |date=2014-10-30 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours before the crash, Mendoza posted: "2 drunk 2 care" on her [[Twitter]] account. She had proclaimed herself as a "pothead princess" on her account and posted quotes indicating her addiction to alcohol and [[Cannabis|marijuana]], such as: "My car permanently smells like weed" and "I really am so baked right now".&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami New Times"/&gt; Mendoza's then-boyfriend Javier Reyes, who owned the Hyundai Sonata involved in the crash, explained that the "2 drunk 2 care" tweet was directed toward him.&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/2-drunk-2-care-driver-who-killed-2-is-hit-with-lawsuit/ |title="2 drunk 2 care" deadly driver had no license, faces lawsuit |author=Dahl, Julia |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of Ferrante and Catronio filed lawsuits against Mendoza, Reyes, The Tijuana Taxi Co., and the T-Mobile store Mendoza was employed to.&lt;ref name="Broward-Palm Beach New Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt;

On May 4, 2015, two months after pleading guilty of two DUI manslaughter charges, Mendoza was sentenced to 24 years in prison.

'''Kurt Riezler''' (February 11, 1882 &amp;ndash; September 5, 1955) was a German [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[diplomat]]. A top-level cabinet adviser in the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]], he negotiated Germany's underwriting of Russia's [[October Revolution]] and authored the 1914 [[Septemberprogramm|September Program]] which outlined German war aims during [[World War I]]. The posthumous publication of his secret notes and diaries played a role in the "[[Fritz Fischer|Fischer]] Controversy" among German historians in the early 1960s.

==Early life==

Riezler was born in [[Munich]] in 1882 to a prominent Catholic family; his grandfather had co-founded the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank (now [[HypoVereinsbank]], [[UniCredit]] Group). He studied [[classics]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]] and was granted his doctorate in economic history with highest honors in 1905. His prize-winning thesis on the ''Oikonomika,'' a classical Greek treatise once attributed to [[Aristotle]], was soon published. After working as a journalist for the ''[[Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]],'' a semi-official newspaper, he joined the press section of the [[German Foreign Office]] in 1907 and attracted the attention of [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]] became chancellor of Germany in 1909, Riezler became his chief adviser and confidant.

==Political career==

Riezler's duties in the chancellor's office concerned primarily, but not exclusively, foreign policy. In 1914 he authored the [[Septemberprogramm|September Program]] which proposed as possible German war aims limited annexations, a hard peace for France, and a Belgian [[vassal state]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.98-9&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1917 he was posted to the German embassy in [[Stockholm]] to arrange a cease-fire on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], and then to [[Moscow]] as the top aide to Germany's ambassador to Russia, [[Wilhelm Mirbach|Count Wilhelm von Mirbach]]. Riezler was an eyewitness to Mirbach's assassination by the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]] on 9 July 1918, having unwittingly ushered the gunman [[Yakov Blumkin]] into Mirbach's presence.

During this period, Riezler served as the conduit for German subsidies to the [[Bolshevik]]s and personally negotiated these with [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s representatives [[Karl Radek]] and [[Alexander Parvus]]. Riezler later claimed privately that it had been his own idea to transport Lenin in the famous "sealed train" from [[Zurich]] through Germany to Russia in April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, Riezler became a staunch supporter of the [[Weimar Republic]]. He joined the [[German Democratic Party]], contributed regularly to the pro-Weimar newspaper ''[[Die Deutsche Nation]],'' and served as the Foreign Office's representative during the drafting of the [[Weimar Constitution]]. From November 1919 until April 1920 he was chief of cabinet to President [[Friedrich Ebert]] and played a central role in suppressing the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kapp Putsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.204-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

In 1927 he was named ''[[Kurator]]'' of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], to which he attracted a distinguished faculty that included [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], [[Adolph Lowe]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Paul Tillich]], and [[Max Wertheimer]]. Riezler consequently played a crucial role in the 1930 inception of the [[Frankfurt School]]; for example, it was Riezler who recommended [[Herbert Marcuse]] to [[Max Horkheimer]]. Because of his concurrent appointment to the philosophy faculty, Riezler was also prominent in German philosophical circles. In 1929 Riezler sided with [[Martin Heidegger]] during the famous "Davos encounter" with [[Ernst Cassirer]] and wrote an eyewitness account of this event, "Davoser Hochschulkurse 1929," for the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]].''

Riezler was forced out of the university in April 1933 by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] but, having been allowed by them to draw his pension, remained in Germany for the next five years, publishing books on [[aesthetics]] and [[Parmenides]].

==Emigration==

In late 1938 he contacted the [[Kreisau Circle]], an aristocratic anti-Nazi faction, and soon emigrated to the United States to accept a professorship in philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]]. He was to remain at that institution until his retirement, interspersed with visiting professorships at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. During this period he became a close friend and colleague of the political philosopher [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted the final chapter of his book ''What is Political Philosophy?'' to Riezler. Noting that Riezler's philosophy was "shaped by both the influence of Heidegger and the reaction to him," Strauss concludes that it "was ultimately because he grasped the meaning of shame and awe that Riezler was a liberal, a lover of privacy."

Kurt Riezler returned to Europe in 1954, lived for some time in Rome and died in Munich in 1955. He was preceded in death by his wife Käthe (1885-1952), daughter of the German impressionist painter [[Max Liebermann]]. His survivors included their daughter Maria, wife of Howard B. White (1912-1974), a New School professor of political philosophy who had been Leo Strauss's first graduate student; and his brother Walter Riezler (1878-1965), a prominent musicologist, art historian and associate of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">'''Lee–Jackson Day''' is a [[legal holiday]] celebrated in the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], for the birthdays of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] generals [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Jackson Day, Lexington VA|url=http://www.leejacksonday.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original holiday, created in 1889, celebrated Lee's birthday on January 19th. Jackson's name was added to the holiday in 1904; his birthday was January 21st.

In 1983, the holiday was merged with the new Federal holiday, [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]], as [[Lee–Jackson–King Day]] in Virginia.  This merger was reversed in 2000.

Lee–Jackson Day is currently observed on the second Friday in January, which precedes [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] (the third Monday in January). Typical events include a wreath-laying ceremony with military honors, a Civil War themed parade, symposia, and a gala ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee–Jackson Day|url=http://www.virginia.org/Listings/EventsAndExhibits/LeeJacksonDay/|publisher=Virginia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;   State offices are closed for both holidays.&lt;ref name="stateholiday1"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/payandholidaycalendar.html |title=Pay and Holiday Calendar  |publisher=Virginia DHRM |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to the 1960 census, the inhabitants of the three villages were entirely Turkish Cypriots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kypros-cyprus.com/maps/1960.jpg Map of Cyprus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028223100/http://www.kypros-cyprus.com/maps/1960.jpg |date=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of Maratha and Santalaris was 207.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fagrino.org%2Falexneo%2Fvillages.pdf&amp;date=2011-02-27 ΚΥΠΡΟΣ - CYPRUS (612 villages, 9251,47 Km²)]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, the total population of the villages had risen to 270, with 124 in Maratha, 100 in Santalaris and 46 in Aloda. However, in July 1974, following the first [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], all men of fighting age were taken away as [[prisoners of war]] to internment camps in [[Famagusta]] and from there transferred to [[Limassol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famagusta|url=http://www.prio-cyprus-displacement.net/default.asp?id=253|publisher=PRIO Cyprus Center|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aloa|url=http://www.prio-cyprus-displacement.net/default.asp?id=554|publisher=PRIO Cyprus Center|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Massacre ==
On 20 July 1974, the men of the villages were arrested by EOKA-B and sent to [[Limassol]]. Following this, according to testimonials cited by [[Sevgül Uludağ]], EOKA-B men from the neighboring village of [[Peristeronopigi]] came, got drunk in the camp they established in the village coffeehouse, fired shots in the air, and subsequently raped many women and young girls. The rape later included the boys and this continued till 14 August 1974. Upon the launch of the second invasion of the Turkish Army, they decided not to leave behind any witnesses and killed the entire population of the villages present at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uludağ|first1=Sevgül|authorlink1=Sevgül Uludağ|title=From Maratha to Voni: Rapes as a weapon of war…|url=http://sevgululudag.blogspot.com.tr/2014/07/from-maratha-to-voni-rapes-as-weapon-of.html|publisher=Politis|accessdate=23 April 2015|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uludağ|first1=Sevgül|title=The story of Assia (Pasakoy) and Afanya (Gazikoy)|url=http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~durduran/hamambocu/authors/svg/svg9_2_2008.html|publisher=Hamamböcüleri Journal|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maratha and Santalaris, 84-89 were killed.

According to Greek Cypriot writer and researcher Tony Angastiniotis, at least one of the attackers used a mainland Greek accent, which suggested that he was a Greek officer.&lt;ref&gt;Asmussen, Jan. ''Cyprus at war: diplomacy and conflict during the 1974 crisis'' (2008), I.B. Tauris, p. 349: "Angastiniotis relates that at least one of the attackers had spoken with a mainland Greek accent suggesting that he had been a junior mainland officer."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
The [[United Nations]] described the massacre as a [[crime against humanity]], by saying "constituting a further crime against humanity committed by the Greek and Greek Cypriot gunmen."&lt;ref&gt;''UN monthly chronicle, Volume 11 (1974)'', United Nations, Office of Public Information, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=rSlUTcuUIoOCOr3w1agJ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=zichAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Maratha+massacre+cyprus&amp;q=Maratha#search_anchor p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was reported by international media, including ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Henry Dodd, ''The political, social and economic development of Northern Cyprus'' (1993), Eothen Press, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=3ilUTdfZKIOv8gPXxs3uBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Cm6gAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Maratha+massacre+cyprus&amp;q=Maratha#search_anchor p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Gerald Flitcroft''' (23 November 1929 – 24 March 2007) was a British [[golf]]er and audacious [[hoax]]er.

Flitcroft became notorious after hitting a score of 121 in the qualifying competition for the [[1976 Open Championship]]—the highest score recorded at the [[Open Championship]]—and by a self-professed "professional golfer".&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|last2=Farnarby|first2=Simon|title=The Phantom of the Open|year=2010|publisher=Yellow Jersey Press|isbn=978-0-224-08317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he gained significant media attention, being referred to as "the world's worst golfer". Following the 1976 Open, the rules were changed to prevent Flitcroft from attempting to enter again. Undeterred, he regularly attempted to enter the Open and several other golf competitions, either under his own name or under pseudonyms such as Gene Paceky (as in paycheque), Gerald Hoppy, and James Beau Jolley.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt; Flitcroft was married to Jean (died 2002) by whom he had two sons—one of whom caddied for him.

He is the subject of a biography, ''The Phantom of the Open'', by Scott Murray and [[Simon Farnaby]], published by [[Yellow Jersey Press]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt;

In his obituary, [[The Daily Telegraph]] commented thus:

:Maurice Flitcroft ...was a [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] shipyard crane-operator from [[Barrow-in-Furness]] whose persistent attempts to [[Gate crashing|gatecrash]] the British Open golf championship produced a sense of humour failure among members of the golfing establishment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1547158/Maurice-Flitcroft.html|title=Maurice Flitcroft|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Flitcroft was born in [[Manchester]] on 23 November 1929.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== The 1976 Open Championship ==
According to his unpublished memoirs, Flitcroft took up the game after watching the [[1974 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup |title=Crazy golfer |last=Murray |first=Scott |date=19 September 2008 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flitcroft had golfing ambitions well above his ability and came to notoriety in 1976 when, posing as a professional golfer, he managed to obtain a place to play in the qualifying round of [[The Open Championship]]—despite his previous experience amounting only to some hacking around on playing fields near his home. Flitcroft recalled, "I was looking to find fame and fortune but only achieved one of the two". He was inspired to enter the tournament by Walter Danecki, a postal worker from [[Milwaukee]] who, after being barred from becoming a professional by the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]], entered the [[1965 Open Championship]] after telling the R&amp;A that he was a pro and set a two-round score of 221 during qualifying.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

When he discovered, to his shock, that any amateurs entering competitions had to have an official [[Golf handicap|handicap]]—something he lacked—he simply declared himself to be a professional. It was in the same 1976 Open that a young new player, the 19-year-old [[Seve Ballesteros]] first came to the public's attention. Flitcroft prepared for the tournament by studying a golf instruction manual by [[Peter Alliss]] which was borrowed from his local library. He further studied from instructional articles by the 1966 [[PGA Championship]] winner [[Al Geiberger]], and honed his skills on a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

His deception (and ineptitude) were uncovered when he managed to card a 49-[[Over par|over-par]] 121—the worst score in the tournament's history; some of the other professionals playing with him were so angry that they successfully demanded a refund of their entry fees. In addition the R&amp;A gave him a lifetime ban from all their courses.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt; It seems that none of the professionals noticed that his gear comprised only a red [[Imitation leather|imitation-leather]] bag and half a set of [[Mail order|mail-order]] clubs. As a result of his abilities, he became known as "[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|The Royal &amp; Ancient]] Rabbit".

== Other work ==
After leaving school, Flitcroft joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. Following his marriage, he and his wife settled in Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked as a crane operator at the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] shipyard.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At other times he worked as a shoe polish salesman and an ice cream man.&lt;ref name=chortle&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/26939/the_worlds_worst_golfer,_coming_to_cinemas# |title=The world's worst golfer, coming to cinemas |last=Richardson |first=Jay |date=24 February 2017 |website=[[Chortle]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2006 article in Golfonline, Flitcroft said, "I was in show business. I toured with a [[revue]], and I used to jump into a tank on the stage, I was a stuntcomedy [[high diver]]. The revue used to tour all the country and I would dive into this tank. It wasn't all glass, just the front so the spectators could see what was going on under the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0,17742,1206885,00.html |title=Cloak and hacker |publisher=GolfOnline |first=Seth |last=Kelly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210007/http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0%2C17742%2C1206885%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After 1976 ==

After his initiation into celebrity golf, Flitcroft briefly became a C-list celebrity and had various golf trophies (usually those celebrating poor play or egregious mishaps) named after him; he also had the distinction of having the "Maurice Gerald Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament" named after him by the 1988 Blythefield Country Club in [[Grand Rapids]]. Buddy Whitten, Blythefield's head pro stated that, "It started as a lark, but most people can't break 90 so they relate more to Maurice than they would to a touring pro." By the time of the 22nd Maurice G. Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament, which was held in May 2000, the club had featured a [[Putting green|green]] with two [[Hole (golf)|holes]] so that even the most errant of approaches were potentially rewarded. If this wasn't enough another green had a {{Convert|12|in||adj=on}} cup.

In 1988, Flitcroft himself was flown to Blythefield to play in the event. He is reported as having told the members there that it was the first time he and his wife had been out of the house together "since their gas oven exploded." Whitten further said, "It was a different sort of experience, I'd never met a crane operator from England. But his game had gotten a little better than I expected. I think he shot in the low 90s." Flitcroft said of his performance, "I wasn't playing too well. Some faults had crept into my swing. But I hit a lot of good shots.”

Flitcroft retired from [[Vickers]] in the 1970s and devoted himself to his golf—but was reduced to the ignominy of once again playing on local fields, having been banned from every local golf club after sneaking into their grounds to play without permission.

Many years after his rise to fame, Flitcroft still received [[Mail|post]] which had been addressed simply to: Maurice Flitcroft, Golfer, England.

In 2017 comedian and writer Simon Farnaby, who co-wrote a biography of Flitcroft, stated that he was writing a film script based on the book.&lt;ref name=chortle /&gt;

'''Agnès Marin''' ({{Birth date|1997|11|26}} &amp;ndash; November 11, 2011) was a 13-year-old girl who was murdered on November 11, 2011 in Chambon-sur-Lignon, France. The murder was committed by 17 year-old Mathieu Moulinas, who at the time was on parole while awaiting trial for rape of another girl.

== Early life ==
Agnès Marin was born to Paola and Frederic Marin. According to a close friend, she was a good student who was interested in becoming a filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cornevin|first=Christophe|title=Murder of Agnes: "We heard two loud cries"|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/11/20/01016-20111120ARTFIG00174-meutre-d-agnes-un-collegien-temoigne.php|work=Le Figaro|accessdate=13 May 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had enrolled her at the ''Cévenolles'' boarding school in ''4th grade''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The French equivalent of the Eighth grade in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; after being exposed to negative influences including [[marijuana]] at her former junior high school. She was [[Burial|buried]] on her would-be 14th [[birthday]], November 26, 2011.

== Murder ==
On November 11, 2011, in [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon-sur-Lignon]], in the département of [[Haute-Loire]],  Agnès Marin,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Even through juvenile victims' names should not be released as stipulated by French law, hers was released by her family.&lt;/ref&gt; a 13-year-old student at [[Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International|''Les Cévenoles'' Boarding School]], went with Mathieu Moulinas, another student,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Although French law is forbidden to reveal any information enabling to name a minor offender, his last name leaked to the press as "Moulinas"&lt;/ref&gt; who was nearly 18 at the time, to look for [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]] in a forest. Once there, Moulinas proceeded to [[rape]] and [[stabbed|stab]] Agnès 17 times before finally burning her body with petrol that he had brought to the site previously.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = France in shock over rape and murder of 13-year old girl|date = November 21, 2011|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8904642/France-in-shock-over-rape-and-murder-of-13-year-old-girl.html|last = Samuel|first = Henry|work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate = November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = French girl Agnes Marin raped and killed by 17-year-old|date = November 22, 2011|url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/french-girl-agnes-marin-was-raped-and-burned-by-17-year-old/story-e6frf7lf-1226202288756|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate = November 9, 2013|newspaper = [[Herald Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
At his trial before the ''[[Cour d'assises|Cour d'assises des mineurs]]''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Court for juvenile offenders committing ''crimes'' (offences punished by at least 10 years in prison)&lt;/ref&gt; that began on June 18, 2013 and was held ''[[in camera]]'' for the most part at the request of Salomé F. in spite of the Marins' wishes and during which Mathieu recognized his guilt, the prosecutor criticized the numerous failings of the institutions and asked the jury to not grant the benefit of minority to Moulinas,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The ''excuse de minorité'' (see {{Interlanguage link multi|Youth justice in France|fr|3=Justice des mineurs en France}}) in French law the means the maximum sentence for a minor is divided by two, so the maximum is reduced to 20 years for life-eligible crimes.&lt;/ref&gt; instead asking for a 30-year sentence and [[civil commitment]], taking into account the fact Moulinas had mental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Haute-Loire - Meurtre d'Agnès : "Un crime exceptionnel, avec un accusé exceptionnel"|date = June 28, 2013|url = http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/meurtre-d-agnes-30-ans-de-reclusion-criminelle-requis-contre-matthieu-28-06-2013-1686928_23.php|last = Colonna d'Istria|first = Geneviève|newspaper = [[Le Point]]|accessdate = November 8, 2013|language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2013, Moulinas was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], a sentence which had not been met against a juvenile since [[Patrick Dils]] in 1989 (who was subsequently exonerated in 2002.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = French minor given life sentence over rape of 13 year old girl|date = June 30, 2013|url = http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20130630-french-minor-given-life-sentence-over-rape-13-year-old-girl|newspaper = [[Radio France International]]|accessdate = November 1, 2013|type = radio|department = Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[lawyer]]s [[appeal]]ed the sentence the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Meurtre d'Agnès Marin: les avocates de Matthieu font appel|date = June 29, 2013|url = http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/06/29/meurtre-d-agnes-marin-les-avocates-de-matthieu-font-appel_914662|last = |first = |newspaper = [[Libération]]|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate = November 9, 2013|language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
The murder was committed during a time when the French public was debating juvenile criminality and recidivism among offenders.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Some in France criticized the several different failures of the judicial system, whether by freeing such a suspect after three months of remand and putting him in a [[Co-educational|co-ed]] [[boarding school]] or the lack of candor of Moulinas's judicial supervisor about Moulinas's near-expulsion for typing "[[Child pornography|pedo sex]]" in a search engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Autopsie d'un drame|date = June 20, 2012|url = http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/20/autopsie-d-un-drame_1721770_3224.html|last = Davet|first = Gérard|work = [[Le Monde]]|accessdate = November 7, 2013|location = France|trans-title=Autopsy of a drama|language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Un proche de la 1ère victime de l'agresseur d'Agnès parle|date = November 22, 2011|url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/11/22/01016-20111122ARTFIG00402-un-proche-de-la-1ere-victime-de-l-agresseur-d-agnes-parle.php|last = Amadeo|first = Fabrice|accessdate = November 8, 2011|newspaper =[[Le Figaro]]|language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = France Calls for Reform After Murder of Girl, 13|date = November 23, 2011|url = http://plus.lefigaro.fr/note/france-calls-for-reform-after-murder-of-girl-13-20111123-607566|work =[[Le Figaro]]|accessdate = November 8, 2013|department = Le Figaro in English|location = France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the prosecution argued the school was aware Moulinas was charged for rape, the school stated they were not aware of the exact reason why he was under investigation. His father said he alluded his son was under investigation for a sexual offense.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, the father of the victim claims that the school was aware that Moulinas had problems involving "sexual acts of aggression." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15828349|title = School murder scandal shocks France

=== Appeal ===
On {{date|2014-10-10|mdy}}, his life sentence was confirmed by the Appeal Assize Court, ending any possibility of the revision of the rulings on the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/10/10/l-assassin-d-agnes-marin-condamne-a-la-reclusion-a-perpetuite-en-appel_4504477_3224.html|title = Assassinat d'Agnès Marin : Matthieu M. condamné à la réclusion à perpétuité en appel|last = |first = |date = October 10, 2014|work = Le Monde|accessdate = October 10, 2014|language = fr|trans-title = Murder of Agnès Marin : Matthieu M. sentenced to life after appealing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nadja Benaissa''' (born 26 April 1982) is a German recording artist, television personality, and occasional actress. She rose to fame in late 2000 when she auditioned for the [[reality television]] show ''[[Popstars (Germany)|Popstars]]'' on [[RTL II]]. The programme announced that Benaissa had won a place as a member of the [[girl group|all-female]] pop band [[No Angels]]. The group has achieved massive success and went on to become the "biggest-selling German [[All female band|girlband]] to date".

After a series of commercially successful releases with the group, Benaissa released her solo debut album ''[[Schritt für Schritt]]'' in 2006. The semi-autobiographical album was recorded entirely in [[German language|German]], taking Benaissa's work further into [[soul music|soul]], [[R&amp;B music|R&amp;B]] and [[jazz music]],&lt;ref name="soulsite"&gt;{{cite web|work=SoulSite.de |title=Interview :: Nadja Benaissa – Was für die Seele gut ist :: 01.02.2006 |url=http://www.soulsite.de/interviews/interview.shtml?id=20 |language=German|accessdate=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enjoyed moderate commercial success.&lt;ref name="soulsite"/&gt;

In February 2010, she was charged with causing bodily harm by [[Law enforcement in Germany|German police]] for having [[unprotected sex]] with three men between 2004 and 2006, without informing them she was [[HIV]]-positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7998981.stm|title=German star arrested in HIV case|work=BBC News|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8512933.stm "German girl band star charged in HIV case"].

== Early life ==
Benaissa is the second child born to a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] father, Muhamed Benaissa,&lt;ref name="woodZ"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Booth|title='I knew I was HIV positive'|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/19/nadja-benaissa-interview-hiv-positive|date=19 March 2011|accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mother of mixed [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Germans|German]] ethnicity with German citizenship, Sabina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Tristana|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1891838,00.html|title=In Germany, No Angels Star Nadja Benaissa Faces HIV Charges|work=TIME|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised alongside her three years older brother Amin,&lt;ref name="spiegelspezial"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article about German Muslims: ''Kümmeltürke oder Terrorist?''|work=[[Der Spiegel]] Spezial Nr. 2/2008|url=http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=56323064&amp;aref=image036/2008/03/24/ROSPC200800200440047.PDF|language=German|accessdate=25 March 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420032242/http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=56323064&amp;aref=image036%2F2008%2F03%2F24%2FROSPC200800200440047.PDF|archivedate=20 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she spent much of her childhood in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]], [[Hesse]], where her parents worked in the catering business, and she attended the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule.&lt;ref name="bidl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Angel, Aids und die Angst|work=[[Bild]]|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/unterhaltung/leute/2009/04/19/no-angels-star-nadja/der-engel-aids-und-die-angst.html|language=German|date=19 April 2009|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of nine, Benaissa began playing instruments, learning the [[piano]] and the [[flute]].&lt;ref name="RBB"&gt;{{cite web|title=''ZIBB'' report|work=RBB-Online|url=http://www.rbb-online.de/_/zibb/beitrag_jsp/key=4232139.html |language=German|accessdate=30 December 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early musical interest grew after having auditioned and won a role in the school stage musical ''[[Tabaluga]]'' during her first year at the [[Dreieich|Dreieich-Schule-Langen]].&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; In her early teenage years, she began writing songs, and at the age of 13 Benaissa started performing in several [[cover band]]s within the [[Frankfurt am Main]] area,&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; eventually winning the second place at ''[[Jugend musiziert]]'', a supraregional music contest for youths.&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt;

On 25 October 1999,&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; at the age of 17, Benaissa gave birth to her daughter Leila Jamila, an event which she describes as "the proudest moment of [her] life".&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; Although Benaissa and her boyfriend ended their relationship, Benaissa began attending evening classes in pursuit of her [[Realschulabschluss]] school certificate.&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== 2000–2003: Breakthrough with No Angels ===
{{Main|No Angels}}

In mid-2000, Benaissa, along with thousands of other women, applied for the debut installment of the German reality television program ''[[Popstars]]'', a talent show looking to put together an [[all-female band]]. Sailing through the selection process, judges [[Simone Angel]], Rainer Moslener and Mario M. Mendryzcki were generally impressed by her performances, which earned her a position in the top ten finalists despite her struggle with dancing choreography.&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; During a special episode in November 2000, jury member Angel eventually disclosed that Benaissa had been selected to become part of the final five-member girl group [[No Angels]]. Initially hesitant about signing a recording contract which would force her to leave her baby daughter with her parents, the show's producers remained persuasive and Benaissa eventually agreed on joining the band.&lt;ref name="woodZ"/&gt;

[[File:No Angels.jpg|thumb|upight|left|[[No Angels]] performing on-stage at the [[Kiel|Kieler Woche]] on 27 June 2008.]] With the final five members of the band in place, ''Popstars'' continued tracking the development and struggles of the group who left homes to move into a shared flat near [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. However, it took another four months until the band released their debut single "[[Daylight in Your Eyes]]", which would subsequently appear on the band's debut album ''[[Elle'ments]]'' (2001). Both the single and the album became an unexpected but record-breaking success, when both instantly entered the top position on the Austrian, German and Swiss ''[[Media Control Charts|Media Control]]'' singles, albums and airplay charts, giving No Angels one of the most successful debuts in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografie » No Angels|work=Chart-King|url=http://www.chart-king.de/include.php?path=content/news.php&amp;contentid=13098|language=German|accessdate=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from the separation from her daughter, Benaissa [[Burnout (psychology)|burned out]] within months, a subject on which she later commented:

{{quote|"I was completely unprepared, overwhelmed with the work and the fame. I enjoyed being with the girls, singing, recording, but it was more about keeping the media interested – there was always a camera in your face. And I had no time for my daughter."}}

Nevertheless, Benaissa decided to remain with the band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadja denkt ans Aufhören|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,193449,00.html|language=German|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following years the No Angels released another two number-one studio albums, ''[[Now ... Us!]]'' and ''[[Pure (No Angels album)|Pure]]'', a live album and a successful [[Swing (genre)|swing]] album branded ''[[When the Angels Swing]]'', totalling twelve singles altogether – including four-number one singles. Eventually selling more than five million singles and albums worldwide, the No Angels became the best-selling [[Girl group|German girl band]] to date&lt;ref name="presseportal"&gt;{{cite web|work=Presseportal|title=Bettina Cramer trifft die erfolgreichste deutsche Girlband: BLITZ Spezial über die No Angels am 6.4.2007, 18.45 Uhr|url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/6708/966608/sat_1|language=German|accessdate=5 April 2007 |quote=''Die erfolgreichste deutsche Girl-Band verkaufte fünf Millionen CDs, erhielt unzählige Auszeichnungen (u.a. "Goldene Kamera", "Echo") und landete vier Nummer-1-Hits.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most successful girl group of [[Continental Europe]] between the years of 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref name="presseportal"/&gt; On 5 September 2003, the four remaining members of the band ([[Jessica Wahls]] had left the band following the birth of her first child in February 2003) announced that they would no longer be performing together after three years of continual touring and increasing cases of illness. The release of ''[[The Best of No Angels]]'' in November of the same year marked the end of the band, with each member going their separate ways in early 2004.&lt;ref name="presseportal"/&gt;

=== 2005–2006: Launching a solo career ===
While her former bandmates pursued solo careers in music and television, Benaissa, who had suffered from intense sleep deprivation,&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite web|work=Presseportal|title=''Planet'' Interview|url=http://www.planet-interview.de/interviews/pi.php?interview=benaissa-nadja-15032006|accessdate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided to focus on her recovered motherhood the following months.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt; In fall 2004, however, she signed a solo contract with the [[Universal Music|urban music division of Universal Music]] and started work on her debut album. Encouraged to perform [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&amp;B music]] with lyrics in [[German language]] after a 2001 participation in the [[Brothers Keepers|Sisters Keepers]] project's single "Liebe &amp; Verstand," Benaissa decided to focus on writing songs with German lyrics only.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt; As a result, she released her first solo single, "Es Ist Liebe," produced by Tino Oac, in September 2005. The [[Motown]]-inspired ballad received positive reception from music critics, but failed to reach the top 50 of the [[German Singles Chart]].

In the fall of 2005 Benaissa went on tour as a supporting act for the German leg of ''[[Simply Red]] – In Concert''.&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; Afterwards she prepared the release of her second single "Ich Hab Dich," which was chosen to represent [[Hesse]] on the [[Bundesvision Song Contest#Bundesvision Song Contest 2006|2nd Bundesvision Song Contest]]. Benaissa eventually finished fourth with 104 points, while the single entered at number 36 on the [[German Singles Chart]]. Two weeks later ''Schritt für Schritt'' was released, yet barely reaching the top 70.&lt;ref name="RBB"/&gt; In June 2006, Benaissa participated in another non-profit-making aid project when she provided vocals for the [[Fury in the Slaughterhouse]] cover, "Won't Forget These Days," released during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

=== 2007–present: Reformation of the band ===
[[File:Nadja Benaissa 3.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Benaissa in concert in 2008.]]
Although Benaissa was preparing her second studio album for a February 2007 release,&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt; involving production by German [[Record producer|producer]]s Audiotreats, DJ Desue, Loomis Green, MRF Entertainment, and Monroe among others,&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;{{cite web|title=''094life.de'' Interview|work=094life.de|url=http://www.094life.de/index.php?page=094tv&amp;video_id=36 |language=German|accessdate=19 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829044920/http://www.094life.de/index.php?page=094tv&amp;video_id=36 |archivedate = 29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; she decided to postpone the release in favour of a reunion of the [[No Angels]] in early 2007. However, as all four band members had settled on the continuation of solo projects, Benaissa entered Berlin recording studios in January 2008 to record fifteen new [[Demo (music)|demo songs]], including material she already penned in 2003.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;"Blog." ''Official Nadja Benaissa [[MySpace]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her [[MySpace]] [[blog]], she finished the album recordings with a second session in March 2008.&lt;ref name="thirteen"/&gt;

In May 2010, No Angels began their five-date acoustic "An Intimate Evening With" tour in Munich, their first [[concert tour]] in eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 March 2010|title=Exklusive Akustik-Clubtour im Mai 2010 mit Konzerten in München, Frankfurt, Köln, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|publisher=Online-Artikel.de|language=German|url=http://www.online-artikel.de/article/an-intimate-evening-with-no-angels-43246-1.html|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benaissa did not take part in the tour as she had called in sick a week before, prompting the remaining trio to re-arrange their set at the last minute.&lt;ref name="fnp1"&gt;{{cite web|date=20 May 2010|title=No Angels: Da Waren’s Nur Noch Drei|publisher=Frankfurter Neue Presse|language=German|url=http://www.fnp.de/fnp/region/lokales/no-angels-da-waren-s-nur-noch-drei_rmn01.c.7710117.de.html|accessdate=30 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005145455/http://www.fnp.de/fnp/region/lokales/no-angels-da-waren-s-nur-noch-drei_rmn01.c.7710117.de.html|archivedate=5 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bild11"&gt;{{cite web|date=26 August 2010|title=Bleibt Nadja Benaissa Ein No Angel?|work=Bild|language=German|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/Newsticker/news-ticker/2010/08/26/26-20-nadja.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829155241/http://www.bild.de/BILD/Newsticker/news-ticker/2010/08/26/26-20-nadja.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 August 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, after months of speculation, the singer announced via [[MySpace]] that she had quit the band for good, leaving the No Angels as a trio.&lt;ref name="nb10"/&gt; In her statement, Benaissa claimed she felt that she had become bigger than the group, stating: "The scandal, the trial – they were overwhelmed by it [...] They'll be fine without me."&lt;ref name="woodZ"/&gt;

Also in September 2010, Benaissa released her biography ''Alles wird gut'', written by Tinka Dippel.

== History ==
The festival was conceptualised by [[Baisali Mohanty]], a Master’s Degree student at [[University of Oxford]] and a classical dancer and choreographer, to help popularise [[Odissi]] and other forms of [[Indian classical dance]] at one of the premier seat of learning. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160504/jsp/odisha/story_83592.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=67003 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506163458/http://orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=67003 |archivedate=2016-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the festival was held on May 27, 2016, at the Grove Auditorium of [[Magdalen College]], [[University of Oxford]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.prameyanews7.com/en/may2016/odisha/24350/3-day-Odissi-fest-at-Oxford-University-from-today-Odissi-fest-at-Oxford-UniversityOdisha.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602160925/http://www.prameyanews7.com/en/may2016/odisha/24350/3-day-Odissi-fest-at-Oxford-University-from-today-Odissi-fest-at-Oxford-UniversityOdisha.htm |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festival Programme ==
The festival hosts solo, duet and group choreographies. A major attraction of the festival is a fusion featuring [[Odissi]], [[Kathak]], [[Bharata Natyam]] and [[Mohiniyattam]], highlighting the interconnectedness that runs through this different dance forms, as a reflection of the underlying unity among diverse [[India]]n culture. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160113/jsp/odisha/story_63528.jsp &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://odishasuntimes.com/2016/05/31/odissi-festival-gets-rousing-reception-oxford-university/&lt;/ref&gt;

PLATINUM succeeded in keeping a low profile until their abuse of the Microsoft Windows hot patching system was detected and publicly reported in April 2016.&lt;ref name="zdnet2017"/&gt; This hot patching method allows them to use Microsoft's own features to quickly patch, alter files or update an application, without rebooting the system altogether, this way, they can maintain the data they have stolen while masking their identity.&lt;ref name="zdnet2017"/&gt;

==PLATINUM's techniques==
{{clarify|text=PLATINUM has been known to exploit web [[plugins]], at one point infiltrating the computers of several Indian government officials 2009, using a website that provided an email service.|reason=How does exploiting web plugins related to providing an email service?|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt;

Once in control of a target's computer, PLATINUM actors can move through the target's [[Computer network|network]] using specially built [[malware]] which is either made by one of the multiple teams they are believed to have or sold through an outside source 2009.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt;

Because of the diversity of this malware, which has little code in common, Microsoft's investigators taxonomised it into families.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt;

The piece of malware most widely-used by PLATINUM was nicknamed Dispind by Microsoft.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt; This piece of malware can install a [[keystroke logging|keylogger]], a piece of software that records (and may also be able to inject) keystrokes.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

PLATINUM also uses other malware like "JPIN" which installs itself into the %appdata% folder of a computer so that it can obtain information, load a keylogger, download files and updates, and perform other tasks like extracting files that could contain sensitive information.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt;

"Adbupd" is another malware program utilised by PLATINUM, and is similar to the two previously mentioned. It is known for its ability to support plugins, so it can be specialised, making it versatile enough to adapt to various protection mechanisms.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt;

===Intel Exploit===
In 2017, Microsoft reported that PLATINUM had begun to exploit a feature of Intel [[CPU]]s.&lt;ref name=Tad2017&gt;[https://www.tad.bg/en/post/platinum-hacker-group-uses-intel-amt "Platinum hacker group uses Intel AMT"], ''Tad Group'', 2017-09-25&lt;/ref&gt; The feature in question is Intel's AMT Serial-over-LAN (SOL), which allows a user to remotely control another computer, bypassing the host [[operating system]] of the target, including firewalls and monitoring tools within the host operating system.&lt;ref name="Tad2017"/&gt;

==Security==
Microsoft advises users to apply all of their security updates to minimize vulnerabilities and to keep highly sensitive data out of large networks.&lt;ref name="ms-2017-06" /&gt; Because PLATINUM targets organizations, companies and government branches to acquire trade secrets, anyone working in or with such organizations can be a target for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liu |first=Jianhong |date=2017-07-15 |title=Comparative Criminology in Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xi8tDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=platinum+cyber+crime&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qs3dh6MXHr&amp;sig=AJcCS3a2fp0xTYlz1phCVi7QCf4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie243j28DWAhVIbSYKHV5FAx84ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=platinum&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pilgrimage''' was a [[demoparty]] which took place annually in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] each summer between 2003 and 2006.  The event was founded by Rich "Legalize" Thompson of the demoscene group Polygony.
&lt;ref name=3dluvr&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acid.org/images/pilgrimage04/interview/interview-pilgrimage-2004-3dluvr-ccrat.html |title=Pilgrimage Inc Interview - Pilgrimage Demo Party 2004 |work= |publisher=3DLUVR.com |date=August 29, 2004 |last1=Caballo |first1=Enrique |last2= |first2= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061745/http://www.acid.org/images/pilgrimage04/interview/interview-pilgrimage-2004-3dluvr-ccrat.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilgrimage was, at the time, the only active demoscene event of its kind in all of [[North America]] (succeeding events such as NAID), while many demoparties take place annually throughout [[Europe]].

==Party features==
=== Competitions ===
Pilgrimage hosted a variety of different [[Compo (demoscene)|compos]], most of which require a skill in electronic art and/or computer programming, such as:

* [[Demo (computer programming)|Demo]]
* Combined Music ([[MP3]] and tracked music)
* [[Pixel]] [[digital art|Graphics]]
* [[text mode|Text Mode]] [[ASCII art|Graphics]]
* "Blender" competition (equivalent to fast-compos at European demoparties)
* "Wildcard" (equivalent to wild-compos at European demoparties)

In 2004, Pilgrimage managed to raise over [[US Dollar|US $]]14,000 in [[currency|cash]] and [[prize]]s to award winners of each of the various competitions, double that of the previous year. &lt;ref&gt;[Pilgrimage 2004 Press release - rhizome.org - March 31, 2004 http://rhizome.org/announce/events/24318/view/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Major sponsors that year included Utah's largest independent ISP XMission, [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]], [[ATI Technologies]], [[Bawls]], [[Microsoft]], and [[DeviantArt]].

=== Seminars ===
[[Image:Pgm04b-roots-elwix-x768.png|thumb|right|Elwix presents his seminar on the history of the North American [[Commodore 64]] demoscene.]]

In addition to competitions, which are the main focal point of any demo party, Pilgrimage also hosted seminars on art and technology-related subjects such as 3D programming and design, the history of art in computing, and game design.  &lt;ref name=hugi31&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hugi.scene.org/online/hugi31/hugi%2031%20-%20demoscene%20parties%20polaris%20pilgrimage%202005%20report.htm|title=Pilgrimage 2005 Party Report|work=HUGI Magazine|publisher=|date=2005|last1=Polaris|first1= |last2= |first2= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Activities===
[[Image:Pgm04b-compos-audience watches-x768.png|thumb|right|200px|Members of the audience oversee the demo competition, vote sheets in hand.]]
Pilgrimage 2004 included the following activities:

* A [[Dance Dance Revolution]] tourney, including several "old school/new school" matchups.
* A city-spanning [[scavenger hunt]] organized by members the local [[2600: The Hacker Quarterly|2600 meeting]].
* A demoscene trivia quiz show hosted by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] and Severina
* A demonstration of how the popular Finnish cocktail [[Salmiakki Koskenkorva]] can be made, including a beverage tasting

In 2004, main organizer Legalize stirred up quite a few attenders during his opening speech of the party, where he (in response to European critics of the party) verbally offended the complete European demoscene, labelling them "[[Eurotrash (term)|Eurotrash]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=10836 www.pouet.net]&lt;/ref&gt; He also delivered a side-jab to attenders from [[Canada]] stating that they are "wussies", as they don't have an active demoparty anymore - to which the members of demogroup Northern Dragons responded that the actual party invitation demo was "written by Canadians". &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060222035450/http://www.scenerep.org/scenezine/issue16.php#2 Scene Zine Issue #16 - Party Report: Pilgrimage 2K4]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Northern Dragons gave another tongue-in-cheek response to the controversy in 2005 by naming their winning demo entry "Eurotrash".

'''Serbia Fashion Week''' is a fashion show held twice a year in [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2017/09/02/news/danube-city-novi-sad-is-the-jewel-in-serbia-s-crown-1123565/|title=Danube city Novi Sad is the jewel in Serbia's crown|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring in April and November, the event attracts local and international fashion designers, such as [[Thierry Mugler]] and [[Anna Fendi]].  In addition to runway shows, seminars and exhibits, the "Fashion Talent Design Competition" helps promote young Serbian designers by showcasing their collections. The seven day festival also highlights the works of applied artists, musicians, interior decorators, multimedia experts and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novisad.travel/en/events/serbia-fashion-week-2/|title=Serbia Fashion Week - TONS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shrove Monday''', sometimes known as '''Collopy Monday''', '''Rose Monday''', '''Merry Monday''' or '''Hall Monday''', is a [[Christianity|Christian]] observance falling on the Monday before [[Ash Wednesday]] every year. A part of the English traditional [[Shrovetide]] celebrations of the week before [[Lent]], the Monday precedes [[Shrove Tuesday]]. As the Monday before Ash Wednesday, it is part of diverse [[Carnival]] celebrations which take place in many parts of the Christian world, from [[Greece]], to [[Germany]], to the [[Mardi Gras]] and Carnival of the Americas.

==Shrovetide==
{{main|Shrovetide}}
The word ''shrove'' is the past tense of the English verb ''shrive'', which means to obtain [[absolution]] for one's [[sin]]s by way of [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and doing [[penance]]. Thus Shrovetide gets its name from the shriving that English Christians were expected to do prior to receiving absolution immediately before Lent begins. Shrove Tuesday is the last day of "shrovetide", somewhat analogous to the ''[[Carnival]]'' tradition that developed separately in countries of [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]]. The terms "Shrove Monday" and "Shrove Tuesday" are no longer widely used in the United States or Canada outside of liturgical traditions, such as in the [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], and [[Roman Catholic]] Churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Mardi Gras | work = St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100764  | accessdate =  17 November 2006 | first=Sue | last=Walker | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Celebrations: Holidays in the United States |work=U.S. State Department |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/holidays.htm |accessdate=17 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116094649/https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/holidays.htm |archivedate=16 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collopy Monday==
The British name '''Collopy Monday''' is after the traditional dish of the day, consisting of slices of leftover meat ([[collops]] of [[bacon]]) along with [[egg (food)|eggs]].&lt;ref name="Brand1849"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brand|first=John|title=Observations on popular antiquities of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P30IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=1849|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is eaten for [[breakfast]] and is part of the traditional [[Lent]]en preparations. In addition to providing a little meat, the collopys were also the source of the fat for the following day's pancakes.&lt;ref name="Timbs1829"&gt;{{cite book|last=Timbs|first=John|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVEYAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=1829|publisher=J. Limbird|location=London|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In east [[Cornwall]], it is sometimes called '''Peasen Monday''' or '''Paisen Monday''' after the custom of eating [[pea soup]] on that day.&lt;ref&gt;

*Margaret Ann Courtney, ''Cornish Feasts and Folk-lore'' (Beare &amp; Son: 1890 (revised and reprinted from [[The Folklore Society]] Journals, 1886–87)), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German carnivals==
{{main|Rosenmontag}}
Shrove Monday is part of the German, Danish, and Austrian Carnival calendar, called '''Rosenmontag'''. In the [[Rhineland]], as part of the pre-lenten Fasching festival (or Feast of Fools), it is part of the parade season, a day of marching, revelry, and satirical floats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/society/20090223-17617.html Karneval revellers brave chilly rain for Rosenmontag parade]. AFP/thelocal.de 23 February 2009.  Retrieved 24 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Carnival in Denmark]], it is called '''Fastelavn'''.

==Eastern Orthodox traditions==
{{main|Clean Monday}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (most years falling later than the Western Church, usually in March), the start of (Eastern) Lent is called '''Clean Monday'''. This is not identical to Shrove Monday, which precedes the start of (Western) Lent by two days. Clean Monday is the first day of "[[Great Lent]]", and is traditionally considered the beginning of spring in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], where it is a Bank Holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bank-holidays.com/pop_up_holidays.php?fete_id=9151&amp;pays_id=69&amp;jour_sem=0&amp;annee=2009&amp;id_langue=2 bank-holidays.com]. Retrieved 24 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Different traditions take place in different localities.  In the town of [[Tyrnavos]], for instance, feasts are followed by songs and dances with [[bacchanalia|Bacchic]] overtones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.agrotravel.gr/agro/site/AgroTopics/t_docpage?sparam=int_activity_tourism&amp;doc=/Documents/Agrotravel/event/Magnisia/mpourani&amp;sub_nav=LearnAbout Shrove Monday in the town of Tyrnavos]. agrotravel.gr Retrieved 24 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caribbean==
In the 19th-century [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], a ''kambule'' (procession of people holding torches) took place in the earliest hours of Shrove Monday.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Warner Lewis, ''Central Africa in the Caribbean: Transcending Time, Transforming Cultures'' (University of the West Indies Press, 2003), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lundi Gras==
The Shrove Monday events of the [[New Orleans]] and [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] [[Mardi Gras]], dating back to the 19th century, have since the late 20th century been named [[Lundi Gras]] ("Fat Monday").{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}

The '''Six Days of Amsterdam''' ({{lang-nl|Zesdaagse van Amsterdam}}) is a [[Six-day racing|six-day track cycling race]] held at the [[Amsterdam Velodrome]] in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].

The recordholder for the Six Days of Amsterdam is the Dutch cyclist [[Danny Stam]] with four victories.

The most recent edition took place in 2016 and was won by Belgians [[Kenny De Ketele]] and [[Moreno De Pauw]], their third Six Day victory as a duo.

==History==
The first edition was between 18 and 24 November 1932, in the old building of the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre|Amsterdam RAI]] on the [[Ferdinand Bolstraat]] on a 166.6 metre track. This first edition was won by the Dutch couple [[Jan Pijnenburg (cyclist)|Jan Pijnenburg]] and [[Piet van Kempen]]. The year afterwards the Dutch couple [[Jan Pijnenburg (cyclist)|Jan Pijnenburg]]/[[Cor Wals]] beat  the French couple [[Marcel Guimbretiere]]/[[Paul Broccado]] and the year later during the third edition it was the other way around and the French couple won. After [[Adolphe Charlier]] and [[Frans Slaats]] won the fourth edition in 1936 there were no more Six Days held in Amsterdam for thirty years. Due to the large unemployment and later also due to the [[second world war]], the [[Royal Dutch Cycling Union|National Cycling Union]] (NWU) prohibited to organise Six Day races. There were many proposals to organise a Six Day race after the second world war but the fifth edition was years later in 1966, in the new RAI building located on the [[Europaplein]]. After four editions in this building there were again about thirty years without the event organised in Amsterdam. Since 2001 the race takes place in the new build [[Amsterdam Velodrome]] located in [[Sportpark Sloten]], with a 200-metre track and a capacity for 2000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zesdaagseamsterdam.nl/Zesdaagse-uitleg/historie/ History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061051/http://www.zesdaagseamsterdam.nl/Zesdaagse-uitleg/historie/ |date=2013-10-23 }}, www.zesdaagseamsterdam.nl.

A '''stowaway''' is a person who secretly boards a [[vehicle]], such as a [[ship]], an [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], a [[train]], [[truck|cargo truck]] or [[bus]], in order to travel without paying and without being detected.

== Air travel ==
{{further|List of wheel-well stowaway flights}}
Poor perimeter security at a number of airports around the world can make it easier for people to stow away on planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='He's a lost soul': mystery of man who fell to earth from plane|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/hes-a-lost-soul-mystery-of-man-who-fell-to-earth-from-plane-20121211-2b6lq.html|work=AP|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=30 December 2012|date=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stowaways in aircraft wheel wells face numerous health risks, many of which are fatal: being mangled when the [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] retracts, [[tinnitus]], [[deafness]], [[hypothermia]], [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]], [[frostbite]], [[acidosis]] and finally falling when the doors of the compartment reopen.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The landing gear compartment is not equipped with heating, pressure or oxygen, which are vital for survival at a high altitude.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; According to experts, at {{convert|18,000|ft|m}}, hypoxia causes [[lightheadedness]], weakness, [[vision impairment]] and [[tremor]]s. By {{convert|22,000|ft|m}} the oxygen level of the blood drops and the person will struggle to stay conscious.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=How often do plane stowaways fall from the sky? |first=Jon |last=Kelly |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19562101 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above {{convert|33,000|ft|m}} their lungs would need artificial pressure to operate normally.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The temperature could drop as low as {{convert|-63|°C|°F}} which causes severe hypothermia.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Those stowaways who managed to not be crushed by the retracting undercarriage or killed by the deadly conditions would most likely be unconscious when the compartment door re-opens during the approach and fall several thousand feet to their deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

David Learmount, an aviation expert of [[Flight International]], told ''[[BBC News|BBC]]'' about a lot of ignorance in this area. He suggested that no one would be willing to risk such journey, having full understanding of this kind of ordeal.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Stowaways who survived usually traveled relatively short distances or at a low altitude.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Two cases are known of people who survived at an altitude of about {{convert|38,000|ft|m}}&amp;nbsp;– a man on an 8-hour flight, whose body core temperature fell to {{convert|79|F|C}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stowaway Found Alive in Jet's Wheel Well|url=http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=96267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 16-year-old boy who was unharmed by a 5.5 hour flight, despite losing consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=16-year-old Survives in Wheel Well of Maui Flight|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/us/article/16-year-old-survives-in-wheel-well-of-Maui-flight-5416974.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all aircraft stowaways are male.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In one reported case, in 2003, a young man mailed himself in a large box and had it shipped on [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] planes from New York City to Texas. He survived because the box travelled in a pressurized hold of an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/30/usa.features11|title=The crate escape|first=Alex|last=Hannaford|periodical=The Guardian|date=29 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 until September 2012, there were 96 known stowaway attempts worldwide in wheel wells of 85 separate flights, which resulted in 73 deaths with only 23 survivors.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Stowaways may risk being fined or imprisoned, since it is illegal in most jurisdictions to embark on aircraft, boats or trains as stowaways. [[Airport]]s, sea [[port]]s and [[train station]]s are typically marked as "no [[trespass]]ing" or "[[private property]]" zones to anyone but customers and employees. Seaports, train stations, and airports often attempt further security by designating restricted areas with signs saying "Authorized Personnel Only".

Since the [[September 11 attacks]], it has become more difficult to be a stowaway on board transportation arriving to or departing from the United States. Airport security has dramatically increased, and among the new security measures is trained professionals watching over the fences from which stowaways usually gain entrance to an airport's runway.

Some illegal immigrants travel around Europe in trucks and trains without being detected. A number of them try to get to other European countries, such as France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/31/calais-crisis-david-cameron-chairs-cobra-meeting-as-mod-role-discussed|title=Cameron chairs Cobra meeting after overnight standoff in Calais|first=Josh|last=Halliday|date=31 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ship travel ==
Stowaways on sailing ships and on steamships made this way of illicit travel known throughout the world. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries impecunious (poor) would-be emigrants and travelers seeking adventure for no cost helped to make it seem romantic. Noted stowaways to America by steamship have included [[Henry Armetta]], [[Bruno Richard Hauptmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Jan Valtin]].

=== Origin ===
The word takes its origin with the expression ''stow away''.

This ''stow away'' expression is old and was used for things (such as food), such usage is seen for instance in the 1699 book ''A New Voyage Round the World, Volume 1'' or 1647 ''Journals of the House of Lords, Volume 10''.

The word was also used (later) for people. This gave names such as ''stow-aways'', when the correct current name in modern English language is ''stowaway''.

Depending on the circumstances, people were stowed away in order to hide themselves, or to be transported as slaves.

The concept of people hiding is not so recent; it was yet forbidden (and so known) in 1748 by king of Spain, under the ''polizón'' denomination.

=== In United States ===

The US legislation set up a stowaway concept in 1850. Previously, entry on the territory was free.&lt;ref name="Ancestry magazine janv.-févr. 2003"&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?id=W2cGYPC9j3EC&amp;
Ancestry magazine janv.-févr. 2003
&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''stowaway'' word might be older.

In 1891, the new US legislation requires the boat to pay the return travel for people not admitted in US, even if stowaway were still admitted.&lt;ref name="Ancestry magazine janv.-févr. 2003" /&gt;

474 stowaways arrived in US in fiscal year 1910,&lt;ref name="Ancestry magazine janv.-févr. 2003" /&gt; and 528, next year.

In 1917, a new legislation defines a list of excludable aliens including stowaways.&lt;ref name="Ancestry magazine janv.-févr. 2003" /&gt;

Several stowaways arrived in United States by boat during the first half of twentieth century; they were paying for 25 to 30 dollars to travel.&lt;ref&gt;
The Rotarian oct. 1921 https://books.google.com/books?id=gEYEAAAAMBAJ
What about the immigrant?
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some stowaways were famous such as Hugh Todd.&lt;ref&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?id=daKhAQAAQBAJ
Social History of the Scotch-Irish / Carlton Jackson / Madison Books, 12 août 1999 - 224 pages
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1843 ===
The Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965, as amended, (The FAL Convention), define stowaway as "A person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person and who is detected on board the ship after it has departed from a port, or in the cargo while unloading it in the port of arrival, and is reported as a stowaway by the master to the appropriate authorities".

Unnoticed by the [[Sea captain|captain]], crew, port officials and customs authorities, stowaways may gain access to a ship with or without the assistance of port personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways hide in empty containers, cargo holds, tanks, tunnels, behind false panels, stores, accommodation areas, engine rooms, void spaces, cranes and chain lockers.

The presence of stowaways on board ships may bring serious consequences for ships and, by extension, to the shipping industry as a whole; the ship could be delayed in port; the repatriation of stowaways can be a very complex and costly procedure involving masters, shipowners, port authorities and agents, and the life of stowaways could be endangered as they may spent several days hidden, with the risk of suffocation and without any food or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/ourwork/facilitation/stowaways/Pages/Default.aspx |title=Stowaways |website=imo.org |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suckling pig.jpg|225px|thumb|right|A dead suckling pig prior to being roasted for consumption at an American [[tailgate party]]]]

A '''suckling pig''' is a [[Piglet (animal)|piglet]] fed on its [[pig milk|mother's milk]] (i.e., a piglet which is still a "[[suckling]]"). In [[culinary]] contexts, a suckling pig is [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] between the ages of two and six weeks. It is traditionally cooked whole, often [[Roasting|roasted]], in various cuisines. It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.

The meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for [[pork rinds]]. The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of [[collagen]] in a young pig.
==History==
There are many ancient recipes for suckling pig from [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]. Since the pig is one of the first [[List of domesticated animals|animals domesticated]] by human beings for slaughter, many references to pigs are found in human culture. The suckling pig, specifically, appears in early texts such as the sixth-century [[Salic law]]. As an example of a law governing the punishment for theft, Title 2, article 1, is, in Latin, ''Si quis porcellum lactantem furaverit, et ei fuerit adprobatum (malb. chrane calcium hoc est) CXX dinarios qui faciunt solidos III culpabilis iudicetur''. "If someone has stolen a suckling pig and this is proven against him, the guilty party will be sentenced to 120 [[Denarius|denarii]] which adds up to three [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] (Latin coins)." The words "chrane calcium" are written in Frankish; "calcium" (or "galza" in other manuscripts) is the [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]] for "suckling pig"; ''porcellum lactantem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Regional dishes==
There are various preparations for suckling pig in Western and Asian cuisines. The most popular preparation can be found in northern Spain, namely Segovia.

===Spanish-speaking countries===
{{cookbook|Lechon asado}}

[[Lechon|Lechón]] is a pork dish in several regions of the world, most specifically [[Cuisine of Spain|Spain]] and its former colonial possessions. The word ''lechón'' originated from the Spanish term ''leche'' (milk), alluding to the immaturity of the piglet. Lechón is a popular item in the cuisine in [[Los Angeles]], Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, [[Perú]], Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and other [[Hispanidad|Spanish-speaking nations]] in Latin America. In Spanish cuisine, '''cochinillo asado''' is common used to refer to roast piglet, as lechón has drifted linguistically to mean any roasted pig. In most of these regions, lechón is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals, and the Thankshgiving. 

After seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a [[rotisserie]] action.

===Asia===
[[File:Shaoruzhu.jpg|thumb|Cantonese style roasted whole suckling pig]]
In Asia, roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties.&lt;ref name="eastweek"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the former Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colony]] of [[the Philippines]], lechón (Filipino: ''litsón'') is considered a [[national dish]]. As the usage of the term has evolved over the years, "lechón" has now come to refer to roasted pig in general (including suckling pigs). Suckling pigs in the country are referred to as ''lechón de leche'', which corresponds to the term ''cochinillo'' in Spain.

There is also variant of suckling pig among the [[Indonesia]]n non-Muslim ethnic groups, such as the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Batak]], and [[Minahasa]]. Some pork dishes are also influenced by ethnic Chinese.

===European===
[[File:Ganzes Spanferkel.jpg|150px|thumb|''Spanferkel'', [[German cuisine]]]]
The [[European cuisine]]s of Romania, Portugal (''leitão''), Spain, Germany, Austria, Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Macedonia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Langenfeld  | first = Annemarie  | title = Spanferkel und Pizzen heiß begehrt  | publisher = Der Westen  | date = 20 September 2009  | url = https://www.derwesten.de/nachrichten/staedte/luedenscheid/2009/9/20/news-133863411/detail.html  | accessdate = 8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Dadiani  | first = Niko  | title = Gochi (Roast Suckling Pig)  | publisher = About Georgia  | url = http://www.aboutgeorgia.net/cuisine/meats.html?page=8  | accessdate = 8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; favor it highly as well. It also accompanies [[goose]] as the traditional Christmas feast of families in Russia and Serbia. [[Russian Navy]] maintains a tradition of presenting a roast piglet (or several) to the crew of a ship returning from deployment.

Suckling pig is known in German and Austrian cuisine as '''Spanferkel'''. It can be roasted in the oven&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Scheibler  | first = Sophie Wilhelmine  | title = Allgemeines deutsches kochbuch für alle stände, oder gründliche anweisung alle arten speisen und backwerke auf die wohlfeilste und schmackhafteste art zuzubereiten: Ein unentbehrliches handbuch für angehende hausmütter, haushälterinnen und köchinnen  | publisher = C.F.

In Sweden suckling pig is called '''spädgris''', it is usually cooked in the oven, or sometimes roasted directly over the fire. It is often stuffed with various  fruits such as apples and plums, together with butter and breadcrumbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Östman  | first = Elisabeth  | title = Iduns kokbok  | publisher = Isaac Marcus Boktryckeriaktiebolag  | year = 1911  | pages = 286–287  | url = http://runeberg.org/idunskok/0309.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The suckling pig is used in [[Cajun cuisine]] in the southern U.S., where the ''Cochon de Lait'' festival is held annually in the small town of [[Mansura, Louisiana]]. During this festival, as its name implies, suckling pigs are roasted. Other uses for the suckling pig in the U.S. include slow roasting in an oven or (as in a Hawaiian-style [[pig roast]]) in a pit. The latter remains popular in the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Award categories==
{{as of|2014}}, there are 26 categories of awards, plus several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called "Best Author (Musical)". The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Pesner, Ben.

Since 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and [[The Broadway League]] jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said..."&lt;ref&gt;Jesse McKinley (June 1, 2003).

=== The medallion ===
The Tony Award medallion was designed by [[art director]] [[Herman Rosse]] and is a mix of mostly [[brass]] and a little [[bronze]], with a [[Electroless nickel plating|nickel plating]] on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.playbill.com/features/article/118031.html | last = Pincus-Roth | first = Zachary. | title = Ask Playbill.com:  Tony Statuettes | work = [[Playbill]] | date = May 22, 2008 | accessdate = September 13, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208071125/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/118031.html | archivedate = December 8, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks.

The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/faq/index.html#20 | title = Tony Awards FAQ | publisher = tonyawards.com | accessdate = September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://americantheatrewing.org/tony/history_of_the_tony_awards.php | title = A History of the Tony Awards | publisher = [[American Theatre Wing]] | accessdate = September 13, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130716221216/http://americantheatrewing.org/tony/history_of_the_tony_awards.php | archivedate = July 16, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This change was implemented to make the award "feel more substantial" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners. According to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:

===Rules for a new play or musical===
For the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not "determined… to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations).&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; The rule about "classic" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) "A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an Award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category."&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew; Simonson, Robert (September 19, 2002).

This rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows{{Example needed |s}} have been ruled ineligible for the "new" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people{{Who|date=April 2011}} feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as "new" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.

===Committees and voters===
The Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers.

A Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements.

The producers "accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big [[box-office]] sales." Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, "you’re going to spike at the box office".
