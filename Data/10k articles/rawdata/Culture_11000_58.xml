'''''24 Hour Party People''''' is a 2002 British comedy-drama film about [[Manchester]]'s [[Popular music of Manchester|popular music]] community from 1976 to 1992, and specifically about [[Factory Records]]. It was written by [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] and directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]]. The film was entered into the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3124030/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: 24 Hour Party People |accessdate=24 October 2009|website=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received positive reviews.

It begins with the [[punk rock]] era of the late 1970s and moves through the 1980s into the [[rave]] and [[DJ]] culture and the "[[Madchester]]" scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main character is [[Tony Wilson]] (played by [[Steve Coogan]]), a news reporter for [[Granada Television]] and the head of [[Factory Records]]. The narrative largely follows his career, while also covering the careers of the major Factory artists, especially [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[A Certain Ratio]], [[The Durutti Column]] and [[Happy Mondays]].

The film is a dramatisation based on a combination of real events, rumours, [[urban legend]]s, and the imaginings of the scriptwriter – as the film makes clear. In one scene, one-time [[Buzzcocks]] member [[Howard Devoto]] (played by [[Martin Hancock]]) is shown having sex with Wilson's first wife in the toilets of a club; the real Devoto, an extra in the scene, [[fourth wall|turns to the camera and says]], "I definitely don't remember this happening." The [[fourth wall]] is frequently broken, with Wilson (who also acts as the narrator) frequently commenting on events directly to camera as they occur, at one point declaring that he is "being [[postmodern]], before it's fashionable". The actors are often intercut with real contemporary concert footage, including the [[Sex Pistols]] gig at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]].

== Plot ==
In 1976 television presenter [[Tony Wilson]] sees [[the Sex Pistols]] perform at the [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall]] for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of [[punk rock]] shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed [[Joy Division]] perform, led by the erratic, brooding [[Ian Curtis]].

Wilson founds a record label, [[Factory Records]], and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson's blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer [[Martin Hannett]] to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and record a hit single, "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]".

Wilson opens a nightclub, [[The Haçienda]]; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, [[Happy Mondays]], led by [[Shaun Ryder]], and the [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]-fuelled [[rave]] culture is born.

Despite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of "Blue Monday" sold loses five pence, as the intricately designed packaging by [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]] costs more than the single's sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record [[Technique (album)|a new album]] in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their [[Yes Please!|fourth studio album]] in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the recording money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the finished album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the Haçienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence.

The Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to [[London Records]] but when Wilson reveals that the label does not hold binding contracts with any of its artists, the deal falls through. While smoking [[marijuana]] on the roof of Haçienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Antwerp School''' was a school of artists active in [[Antwerp]], first during the 16th century when the city was the economic center of the [[Low Countries]], and then during the 17th century when it became the artistic stronghold of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] under [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

==History==
Antwerp took over from [[Bruges]] as the main trading and commercial center of the [[Low Countries]] around 1500. Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.

The first school of artists that emerged in the city were the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]], a group of anonymous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the [[High Renaissance]]. [[Jan Gossaert]] was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as [[Frans Floris]], continued this style.

The [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots ('[[Beeldenstorm]]' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the [[Dutch Revolt]] resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as [[Otto van Veen]] and members of the [[Francken]] family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the [[Scheldt]] river was blockaded by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1585 diminishing trade.

[[File:Paul de Vos, Ark van Noah.jpg|thumb|left|Paul de Vos, ''Ark van Noah'']]The city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]], and the influence of [[Anthony van Dyck]], made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque.  The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of [[old master print]]s and book illustrations.  Antwerp ''[[animalier]]s'' or animal painters, such as [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Paul de Vos]] dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century.  Many artists joined the [[Guild of Romanists]], a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the [[Habsburg]] Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.

The artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at [[auction]]s.

The '''Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority''' (AZSTA) is a corporate and political body  having the rights, powers and immunities of a municipal corporation.  It was created on April 24, 2000 by [[Arizona Senate]] Bill 1220. The mission of the AZSTA is to build and operate a [[University of Phoenix Stadium|multipurpose facility]], to provide funding for tourism promotion in Maricopa County, to improve [[Cactus League]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactusleague.com/ Cactus League] official website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[spring training]] facilities, and to build community [[youth sports|youth]] and [[amateur sports]] and recreational facilities.

The AZSTA Board of Directors consists of nine citizens of Maricopa Co. who volunteer their time and accept no compensation or per diem.  The Board members are appointed to five-year terms by the Governor (5), the President of the Senate (2) and the Speaker of the House (2) and are eligible to serve two terms.  Board appointees are appointed to achieve a balanced representation of the Valley's regions as well as the tourism industry, Cactus League and youth sports. The daily operation of the AZSTA is overseen by the Executive Staff Members.

==History==
On April 24, 2000 Arizona Governor [[Jane Dee Hull]] signed Arizona Senate Bill 1220 which created the '''Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority''' (initially known as the TSA). Later in April 2004 the ''Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority'' was renamed to the ''Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority'' in order to avoid confusion with the similarly abbreviated [[Transportation Security Administration]].

[[File:AZTSA Logo.png|thumb|250px|right|The original Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority logo.]]

The first order of business for the TSA was to bring a stadium financing package to voters in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] which took the form of Arizona [[Initiative|Proposition]] 302. On November 7, 2000 voters approved the ballot initiative with a 52% to 48% vote.

=== Youth sports ===
In May 2001 the TSA approved its first youth sports project. In late September 2001 the TSA approved the [[Avondale, Arizona|City of Avondale]]’s youth sports complex proposal. The TSA hosted a Youth and Amateur Sports Town Hall in April 2002. During the Town Hall the TSA formed an advisory committee and announced plans to develop existing youth and amateur sports facilities. The Advisory Committee held its first meeting in May 2002. In December 2002 the TSA approved an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Avondale for a 10-field complex to be completed by December 2003. In February 2003 the TSA hosted the First Annual Youth and Amateur Sports Summit. In June 2003 the TSA broke ground for the Avondale Regional Youth Sports Complex. The Youth and Amateur Sports Committee provided the TSA with recommendations, and in February 2004 the TSA approved $1.32 million for 13 projects and programs.

=== Spring training ===
In February 2002, AZSTA made its first spring training decision when it voted to increase the funding commitment for the [[Surprise, Arizona|City of Surprise]] spring training facility. In December 2002 the City of Surprise held the grand opening of "Billy Parker Field". In February 2003 AZSTA sold $33 million of Cactus League [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and directed $4.3 million to a $6.4 million upgrade project for [[Phoenix Municipal Stadium]]. The $4.3 million was presented in a commemorative check on March 26, 2003 during an [[Oakland Athletics]] vs. [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] game. The Phoenix Municipal Stadium project was completed in February 2004.

AZSTA has committed $68.3 million in funding for renovations to [[Cactus League]] facilities in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]]. It is estimated that over 30 years, AZSTA will contribute $205 million to the refurbishment of Cactus League facilities in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]].

AZSTA has funded:

*  $32 million to the [[Surprise Stadium]] ([[Kansas City Royals]] &amp; [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]);
*  $4.3 million to [[Phoenix Municipal Stadium]] ([[Oakland Athletics]]);
*  $12 million to [[Tempe Diablo Stadium]] ([[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]);
*  $20 million to [[Scottsdale Stadium]] ([[San Francisco Giants]]).

Upcoming Cactus League projects include a stadium in [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]] for the [[Cleveland Indians]] and a stadium in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]].

'''Arkansas literature''' has an emerging consciousness, though it still lags behind other Southern states such as [[Mississippi]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the promotion of its literary culture.  [[University of Arkansas Press]] is probably the state's largest publisher of books, though there do exist some notable small presses in the state: [[August House]], [[Rose Publishing Group]], and [[Chenault and Gray]].  The [[University of Arkansas]]'s M.F.A. program has graduated a number of notable writers, including [[Lewis Nordan]], [[John Dufresne]], [[Steve Yarbrough (writer)|Steve Yarbrough]], and more.  In 2004, the state held the first annual [[Arkansas Literary Festival]] in [[Little Rock]], attracting famous writers from around the nation.  The [[Porter Prize]] is the state's most prestigious literary award.

An '''atelier''' ({{IPA-fr|atəlje|lang}}) is the private [[workshop]] or [[studio]] of a professional artist in the [[fine art|fine]] or [[decorative arts]], where a principal [[Master craftsman|master]] and a number of assistants, students, and apprentices can work together producing pieces of [[fine art]] or [[visual arts|visual art]] released under the master's name or supervision.

This was the standard vocational practice for European artists from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 19th century, and common elsewhere in the world. In [[medieval Europe]] such a way of working and form of visual or fine art education was often enforced by local [[guild]] regulations, of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]], and those of other guilds for other crafts. [[Apprentice]]s usually began young, working on simple tasks, and after some years became [[journeymen]], before becoming masters themselves. The system was gradually replaced as the once powerful guilds declined, and the [[academy]] became a favored method of training, although many professional artists continued to use students and assistants, some paid by the artist, some paying fees to learn.&lt;ref name=Harrap&gt;Diana Davies (editor), ''Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists'', Harrap Books Limited, (1990) {{ISBN|0-245-54692-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the atelier consists of a master [[artist]], usually a professional [[Painting|painter]], sculptor, or from the mid-19th century a fine art photographer, working with a small number of students to train them in visual or fine arts. This very word has also taken on other similar meanings, indicating a place of work and study of the [[haute couture]] fashion designer, [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] and artists in general. Atelier schools can be found around the world, particularly in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janson |first1=H. W. |last2=Janson |first2=Anthony F. |title=History of Art |edition=5th |location=London |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |page=629 |isbn=0500237018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the methods vary, most painting ateliers train students in the skills and techniques associated with creating some form of representational art, the making of two-dimensional images that appear real to the viewer. They traditionally include sessions for drawing or painting [[Nude (art)|nude art]].

==Methods==
===Sight-Size===
[[Image:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Apollo Belvedere]],'' (350-325 BC) [[Vatican Museums]]]] [[Image:Tizian 041.jpg|right|thumb|[[Titian]], ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (1516–1518)]]

'''Sight-Size''' is a method of drawing and painting an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale. The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface appear to be the same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools—which can include [[Spirit level|levels]], [[mirror]]s, [[plumb bob]]s, strings, and sticks—the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same [[dimensions]]. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It can also be used to draw the exact dimensions for a [[Model (art)|model]] in preparation for a painting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Ateliers following the sight-size method generally agree that the practice of careful [[drawing]] is the basis of [[painting]], teaching a form of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] based upon careful observations of nature with attention to detail. Using this method, students progress through a series of tasks such as cast drawing, cast painting, drawing and painting from the live model, and still life. Students must complete each task to the instructor's satisfaction before progressing to the next. This system is referred to as "systematic progression" or "systematic teaching and learning".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Atelier students often begin this progression by drawing [[Plaster#Use in sculptural arts|plaster]] casts. These casts are usually faces, hands, or other parts of the [[human anatomy]]. Plaster casts provide some of the benefits of live, human models, such as the presence of [[natural]] [[shadows]]. They also have their own distinct advantages: they remain perfectly still and their white color allows the student to focus on the pure, [[grayscale]] tones of shadows.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One goal for sight-size students is to gain enough skill to transfer an accurate image to the paper or canvas without the aid of a mechanical device. Contemporary realist painter Adrian Gottlieb notes that "while professional painters pursuing a full-time career will develop an 'eye' that precludes the need for measuring devices and plumb lines (tools necessary during the training period), the observation method itself is not abandoned - instead it becomes second nature. Sight-size can be taught and applied in conjunction with a particular sensitivity to gesture to create life-like imagery; especially when applied to portraiture and figurative works."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Darren R. Rousar, former student of Richard Lack and [[Charles H. Cecil Studios|Charles Cecil]] as well as the author of ''Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach'', agrees and defines measuring in broad terms. He says that "a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or even consciously think about literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317065127/http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archivedate=2009-03-17 |title=Sight-Size Misconceptions |website=Sight-Size.com |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art school owner Charles H. Cecil writes:

:In reviving the atelier tradition, [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) adopted sight-size as the basis of his teaching method. He founded his studio on the precedent of private ateliers, such as those of [[Carolus-Duran]] and [[Léon Bonnat]]. These French masters were accomplished sight-size portraitists who conveyed to their pupils a devotion to the art of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]. It should be noted that Sargent was trained by both painters and that, in turn, his use of sight-size had a major influence in Great Britain and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescecilstudios.com/html/philosophy/atelierTradition.html |title=Atelier tradition|author= Charles H. Cecil Studios |accessdate= September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art from ateliers using the sight-size method is often reminiscent of Greek and Roman sculpture from [[classical antiquity]], such as the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. Paintings may favor the visual imagery of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] art of the mid-18th to 19th century. The sight-size method also lends itself to styles of portraiture in which the artists desires an accurate, natural, true to life or even near photographic image of the sitter as is evident in the work of [[Bouguereau]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Comparative measurement===
The comparative measurement method requires proportional accuracy, but allows the artist to vary the size of the image created. This technique broadly encompasses any method of drawing that involves making accurate measurements primarily using the naked eye. In the early training period students may be aided by a pencil, brush or [[plumb line]] to make comparisons, but there is no transfer of 1:1 measurements from subject directly to paper.  Schools that teach this method include The Water Street Atelier and The Swedish Academy of Realist Art.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In his essay, "[https://www.swedishacademyofrealistart.se/comparative-method The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages]", the painter and instructor Hans-Peter Szameit, of the Swedish Academy of Realist Art, discusses the disadvantages of sight-size, describing it as essentially the making of a mechanically produced image limited to one size, the "sight size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atelierstockholm.se/about/sight-size/| title= The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages| author=Szameit, Hans-Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illusion===
[[File:Léon Bonnat - Idylle.JPG|thumb|left|[[Léon Bonnat]], ''Idylle'' (1890) [[Musée Bonnat]]]]
Another traditional atelier method incorporates the use of illusions that fool the viewer into believing an image is accurate. This method is most often taught in conjunction with advanced compositional theory. Since it is not necessary to copy the subject accurately to achieve a successful illusion, this method allows the artist to experiment with many options while retaining what appears to be a realistic image.

In one example, the ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending'' (c. 1613–1614 (drawn), in ''The Education of Marie de' Medici''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=V&amp;A Images|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1069261/study-of-a-male-figure-drawing-rubens-peter-paul/|title=Prints, Drawings and Paintings Collection: ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending in 'The Education of Marie de Medici'|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Rubens has obscured the point where the legs attach to the torso. This is one factor that contributes to the ease in which he is able to successfully experiment with a variety of dramatically different leg placements. At least three sets of feet are visible. The viewer is not disturbed by an illogical attachment if the attachment is not visible and the resulting two-dimensional image is pleasing to the eye. This allows the artist to choose from a great number of very different alternatives, making his selection based on personal preference or aesthetics rather than accuracy. In the referenced exercise it is possible to experiment with numerous manipulations regarding the size and placement of each part of the body while at the same time using a collection of two-dimensional foreshortening illusions to retain the appearance of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyorktelco.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Creative_Foreshortening_Exercise.pdf |title=Creative Foreshortening Exercise |author=Simon, Trinka Margua |date=2008 |work=The Art of Composition |isbn=978-0-615-23934-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130030/http://newyorktelco.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Creative_Foreshortening_Exercise.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to body parts, artists may rely on the manipulation of many other elements to achieve a successful illusion. These can include: the manipulation of color, value, edge characteristics, overlapping shapes, and a number of different types of paint applications such as [[glazing (window)|glazing]] and [[scumbling]]. Work developed this way would not begin with a drawing, but rather the placement of all relevant elements necessary for the success of the illusions as well as the composition as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1505989?uid=3738984&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104848463297 Varnish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurney|first=James|title=James Gurney Interview|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the illusions designed to mimic reality also speed the painting process, allowing artists more time to design and complete complex large-scale works.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Individual students of this method study a diverse selection of old masters, although many begin their studies with the [[High Renaissance]] (1490s–1527), [[Mannerist]] (1520–1580), [[Baroque]] (1600–1725), and [[Impressionist]] (1870s–1880s) painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Degas]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Rubens]], and [[Titian]]. However, because the emphasis is on creativity, it is often the design of the composition and the application and use of materials that is studied with less focus on reproducing a particular style or subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Students of these ateliers will therefore exhibit a wide range of personal styles and increasing amounts of creative experimentation. The result is a group whose art is highly individualized, with each student pursuing their own individual interests. There was great diversity at the atelier of [[Léon Bonnat]] (1846–1855). Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as "a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail."&lt;ref name="Bonnat"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julius |last=Kaplan |contribution=Leon Bonnat |title=The Dictionary of Art |volume=IV |location=New York |publisher=Grove |year=1996 |isbn=9781884446009 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scandinavian"&gt;{{cite web | last=Weisberg| first=Gabriel | title=Gabriel P.

The '''Basilica of Constantine''' ({{lang-de|Konstantinbasilika}}), or '''Aula Palatina''', at [[Trier]], [[Germany]] is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] palace [[basilica]] that was commissioned by the emperor [[Constantine I]] (AD 306–337) at the beginning of the 4th century. 

Today it is used as the ''Church of the Redeemer'' and owned by a congregation within the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]]. The basilica contains the largest extant [[hall]] from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] (see [[List of ancient Greek and Roman roofs]]) and is ranked a [[World Heritage Site]]. The hall has a length of 67 m, a width of 26.05 m&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ulrich|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a height of 33 m.  It is designated as part of the [[Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

The Aula Palatina was built around AD 310 as a part of the [[palace]] complex. Originally it was not a free standing building, but had other smaller buildings (such as a forehall, a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] and some service buildings) attached to it. The Aula Palatina was equipped with a floor- and wall-heating system ([[hypocaust]]).

[[File:Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz - Basilika, Altarraum (Zeno Ansichtskarten).jpg|thumb|A postcard of the interior, circa 1900]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], it was used as the residence for the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of Trier. For that, the [[apse]] was redesigned into living quarters and pinnacles were added to the top of its walls. In the 17th century, the [[archbishop]] Lothar von Metternich constructed his palace just next to the Aula Palatina and incorporated it into his palace doing some major redesign. Later, in the 19th century, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] ordered the building to be restored to its original Roman state, which was done under the supervision of the military [[architect]] Carl Schnitzler. In 1856, the Aula Palatina became a Protestant church. In 1944, the building burned due to an [[strategic bombing|air raid]] of the [[Allies of World War II|allied forces]] during [[World War II]]. When it was repaired after the war, the historical inner decorations from the 19th century were not reconstructed, so that the brick walls are visible from the inside as well.

[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|thumb|[[Divination]] rituals such as the one depicted on this early 20th century [[Halloween]] [[greeting card]], where a woman stares into a mirror in a darkened room to catch a glimpse of the face of her future husband, while a witch lurks in the shadows, may be one origin of the Bloody Mary legend.]]
'''Bloody Mary''' is a [[folklore]] legend consisting of a [[ghost]], phantom, or spirit [[Conjuration|conjured]] to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend.  Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play.

==Ritual==
Historically, the [[Necromancy|ritual]] encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= | first=Bill| last=Ellis| title=Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture| publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8131-2289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a chance that they would see a [[Human skull symbolism|skull]] (or the face of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ronald Hutton| first=Ronald| last=Hutton| title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2001| isbn=978-0-19-285448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of [[catoptromancy]]. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times).&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/bloody_mary.htm Bloody Mary at Urban Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; or scratching their eyes out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halloween-website.com/bloody_mary.htm ''Bloody Mary'']; www.Halloween–Website.com; retrieved November 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—"Hell Mary" and "Mary Worth" are popular examples.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The [[Urban legend|modern legend]] of [[Hanako-san]] in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.&lt;ref&gt;de Vos, Gail (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HJwCRAlpioC&amp;pg=PA155 What Happens Next? Contemporary Urban Legends and Popular Culture]''. ABC-CLIO. p. 155. {{ISBN|1598846345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of [[miscarriage]]s or [[False pregnancy|false pregnancies]]&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/bloodymary.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Bloody Mary|publisher=[[Snopes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is remembered for her [[Mary I of England#Religious policy|violent religious reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp. 207–208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenon explained==
Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate.&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; Facial features may appear to "melt", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the "strange-face illusion", is believed to be a consequence of a "dissociative identity effect", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Caputo| first1=Giovanni B| year=2010| title=Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion| journal=[[Perception Magazine]]| volume=39| issue=7| pages=1007–1008| doi=10.1068/p6466| url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466| accessdate=October 18, 2012| pmid=20842976| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085513/http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466#| archive-date=2012-10-25| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of ''[[Troxler's fading]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters ''An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters'']; accessed December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; and possibly [[Hypnosis|self-hypnosis]].

The '''''Bolo'' universe''' is a fictional universe based on a series of [[military science fiction]] books by author [[Keith Laumer]]. It primarily revolves around the eponymous "Bolo", a type of self-aware [[tank]]. They first appeared in the short story ''Combat Unit'' (1960),&lt;ref&gt;''Bolos: Their Finest Hour'' Baen 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and have since been featured in [[science fiction]] novels and short story [[anthology|anthologies]] by him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2016/03/24/front-lines-and-frontiers-the-compleat-bolo-by-keith-laumer/|title=Who Guards the Guards?: The Compleat Bolo by Keith Laumer|date=2016-03-24|website=Tor.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalfictionpub.com/blog/keith-laumer-part-4-bolo/|title=Keith Laumer, Part 4: Bolo {{!}} Digital Fiction Pub|website=digitalfictionpub.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldswithoutend.com/MilitaryScienceFiction.asp|title=Military Science Fiction: A Brief History by Mike Resnick |website=www.worldswithoutend.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The story of the books takes place in various times from the near-future (2018, 2068), the mid-range future (27th up to 37th century) and even farther in one case (118th century). The overall plot features mostly military themes and includes space exploration, alien races and some advances in human society.

Many Bolo stories are told from the point of the view of the Bolo itself, with its internal thoughts printed in [[italic type|italics]] throughout the text.

One theme in Bolo works is the portrayal of valiant, tragic, self-sacrificing heroes, such as Bolo "Nike" in the story "Miles to Go" (Weber 1995, in Bolos Book III). Another concept explored by stories such as "Miles to Go" is the use (and abuse) of safeguards to prevent artificial intelligence from hurting its creators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} (see also  [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]].)

Their overall programming involves large amounts of human military history, and often they draw conclusions from that information which puts them at odds with their commanders. Sometimes Bolos develop senses of honor and nobility that would bring their actions into conflict with orders given by their human superiors. One of the stories in Rogue Bolo chronicles the actions of Combat Unit CSR, who identifies an alien threat to humanity but is forced to go "rogue" in order to defeat it (possibly for dramatic effect, as it does not appear to be explained why the bolo did not simply inform its commanders of the threat).

==Description==
Bolos as envisioned by Laumer in his [[future history]] [[Military science fiction|military SF]] are described as [[Vehicular automation|autonomous]] armoured fighting vehicles of immense size. 
While the early versions are in the range of a few hundred tons, the "Mark XXXIII", a standard model appearing in the series, weighs 32,000 tons.

* their increasingly complex AI: Where first models are controlled by programming intended to reduce the need for a human crew, later models mimic human thought patterns, feature [[Strong AI hypothesis|strong AI]]s and finally ''Psychotronic circuitry'', enabling [[self-aware]]ness, [[strategic planning]] and decision-making, and even [[conscience]].
* minimized human crew, often consisting only of a single human commander who can either directly control all aspects of his unit thanks to an advanced interface, or who communicates with his unit, giving it instructions to carry out.

===Offensive systems===
Weapon systems described as part of early Bolo marks include mostly real world weaponry; the more futuristic settings of the novels describes them carrying advanced nuclear weapons. The main gun of a Bolo is usually a variant of the ''Hellbore'' system which is described in the Bolo story-universe as a long-range [[deuterium]]-initiated [[Nuclear fusion|fusion pulse]]. ''Hellbores'' were meant as weapons for interstellar vessels, and the versions mounted on Bolos were modified to fit.

Secondary weapons cover a wide field of weapon systems, as Bolos were supposed to address most combat situations, including land, sea and air battles, sometimes including space/orbit. While Bolo models generally opted for a "balanced" approach to offensive and defensive capabilities, there were often specialised variations on the base model, such as heavy siege units, scout units and [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM]] platforms. The additional weaponry thus includes but isn't restricted to: A high-speed auto-cannon which was recurringly referred to as "Infinite Repeaters" (the 'infinite' referring to the fact that the Bolo can create its own ammunition from metals found in the environment, thus not having an ammo count in the true sense of the word), firing systems such as a combination of [[Gatling guns]] with [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] similar to the [[2S4 Tyulpan]]; [[Vertical launching system|VLS]] (also for launch of drones etc.); as well as tank guns or railguns similar to [[battleship secondary armament]], which includes additional ''Hellbores'' of a smaller caliber. Projectiles include [[Kinetic energy penetrator|KEP]] projectiles, ''DSFSLRP'' (futuristic [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot|APFSDS]]), other missiles and anti-personnel [[flechette]]s. Bolos may carry different types of drones ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], hover-[[Unmanned ground vehicle|UGVs]], even [[spy satellite|satellites]]) for maintenance, reconnaissance (sometimes including [[spy satellite]]s) and providing additional offense.

===Defensive and other systems===
The [[armor]] of a Bolo unit is designed to withstand direct hits from all weapons, including in some of the stories nuclear weapons. The armor consists of [[composite material]]s that are named in the books as "durachrome", "flintsteel",&lt;ref&gt;"Though Hell Should Bar The Way"&lt;/ref&gt; "duralloy" and "endurachrome". Many models would also use ablative or ceramic tiles to provide additional protection against plasma weapons.

Bolos are also described as having [[reactive armor]] ( to stop penetrator missiles that could bore through their regular armor), and energy battlescreens; battlescreens convert an enemy weapon fire into energy which could then be redirected to the Bolo's own systems and weapons. Also, beginning with the Mark XXIII, internal disruptor fields were added to limit damage to vital systems from any attacks which did manage to penetrate the Bolo's outer defenses.

Each unit is also equipped with passive and active sensors, as well as stealth and ECW capabilities. Later Marks were often also equipped with [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] comm.

Power for weapons, battlescreens, and mobility is most often provided by one or more [[Nuclear fission|fission]] or [[fusion power|fusion]] energy sources, in conjunction with high-capacity batteries which are used as secondary or emergency power supplies. A Bolo's command center can remain operational for decades or centuries after reactor fuel is exhausted. As a last resort, Bolos may detonate their reactors to destroy an enemy, or prevent their capture.

===Artificial intelligence===
Early Bolo models are described as not self-aware artificial intelligences. Up to the Mark IX, they are only systems which automate the functioning of the vehicle under direct human command. Beginning with the Mark X, Bolos begin to use limited AI systems using pre-packaged battle plans which allows them to function relatively independently provided the situation on the battlefield falls within the parameters of its pre-loaded plan. If not, the human commander needs to directly intervene either selecting a new battle plan or taking over the functions of the Bolo personally. This system is further advanced beginning with the Mark XV-R which is given a basic AI core capable of choosing between various pre-loaded plans based upon actual battlefield conditions. However, what these earlier Bolos are not capable of doing is developing their own independent battle plans.

Beginning with the Mark XX, Bolos are equipped with a ''psychotronic brain'' which gives them artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="Field Test"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/1439133476/1439133476___2.htm | title=Field Test | publisher=Bean eBooks | accessdate=25 March 2015 | author=Keith Laumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous to human minds, psychotronic brains do turn insane when damaged, which requires their creators to restrict the awareness and initiative at all times except during battle. This is accomplished by separating main processing from personality. The two are integrated (enabling the Bolo to come into possession of its full faculties) only when battle preconditions are met, such as the approach of an enemy or the order of a human officer. In later models, added redundancy reduces the likelihood of insanity and the restriction is relaxed to enhance intelligence. As a final safeguard, Bolos are equipped with a ''Total Systems Override Program'' (nicknamed ''Omega Worm'') which erases the Bolo's software, rendering it brain-dead. This is triggered if a Bolo refuses an authorized order or if executed by a human operator.

The cognitive inhibitions are completely removed after a review of the combat performance, at the ''Battle of Santa Cruz'' (c. A.D. 3030), of experimental unit ''23/B-0075-NKE'' (''Nike''). ''Nike'''s performance demonstrates the capabilities and reliability of fully autonomous psychotronics. ''Nike'' herself dies by ''Omega Worm'' as a result of refusing to obey an officer who is a traitor. This leads to a revision of the parameters for execution of ''Omega Worm'' in later model Bolos.

Beginning with the Mark XXV models, Bolos become completely autonomous, capable of full self-direction in all situations. However, it is found that the intuitive capabilities of human commanders working in conjunction with intelligent Bolos increases the effectiveness of the units and so, with some exceptions, human commanders continue to be assigned to, fight with and if necessary, die with their Bolos. This partnership is further enhanced with the introduction of the Mark XXXII which pioneers a neural interface which allows the Bolo and its human commander to mentally merge human intuition and Bolo processing speed.

====Computing design structure====
Most later mark Bolos have several processing centers, the main core, the personality center, the damage control core (in later models) and the survival center. Some Bolos are given a secondary main core; however, this was not typical. Of these, the survival center is the most heavily protected. In the event of the destruction of the Bolo, the survival center is designed to protect the Bolo's core personality and programming for later retrieval and reactivation.

Each Bolo contains several computer "cores" with different functions, each of which contains multiple fully functional duplicates in case of failure. If a Bolo's logic becomes dysfunctional enough, it regresses to the original ''Resartus protocol'', which is embedded in all self-aware models just for such a case.

====Safeguards====
A key factor in Bolo psychotronic design is the need to address public and military concern over the potential catastrophe which could be unleashed in the event of a Bolo disobeying orders or being suborned. To mitigate this, a number of safeguards are included in the psychotronic design—specifically a focus on loyalty, honour and a strong sense of duty, as well as a restriction on the level of awareness and processing power made available to the Bolo outside of combat. These safeguards often combine with the prejudices of ranking officers to cause the unnecessary destruction of a Bolo during combat.&lt;ref name="CompleatBolo"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laumer |first= Keith |authorlink= Keith Laumer |title= The Compleat Bolo |date=March 2004 |publisher= Baen |isbn= 978-0671698799}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bolos being able to survive for centuries, older Marks often end up scattered across the galaxy abandoned on old warfields or retrofitted for use in farming or heavy construction. On several occasions obsolete Bolos go rogue, causing significant destruction, loss of life and bad publicity for the ''Dinochrome Brigade'': as a result, a special unit was set up to find all such units and burn out their control centers.

On several occasions, Bolos have turned against their commanders during combat: in ''Bolo!'', a damaged Mark XXV (Unit LNC/Lance) loses its [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] capability, causing it to attack a fellow Bolo.  Although it is revealed at the end that Unit LNC had received battle damage that almost destroyed his personality center causing it to lose the IFF capability. Similarly, a Mark XXXIII (Unit HCT/Hector) was subverted by an alien AI and turned into a prison guard in ''Bolo Rising''. Conversely, Bolos have occasionally refused to carry out illegal, treasonous, or dishonourable orders, such as Unit NKE (Nike) in ''The Triumphant'' or Unit SOL (Surplus On Loan) in ''The Road to Damascus''.

===Command structure and deployment===
Bolos and their human commanders are assigned to an elite ''Concordiat'' unit called the "Dinochrome Brigade", which traces its lineage back to various units on Earth. Individual Bolos are generally identified by a three-letter prefix which is generally extrapolated into a [[given name]]—this name is generally used as the default access code for a new commander. Often, Bolos on garrison duty are described as older [[military surplus|surplus]] or reserve units on loan, in which case their three-letter prefix is changed to "SOL".
&lt;ref name="Bolo_RD"&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink= John Ringo, Linda Evans |title= Bolo: The Road to Damascus |date=March 2004 |publisher= Baen |isbn= 978-0743471879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolos are generally deployed in groups to provide fire support, though individual units are occasionally detached to perform garrison duty—later marks of Bolo are considered to be so capable that a single unit can be assigned to guard an entire planet, even during periods when a human commander is not available. When deployed by the Dinochrome Brigade for major combat operations, Bolos usually serve with "Planetary Siege Regiments." Before the development of higher marks of Bolos, powerful enough to often allow a single Bolo to conduct major planetary operations without support, the regiments are only called "siege regiments."

==Fictional history==
Laumer included a history of the Bolo as an appendix to one of his books. The ''Mark I'' is described as conventional large (150 tonne) tank equipped with various [[Servomechanism|servo]]s and mechanical devices to reduce crew requirements. It is developed around the year 2000 by the fictional Bolo Division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].&lt;ref name="Bolo_GM"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laumer |first= Keith |authorlink= Keith Laumer  |title= Bolo: Annals of the Dinochrome Brigade |date=July 1976 |publisher= Berkley Books |isbn= 0-425-03450-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 300-tonne Mark III it has  AI allowing limited independent action and is powered by "ionic" batteries able to support combat-level activity for up to ten years and enabling operation even when fully submerged.

The AI increases until the incorporation of Psychotronic circuitry in the Mark XX leads to Bolos becoming self-aware and capable of fully independent operation.&lt;ref name="Field Test"/&gt; The Mark XXVI is described as capable of true independent [[strategic planning]], while the final standardised Bolo, the 32,000-tonne Mark XXXIII is described as fully self-willed and able to operate indefinitely without external support.

As humanity spreads beyond Earth, Bolos are used to protect first ''the Empire'', and then the ''Concordiat of Man''. For millennia, each successive mark of Bolo proves to be the lynchpin of humanity's ground-based defenses, especially in the numerous and protracted wars against various aliens, most notably the ''Deng'' and the ''Melconians'' in the 30th century. Bolos are also used in smaller scale raids, skirmishes and internal conflicts between warring human parties.

The Mark XXXIII Bolo is the last standard Bolo built by the ''Concordiat'' prior to the ''Melconian'' destruction of Earth. Following the genocide of the "Final War" with the ''Melconians'',  surviving Bolos are described as crucial in sheltering and protecting the few scattered remnants of humanity during the long slow process of rebuilding. A number of ''seed corn'' colonies survive the genocide policies carried out by both sides and go on to produce new models of Bolo: these are even larger in size, design and capabilities.

|- valign="top"
| 01.
| Aetryx
| Biochemical (Cybernetic)
| Xeno-parasitic (Non-humanoid)
| Enemy
| A species of parasites that invaded a human planet after the Concordiat and the 'Last War'. They subverted a number of Mk. XXXII Bolos by implanting them with copies of human consciousness, and used them to fight the Mk. XXXIIIs that humanity (no longer the Concordiat) sent to liberate the planet. Aetryx infantry are genetically engineered brutes and they have some fairly heavy gravtanks, but nothing on the scale of a Bolo.
|- valign="top"
| 02.
| Anceti
| Chronomorphic
| Unknown
| Enemy
| An alien enemy of the Concordiat with some advanced technology that allows them to use time as a weapon.
|- valign="top"
| 03.
| Axorc
| Unknown
| Unknown
| Enemy
| An alien foe of the Concordiat known for operating large crawler tanks similar to large, mechanized and armored centipedes. Little is mentioned about the Axorc other than their choice of multi-legged armored vehicles and that the Concordiat decisively overcame the Axorc. The Axorc were mentioned in Bolo Brigade and in The Compleat Bolo.
|- valign="top"
| 04.
| BOLO
| Mechanimorphic (Machine)
| Robot Tank
| Ally
| Protagonist of the series
|- valign="top"
| 05.
| Deng
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-arachnoid (Non-humanoid)
| Arch-enemy
| Dog-sized spider-like aliens. Were the principal  enemy of the human Concordiat for centuries, and unlike some alien species, treaties could be used with them. Primary weapons were 'Yavac' type armored vehicles. Unlike later authors, Keith Laumer always portrayed the light Yavacs as multi-legged walkers, while the heavier units were tracked, like Bolos. (Later authors missed or ignored this.) Primary weapons were deep UV lasers, as well as assortments of other weapons. Generally inferior to contemporary Bolos, the Deng required superior numbers to overcome Concordiat Bolos. Deng military organization operated large formations, and used numerous infantry forces.
|- valign="top"
| 06.
| Grakaan
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-insectoid (Humanoid body plan)
| Ally
| An insectoid species with a vaguely humanoid appearance noted for a strong empire and a curious sense of humor. Their large empire, located far from the Galactic Core, has been known to resist all incursions into its territory and has never quarreled with humans of the Concordiat.
|- valign="top"
| 07.
| Humans
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Human (''Homo sapiens sapiens'')
| Ally
| Humans created and operated Bolo war machines that defended the Concordiat. Humans often allied with alien races, but rarely mixed with alien species outside of trade and war purposes. Almost no human colonies mixed with alien beings under shared living conditions while the Concordiat existed, although a few, rare exceptions did occur.
|- valign="top"
| 08.
| Kezdai
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-reptillianoid (Humanoid body plan)
| Enemy
| A saurian-like race, fractionalized by clans which formed the basis of their political system, whose leadership tended to be military. The Kezdai began a campaign of expansionary conquests against Concordiat worlds during the period of total war with the Melconians. However, the Kezdai vastly underestimated the actual size of the Concordiat. Their actual threat level is around the same level as the Malach, a minor annoyance. The Kezdai military was organized around wheeled and counter-gravity vehicles (tracks did not appear to be used at all), with infantry in 'light' armor (i.e. not 'power armor') and extensive use of orbital fire support.
|- valign="top"

| Briefly mentioned in ''Bolo Rising'' as an ally of the Melconian empire
|- valign="top"
| 10.
| K'Juur
| Unknown
| Unknown
| Enemy
| Briefly mentioned in ''Bolo Rising'' as a foe fought by Bolos in the fratricidal Outreach War
|- valign="top"
| 11.
| Malach
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-reptillianoid (Semi-humanoid body plan) (Alternative biochemistry)
| Enemy
| Six-limbed raptor-like race, evolved from pack hunters in metal-poor old regions of the galaxy. Driven to conquest from old hunter instincts that had never worked out of their genetics. Malach society was ideologically an extremely militant social Darwinist group. The primary Malach ground weapon was a single-manned 'walker-type' capable of limited flight, atmospheric re-entry with a pod, and was armed with a variety of high energy weapons, magnetic shielding and low-yield tactical nuclear missiles. The Malach also employed unarmored infantry. The Malach operated a fleet based on large capital ship naval groups. The Malach were overall a small threat and their invasion was repulsed by a pair of old Mk. XXIV Bolos. If the regular Concordiat military had been deployed, the Malach most likely could have been easily crushed. (In Bolo Brigade, the Malach are mentioned, implying that most likely the Mk. XXX was the front-line Bolo. Given that two Mk. XXIVs were able to repulse the invasion, an actual Concordiat brigade and Navy force would have been able to crush them in short order.)
|- valign="top"
| 12.
| Melconian
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-caninoid (Humanoid body plan)
| Arch-Enemy
| Roughly human-sized anthropomorphic canids (bipedal dog-like humanoids), who were psychologically very similar to the humans of the Concordiat. The Melconians controlled a very large empire, with a long military history, estimated to be around twice the size of the Concordiat at its height. While they used heavy armor and infantry units in large numbers, Melconian infantry did not use heavy 'power armor' like the Concordiat. Unlike Bolos, which were designed to operate as single, independent combatants, Melconian heavy mechanized units were focused on a single battlefield role. Melconian technology was less advanced than the Concordiat's, and had no artificial intelligence in any of their mechanized units.
|- valign="top"
| 13.
| Quern
| Unknown
| Unknown
| Enemy
| Major threat during the time where the Mk. XXIII was the front-line Bolo unit. Caused considerable damage during their invasion, striking into core worlds. Concordiat counter-attack resulted in what was believed to be the total annihilation of the Quern race and they were never heard from again.
|- valign="top"
| 14.
| Tersae
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-avian (Humanoid body plan)
| Enemy
| A primitive, vaguely anthropomorphic avian race (bipedal bird-like humanoids). The Tersae were a biologically-engineered species created by the Melconians in order to better understand sentience. The Melconians controlled the Tersae (who were divided into tribes) via a series of radios which beamed instructions to them. The Tersae came into conflict with humans at the orders of the Melconians, who were at the time altering them still further with increased aggression in mind. When humanity discovered the truth, the Melconians fled the system and released a Tersae-specific nerve gas, wiping out most of the population, but some survived with the help of the humans. The Melconians were not blamed at the time, as Earth and Melcon had not yet made first contact with each other. (Note: Not to be confused with the similar 'Tersae' of the BattleTech series, though ~very~ similar.)
|- valign="top"
| 15.
| Tolun
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-amphibianoid (Humanoid body plan)
| Neutral
| The Tolun (bipedal frog-like humanoids) are mentioned in ''Bolo Rising''. The Tolun are sharp traders and always desire to learn new technologies even though their own is estimated to be considerably more advanced than present human technologies.
|- valign="top"
| 16.
| Vovoin
| Unknown
| Unknown
| Enemy
| Briefly mentioned in ''Bolo Rising'' as a foe fought by Bolos in the fratricidal Outreach War.
|- valign="top"
| 17.
| Xalontese ("Harpy")
| Biochemical (Organic)
| Xeno-avian (Non-humanoid)
| Enemy
| Also known as Harpies. The Harpies invaded the Concordiat shortly after the introduction of the Mk. XXVIII Bolo to front-line service. The Harpy military utilized mass swarms of semi-sentient, flying suicide infantry (which resemble [[harpies]], hence the nickname), supported by heavy close air support in the form of airship-like egg-shaped flying units. Ships were relatively slow, and their heaviest weapons could only fire straight down. However, the Harpy airships were massively armored and could resist the 110-cm Hellbores of the Mk. XXVIIIs for a considerable time. Briefly mentioned in ''Bolo Rising'' as a foe fought by Bolos in the Fringe Worlds War. Harpies also appear in the short story ''Shared Experience''.
|- valign="top"
| 18.
| Yezhoth
| Unknown
| Unknown
| Neutral
| In ''Bolo Rising'', an old vessel of the Yezhoth is prepared by the !*!*! to transport humans and thus they are (or were) at least geometrically similar to humans.
|- valign="top"
| 19.
| !*!*!
| Mechanimorphic (Machine)
| Robotic Warmachines
| Arch-enemy
| The !*!*! are the chief antagonist in ''Bolo Rising'' and are a machine intelligence/civilization capable of subverting Bolos under the right conditions.  They are believed to have originated somewhere in the galactic core and then rapidly expanded, destroying or conquering the organic civilizations they encountered. Their motivations are not well understood, but their martial technology is. The !*!*! employ Berzerker-like war machines of every size between an insect and a planetoid and have no compunction against flinging asteroids or rocks against planets with immense momentum, causing near nuclear-like devastation. One of their units, the Mobile Bastion, is a tracked vehicle a mile long with detachable, reusable FTL drives for interstellar travel, with a directed-energy main gun measured in tens of megatons ''per second'' of output.The specifics of their culture, assuming they even ''have'' one, are a mystery.

|Sentient
|Not involved with humans.
|Cyborg
|Non-humanoid,apparently descended from humans&lt;ref&gt;Hold Until Relieved Baen 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
|Are hyper-intelligent beings that are co-existing with machines that they are built into.They descend from humans, whom they evolved from many billions of years before them.They find the very last surviving Bolo (a mark LXIV) buried deep in volcanic rock,They are easily able to bypass the Bolo and interrogate it.They integrate it into a new body.

==In other media==
The Bolo stories inspired the board game  [[Ogre (game)|Ogre]], whose creators originally intended to license the stories. For cost reasons this did not occur and a different background was invented for the game, with its titular tank deliberately being made self unaware in order to differentiate it.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/resources/faq.html#16|title=Ogre FAQ|website=www.sjgames.com|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}'''''Brave New World''''' is a [[dystopian]] [[novel]] written in 1931 by English author [[Aldous Huxley]], and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic [[World State in Brave New World|World State]] of [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] citizens and an intelligence-based [[social hierarchy]], the novel anticipates huge scientific developments in [[reproductive technology]], [[sleep-learning]], [[psychological manipulation]], and [[classical conditioning]] that are combined to make a [[utopian society]] that goes challenged only by a single outsider. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, ''[[#Brave New World Revisited|Brave New World Revisited]]'' (1958), and with ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), his final novel.

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"&gt;{{cite web |title=100 Best Novels |publisher=Random House |year=1999 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |accessdate=23 June 2007}} This ranking was by the [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/about/board.html Modern Library Editorial Board] of authors.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"&gt;{{Cite news |title=100 greatest novels of all time |publisher=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction |accessdate=10 October 2012 |location=London |first=Robert |last=McCrum |date=12 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"].

Translations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitled ''Le Meilleur des mondes'' (''The Best of All Worlds''), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. 'Leibniz', by Nicholas Jolley (Routledge, 2005){{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satirised in ''[[Candide|Candide, Ou l'Optimisme]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1759).

==History==
Huxley wrote ''Brave New World'' while living in [[Sanary-sur-Mer]], France, in the four months from May to August 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Iltis, Université Nancy II, http://www.sanary.com/a-huxley-in-sanary-1-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Huxley had already established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (''The Burning Wheel'', 1916) and four successful satirical novels: ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was Huxley's fifth novel and first [[dystopia]]n work.

Huxley said that ''Brave New World'' was inspired by the [[utopia]]n novels of [[H. G. Wells]], including ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Letters of Aldous Huxley'', ed. by Grover Smith (New York and Evanston: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), p. 348: "I am writing a novel about the future—on the horror of the Wellsian Utopia and a revolt against it. Very difficult. I have hardly enough imagination to deal with such a subject. But it is none the less interesting work" (letter to Mrs. Kethevan Roberts, 18 May 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became ''Brave New World''. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had "been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells", but then he "got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heje |first=Johan |chapter=Aldous Huxley |editor-last=Harris-Fain |editor-first=Darren |title=British Fantasy and Science-Fiction Writers, 1918–1960 |location=Detroit |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |page=100 |isbn=0-7876-5249-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to ''Brave New World'' as a "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of [[D. H. Lawrence]].

[[George Orwell]] believed that ''Brave New World'' must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell: [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml ''Review''], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote ''Brave New World'' long before he had heard of ''We''.&lt;ref name="Russell, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zamiatin's We|last=Russell|first=Robert|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85399-393-0|location=Bristol|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''We'' translator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying.&lt;ref name="NR1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|title=Leonard Lopate Show|date=18 August 2006|publisher=WNYC|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405075001/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy}} (radio interview with ''We'' translator Natasha Randall)&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific futurism in ''Brave New World'' is believed to be cribbed from ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus]]'' by [[J. B. S. Haldane]].&lt;ref&gt;''Disturbing the Universe'', Chapter 15, Freeman Dyson, Basic Books, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold currency standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the "primal and ultimate need" if civilisation was to survive the present crisis.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; The ''Brave New World'' character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]]. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited [[Billingham Manufacturing Plant|Mond's technologically advanced plant]] near [[Billingham]], north east England, and it made a great impression on him.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;Introduction by David Bradshaw. p. xxii. Huxley, Aldous. "Brave New World". Random House, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave ''Brave New World'' much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans,&lt;ref&gt;The Vintage Classics edition of ''Brave New World''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had also found the book ''My Life and Work'' by [[Henry Ford]] on the boat to America, and he saw the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, David. Introduction. Brave New World. By Aldous Huxley. London: Vintage, 2004. p. viii. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel opens in the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]] city of [[London]] in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), where citizens are engineered through [[artificial uterus|artificial wombs]] and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined [[social class|classes]] (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high caste, which gives him an [[inferiority complex]]. His work with [[hypnopaedia|sleep-learning]] allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called ''soma''. Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to [[Iceland]] because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.

Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in [[New Mexico]], in which the two observe [[natural childbirth|natural-born]] people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]], including the [[Puebloan peoples]] of [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]].) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession&amp;nbsp;— a scientific manual and the complete works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this "brave new world". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his "father", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.

Bernard, as "custodian" of the "savage" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard's popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using ''soma'', while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John's view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare's writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina's freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda's bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the "correct" attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for "death-conditioning" come across as disrespectful to John until he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of ''soma'' to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying ''soma'' vapor into the crowd.

Bernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the "Resident World Controller for Western Europe", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses the [[Falkland Islands]] as his destination, believing that [[Climate of the Falkland Islands|their bad weather]] will inspire his writing. Mond tells Bernard that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands "the right to be unhappy". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.

Jaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop tower, near the village of [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]], where he intends to adopt a solitary [[ascetic]] lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising [[self-flagellation]]. This soon draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, [[Rubbernecking|hoping to witness]] his bizarre behaviour; one of them is implied to be Lenina. At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with [[Cat o' nine tails|his whip]]. The onlookers are wildly aroused by the display and John is caught up in the crowd's ''soma''-fueled frenzy. The next morning, he remembers the previous night's events and is stricken with remorse. Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening discover John dead, having hanged himself.

==Characters==
'''Bernard Marx''' – a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of ''soma''. Bernard is in love with Lenina but he doesn't like her sleeping with other men, even though "everyone belongs to everyone else". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island&lt;!--NOTE: Although John asks if he could 'go to the islands' with Bernard and Watson, it is not necessarily true that Bernard and Watson are both going to the Falkland Islands. Only Watson is definitely going to the Falklands. Bernard's island is never explicitly stated.--&gt; for his non-conformist behaviour.

'''John''' – the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation ("Malpais") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John ("the Savage", as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the "Brave New World" (Miranda's words in ''[[The Tempest]]'') takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the [[hypnopedia|hypnopedic]] messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of "sin" (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.

'''Helmholtz Watson''' – a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism and philistinism of the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the [[Falkland Islands]]—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of ''soma'' following Linda's death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing.

'''Lenina Crowne''' – a young, beautiful fetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. She is  part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using ''soma'' to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilization, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an "[[List of quotes from Shakespeare in Brave New World#Chapter 13|impudent strumpet]]". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.

'''Mustapha Mond''' – Resident World Controller of Western Europe, "His Fordship" Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years' War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of "Community, Identity, Stability". Among the novel's characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimate [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] goal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the genetic caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.

'''Fanny Crowne''' – Lenina Crowne's friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in the World State). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.

'''Henry Foster''' – One of Lenina's many lovers, he is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John's assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.

'''Benito Hoover''' – Another of Lenina's lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.

'''The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC)''', also known as '''Thomas "Tomakin"''' – He is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn, however, when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realize is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are) but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.

'''Linda''' – John's mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC's Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there are ''mescal'' brought by Popé as well as ''[[peyote|peyotl]]''. Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to ''soma'', wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.

'''The Arch-Community-Songster''' – The secular equivalent of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the World State society.

'''The Warden''' – An Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=101}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darwin Bonaparte''' – a "big game photographer" (i.e. filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte is known for two other works: "feely of the gorillas' wedding",&lt;ref name="Brave New World"&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=253}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and "Sperm Whale's Love-life".&lt;ref name="Brave New World"/&gt; He has already made a name for himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=252}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but still seeks more.

===Others===
* [[Freemartin#Fictional use|Freemartins]]: These women have been deliberately made sterile by exposure to male hormones during fetal development but still physically normal except for "the slightest tendency to grow beards." In the book, government policy requires freemartins to form 70% of the female population.

===Of Malpais===
*'''Popé''', a native of Malpais. Although he reinforces the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing her ''[[mescal]]'', he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John also attempts to kill him. He gave Linda a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare.
*'''Mitsima''', an elder tribal [[shaman]] who also teaches John survival skills such as rudimentary ceramics (specifically [[coil pot]]s, which were traditional to Native American tribes) and bow-making.

===Background figures===
These are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:
*'''[[Henry Ford]]''', who has become a [[messianism|messianic]] figure to the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]]. "Our Ford" is used in place of "Our Lord", as a credit to popularising the use of the [[assembly line]]. Huxley's description of Ford as a central figure in the emergence of the ''Brave New World'' might also be a reference to the utopian industrial city of ''[[Fordlândia]]'' commissioned by Ford in 1927.{{speculation inline|date=August 2014}}
*'''[[Sigmund Freud]]''', "Our Freud" is sometimes said in place of "Our Ford" because Freud's psychoanalytic method depends implicitly upon the rules of classical conditioning, and because Freud popularized the idea that sexual activity is essential to human happiness. (It is also strongly implied that citizens of the World State believe Freud and Ford to be the same person.)&lt;ref&gt;chapter 3, "Our Ford-or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters–Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[H. G. Wells]]''', "Dr Wells", British writer and [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], whose book ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' was an incentive for ''Brave New World''. "All's well that ends Wells", wrote Huxley in his letters, criticising Wells for anthropological assumptions Huxley found unrealistic.
*'''[[Ivan Pavlov|Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]]''', whose conditioning techniques are used to train infants.
*'''[[William Shakespeare]]''', whose banned works are quoted throughout the novel by John, "the Savage". The plays quoted include ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. Mustapha Mond also knows them because as a World Controller he has access to a selection of books from throughout history, including the Bible.
*'''[[Thomas Robert Malthus]]''', 19th century British economist, believed the people of the Earth would eventually be threatened by their inability to raise enough food to feed the population. In the novel, the eponymous character devises the contraceptive techniques (Malthusian belt) that are practiced by women of the World State. 
*'''Reuben Rabinovitch''', the Russian-Jewish character on whom the effects of sleep-learning, [[Sleep-learning|hypnopædia]], are first observed.
*'''[[John Henry Newman]]''', 19th century Catholic theologian and educator, believed university education the critical element in advancing post-industrial Western civilization. Mustapha Mond and The Savage discuss a passage from one of Newman's books.
*[[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|'''Alfred Mond''']], British industrialist, financier and politician. He is the namesake of Mustapha Mond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/22/aldous-huxley-prophet-dystopia-cs-lewis|title=Aldous Huxley: the prophet of our brave new digital dystopia {{!}} John Naughton|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2013-11-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of names and references===

However, ''Brave New World'' also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. ''Brave New World''. Harper Perennial Modern Classics; Reprint edition (17 October 2006), P.S. Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-06-085052-4}} &amp;nbsp;— "About the Book."&amp;nbsp;— "Too Far Ahead of Its Time? The Contemporary Response to ''Brave New World'' (1932)" p. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', [[G. K. Chesterton]] explained that Huxley was revolting against the "Age of Utopias". Much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works of [[H. G. Wells]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:

{{bquote|After the Age of Utopias came what we may call the American Age, lasting as long as the Boom. Men like Ford or Mond seemed to many to have solved the social riddle and made capitalism the common good. But it was not native to us; it went with a buoyant, not to say blatant optimism, which is not our negligent or negative optimism. Much more than Victorian righteousness, or even Victorian self-righteousness, that optimism has driven people into pessimism. For the Slump brought even more disillusionment than the War. A new bitterness, and a new bewilderment, ran through all social life, and was reflected in all literature and art. It was contemptuous, not only of the old Capitalism, but of the old Socialism. ''Brave New World'' is more of a revolution against Utopia than against Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Chesterton, review in ''The Illustrated London News'', 4 May 1935&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, in 1944 economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] described ''Brave New World'' as a [[satire]] of utopian predictions of [[socialism]]: "Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony."&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises (1944). [https://mises.org/system/tdf/Bureaucracy_3.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document Bureaucracy], New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"/&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"/&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"/&gt;

==Fordism and society==
{{Main|World State in Brave New World}}
The World State is built upon the principles of [[Henry Ford]]'s [[assembly line]]: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., "By Ford!"). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a "T". In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and in America the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' continues publication as ''The Fordian Science Monitor''. The World State calendar numbers years in the "AF" era — "Anno Ford" — with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first [[Ford Model T|Model T]] rolled off his assembly line. The novel's [[Gregorian calendar]] year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

From birth, members of every class are [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called "hypnopædia" in the book) to believe their own class is superior, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by an [[antidepressant]] and [[hallucinogenic drug]] called ''soma.''

The biological techniques used to control the populace in ''Brave New World'' do not include [[genetic engineering]]; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of [[DNA]] was known. However, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the [[eugenics]] movement, based on [[artificial selection]], was well established. [[Huxley family|Huxley's family]] included a number of prominent biologists including [[Thomas Huxley]], half-brother and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Andrew Huxley]], and his brother [[Julian Huxley]] who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding ([[nature versus nurture|nurture versus nature]]); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element of [[selective breeding]] as well.

==Comparisons with George Orwell's '' Nineteen Eighty-Four ''==
Social critic [[Neil Postman]] contrasted the worlds of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''Brave New World'' in the foreword of his 1985 book ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]''. He writes:
{{Quote|What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in ''Brave New World Revisited,'' the civil [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In ''1984'', Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In ''Brave New World,'' they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.}}

Journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], who himself published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article "Why Americans Are Not Taught History":

{{Quote|We dwell in a present-tense culture that somehow, significantly, decided to employ the telling expression "You're history" as a choice reprobation or insult, and thus elected to speak forgotten volumes about itself. By that standard, the forbidding dystopia of George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' already belongs, both as a text and as a date, with [[Ur]] and [[Mycenae]], while the [[hedonism|hedonist]] [[nihilism]] of Huxley still beckons toward a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus. Orwell's was a house of horrors. He seemed to strain credulity because he posited a regime that would go to any lengths to own and possess history, to rewrite and construct it, and to inculcate it by means of coercion. Whereas Huxley ... rightly foresaw that any such regime could break because it could not bend. In 1988, four years after 1984, the [[Soviet Union]] scrapped its official history curriculum and announced that a newly authorized version was somewhere in the works. This was the precise moment when the regime conceded its own extinction. For true blissed-out and vacant servitude, though, you need an otherwise sophisticated society where no serious history is taught.&lt;ref name="Hitches"&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], "Goodbye to All That: Why Americans Are Not Taught History." ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. November 1998, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Brave New World Revisited''==
[[File:BraveNewWorldRevisited.JPG|thumb|First UK edition]]
'''''Brave New World Revisited''''' ([[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]], US, 1958; [[Chatto &amp; Windus]], UK, 1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |title=Brave New World Revisited – HUXLEY, Aldous &amp;#124; Between the Covers Rare Books |publisher=Betweenthecovers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609233725/http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Huxley almost thirty years after ''Brave New World'', is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In ''Brave New World Revisited'', he concluded that the world was becoming like ''Brave New World'' much faster than he originally thought.

Huxley analysed the causes of this, such as [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal suggestion]]. ''Brave New World Revisited'' is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu [[Vedanta]] in the interim between the two books.

The last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into the [[totalitarian]] world described in ''Brave New World''. In Huxley's last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'', he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally known as a counterpart to his most famous work.

== Censorship/banning instances, accusation of plagiarism ==
The [[American Library Association]] ranks ''Brave New World'' as No. 52 on their list of [[most challenged books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=85714|title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10#2010|title=Top ten frequently challenged books lists of the 21st century|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list includes some notable incidents in which it has been censored, banned, or challenged:

*In 1932, the book was banned in [[Ireland]] for its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/od/bannedliteratur1/tp/aa_bannedbooks.htm|title=Banned Books|date=2 November 2009|publisher=Classiclit.about.com|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |title=Banned Books |publisher=pcc.edu |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602184644/https://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |archivedate= 2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1965, a [[Maryland]] English teacher alleged that he was fired for assigning ''Brave New World'' to students. The teacher sued for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights but lost both his case and the appeal.&lt;ref name="karolides2011_p472_1"&gt;{{cite book|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|edition=Second|page=472|quote=In 1965, a teacher of English in Maryland claimed that the local school board had violated his First Amendment rights by firing him after he assigned ''Brave New World'' as a required reading in his class. The district court ruled against the teacher in ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 237 F. Supp. 222 (D.Md) and refused his request for reinstatement in the teaching position. When the case was later heard by the circuit court, ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 348 F.2d 464 (4th Cir. 1965), the presiding judge affirmed the ruling of the lower court and included in the determination the opinion that the nontenured status of the teacher accounted for the firing and not the assignment of a particular book.|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a "pornographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bare breasts and Bare Bottoms: Anatomy of Film Censorship in India|last=Sharma|first=Partap|publisher=[[Jaico Publishing House]]|year=1975|editor-last=Razdan|editor-first=C.

*In 1980, it was removed from classrooms in [[Miller, Missouri|Miller]], Missouri among other challenges.
*In 1982, [[Polish people|Polish]] author Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fiction ''Zaczarowana gra'' ("The Magic Game"), presented accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities between ''Brave New World'' and two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish author [[Mieczysław Smolarski]], namely ''Miasto światłości'' ("The City of Light", 1924) and ''Podróż poślubna pana Hamiltona'' ("Mr Hamilton's Honeymoon Trip", 1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zaczarowana gra|last=Smuszkiewicz|first=Antoni|publisher=Wydawn.

*[[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that in writing ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' (1952), he "cheerfully ripped off the plot of ''Brave New World'', whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's ''We''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Playboy]] [http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html interview with Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155908/http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html |date=10 February 2009 }}, July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian values''' are the commonly shared ethical and human values of Canadians.&lt;ref name="Douglas Baer 1993"&gt;Douglas  Baer, Edward Grabb, and William Johnston, "National character, regional culture, and the values of Canadians and Americans." ''Canadian Review of Sociology/Revue canadienne de sociologie'' 30.1 (1993): 13-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  The major political parties have claimed explicitly that they uphold these values, but use generalities to specify them. [[Justin Trudeau]] after taking office as Prime Minister in 2015 tried to define what it means to be Canadian, saying that Canada lacks a core identity but does have shared values:
:There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada....There are shared values — openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first postnational state.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Lawson, "Trudeau's Canada, Again: With support from President Obama and the legacy of his father on his side, Justin Trudeau sets out to redefine what it means to be Canadian," [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/magazine/trudeaus-canada-again.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' Dec. 8, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scholars have tried to identify, measure and compare them with other countries.  Baer et al. argue that, "Questions of national character and regional culture have long been of interest to both Canadian and American social scientists. The Canadian literature has focussed largely on historical and structural reasons for regional distinctiveness and the possible role of regionalism in undermining a truly national Canadian character or ethos."&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Grabb, and Johnston, "National character, regional culture, and the values of Canadians and Americans."  (1993) p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also critics who say that such a task is practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Neil Macdonald|title=A very short list of Canadian values: Neil Macdonald|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/neil-macdonald-kellie-leitch-values-survey-1.3759075|accessdate=31 December 2016|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=September 13, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International comparisons==
When he began his study of Canada in the late 1940s,  American sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] assumed Canadian and American values were practically identical. Further work led him to discover and to explore the  differences.  By 1968 he concluded:
:Canadian values fall somewhere between those of Britain and the United States, rather than being almost identical with those of the United States, as I had assumed.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Lipset, ''Agrarian Socialism: The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in Saskatchewan, a Study in Political Sociology'' (1950; revised edition 1968) p xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipset  offered some theories of where the two societies differ, and why. That stimulated a large body of scholarship, with other scholars offering their own explanations and criticizing his.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Baer, et al.  "The values of Canadians and Americans: A critical analysis and reassessment." ''Social Forces'' 68.3 (1990): 693-713.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, numerous academic studies compare Canadian values and beliefs with those of the United States, and sometimes they add in other countries as well.    Lipset has explained his social science methodology:
:my conclusions [are] that the variations in North American history and social and geographic environments gave rise to two peoples who differ in significant ways from each other, although as I have repeatedly stressed, they are more similar than different, particularly in comparison with other nations. My chief methodological argument for focusing on Canada in order to learn about the United States is precisely that the two nations have so much in common. Focusing on small differences between countries which are alike can be more fruitful for understanding cultural effects than on large ones among highly similar nations. The former permits holding constant many variables, which the units have in common.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, "Defining Moments and Recurring Myths: A Reply" '' Canadian Review of Sociology &amp; Anthropology'' (2001) 38#1 pp 97-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipset presented numerous political and economic values on which he scored the U.S. as high and Canada as low.  These included:  individualism and competitiveness, entrepreneurship and high risk-taking, utopian moralism, inclination to political crusades,  populist or anti-establishment and anti-elite tendencies, a God-and-country nationalism, and intolerance for ideological nonconformity.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Lipset, "The Canadian Identity," ''International Journal of Canadian Studies'' (2006), Issue 33, pp 83-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical origins: Revolution and counterrevolution===
Lipset argues that:
:Many writers seeking to account for value differences between the United States and Canada suggest that they stem in large part from the revolutionary origins of the United States and the counterrevolutionary history of Canada…. The Loyalist emigrés from the American Revolution and Canada's subsequent repeatedly aroused fears of United States encroachment fostered the institutionalization of a counterrevolutionary or conservative ethos.&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution: Change and persistence in social structures (2nd ed, 1970) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.M.S. Careless, ''Canada: A story of challenge'' (Cambridge UP, 1963),  pp 111-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian historian [[Arthur R. M. Lower]] argues:
: in its new wilderness home and its new aspect of British North Americanism, colonial Toryism made its second attempt to erect on American soil a copy of the English social edifice. From one point of view this is the most significant thing about the Loyalist movement; it withdrew a class concept of life from the south, moved it up north, and gave it a second chance.&lt;ref&gt;A.R.M. Lower, ''From Colony to Nation'' (1946),  p 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious factors===

Religious belief and behavior are possible candidates in searching for the sources of values. Lipset looked to religion as one of the causes of differentiation compared to the United States.  He stated:

:America remains under the strong influence of the Protestant sects. Its northern neighbor adheres to two churches, Catholic and Anglican, and an ecumenical Protestant denomination (the United Church of Canada) that has moved far from the sectarian origins of its component units toward churchlike communitarian values. The overwhelming majority of Canadians (eighty-seven percent) belong to these three mainline denominations. Conservative evangelicals--groups of Baptists, Nazarenes, Pentecostals, Adventists, and so on--constitute only seven percent of Canadians....Clearly, the different religious traditions of the two countries help to explain much of their varying secular behavior and belief.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, ''Continental Divide'' (1990) PP 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover and Reimer agree and update Lipset with a plethora of recent survey statistics, while noting that the differences narrowed since 1990, especially in the Prairie provinces.  They stress that in the early 21st century 87% of Canadians belonged to cooperative churches, whereas 20% of Americans were Baptists and many more were evangelicals, fundamentalists  or members of new religions who tended to behave in a more sectarian fashion; these elements, they argue, made for a higher level of religious and political conservatism and intolerance in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R.  Hoover and Samuel H. Reimer. "Things That Make for a Peaceable Kingdom: An Overview of Christianity and 'Cooperativeness' across the Continental Divide." ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' 41.2 (2004): 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regionalism===
Baer, Grabb and Johnston argue that:
:The pattern of regional cultures is not significantly affected or defined by the national border separating Canada and the United States. Instead...with a few exceptions, the map of regional cultures involves three major segments: a relatively left-liberal Quebec, a more conservative Southern United States, and a comparatively moderate sector that largely encompasses the remainder of the two countries.&lt;ref name="Douglas Baer 1993"/&gt;

==Description==

A 2013 Statistics Canada survey found that an "overwhelming majority" of Canadians shared the values of human rights (with 92% of respondents agreeing that they are a shared Canadian value), respect for the law (92%) and gender equality (91%). There was considerably less agreement among Canadians over whether ethnic and cultural diversity, linguistic duality, and respect for aboriginal culture were also shared Canadian values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2015005-eng.htm#a2|title=Canadian Identity, 2013|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Canadian Index of Well Being at the [[University of Waterloo]], Canadian values include:
:* fairness
:* inclusion
:* democracy
:* economic security
:* safety
:* sustainability
:* diversity
:* equity
:* health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reflecting Canadian values|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/about-canadian-index-wellbeing/reflecting-canadian-values|publisher=Canadian Index of Well Being|accessdate=31 December 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey for Citizen's Forum on Canada's Future, 1991 identified the following values:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diane Symbaluk|author2=Tami Bereska |title=Sociology in Action, Canadian Edition, 2nd ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0hwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87|publisher=Nelson Education|isbn=978-0-17-672841-0|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Equality and fairness.
* Consultation and dialogue.
* Accommodation and tolerance.
* Diversity.
* Patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Kohler, “[https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/on-top-of-the-world-2/ Canadians Feel like They’re on Top of the World],” Macleans.ca, retrieved October 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Freedom, Peace and Nonviolent change.

===Monarchy===
[[Michael Ignatieff]], the Liberal leader in 2009-11, in 2004 rooted Canadian values in a historic loyalty to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Michael Jackson|title=The Crown and Canadian Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcIf46DzpfUC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2013|publisher=Dundurn|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise the  Conservative Party in 2009 pointed to support for the monarchy as a core Canadian value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shibao Guo|author2=Lloyd Wong|title=Revisiting Multiculturalism in Canada: Theories, Policies and Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW8iCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2015|publisher=SensePublishers|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping foreign policy===
[[John Diefenbaker]], the Conservative Prime Minister 1957-63, was reluctant to use Canadian values as a criterion for deciding on foreign policies. For example, Jason Zorbas argues that human rights abuses in Argentina  and Brazil did not affect relations with those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Gregory Zorbas|title=Diefenbaker and Latin America: The Pursuit of Canadian Autonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xkrBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However his successor, [[Lester Pearson]], the Liberal Prime Minister (1963–68), called in 1967 for a foreign policy "based on Canadian considerations, Canadian values and Canadian interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Spencer|title=Canadian Foreign Policy, Conservative Style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpYTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22canadian+values%22&amp;dq=%22canadian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHt7zuzLbRAhVmwVQKHTp8BgAQ6AEIMzAF|year=1958|publisher=Canadian Institute of International Affairs|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Conservative [[Brian Mulroney]], Prime Minister 1984 to 1993, according to scholar Edward Akuffo:
:Canadian foreign policy witnessed the integration of development and security issues and the foreign policy agenda when Canada participated in development projects as well as in peacekeeping operations....Mulroney's policy initiatives...[marked] the critical juncture for the revamping of 'Canada's moral identity' after the Cold War....The concept of Canada's moral identity is consistent with what others call the 'branding of Canada' in the international arena through the projection of Canadian values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Ansah Akuffo|title=Canadian Foreign Policy in Africa: Regional Approaches to Peace, Security, and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUUHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Chrétien]], the Liberal Prime Minister (1993-2003), showed little interest in foreign policy. Political scientists Patrick James, Nelson Michaud and Marc J. O'Reilly argue that, "This plain-speaking politician built his career on defending traditional Canadian values and promoting middle-class policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick James et al. eds.|title=Handbook of Canadian Foreign Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTk2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA514|year=2006|publisher=Books|page=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarianism, social equality, and peace===
While Liberal and Conservative politicians claimed to represent Canadian values, so too did socialists and forces on the left. Ian MacKay argues that, thanks to the long-term political impact of "Rebels, Reds, and Radicals", and allied leftist political elements, "egalitarianism, social equality, and peace... are now often simply referred to...as 'Canadian values.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian McKay|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc_yHAW03fIC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2005|publisher=Between The Lines|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Historic educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States, have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'' (2nd ed, 1970) pp 40-44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Crawford and James Curtis. "English Canadian-American differences in value orientations: Survey comparisons bearing on Lipset's thesis." ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 14.3-4 (1979): 23-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960, for example, 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Wanner, "Educational inequality: Trends in twentieth-century Canada and the United States." ''Comparative Social Research'' 9.1 (1986): 986+&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys in the late 1950s of citizens and educators by Lawrence Downey:
:Canadians, as a group, assigned considerably higher priority than did Americans to knowledge, scholarly attitudes, creative skills, aesthetic appreciation, and morality, as outcomes of schooling. Americans emphasized physical development, citizenship, patriotism, social skills, and family living much more than did Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence William Downey, ''The task of public education: The perceptions of people'' (Midwest Administration Center, University of Chicago, 1960), Quoted in Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'', p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has long emphasized vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'' p 41&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ivor F. Goodson]] and [[Ian Dowbiggin|Ian R. Dowbiggin]] have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era,  a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The  London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin, "Vocational education and school reform: the case of the London (Canada) Technical School, 1900-1930" ''History of Education Review'' (1991) 20#1: 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public universities====
Most post-secondary institutions in Canada are [[public universities]] which means they are funded by the provincial government, but they are not owned by the provinces.  In contrast, public universities in the United States are owned and controlled by state governments, and there are many  [[private universities]], including such schools as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago and Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theresa Shanahan et al.|title=The Handbook of Canadian Higher Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJcHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49|year=2016|publisher=MQUP|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms===
{{main|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, heavily promoted by Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], was adopted in 1982. The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the government. It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights.  Even before he entered politics, Trudeau had developed his concept of the charter primarily as an expression of common Canadian values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald Kernerman|author2=Philip Resnick|title=Insiders and Outsiders: Alan Cairns and the Reshaping of Canadian Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GtbeiDTfHQC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2005|publisher=UBC Press|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Trudeau said that thanks to the Charter, Canada itself could now be defined:
:Canada is a society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom.  The search for this Canadian identity, as much as my philosophical views, had led me to insist on the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Elliott Trudeau|title=Memoirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqsJbzlwtwsC&amp;pg=PA323|year=1993|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiculturalism===
{{main|Multiculturalism in Canada}}
The enormous ethnic variety of the population of Canada in recent decades has led to an emphasis on "[[multiculturalism]]."  Sociologist N. M. Sussman says, "The tenets of this concept permitted and subtly encouraged the private maintenance of ethnic values while simultaneously insisting on minimal public adherence to Canadian behaviors and to Canadian values." As result, immigrants to Canada are more likely to maintain the values and attitudes of both the home and of the host culture, compared to similar immigrants to Australia, the United Kingdom, or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chan Kwok-bun|title=International Handbook of Chinese Families|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7DqB4bOA0cC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2012|publisher=Springer |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Griffith argues that, "89 percent of Canadians believe that foreign-born Canadians are just as likely to be good citizens as those born in Canada....But Canadians clearly view multiculturalism in an integrative sense, with an expectation that new arrivals will adopt Canadian values and attitudes."  Griffith adds that, "There are virtually no differences between Canadian-born and foreign-born with respect to agreement to abide by Canadian values (70 and 68 percent, respectively)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Griffith|title=Multiculturalism In Canada: Evidence and Anecdote|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tO9iCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2015|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender equality and the role of women===
In 2016, the workforce participation rate for Canadian women was 70.2% (78.4% for males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=27th Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan|url=http://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/Docs/cpp27.pdf|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 January 2017|pages=18|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that [[Elsie MacGill]] defined Canadian values. She was a pioneer for women in engineering and business, a war hero and a role model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cristina Amon|author2=Mary Wells|author3=Kim Woodhouse|title=MacGill defined Canadian values|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2016/12/06/macgill-defined-canadian-values|accessdate=31 December 2016|publisher=The Whig|date=December 6, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.

In contrast, in the United States the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was never ratified.  Section 1 of that amendment would have granted "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."

Citing Canadian values, Canadian courts have rejected assertions that violence against women is in some circumstances acceptable because of one's religious and cultural beliefs.  In the ''R v. Humaid'' decision, Justice Rutherford of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated:
:Wife-murder may seem especially repugnant to our Canadian value fabric when cultural considerations that are contrary to our Canadian values figure prominently. However it must be borne in mind here that the Court of Appeal found "no air of reality" to the applicant's claim that religious and cultural beliefs resulted in his being severely provoked by what his wife said to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen v Adi Abdel Humaid|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2015/2015onsc5345/2015onsc5345.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQARImNhbmFkaWFuIHZhbHVlcyIAAAAAAQ&amp;resultIndex=28|publisher=Ontario Superior Court of Justice|accessdate=5 January 2017|location=paragraphs 23 and 24|language=English|date=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicly funded health care===
Universal access to publicly funded health services "is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Health of Canadians – The Federal Role|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/372/soci/rep/repoct02vol6part7-e.htm|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=5 January 2017|location=17.1   Universality|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Survey research in the 1990s showed that:
:When asked, "What makes you most proud of Canada?" one in three Canadians volunteered, "Our health-care system." When asked a reversed version of the American health-care scenario, "Would you support political union [with the U.S.] if it meant a private health-care system?" The reply was a resounding 'no'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald F. Inglehart et al.|title=The North American Trajectory: Cultural, Economic, and Political Ties Between the United States, Canada, and Mexico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12e8SCQF4DwC&amp;pg=PA146|year=1996|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbaric Cultural Practices issue===
Certain cultural practices were called "Barbaric" and made illegal in 2015, when the ''Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act'' was enacted by the Canadian federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbaric Cultural Practices Act|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/astat/sc-2015-c-29/latest/sc-2015-c-29.html|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ashley Csanady|title='Barbaric Cultural Practices' bill to criminalize forced marriage, tackle 'honour killings' passes final vote|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/barbaric-cultural-practices-bill-to-criminalize-forced-marriage-tackle-honour-killings-set-for-final-vote|accessdate=31 December 2016|agency=National Post|date=June 17, 2015|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2015%5F29/page-1.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=1 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 general election Conservatives pitched their policy "as an issue of Canadian values....The Conservatives expanded the issue, announcing a proposed RCMP hotline that would allow Canadians to report the existence of 'barbaric cultural practices' in the country." These targeted practices included [[polygamy]], [[forced marriage]] and early marriage (i.e. [[child marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon H. Pammett|author2=Christopher Dornan|title=The Canadian Federal Election of 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtEkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT220|date= 2016|publisher=Dundurn|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 act criminalizes certain conduct related to early and [[forced marriage]] ceremonies, including the act of removing a child from Canada for the purpose of such marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=989099 |title=Archived - Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act receives Royal Assent - Canada News Centre |publisher=News.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial to the Victims of Communism – Canada, a Land of Refuge==

The [[Memorial to the Victims of Communism (Ottawa)|Memorial to the Victims of Communism  – Canada, a Land of Refuge]] is located in Ottawa.  It is being constructed to bring the suffering of "the millions of victims Communism" into the public's consciousness.  Many of the victims fled to Canada "seeking peace, order, democracy, and liberty." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial to the Victims of Communism|url=http://tributetoliberty.ca/memorial-why|accessdate=15 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memorial is expected to be completed in 2018.

According to Ms. Mélanie Joly, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, "Commemorative monuments play a key role in reflecting the character, identity, history and values of Canadians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1030769|title=Minister Joly Launches Public Consultations on the Memorial to the Victims of Communism – Canada A Land of Refuge|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Canada|language=English|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203090813/http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1030769|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=yes|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She complained that the previous Harper government had made the project too controversial.

==Screening immigrants for anti-Canadian values==

Canadian politicians have proposed rejecting immigrants who have anti-Canadian values such as:

:* intolerance toward other religions, cultures, genders, and sexual orientations
:* reluctance to embrace Canadian freedoms&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bruce Campion-Smith|title=Canadians favour screening would-be immigrants for 'anti-Canadian' values, poll shows|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/10/canadians-favour-screening-immigrant-values-poll-shows.html|accessdate=31 December 2016|agency=Toronto Star|date=September 10, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kellie Leitch]], a candidate for leadership candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada, is among the proponents of this type of screening.
&lt;ref name="thestar1"/&gt;

==Province of Quebec==

===Bill 101 - Charter of the French Language===
The [[Charter of the French Language]] is Quebec legislation that makes French the official language of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Y. Bourhis, ed., ''Conflict and Language Planning in Quebec'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the Charter requires:

* all administrative government documents to be drafted and published in French
* the language of instruction from kindergarten to secondary school to be French

===Quebec Charter of Values===
The [[Quebec Charter of Values]] is legislation that was proposed in the Quebec legislature in 2013 but which was not enacted into law.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tessier and Éric Montigny. "Untangling myths and facts: Who supported the Québec Charter of Values?" ''French Politics'' 14.2 (2016): 272-285.&lt;/ref&gt; It would ban [[public sector]] employees from wearing conspicuous religious symbols. Article 5 in Chapter II states:
:In the exercise of their functions, personnel members of public bodies must not wear objects such as headgear, clothing, jewelry or other adornments which, by their conspicuous nature, overtly indicate a religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Trygve Ugland, "The Quebec Charter of Values: A Solution in Search of Problems." ''Journal of Eastern Townships Studies'' 42 (2014): 11+ [http://eprints.ubishops.ca/104/1/JETS%2042%20Ugland%20article.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Trudeau has been  a champion of the "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms"; he opposed the "Quebec Charter of Values."  He stated: "Prohibiting someone from wearing a hijab or a kippah is not compatible with Quebec and Canadian values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Huguette Young|title=Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6vrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=2016|publisher=Dundurn|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinct society===
Proposed changes to the Canadian Constitution included adding the phrase "[[distinct society]]" to the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] to recognizes the uniqueness of Quebec as compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burgess, "Ethnicity, nationalism and identity in Canada‐Quebec relations: The case of Quebec's 'distinct society'." ''Journal of Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics'' 34.2 (1996): 46-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Johnston and Andre Blais. "Meech Lake and Mass Politics: The'Distinct Society'Clause."

==Controversy==
Defining Canadian values is problematic if the goal is to identify values that are universally held.

According to [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] reporter [[Neil Macdonald]], there are "precious few notions that can accurately be described as universally held Canadian values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/neil-macdonald-kellie-leitch-values-survey-1.3759075|title=A very short list of Canadian values: Neil Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Lysiane Gagnon]], Canadians "don't share common values."

===Nationalism and its potential adverse impact on foreign policy===
Scholars have asked whether shared values underpin national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Henderson and Nicola McEwen. "Do shared values underpin national identity? Examining the role of values in national identity in Canada and the United Kingdom." ''National Identities'' 7.2 (2005): 173-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Stairs links the concept of Canadian values with  [[nationalism]].  Stairs, the McCulloch Professor in Political Science at [[Dalhousie University]], has argued that there is indeed an intense widespread belief in the existence of Canadian values, but says that belief can itself be harmful. He contends that:
:[Canadians typically] think of themselves not as others are, but as morally superior. They believe, in particular, that they subscribe to a distinctive set of values - ''Canadian'' values - and that those values are special in the sense of being unusually virtuous. A prominent effect of that belief is that it has put them in serious danger of misunderstanding the true origins of their behaviour, on the one hand, and of doing significant damage to the effectiveness of their diplomacy, both next door and overseas, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Stairs,  "Myths, Morals, and Reality in Canadian Foreign Policy" ''International Journal'' 58#2 (2003) pp. 239-256 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40203840 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stairs also argues that,  "first billing is usually given in received lists of Canadian values to 'multiculturalism'...as a means of challenging the premises of nationalism in Quebec."&lt;ref&gt;Stairs,  "Myths, morals, and reality in Canadian foreign policy," p 247&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cargo system''' (also known as the civil-religious hierarchy, ''fiesta'' or ''mayordomía'' system) is a collection of secular and religious positions held by men or households in rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] communities throughout central and southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].  These revolving offices, or ''cargos'', become the unpaid responsibility of men who are active in civic life.  They typically hold a given post for a term of one year, and alternate between civic and religious obligations from year to year.  Office holders execute most of the tasks of local governments and churches.  Individuals who hold a cargo are generally obligated to incur the costs of feasting during the ''fiestas'' that honor particular saints.

Where it is practiced, there is generally some expectation of all local men to take part in this cargo system throughout their lives.  Office holders assume greater responsibilities as they grow in stature in the community.  Such progression requires substantial financial resources, but eventually an individual who holds a requisite number of posts in service to his community retires and joins a group of elders instrumental in community decision-making, including appointing people to cargos.

This expectation of local men to take part in this system is both an economic and a social one, as those who do not contribute are seen as not being deserving of living in the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sueann Caulfield|editor2=Sarah C. Chambers|editor3=Lara Putnam|title=Honor, status, and law in modern Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0-8223-3587-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served to create a village system where the old were helped by the young and women helped by men. Furthermore, the legal enforcement of village obligations solidified communal (social) identity, rather than an identity dependent upon and linked to the national state. The cargo system has also been considered influenced by traditional Hispanic customs, as the municipal government provided the tradition of ''cargas consejiles', where village residents are obligated to serve post terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sueann Caulfield|editor2=Sarah C. Chambers|editor3=Lara Putnam|title=Honor, status, and law in modern Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0-8223-3587-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the cargo system was a ladder system in which indigenous men could climb up. The cargo system was mainly defined as a public labor and community service. Villages that were impoverished were able to get help easier because taxes were not charged, yet public work was given. It was a system in which involved faithful and long term community service. Men and women (husband and wife) were considered one unit, men needed their wives in order to succeed in their community. Women did not claim rights in relation to village government.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Sueann, et al. “Community Service, Liberal Law and Local Custom in Indigenous Villages: Oaxaca, 1750-1850.” Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of the cargo system are tied to the efforts of [[Spain|Spanish]] missionaries to convert [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to Christianity while at the same time forestalling their cultural Hispanicization.  After the Spanish conquest of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 16th century, many Indians were forcibly relocated to [[pueblo]]s, which like Spanish villages contained a church as the town center.  Priests were one of many special interest foreigners who had control over the political and social affairs of indigenous peoples, and they had dominion over many of these pueblos and had the authority to keep other colonists out.  The priests were mindful that much of their influence over the Indians stemmed from the priests' ability to speak Indian languages.  Despite a 1550 royal edict calling for native peoples to be taught the Spanish language, missionaries continued to minister to them in [[Nahuatl]] and other local languages, thus preserving a major source of Indian dependency on the church.  The colonial church did not insist on excessive [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicization]] of existing indigenous practices, so long as there was no clear conflict between the two.

Because the missionaries were small in number, they increasingly placed religious responsibilities in the hands of trusted members of the villages.  The village mayor or ''alcalde'' was charged with the responsibility of leading the villagers in a procession to Sunday [[Catholic Mass|Mass]].  Over time, these processions were conducted with greater ceremony, making use of trappings such as crosses, incense, and music.

The cargo system was used and transformed by communities within the context of law to eliminate noble exemption privileges. This brought to an end many internal feuds over ''principales'' with regards to nobility. Noble exemptions were opposed by the common people, who were worried that such exemptions would negatively impact the supply of labour to the point of constant service. It was impossible to become part of the nobility by marrying the daughter of a noble, and was instead pushed by claimants based on heritage. Therefore, in practice, the system was not as egalitarian as in the hypothetical sense, because while some men could move to greater positions and into seats of authority, others lacked the prestige to accomplish the same. The dispersal of the ability to accumulate wealth along with prestige also contributed greatly to the transformation of these villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sueann Caulfield|editor2=Sarah C. Chambers|editor3=Lara Putnam|title=Honor, status, and law in modern Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0-8223-3587-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion drawing on a Spanish institution called the ''cofradías'', the priests created a hierarchy of village posts in order to better organize the religious and civil lives of their Indians.  Indigenous people filled these roles, which in theory gave them greater status within the community.  These roles, however, also placed economic obligations on their recipients and the clergy used them as a way to exercise control over the villagers.  Villagers were obligated to organize efforts to discharge debts related to cost of food, wafers and wine for the Mass and payment of the priests.

The cargo system could a serve a manner in which people could elevate their station in society. People who faithfully discharged their duties through a series of mundane tasks could increase their social status which resulted in greater access for job opportunities and loftier positions.  In short, community service allowed one to move up in the hierarchy of their society. Eventually villagers could reach a high ranking position as members of the principals, who in turn would vote for the communal leader, the gobernadores. The ''caciques'' ore pre-Hispanic nobles were exempt from the low standing positions, although a person from meager beginnings could ultimately serve to accumulate wealth and power.

The cargo system also affected marital life. The man would work in the household of his in-laws. After marriage, the wife would move in with the groom’s family in which she served as a domestic servant for her mother-in law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26377">A '''comic book letter column''' is a section of an [[American comic book]] where readers' letters to the publisher appear. Comic book letter columns are also commonly referred to as '''letter columns''' (or '''lettercols'''), '''letter pages''', '''letters of comment''' ('''LOCs'''), or simply '''[[letters to the editor]]'''. Letter columns appeared early on in the history of comic books themselves, and their growing prevalence — particularly beginning in the 1960s — helped create and legitimatize comics [[fandom]]. Letter columns remained a regular feature of most comic books until the early years of the 21st century, when they were gradually phased out in favor of the growing prevalence of [[email]] and [[Internet forums]].

==History==
Although they were already standard in the [[science fiction magazine]]s of the time, the first recorded comic book letter column appeared in ''Target Comics'' #6, published by [[Novelty Press]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="overstreet"&gt;Overstreet, Robert M. ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'', vol. 33. House of Collectibles, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (The page in question also has an early mention of comic book collecting.)&lt;ref name="overstreet" /&gt; The first [[DC Comics]] comic to include a letters column was ''Real Fact Comics'' #3 (Jul-Aug 1946).&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=13011&amp;Lot_No=15707&amp;src=pr Heritage Auction Galleries: Amazing Comics Auction #13011; Lot #15707.

Retrieved November 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first DC title with a letters column as a regular feature was ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' beginning with issue #124 (September 1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irvine|first= Alex|authorlink = Alexander C.

Early versions of the lettercol tended to be simple fan letters, often from young readers. These letters tended to be praise for the previous issue's story and artwork; or simplistic questions about the correct pronunciation of "[[Mxyzptlk]]" or where Superman put his Clark Kent clothes when he was in costume;&lt;ref&gt;Engblom, Mark.

Letter columns came into their prime in the 1960s, when readers' letters became longer and the discussions more sophisticated. For example, in the mid-1960s longtime letter writer (and future comics historian) [[Peter Sanderson]]'s lengthy, well-reasoned, and impressively erudite missives forced [[DC Comics|DC]] editor [[Julie Schwartz]] to expand the lettercols in his books to a second, separate page (such as "Flash-Grams — Extra", "Letters To the Batcave — Extra", and "JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition") to facilitate Sanderson's sharp analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Hembeck, Fred.

By the 1970s, nearly all mainstream comics included letter pages. Historian Matthew J. Pustz describes the different approaches of the two major publishers, DC and [[Marvel Comics]]:
{{cquote|There were, however, important differences between the lettercols published by DC and Marvel. In many DC comics, letters were shortened, excerpted, or compiled into lists of suggested guest stars. Marvel letters pages, conversely, often contained very long letters in which fans praised, criticized, or offered detailed suggestions. Unlike DC editors, who referred to readers as 'them,' the editors of Marvel's letters pages frequently directly addressed their fans, often using the inclusive 'we' or 'us.' . . . Negative letters were common, but the criticism often differed. While Marvel fans' criticism could be very pointed, focusing on the work of particular writers and artists or even the company's whole output, negative letters from DC fans were usually mild. . . . By the early 1980s, though, DC letter columns began to become more like Marvel's, with longer letters that privileged content and commentary over simple reaction. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marvel letter pages had lost much of their critical edge, with DC lettercols taking up the slack.&lt;ref name="Pustz"&gt;Pustz, Matthew J. ''Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers'' (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the letter column became a longstanding tradition in the mainstream comic book industry, it even became a feature of [[underground comix|underground]], [[independent comics|independent]], and [[alternative comics]] of the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, a trend in letter writing developed in which readers would send in specific, bulleted questions about the direction of the series, plot points, etc.; which were often answered (or evaded) by the writer or editor point-by-point.

By the first few years of the 21st century, as comic-related  forums sprang up all over the Internet, letter columns were gradually replaced by advertisements or in-house promotions. In 2002, DC officially ended the practice of the letter page&lt;ref&gt;Stuever, Hank. "A Dead-Letters Day: Comic Books End Printed Mail Columns As Fans Turn to Web," ''Washington Post'', page C1, December 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; — only to bring it back in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, David. [http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/01/03/dcu-in-2011-dc-nation-letter-columns-return-to-dc-comic-books "DCU in 2011: DC Nation: Letter Columns Return to DC Comic Books,"] ''DC Comics Fan News'' (Jan. 11., 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many independent titles (such as ''[[Usagi Yojimbo]]'', ''[[Hellboy]]'', ''[[Optic Nerve (comics)|Optic Nerve]]'', ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Chew (comics)|Chew]]'', and ''[[King-Cat Comics]]'') still feature letters pages to this day.

==Form and content==
As standardized by the big mainstream American companies, the letter column was typically overseen by one of the comic’s staff members, often the book’s editor (or later on, the assistant editor), and occasionally the book’s writer(s).

The letters page was often used as a soapbox, where in addition to responding to reader comments, the editor would provide behind-the-scenes details about the comics world, announce changes to the title or the creative team, plea for more (or better) letters, needle the competition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bp6607.html "Marvel Bullpen Bulletins" (July 1966).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007034749/http://costa.lunarpages.com/bp/bp6607.html |date=2008-10-07 }} Accessed Feb. 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and otherwise communicate with readers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080115190045/http://www.geocities.com/mh_prime/remarks.html Gruenwald, Mark. "Mark's Remarks Index." Accessed July 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the monthly (or longer) lag between issues, a comic’s letter column usually featured reader responses to issues about three-to-five months prior to the current one. Occasionally, if a story ran too long one month, or there were printer-related problems, a comic's letters page would be omitted that issue. This would often produce an outcry from deprived readers in later letter columns, accompanied by the requisite apologies and explanations.

Until the late-1970s, letter columns were usually found in the middle of the book, when they mostly moved to the book’s second-to-last page (the last page tending to be an advertisement).&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Roger, ed. "Avengers Assemble!" ''Avengers'' #186 (Marvel Comics, August 1979), p. 31: "... and while Jim [Shooter] thanks you for the kind words, he'd like to point out that it was Roger Stern's idea to move his letters pages back to page 31... a move with which — we're proud to say — most other editors have enthusiastically followed suit!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 1960 — thanks in no small part to the urging of motivated readers like [[Jerry Bails]] (later to be known as the '"father of comics fandom") and [[Roy Thomas]] — DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters, a custom of long standing in science fiction magazines and one which helped originate [[science fiction fandom]] (where Schwartz himself got his start in publishing). The first letters page with the letter writers' full addresses appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #35 (May 1961).&lt;ref name="schelly"&gt;Schelly, Bill. ''The Golden Age of Comic Fandom'', Hamster Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this practice, many readers connected with each other, becoming [[penpals]], and starting communities of fans and/or publishing [[fanzines]]. In a number of cases, readers (including future ''[[X-Men]]'' artist [[Dave Cockrum]])&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;Jacobson, Aileen. "Serious Comics Fans," Washington Post (Aug 16, 1971), p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; "met" their future spouses via a comic book letter page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=1353 Pulfer, Richard. "The Flickering Mind of Al Schroeder III," Broken Frontier (May 28, 2008). Accessed July 17, 2008.]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} In 1979, a woman named Barb Long saw Al Schroeder III's letters in the ''Superman'' letter columns, and wrote to him. He wrote back, and six months later, they met face to face.

Peter Sanderson writes of Schwartz's letter columns:
{{cquote|Julie Schwartz’s letter columns were the best in the business: . . . Schwartz sought and published letters with wit, style and intelligence, that demonstrated genuine, if still budding, critical faculties. . . .Schwartz treated his comics lettercols as a means of thought-provoking entertainment, just like the stories themselves. So many letter columns in other books ran non-answers by anonymous staffers; Schwartz, in contrast, always made clear he treated his readers’ opinions with respect. By printing names and addresses of his letter writers, he fostered communication among readers in a time before comics shops or conventions. . . . Moreover, in encouraging his more creative correspondents, Schwartz set a number of them on the path to becoming comics professionals themselves. Quite a number of comics pros made their first appearances in print in 1960s Schwartz lettercols. . . .&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Peter. [https://archive.is/20130131224006/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2004/04/02/comics-in-context-32-the-living-legend/ "Comics in Context #32: The Living Legend," Quickstop Entertainment (Apr. 2, 2004).] Accessed Nov. 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief/publisher [[Stan Lee]], [[Marvel Comics]] also decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters. Lee made it a priority to create a community of readers, giving them a sense of personal investment in Marvel and its titles. Lee's ambition to create a company aesthetic in this way was overwhelming successful; many Marvel fans would sign off their letters with the phrase, "Make Mine Marvel!"

For many fans, having a letter printed was a badge of honor — especially if it was in one of the more high-profile letters pages. The feeling was that if one wrote enough good letters, it was possible to influence the direction of the comic and/or one's favorite characters. And as letters pages became more collaborative in this way, many became forums for long-running discussions among the editors and readers, with topics ranging from what defined a "mutant" to real-world issues such as religion, racism, feminism, gay rights, and the rights of the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Morris E. III. "Coming Out in Comic Books: Letter Columns, Readers, and Gay and Lesbian Characters," ''Comics &amp; Ideology'' chapter 10 (New York: Peter Lang, 2001), pp. 221-250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busiek, Kurt.

''Avengers'' #183 (Marvel Comics, May 1979).]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cerebus'' creator [[Dave Sim]]'s comments about women, for example, became the source of a particularly long-running and bitter debate in the pages of "Aardvark Comment".&lt;ref&gt;A strongly worded recap of that controversy can be found in [http://www.tcj.com/263/e_stephen.html "Masculinity's Last Hope, or Creepily Paranoid Misogynist? An Open Letter to Dave Sim" by R.S. Stephen. ''The Comics Journal'' #263, Oct./Nov. 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain circumstances, it was practice for Marvel and DC to solicit letters for titles which had trouble filling a letters page each month.&lt;ref&gt;Kupperberg, Alan, [http://www.alankupperberg.com/yancy.html "It Started on Yancy Street: A Personal Reminiscence," AlanKupperberg.com.] "By early 1970 . . . I often contributed custom-written 'fan-mail' for correspondence-starved letters pages on request."&lt;/ref&gt; While popular titles could receive up to 40 or more letters per month, other titles might not receive enough to even fill a page.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt; In desperate circumstances, DC and Marvel lettercol assemblers were even known to write fake letters under assumed names, just to fill out the column.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;

For some time in the 1970s, Marvel editors (and assistant editors, like [[Mark Gruenwald]])&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Jeff. [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/gruenwaldmark.htm "Mark Gruenwald," Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.]: "In Gruenwald's early days as an assistant editor, he would refer to himself on the letters page as an 'armadillo.'" Accessed Feb. 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; responded to readers' letters in the guise of a "friendly armadillo." Beginning in 1980, under new editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]], Marvel instituted new letter column policies. One change was to let writers of certain titles (rather than the book's editor) manage the letters pages.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]. ''Avengers'' #196 (Marvel Comics, June 1980): "As you may have already noticed in a number of other Marvel titles, some letters pages are now being conducted by the regular writers of the books in which they appear. . . . We feel that readers who care enough about a book to take the time to write to it should know that their letters are being read, and considered, by real people."&lt;/ref&gt; The other was to eliminate the conceit of the "armadillo" and have the books' editors or writers respond to letters under the own names.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]. "Printed Circuits," ''Iron Man'' #135, Marvel Comic, June 1980): "The armadillo is dead. . . . [W]e figured that our readers deserve to know who they're talking to, and to get answers back from real live humans who are directly involved with the titles you care about."&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, some DC Comics letters pages — like those in ''[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]'' and ''[[Ambush Bug]]'' — used the humorous device of having the main character "respond" to letters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Marvel's [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], as part of his regular practice of breaking the "[[fourth wall]]," also answered his own letters.

The letters page also functioned as another form of "house ad," a place to promote the book, other books in the same line, or the comic book publishing company in general.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;Carlson, KC. [http://westfieldcomics.com/feature/224 "KC: LOC," Westfield Comics (Sept. 2008).]. Retrieved Sept. 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some had additional purposes such as in the 1980s ''[[Question (comics)|The Question]]'' series, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]], whose letters pages included a reading recommendation with each issue to complement the [[philosophical]] points illustrated in the feature story.

===Letter column titles===
&lt;!--{{Main|List of comic book letter column titles}} --&gt;
The typical letters page had its own title, which was usually a reference to the book’s hero or heroes. "Cape and Cowl Comments" (''[[World's Finest Comics]]''), "JLA Mailroom" (''[[Justice League of America]]''), "Legion Outpost" (''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]''), "Metropolis Mailbag," (''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]''), "Avengers Assemble!" (''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''), "Letters to the Living Legend," (''[[Captain America]]''), "The Spider's Web" (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''), and "X-Mail," (''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'') are just a few examples of this tradition. ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' faced difficulties in this aspect, as the United States Postal Service objected to delivering what were labeled as "Suicide Notes."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Some books had trouble sticking with a lettercol title, and changed them on a more or less regular basis. It soon became a tradition to hold a contest for fans to write in with column title ideas, with the winning writer credited in the letters page. Similarly, when a new comic book series was created, readers were asked to submit names for the lettercol title right from the outset.

==Reader participation==
[[Jerry Bails]] may have been the first reader to believe he could influence the direction of his favorite comics. In the early 1960s, he bombarded the DC offices with suggestions for new [[Silver Age of Comic Books|superhero revivals]] such as was already happening with the Flash, the Justice League, and so on. For instance, in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #4, the letters page is filled with missives from Bails under different pen names. He did everything he could to fool editor Julius Schwartz, including mailing the letters from all across the country.&lt;ref name="schelly" /&gt;

Later on, during the lettercol heyday of the 1970s and 1980s, many comics actively encouraged reader participation. Fans were asked to weigh in on a character’s uniform changes, or in some cases, submit their own uniform designs, with the winning entry actually becoming the character’s new costume.&lt;ref&gt;Fan-designed costumes for the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were published in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #403 (Apr. 1971, after the Legion's run ended in that comic). In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' vol. 1, #183 (Mar. 1972), Duo Damsel, Saturn Girl, Karate Kid, Projectra, and Shadow Lass wore these costumes; only those for Duo Damsel and Saturn Girl were adopted for the long-run.&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' and ''The Vision and Scarlet Witch'' limited series were asked to suggest names for the main characters' babies.&lt;ref&gt;''Tomb of Dracula'' #48-51 (Marvel Comics, 1976), and ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #8 (May 1986), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; (Winners of contests liked these were often awarded with original artwork from the book in question.)&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul. [http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/015_swan/015_swan.htm "Curt Swan: A Superman Walked Among Us," Comic Book Marketplace (2002)]: "When it came to his original artwork, like many comic book journeymen of his time . . . [Curt] Swan was pretty cavalier about keeping any for himself. He had no problem that much of it [was] used to be given away to readers as letter column prizes. . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Deliveries," ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'', vol. 2, #12 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

For team books like ''The Avengers'', ''Justice League'', or the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'', fans were polled as to which characters should become permanent members, team leaders, or conversely, excised from the team. (Readers were also asked to suggest or vote on the title of the letter column. [[#Letter column titles|See further discussion below]].)
Many 1970s Marvel lettercols stressed the importance of reader feedback, such as this one from ''Power Man'' #24 (April 1975): "We don't score hits with every issue. Sometimes a story has flaws or just doesn't come up to snuff. Which is why your letters are so valuable to us in producing these comments. . . . So don't let anybody tell you your letters aren't important, people. They are vital to these magazines."&lt;ref&gt;Wein, Len, ed. "Comments to Cage," ''Power Man'' #24 (Marvel Comics, Apr. 1975), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, (beginning in the 1980s) the most esteemed letterhacks were occasionally solicited to send letters based on early preview copies, thus helping to build a fan-base for a new title.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Kevin Noel. [http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/114603002119259.htm "Cobb and Ten Rounds With Beau Smith," Comics Bulletin, April 26, 2006.

===Letterhacks===
{{Main|Letterhack}}
Fans whose letters were published regularly became well known throughout the industry by virtue of their letters. Writer Mark Engblom describes the phenomenon this way:
{{cquote|Chosen by the title's editor (or, in some cases, the writer), a few lucky fans would get the opportunity to share their opinion with not only the creators, but a captive audience of fellow fans as well.  In fact, some of the most prolific fans had letters printed almost every month in a variety of titles, becoming minor celebrities in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Engblom, Mark.

}}
Some of the most prolific "LOCers" or "letterhacks" include [[Jerry Bails]], [[T.M. Maple]] (who published over 3,000 letters), Augie De Blieck, Jr. (who claims to have published over 400 letters),&lt;ref&gt;De Blieck Jr., Augie.

As discussed above, some letterhacks gained entrée into an actual career in comics because of their letter-writing expertise. For instance, [[Bob Rozakis]] parlayed his frequent published letters to DC comics during the late 1960s and early 1970s into a job as DC's "Answer Man" and eventually a solid career as a DC writer. [[Kurt Busiek]], [[Mary Jo Duffy]], [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Fred Hembeck]], [[Tony Isabella]], [[Paul Levitz]], [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]], [[Dean Mullaney]], [[Martin Pasko]], [[Diana Schutz]], [[Beau Smith]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Kim Thompson]] are just a few of the many comic book professionals who got their starts as young letterhacks.

'''Fashion tourism''' is a niche market segment evolved out of three major sectors: Creative Tourism, [[Cultural tourism|Cultural Tourism]] and Shopping Tourism. Fashion Tourism can be defined as “the interaction between [[Destination marketing organization|Destination Marketing Organizations]] (DMOs), trade associations, tourism suppliers and host communities, with people travelling to and visiting a particular place for business or leisure to enjoy, experiment, discover, study, trade, communicate about and  consume [[fashion]].”&lt;ref name="janmiller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janmiller.co|title=Jan Miller Consultancy|publisher=janmiller.co|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All over the world today cities are increasingly using the cultural industries for the development of tourism and other industries to boost their economic fortune and to position themselves in the global market. There is often no need for cities to specialize in any new activity but rather to diversify their economy and it is in this context that fashion tourism has been adopted and promoted in many cities. See examples for [[Antwerp]],&lt;ref name="visitantwerpen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitantwerpen.be/Bezoekerssite-EN/Visitors/to-do/to-do-exploring-the-city/to-do-exploring-the-city-with-a-guide/guided-tours-by-theme-(groups)/walks-by-theme-(groups)-fashion--lifestyle-city.html|title=Visit Antwerpen – Official tourism portal of Antwerp Tourism &amp; Convention.|publisher=visitantwerpen.be|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]],&lt;ref name="FashionCityInsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.FashionCityInsider.com|title=Fashion City Insider|publisher=FashionCityInsider.com|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="tokyofashion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokyofashion.com/fashion-map/|title=Tokyo Fashion Map - TokyoFashion.com|publisher=tokyofashion.com|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion is a global industry and many capital cities have press-grabbing trade activity at least twice a year, e.g. London through its [[London Fashion Week]], and this is often the starting point for many DMOs to take fashion seriously as a new anchor for their tourism industry and visitor economy. They are consciously pushing fashion week trade events into the public eye to raise their city’s fashionable credentials and encourage visitors to consider travel to their city.

== Prime movers ==
London (via the Mayor of London’s office) and New York (via the New York City Economic Development Council) government offices have been leading the way internationally to use their fashion credentials to attract visitors to their cities and wider. Other cities also following suit having seen the economic impact which London and New York’s fashion credentials can bring. Seoul now has two fashion weeks, and riding on the reputation of these, the city now has a vast complex of shopping malls and wholesale retailers which attract more than two million visitors per year, including just about half of all the tourists who come to Seoul.&lt;ref name="travel.cnn.com"&gt;Fashion is essential to tourism; 6 January 2012, by Hannah Bae; http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/shop/tell-me-about-it/hannah-bae-fashion-essential-tourism-405067&lt;/ref&gt;  Singapore also has a fashion week and the Singapore Tourism Board includes fashion as one of the high-profile component for enhancing the city’s destination attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Tourism Board: Annual report 12/13; http://www.stb.gov.sg/htm/STBAnnualReport/STB_AR12-13/pdf/stb_ar_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a city as obscure as Lagos, Nigeria, (in terms of fashion credentials) has recently commissioned the Central University of Applied Sciences to prepare a report titled ‘The Emerging Role of Fashion Tourism and The Need for a Development Strategy’&lt;ref&gt;The Emerging Role of Fashion Tourism and The Need for a Development Strategy in Lagos Nigeria, Olubukola Bada, Central University of Applied Sciences, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; so that they could assess the advantages fashion could bring to their local and regional economy.

== Shopping as a tourism motivator ==
Shopping has become a motive to travel and is now a major tourist activity. Visitors are increasingly choosing shopping as a way to experience local culture through an engagement with local products and local craftspeople, and some destinations provide special tourist shopping activities for tourists to shop for goods.&lt;ref&gt;Conciergeetcetera.com, Fashion Tourism – The Ultimate Epicure of Travel, June 26, 2013Culture, shopping, Tourism&lt;/ref&gt; As a niche market segment within shopping tourism, the economic importance of fashion tourism cannot be under-estimated. The recently launched [[Bicester]] designer shopping village, an hours train journey out of London is now the third largest shopping destination in the UK after [[Harrods]] and [[Selfridges]], and the Bicester train station has signage in Mandarin and Arabic.&lt;ref name="travel.cnn.com" /&gt; Individual fashion brands also play a major part in fashion tourism marketing. VisitBritain, the UK’s tourism board, recently stated that the luxury clothing brand Burberry has almost played a lone hand in attracting lucrative high-spending Chinese tourists to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese tourists can help UK out of recession, says British tourist board; 10 October 2012; James Meikle; theguardian.com; https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/chinese-tourists-uk-shopping-recession&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tourism statistical data of the U.S. Office of Travel and Tourism Industries on tourism performance, shopping ranked as the top participation activity for Asians (90%) and Western Europeans (86%), and Eastern European tourists (85%). Detailed profiles for countries of origin show that shopping is on the top among all other tourist activities for the European countries of Ireland (93%), Spain (82%), and Italy (79%). Asian shopping participation percentages are particularly high in Taiwan (93%) and Japan (92%).&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wilson blog ‘Shopping tourism’, April 2012 http://www.slideshare.net/wilsontom/shopping-tourism&lt;/ref&gt;

There are increasing incentives to travel for economic reasons, as purchasing power and currency fluctuations can play an important role in travel decision making, as well as relative price positioning. There is a trend within shopping tourism for consumers from [[emerging markets]], notably [[China]] and [[South America]], to plan their trips according to where fashion [[Handbag|handsbags]] are cheapest. Up to 50% of sales of [[luxury goods]] in Western Europe are generated by foreigners and global travel generates as much as 30% of total sales of luxury goods.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"&gt;The rise of accessories tourism; October 13, 2011  by Vanessa Friedman; http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2011/10/13/the-rise-of-accessories-tourism/&lt;/ref&gt; The queues of non-Parisians outside Louis Vuitton clearly mean something, but according to an HSBC report ‘The Bling Dynasty’,&lt;ref&gt;China's Bling Shoppers Choose Asia Over Europe; 3 April 2013, by Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani; https://www.cnbc.com/id/100611573&lt;/ref&gt; this is less about status (the chic of buying from the point of origin) than economic intelligence (the savings involved). This isn’t limited to luxury products. Brazil has overtaken the UK as the source of the largest group of tourists to Florida and New York, and they spend close to twice as much as British tourists on products, partly because they can make savings of up to 70% on US merchandise compared to its cost in Brazil.. The nature of shopping tourism is certainly changing: “It’s not about souvenirs - it’s about savings”.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"/&gt;

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]],'' not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word."&lt;ref name="UTorontoRounds2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|title=Psychiatry Rounds: The case for and against publicly funded transsexual surgery|date=April 2000|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Toronto, Ontario|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304092619/http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-04|volume=4|issue=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008 /&gt;  It was called the ''feminine essence narrative'' by [[Alice Dreger]] in 2008,&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dreger AD |title=The Controversy Surrounding The Man Who Would Be Queen: A Case History of the Politics of Science, Identity, and Sex in the Internet Age |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=366–421 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18431641 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0753m756162q4236/fulltext.pdf |pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''feminine essence theory'' by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Deconstructing the feminine essence narrative |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=434–8; discussion 505–10 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18431630|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9328-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''[[Harry Benjamin]] syndrome'', after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist [[David O. Cauldwell]], are favorably cited by proponents in support of this idea.&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=As the medical literature on transsexuals emerged, the doctors and scientists involved drew, as Ulrichs had, a distinction between the sex in the mind, as seen in the sense of self, and the sex in the body, as generally evidenced in the genitals.  Cauldwell referred to individuals who were "physically of one sex and apparently psychologically of the opposite sex."  Hamburger and his colleagues wrote of a "female personality in a male body" and the "feeling of being a woman."  Benjamin borrowed Ulrichs' formula of "a female soul'... in [a] male body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental [[cause of transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey and Triea, 2007.  "The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism." The transsexual advocacy website, transsexual.org, puts this theory succinctly: 'A transsexual is a person in which the sex-related structures of the brain that define gender identity are exactly opposite the physical sex organs of the body.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between "brain sex" and "anatomical sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |title=Harry Benjamin Syndrome (HBS) |accessdate=6 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202040714/http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proponents reject the term ''transsexual'', as the ''[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]'' prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like [[sex reassignment surgery]].  Some proponents consider themselves to be [[intersex]] instead of transgender.&lt;ref name=HBS&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=HBS /&gt;

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 1999

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

W. |author3=Clemmensen L. H. |author4=Dickey R. | year = 1989 | title = Prediction of regrets in postoperative transsexuals | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 43–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005b&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.

A '''flipped image''' or '''reversed image''', the more formal term, is a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original across a horizontal axis (a ''[[Flopped image|flopped]]'' image is mirrored across the vertical axis).&lt;ref&gt;Ron Brinkmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O_W0_8opPgoC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=flopped+image&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WoyNT7u2JaKk0QW3u73yDA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=flopped%20image&amp;f=false "The Art and Science of Digital Compositing: Techniques for Visual Effects"], Morgan Kaufmann Publishers (2008), pp. 132–3. {{ISBN|978-0-12-370638-6}} ...shows examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[printmaking]] techniques produce images where the printed copy is reversed from the image made on the printing plate, so in a print copying another image, or a real scene or object, unless the artist deliberately creates the plate as a mirror-image of his subject, the finished print will be a mirror image of it.  Many print makers developed the skill of reversing images when making printing plates, but many prints, especially early ones, have images that are reversed.

==Photography==
Many large format cameras present the image of the scene being photographed as a flipped image through their viewfinders. Some photographers regard this as a beneficial feature, as the unfamiliarity of the format allows them to compose the elements of the picture properly without being distracted by the actual contents of the scene. The technique is meant to bypass or override the brain's visual processing which normally sees what is expected rather than what is there.

Flipping is occasionally used as a [[trompe l'oeil]] effect in scenes which incorporate reflections in a body of water.  The image is deliberately inverted so that people slowly discern that something is 'not quite right' with the picture, and come to notice that it is upside down.

'''Haida''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|hai|X̱aat Kíl}}'', ''{{lang|hai|X̱aadas Kíl}}'', ''{{lang|hai|X̱aayda Kil}}'', ''{{lang|hai|Xaad kil}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Stephen+Hume+high+tech+fight+save+indigenous+languages/9628213/story.html |title=A high-tech fight to save B.C.'s indigenous languages |first=Stephen |last=Hume |work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the language of the [[Haida people]], spoken in the [[Haida Gwaii]] [[archipelago]] of the coast of [[Canada]] and on [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] in [[Alaska]]. An [[endangered language]] by a [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|book]] put out by [[UNESCO]], Haida currently has 14 native speakers, though revitalization efforts are underway. At the time of the European arrival at {{lang|hai|Haida Gwaii}} in 1774, it is estimated that Haida speakers numbered about 15,000. Epidemics soon led to a drastic reduction in the Haida population, which became limited to three villages: [[Masset, British Columbia|Masset]], [[Skidegate, British Columbia|Skidegate]], and [[Hydaburg, Alaska|Hydaburg]]. Positive attitudes towards assimilation combined with the ban on speaking Haida in residential schools led to a sharp decline in the use of the Haida language among the Haida people, and today almost all ethnic Haida use English to communicate.

Classification of the Haida language is a matter of controversy, with some linguists placing it in the [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dené]] language family and others arguing that it is a [[language isolate]]. Haida itself is split between Northern and Southern dialects, which differ primarily in phonology. The Northern Haida dialects have developed [[pharyngeal consonant]]s, typologically uncommon sounds which are also found in some of the nearby [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] and [[Wakashan languages]].

The Haida sound system includes [[ejective consonant]]s, [[glottalic consonant|glottalized]] [[sonorant]]s, contrastive [[vowel length]], and phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. The nature of tone differs between the dialects, and in Alaskan Haida it is primarily a [[pitch accent]] system. [[Syllabic consonant|Syllabic lateral]]s appear in all dialects of Haida, but are only phonemic in Skidegate Haida. Extra vowels which are not present in Haida words occur in nonsense words in Haida songs. There are a number of systems for writing Haida using the [[Latin alphabet]], each of which represents the sounds of Haida differently.

While Haida has nouns and verbs, it does not have adjectives and has few true [[adposition]]s. English adjectives translate into verbs in Haida, for example ''{{lang|hai|'láa}}'' "(to be) good", and English [[prepositional phrase]]s are usually expressed with Haida "relational nouns", for instance Alaskan Haida ''{{lang|hai|dítkw}}'' 'side facing away from the beach, towards the woods'. Haida verbs are marked for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and [[evidentiality]], and person is marked by pronouns that are [[clitic]]ized to the verb. Haida also has hundreds of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]]. Haida has the rare [[direct–inverse language|direct-inverse]] word order type, where both [[subject-object-verb|SOV]] and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]] words orders occur depending on the "potency" of the subject and object of the verb. Haida also has [[obligatory possession]], where certain types of nouns cannot stand alone and require a possessor.

==History==
The first documented contact between the Haida and Europeans was in 1772, on [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]]'s exploratory voyage.&lt;ref name="e1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Haidas inhabited the {{lang|hai|[[Haida Gwaii]]}}, [[Dall Island]], and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]].&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; The precontact Haida population was about 15,000; the first smallpox epidemic came soon after initial contact, reducing the population to about 10,000 and depopulating a large portion of the Ninstints dialect area.&lt;ref name="e2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next epidemic came in 1862, causing the population to drop to 1,658.&lt;ref name="e2" /&gt; Venereal disease and tuberculosis further reduced the population to 588 by 1915.&lt;ref name="e2" /&gt; This dramatic decline led to the merger of villages, the final result being three Haida villages: [[Masset, British Columbia|Masset]] (merged 1876), [[Skidegate, British Columbia|Skidegate]] (merged 1879), and [[Hydaburg, Alaska|Hydaburg]] (merged 1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Haida Jargon}}
In the 1830s a [[pidgin]] trade language based on Haida, known as '''Haida Jargon''', was used in the islands by speakers of English, Haida, [[Coast Tsimshian]], and [[Heiltsuk dialect|Heiltsuk]].&lt;ref name="Campbell1997"&gt;Lyle Campbell (1997) ''American Indian Languages'', p.  24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] of 1858 lead to a boom in the town of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and Southern Haida began traveling there annually, mainly for the purpose of selling their women.&lt;ref name="e3"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this the Haida used [[Chinook Jargon]].&lt;ref name="e4" /&gt; This contact with whites had a strong effect on the Southern Haida, even as the Northern Haida remained culturally conservative.&lt;ref name="e4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Skidegate Haida were reported as dressing in the European fashion in 1866, while Northern Haida "were still wearing bearskins and blankets ten years later."&lt;ref name="e4" /&gt;

In 1862, [[William Duncan (missionary)|William Duncan]], a British Anglican missionary stationed at [[Fort Simpson]], took fifty [[Tsimshian]] converts and created a new model community, [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]].&lt;ref name="e5"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new village was greatly successful, and throughout the Northwest coast the attitude spread that abandoning tradition would pave the way for a better life.&lt;ref name="e6"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haida themselves invited missionaries to their community, the first arriving in 1876.&lt;ref name="e6" /&gt; These missionaries initially worked in the Haida language.&lt;ref name="e6" /&gt; The Rev. [[John Henry Keen]] translated the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Haida, published in 1899 in London by the [[Missionary Society]].&lt;ref name="bo"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beolens |first=Bo |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=JHU Press |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC&amp;pg=PA220 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Keen later translated the gospels of Luke and John and the Acts from the New Testament into Haida. {{cite journal |last=Hatch |first=Melville H. |title=A Biographical Memoir of Rev. Keen|journal=The Coleopterists Bulletin |date=Autumn 1957 |volume=XI |pages=62–64 |jstor=3999009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books of Matthew, Luke, John and Acts from the New Testament would also be translated into Haida and published by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="e6" /&gt; However, negative attitudes towards the use of the Haida language were widespread among the Haida people, even in the fairly conservative village of Masset where Keen was located.&lt;ref name="e6" /&gt; In an 1894 letter, Keen wrote:

{{quote|text=These people would fain have their services etc. entirely in English. It has been by sheer determination that I now have the whole service (except hymns and canticles) in the vernacular.|sign=[[John Henry Keen]] |source=1894 letter, quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=6}}}}

Beginning at the turn of the century, Haida began sending their children to residential schools.&lt;ref name="e6" /&gt; This practice was most widespread among the Southern Haida; among the Northern Haida it was practiced by the more "progressive" families.&lt;ref name="e7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools strictly enforced a ban on the use of native languages, and played a major role in the decimation of native Northwest Coast languages.&lt;ref name="e7" /&gt; The practice of Haida families using English to address children spread in Masset in the 1930s, having already been practiced in Skidegate, the rationale being that this would aid the children in their school education.&lt;ref name="e7" /&gt; After this point few children were raised with Haida as a primary language.&lt;ref name="e7" /&gt;

==Status==
Today most Haidas do not speak the Haida language.  The language is listed as "critically endangered" in UNESCO's ''Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger'', with nearly all speakers elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |date=2010 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2 |edition=3rd |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/atlas-of-languages-in-danger/|accessdate=19 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hlorg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Haida Language Mainpage |last=Lachler |first=Jordan |url =http://haidalanguage.org/ |accessdate=23 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, most speakers of Haida are between 70 and 80 years of age, though they speak a "considerably simplified" form of Haida, and comprehension of the language is mostly limited to persons above the age of 50. The language is rarely used even among the remaining speakers and comprehenders.&lt;ref name="e17"/&gt;

The Haida have a renewed interest in their traditional culture, and are now funding Haida language programs in schools in the three Haida communities, though these have been ineffectual.&lt;ref name="e8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haida classes are available in many Haida communities and can be taken at the [[University of Alaska Southeast]] in [[Juneau]], [[Ketchikan]], and [[Hydaburg]].&lt;ref name="hlorg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ktoo201310"&gt;{{Cite episode |publisher=KTOO, [[Juneau, Alaska]] |credits=Lisa Phu (Director) |title=UAS and Yukon College partnership advances Native language efforts |accessdate=24 October 2013 |date=22 October 2013 |minutes=3:44 |url=http://www.ktoo.org/2013/10/22/uas-and-yukon-college-partnership-advances-native-language-efforts/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Skidegate Haida language app is available for [[iPhone]], based on a "bilingual dictionary and phrase collection {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} words and phrases archived at the online Aboriginal language database [[FirstVoices|FirstVoices.com]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=FirstVoices: Hlg̱aagilda X̱aayda Kil Welcome Page |accessdate=19 January 2013 |url=http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Hlgaagilda-Xaayda-Kil }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 [[Kingulliit Productions]] was working on the first feature film to be acted entirely in Haida language; the actors had to be trained to pronounce the lines correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/world/americas/reviving-a-lost-language-of-canada-through-film.html Reviving a Lost Language of Canada Through Film]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[Franz Boas]] first suggested that Haida might be genetically related to the [[Tlingit language]] in  1894, and linguist [[Edward Sapir]] included Haida in the [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dené]] language family in 1915.&lt;ref name="e2004" /&gt; This position was later supported by others, including Swanton, Pinnow, and Greenberg and Ruhlen.&lt;ref name="e2004"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2004|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, many linguists regard Haida as a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref name="Schoonmaker"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schoonmaker|1997|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not universally accepted; for example, Enrico (2004) argues that Haida does in fact belong to the Na-Dené family, though early loanwords make the evidence problematic.&lt;ref name="e2004" /&gt; [[Dene-Yeniseian languages|A proposal]] linking Na-Dené to the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] family of central Siberia finds no evidence for including Haida.&lt;ref name=symposium&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy2008.html Dene–Yeniseic Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Haida has a major dialectal division between Northern and Southern dialects.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; Northern Haida is split into Alaskan (or Kaigani) Haida and Masset (or North Graham Island) Haida.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; Southern Haida was originally split into Skidegate Haida and Ninstints Haida, but Ninstints Haida is now extinct and is poorly documented.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; The dialects differ in phonology and to some extent vocabulary; however, they are grammatically mostly identical.&lt;ref name="hlorg" /&gt;

Northern Haida is notable for its [[pharyngeal consonant]]s.&lt;ref name="m18"/&gt; Pharyngeal consonants are rare among the world's languages, even in North America.&lt;ref name="m17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mithun|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an [[areal feature]] of some languages in a small portion of Northwest America, in the [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] and [[Wakashan languages]] as well as Haida.&lt;ref name="m18" /&gt; The pharyngeal consonants of Wakashan and Northern Haida are known to have developed recently.&lt;ref name="m18" /&gt;

In Alaskan Haida, all velar, uvular, and epiglottal consonants, as well as {{IPA|/n l j/}} for some speakers, have rounded variants resulting from coalescence of clusters with {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name="L278"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Haida also shows simplification of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} to {{IPA|/n/}} when preceding an alveolar or postalveolar obstruent, and of {{IPA|/sd̥͡ɮ̊/}} to {{IPA|/sl/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Skidegate Haida, {{IPA|/x/}} has allophone {{IPA|[h]}} in syllable-final position.&lt;ref name="e10" /&gt;

Masset Haida phonology is complicated by various spreading processes caused by contiguous sonorants across morpheme boundaries, caused by loss of consonants in morpheme-initial position.&lt;ref name="e16"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Skidegate Haida some instances of the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} are on an underlying level unspecified for quality; Enrico (2003) marks specified {{IPA|/a/}} with the symbol {{angle bracket|@}}.&lt;ref name="e11" /&gt; Unspecified {{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPA|/u/}} after {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} after (non-lateral) alveolar and palatal consonants, and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} after lateral consonants.&lt;ref name="e11" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This may occur after FSS, for instance ''{{lang|hai|kwasaaw}}'' 'pig' + ''{{lang|hai|-aay}}'' 'DF' becomes ''{{lang|hai|kwasiwaay}}'', see {{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not exist in Masset Haida.&lt;ref name="e12" /&gt; A small class of Masset Haida words has a new vowel in place of this unspecified vowel which differs in quality from the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.&lt;ref name="e13" /&gt; &lt;!-- Enrico &amp; Stuart (1996) p. xii implies that this vowel is {{IPA|/e/}} and also occurs in this way in Kaigani --&gt;

{{IPA|/ə/}} is the short counterpart of {{IPA|/aː/}} and so can also be analyzed as {{IPA|/a/}}. Though quite variable in realization, it has an allophone {{IPA|[ʌ]}} when occurring after uvular and epiglottal consonants.&lt;ref name="L323"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequences {{IPA|/jaː/}} and {{IPA|/waː/}} tend towards {{IPA|[æː]}} and {{IPA|[ɒː]}} for some speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the contrasts between vowels, or sequences of vowels and the semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}, are neutralized in certain positions:
* The short vowels do not contrast after the alveolar and postalveolar fricatives and affricates. Only one short vowel occurs in this position, in Alaskan Haida usually realized as {{IPA|[e]}}, but {{IPA|[i]}} when further followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|[u]}} when followed by any rounded consonant.&lt;ref name="L323"/&gt;
* The contrasts of {{IPA|/i/}} with {{IPA|/jə/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} with {{IPA|/wə/}} are neutralized when preceded by a velar/uvular/epiglottal consonant, as well as word-initially before the glottal stop.&lt;ref name="L35"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No contrast exists between long high vowels and short high vowels followed by a semivowel. Thus, {{IPA|/iː/}} is equivalent to {{IPA|/ij/}}, and {{IPA|/uː/}} is equivalent to {{IPA|/uw/}};&lt;ref name="L35"/&gt; moreover, {{IPA|/wiː/}} is also equivalent to {{IPA|/uj/}}, and {{IPA|/juː/}} to {{IPA|/iw/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After consonants other than velar/uvular/epiglottal, {{IPA|/əj/}} and {{IPA|/əw/}} are also neutralized to {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}}.&lt;ref name="L35"/&gt;
* Long vowels are shortened before syllable-final glottal consonants, the high vowels {{IPA|/iː uː/}} also before sonorant (nasal or approximant) consonants. Where productive, this is a late process that applies after the preceding neutralizations, so that e.g. {{IPA|/qʰwaːʔáːj/}} "the rock" is realized as {{IPA|[qʰwʌʔáːj]}}, not {{IPA|[qʰuʔáːj]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vowels {{IPA|/ɯ ɜ æ/}} and short {{IPA|/o/}} occur in nonsense syllables in Haida songs.&lt;ref name="esxii" /&gt;

===Tone===
Haida features phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], the nature of which differs by dialect.

The Canadian dialects (Skidegate and Masset) have a tone system with low [[functional load]].&lt;ref name="e13"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarked [[heavy syllable]]s (those with long vowels or ending in sonorants) have high pitch, and unmarked light syllables have low pitch: ''{{lang|hai|gid}}'' {{IPA|[ɡ̊ìd̥]}} "dog", ''{{lang|hai|gin}}'' {{IPA|[ɡ̊ín]}} "sapwood".&lt;ref name="e13" /&gt; Examples of marked syllables include ''{{lang|hai|sùu}}'' "among" (Masset), ''{{lang|hai|k'á}}'' "tiny" (Skidegate).&lt;ref name="e14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Masset Haida marked low tone syllables are more common, resulting from elision of intervocalic consonants: compare Skidegate ''{{lang|hai|7axad}}'' to Masset ''{{lang|hai|7àad}}'' "net".&lt;ref name="e14" /&gt; Some alternations may be interpreted as results of syllable parsing rather than marked tone: compare Masset ''{{lang|hai|q'al.a}}'' {{IPA|[qʼálà]}} "muskreg" to ''{{lang|hai|q'ala}}'' 'be suspicious of' {{IPA|[qʼàlà]}}, where ''{{lang|hai|.}}'' marks a syllable boundary.&lt;ref name="e14" /&gt;

In Skidegate Haida, short vowels which do not have marked tone are phonetically lengthened when they are in a word-initial open syllable, thus ''{{lang|hai|q'an}}'' {{IPA|[qʼán]}} "grass" becomes ''{{lang|hai|q'anaa}}'' {{IPA|[qʼàːnáː]}} "grassy".&lt;ref name="e17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Masset Haida, marked low tone syllables have extra length, thus ''{{lang|hai|ginn}}'' "thing", ''{{lang|hai|7aww}}'' "mother".&lt;ref name="e15"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kaigani the system is primarily one of [[pitch accent]], with at most one syllable per word featuring high tone in most words, though there are some exceptions (e.g. ''{{lang|hai|gúusgáakw}}'' "almost"), and it is not always clear what should be considered an independent "word".&lt;ref name="esxii"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|Stuart|1996|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; High tone syllables are usually heavy (having a long vowel or ending in a sonorant).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonotactics===
The syllable template in Haida is (C(C(C))V(V)(C(C)).&lt;ref name="e13"/&gt; In Skidegate Haida the two unaspirated stops /p t/ can occur in the syllable coda, while none of the other unaspirated or aspirated stops can.&lt;ref name="e10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Masset Haida the unaspirated stops and affricates which may be in the syllable coda are {{IPA|/p t t͡s t͡ʃ k/}},&lt;ref name="e12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Alaskan Haida {{IPA|/p t t͡s t͡ɬ k kʷ ʡ͡ʜ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Would-be final {{IPA|/q/}} in loanwords may be nativized to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Skidegate Haida a long syllabic lateral may appear in VV position, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|tl'll}}'' "sew".&lt;ref name="e12" /&gt; Historically this developed from long ''{{lang|hai|ii}}'' after a lateral consonant, but a few Skidegate words retain ''{{lang|hai|ii}}'' in this position, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|qaahlii}}'' "inside", ''{{lang|hai|liis}}'' "mountain goat wool".&lt;ref name="e12" /&gt; Syllabic resonants occur frequently in Masset Haida and occasionally in Kaigani Haida, but they are not present on the phonemic level.&lt;ref name="esxi"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|Stuart|1996|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Several orthographies have been devised for writing Haida. The first alphabet was devised by the [[Alaska Native Language Center]] (ANLC) for Kaigani Haida in 1972, based on [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] orthographic conventions, and is still in use.&lt;ref name="esx"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|Stuart|1996|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguist John Enrico created another orthography for Skidegate and Masset Haida which introduced {{angle bracket|7}} and {{angle bracket|@}} as letters and did away with the distinction between upper and lower case, and this system is popular in Canada.&lt;ref name="wwh"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lachler |first=Jordan |url=http://www.haidalanguage.org/ways-of-writing.html |title=Ways of Writing Haida |accessdate=25 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lg"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=Chris |url=http://www.languagegeek.com/isolate/xaadas.html |title=Haida Language |year=2008 |accessdate=25 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bringhurst]], for his publications on Haida literature, created an orthography without punctuation or numerals, and few apostrophes; and in 2008 the [[Skidegate Haida Immersion Program]] (SHIP) created another, which is the usual orthography used in Skidegate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bringhurst |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=A Story as Sharp as a Knife: The Classical Haida Mythtellers and Their World |location=Appendix 1 |page=429 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |isbn=1553658396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems have been used by isolated linguists.&lt;ref name="lg"/&gt; Haida consonants are represented as follows.

In ANLC orthography {{angle bracket|ch}} is used for {{angle bracket|ts}} in syllable-initial position, and a hyphen is used to distinguish consonant clusters from [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (e.g. ''{{lang|hai|kwáan-gang}}'' contains the sequence /n/ followed by /g/ rather than the consonant /ŋ/).&lt;ref name="wwh"/&gt; Bringhurst uses a raised dot for the same, ''{{lang|hai|kwáan·gang}}''. The Enrico orthography uses {{angle bracket|l}} (or {{angle bracket|ll}} when long) for the syllabic lateral in Skidegate Haida, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|tl'l}}''.&lt;ref name="esxii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwh"/&gt; Enrico uses a period {{angle bracket|.}} for an "unlinked consonant slot."&lt;ref name="esxi"/&gt; {{angle bracket|r x}} are used for {{IPA|/ɢ̥ χ/}} in Enrico's Skidegate orthography since they generally correspond to {{IPA|/ʡ͡ʜ ʜ/}} in the other dialects.&lt;ref name="wwh"/&gt;

The following are how Haida vowels are written:

Enrico (2003) uses {{angle bracket|@}} for some instances of {{IPA|/a/}} based on morphophonemics. Alaskan Haida also has a diphthong written {{angle bracket|ei}}. Enrico &amp; Stuart (1996) use {{angle bracket|ï ë ä}} for the vowels {{IPA|/ɯ ɜ æ/}} that occur in nonsense syllables in songs.&lt;ref name="esxii" /&gt; The Alaskan Haida orthography was updated in 2010 by Jordan Lachler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sealaskaheritage.org/programs/Language%20Resources/Haida_dictionary_web.pdf |title=Dictionary of Alaskan Haida |last=Lachler |first=Jordan |date=22 June 2016 |website=Dictionary of Alaskan Haida |publisher=Sealaska Heritage Institute |access-date=22 June 2016 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
The word classes in Haida are nouns, verbs, postpositions, demonstratives, quantifiers, adverbs, clitics, exclamations, replies, classifiers, and instrumentals.&lt;ref name="e21" /&gt; Unlike in English, adjectives and some words for people are expressed with verbs, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|jáada}}'' "(to be a) woman", ''{{lang|hai|'láa}}'' "(to be) good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haida morphology is mostly suffixing.&lt;ref name="e19" /&gt; Prefixation is only used to form "complex verbs", made up of a nominal classifier or instrumental plus a bound root, for instance Skidegate ''{{lang|hai|sq'acid}}'' "pick up stick-object" and ''{{lang|hai|ts'icid}}'' "pick up several (small objects) together, with tongs", which share the root ''{{lang|hai|cid}}'' "pick up".&lt;ref name="e20"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infixation occurs with some stative verbs derived from classifiers, for instance the classifier ''{{lang|hai|7id}}'' plus the stative suffix ''{{lang|hai|-(aa)gaa}}'' becomes ''{{lang|hai|7yaadgaa}}''.&lt;ref name="e20" /&gt;

The definite article is suffixed ''{{lang|hai|-aay}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speakers shorten this suffix to ''{{lang|hai|-ay}}'' or ''{{lang|hai|-ei}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nouns, especially verbal nouns ending in long vowels and loan words, take ''{{lang|hai|-gaay}}'' instead, often accompanied by shortening or eliding preceding ''{{lang|hai|aa}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Alaskan Haida, the definite article takes high tone if added to a low-tone syllable, and also takes the high tone from stems ending in a sonorant, nasal, or {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/uː/}} "unless their vowel is lengthened", e.g. ''{{lang|hai|x̱akw}}'' "halibut" becomes ''{{lang|hai|x̱agwáay}}''. See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haida also has a [[partitive article]] ''{{lang|hai|-gyaa}}'', referring to "part of something or ... to one or more objects of a given group or category," e.g. ''{{lang|hai|tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang}}'' 'he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Alaskan Haida, ''{{lang|hai|-gyaa}}'' takes high tone if the noun does not have a high tone already. See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partitive nouns are never definite, so the two articles never co-occur.&lt;ref name="l65"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal pronouns occur in independent and clitic forms, which may each be in either agentive or objective form; first and second person pronouns also have separate singular and plural forms.&lt;ref name="e92"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third person pronoun is only used for animates, though for possession ''{{lang|hai|ahljíi}}'' (lit. "this one") may be used; after relational nouns and prepositions ''{{lang|hai|'wáa}}'' (lit. "it, that place, there") is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# short form used as bound possessive pronoun before dependent nouns and cliticized to intransitive verbs (that take an objective argument); long form used as bound possessive pronoun before relational nouns and prepositions, and cliticized to transitive verbs
# ''{{lang|hai|an}}'' is the object pronoun, while ''{{lang|hai|-ang}}'' is the bound possessive pronoun, suffixed to the noun or preposition it modifies
&lt;/small&gt;

Number is not marked in most nouns, but is marked in certain cases in verbs.&lt;ref name="eplur"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship nouns do have a plural in with ''{{lang|hai|-'lang}}'' (or for many speakers ''{{lang|hai|-lang}}''), e.g. ''{{lang|hai|díi chan'láng}}'' "my grandfathers".&lt;ref name="l68"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As seen in this example, the suffix takes high tone after a low-tone stem. Also note that the suffix ''{{lang|hai|-(a)ng}}'' 'one's own' disappears after this suffix. See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few verbs have [[suppletion|suppletive]] plural forms, as in many other North American languages.&lt;ref name="eplur" /&gt; In addition, Haida has a plural verb suffix ''{{lang|hai|-ru}}'' (Skidegate) ''{{lang|hai|-7wa}}'' (Masset) ''{{lang|hai|-'waa}}'' / ''{{lang|hai|-'uu}}'' (Kaigani) that is used to indicate that some third person pronoun in the sentence is plural, and to mark plural subject in imperatives.&lt;ref name="eplur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=124, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third person pronoun that is pluralized can have any grammatical function, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|tsiin-ee 'laangaa hl dah rujuu-7wa-gan}}'' "I bought all '''their''' fish" (Masset).&lt;ref name="eplur" /&gt;

Most nouns referring to family relationships have special [[vocative]] forms, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|chanáa}}'' (Alaskan) ''{{lang|hai|chaníi}}'' (Masset) "grandfather!"&lt;ref name="l67" /&gt;

Haida uses so-called "relational nouns" referring to temporal and spatial relations in place of most prepositions or prepositional phrases in English.&lt;ref name="l68"/&gt; Many of these are formed with the suffix ''{{lang|hai|-guu}}'', or in Alaskan Haida more often ''{{lang|hai|-kw}}''.&lt;ref name="l69"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated orthography for Alaska Haida has changed the ''{{lang|hai|-kw}}'' to ''{{lang|hai|-gw}}''. For example, Haida ''{{lang|hai|únkw}}'' / ''{{lang|hai|ínkw}}'' / ''{{lang|hai|ánkw}}'' "surface" likely comes from ''{{lang|hai|ún}}'' "back (noun)", and Alaskan Haida ''{{lang|hai|dítkw}}'' "side facing away from the beach, towards the woods" comes from the noun ''{{lang|hai|(a)díit}}'' "away from the beach, place in the woods".&lt;ref name="l69" /&gt; These contrast with "local nouns", which refer to localities and do not occur with possessive pronouns, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|(a)sáa}}'' "above, up".&lt;ref name="l71" /&gt; Some local nouns have an optional prefix ''{{lang|hai|a-}}'' which does not have semantic value.&lt;ref name="l71" /&gt; Both relational and local nouns may take the areal suffix ''{{lang|hai|-sii}}'' to refer to the entire area rather than a particular location, so for example ''{{lang|hai|'waa ungkw}}'' means "[at some place] on its surface" while ''{{lang|hai|'waa ungkwsii}}'' means "its surface area".&lt;ref name="l72"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haida has a small class of true [[postposition]]s, some &lt;!-- ? --&gt; of which may be suffixed to relational nouns.&lt;ref name="l70"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaskan postpositions ''{{lang|hai|-k}}'' "to" and ''{{lang|hai|-st}}'' "from" (Skidegate ''{{lang|hai|-ga}}'', ''{{lang|hai|-sda}}'') fuse to the preceding word.&lt;ref name="l70" /&gt; The Alaskan postposition of ''{{lang|hai|-k}}'' has been updated in the current Alaska Haida orthography to ''{{lang|hai|-g}}''. These also fuse with a preceding suffix ''{{lang|hai|-kw}}'' to become ''{{lang|hai|-gwiik}}'' and ''{{lang|hai|-guust}}''.&lt;ref name="l70" /&gt; The updated orthography for Alaska Haida has changed the ''{{lang|hai|-kw}}'' to ''{{lang|hai|-gw}}''. Some postpositions have forms beginning with ''{{lang|hai|ǥ-}}'' which are used in some common constructions without a preceding possessive pronoun, and translate into English as a pronoun plus "it", e.g. ''{{lang|hai|ǥáa hal gut'anánggang}}'' "he's thinking about it" (with ''{{lang|hai|ǥáa}}'' for ''{{lang|hai|aa}}'' "to, at").&lt;ref name="l71"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haida [[demonstrative]]s are formed from the bases ''{{lang|hai|áa}}'' (close to speaker), ''{{lang|hai|húu}}'' (close to listener), ''{{lang|hai|'wáa}}'' (away from both), and ''{{lang|hai|a(hl)}}'' (something previously mentioned), which when used independently are place demonstratives.&lt;ref name="ldem"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be given the following suffixes to create other demonstratives: ''{{lang|hai|jii}}'' (singular object), ''{{lang|hai|sgaay}}'' (plural objects), ''{{lang|hai|s(d)luu}}'' (quantity or time), ''{{lang|hai|tl'an}}'' (place), ''{{lang|hai|tl'daas}}'' (plural people), ''{{lang|hai|tsgwaa}}'' (area), and ''{{lang|hai|k'un}}'' (manner).&lt;ref name="ldem" /&gt;

Haida verbs have three basic forms: the ''present'', the ''past'', and the ''inferential'' forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past and inferential forms are both used to refer to events in the past, but differ in [[evidentiality]]: the inferential marks that the speaker was informed of or inferred the event rather than having experienced it personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bare present form refer to present-tense events, while future is formed with the suffix ''{{lang|hai|-saa}}'', using a present-form verb, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|hal káasaang}}'' "he will go".&lt;ref name="l125"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interrogative past form, made from the inferential form by removing final ''{{lang|hai|n}}'', is used in place of both past and inferential forms in sentences with question words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four &lt;!-- source says five but only lists 4 !!? --&gt; classes of verb stems:&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The stem of a verb, which is "the form which most people will give as the basic form of a verb if you ask them how to say 'to do so and so{{' "}}, may be determined by removing ''{{lang|hai|-saang}}'' from the future form of the verb, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|kíngsaang}}'' "will see" has stem ''{{lang|hai|kíng}}'' "to see". See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitual aspect uses the suffix ''{{lang|hai|-gang}}'' in the present and inferential and ''{{lang|hai|-(g)iinii}}'' in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=123, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential mood is marked with ''{{lang|hai|-hang}}'' and hortative with the particle ''{{lang|hai|ts'an}}'' (in the same position as the tense suffixes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=125,128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imperatives are marked with the particle ''{{lang|hai|hl}}'' after the first phrase in the sentence, or ''{{lang|hai|hlaa}}'' after the verb word (the verb dropping final weak ''{{lang|hai|aa}}'' if present) if there is no non-verbal phrase.&lt;ref name="l128"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This clitic ''{{lang|hai|hl}}'' becomes ''{{lang|hai|hahl}}'' if the previous word ends in a lateral consonant. See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs are negated with the negative suffix ''{{lang|hai|-'ang}}'', usually with the negative word ''{{lang|hai|gam}}'' "not" in sentence-head position.&lt;ref name="lneg"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs drop weak ''{{lang|hai|-aa}}'' before this suffix, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|gám hín hal ist-ánggang}}'' "he is not doing it that way".&lt;ref name="lneg" /&gt;

Haida uses instrumental prefixes, classificatory prefixes, and directional suffixes to derive verbs.&lt;ref name="l91"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some verb stems, known as ''bound stems'', must occur with at least one such affix; for example ''{{lang|hai|-daa}}'' "strike once" requires an instrumental prefix.&lt;ref name="l91" /&gt;

Haida has a large number of classifiers (on the order of 475).&lt;ref name="e21"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have a limited number of rhyme structures, which relate to each other ideophonically.&lt;ref name="e21" /&gt;

Numerals are generally treated as verbs in Haida, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|vdíi git'aláng sdáansaangaangang}}'' "I have eight children" (literally "my children are eight").&lt;ref name="lnum"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some types of objects, classificatory prefixes are used, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|sdlakw dlasáng}}'' "two land otters" (''{{lang|hai|dla-}}'' = small animal or fish).&lt;ref name="lnum" /&gt;

Nouns and verbs that end in a vowel undergo glide formation (if the final vowel is high) or truncation (otherwise) before vowel-initial prefixes.&lt;ref name="e17" /&gt; Some vowel-initial suffixes cause nouns and verbs which are consonant-final and polysyllabic to undergo Final Syllable Shortening (FSS).&lt;ref name="e17" /&gt;
: ''{{lang|hai|sk'u}}'' "high water" + ''{{lang|hai|-aay}}'' 'DF' → ''{{lang|hai|sk'waay}}'' (Masset)
: ''{{lang|hai|st'a}}'' "foot" + ''{{lang|hai|-aang}}'' "own" → ''{{lang|hai|st'aang}}'' (Skidegate)
: ''{{lang|hai|k'ugansaan}}'' "bladder" + ''{{lang|hai|-ang}}'' "own" → ''{{lang|hai|k'ugansanang}}'' (Masset)

In Masset Haida, final short vowels in polysyllabic verbs are lengthened in sentence-final position: compare Masset ''{{lang|hai|dii-ga-hl 7isdaa}}'' to Skidegate ''{{lang|hai|dii-gi-hla 7isda}}'' "Give it to me".&lt;ref name="e19"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntax===
Haida clauses are verb-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] word order is always possible, while [[Object-subject-verb|OSV]] may also be used when the subject is more 'potent' than the object; thus Haida is a [[direct–inverse language]].&lt;ref name="epot"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a human is more potent than a horse, which is more potent than a wagon.&lt;ref name="epot" /&gt; Thus the Masset Haida sentence ''{{lang|hai|yaank'ii.an-.uu Bill x-aay gu'laa-gang}}'' can only mean "truly Bill likes the dog", while ''{{lang|hai|yaank'ii.an.uu xaay Bill gu'laa-gang}}'' can mean either "truly the dog likes Bill" or "truly Bill likes the dog".&lt;ref name="epot" /&gt; The determinants of potency are complex and include "acquaintance, social rank, humanness, animacy.. number ... [and] gender was also important at least in the two southern dialects."&lt;ref name="e76"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following groups are listed in descending order of potency: "known single adult free humans; non-adult and/or enslaved and/or unknown and/or grouped humans; non-human higher animals; inanimates and lower organisms (fish and lower)."&lt;ref name="e76" /&gt; Grammatical definiteness does not affect potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronouns are placed adjacent to the verb and [[clitic]]ized to it.&lt;ref name="e46"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their internal order is object–subject, or in causatives object-causee-subject, for example ''{{lang|hai|Bill dii dalang squdang-hal-gan}}'' &lt;small&gt;Bill me you punch-direct.that-PA&lt;/small&gt; "You told Bill to punch me / Bill told you to punch me".&lt;ref name="e46" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;When both pronouns are object pronouns, the pronoun translating to a subject in English comes last. See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potency is also relevant for pronoun ordering when one pronoun is less potent, for example the indefinite pronoun ''{{lang|hai|ga}}'' in ''{{lang|hai|'laa ga 7isda-gan}}'' = ''{{lang|hai|ga 'la 7isda-gan}}'' 'she took some.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences with ''{{lang|hai|nang}}'' "someone" or ''{{lang|hai|tl'}}'' "some people" as the subject may be translated as passive sentences in English, for example ''{{lang|hai|láa tl' ḵínggan}}'' "he was seen (by more than one person)", literally "some people saw him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clitic pronouns are used as complements of verbs, as inalienable possessives, with quantifiers, and in Skidegate Haida as the objects of some postpositions.&lt;ref name="e92" /&gt; Independent pronouns are used everywhere else.&lt;ref name="e92" /&gt; Agentive pronouns are marked and are only used as subjects of some verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs taking agentive subjects are most common in the lexicon (about 69%), followed by those taking objective subjects (29%) and those that may take either (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intransitive verbs of inherent states (e.g. "be old") take an objective subject, while most transitive verbs take agentive subjects (but cf. verbs like ''{{lang|hai|gu'laa}}'' "like").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some verbs that may take either, there may be a semantic difference involved, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|gwaawa}}'' (Masset) which means "refuse" with agentive subject but ''not want'' with objective subject.&lt;ref name="e96"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrico (2003) argues that the agentive case indicates planning; thus Haida is essentially an [[active–stative language]], though subject case is also variable in some transitive verbs.&lt;ref name="e96" /&gt;

Enclitics are placed after the first phrase in the sentence, usually a noun phrase (except with the imperative clitic ''{{lang|hai|hl(aa)}}'' which follows a verb phrase).&lt;ref name="l145"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent pronouns are used instead of clitic pronouns when modified by a clitic, so for example ''{{lang|hai|hal ngíishlgan}}'' "he got well" becomes ''{{lang|hai|l'áa háns ngíishlgan}}'' "he also got well" when the clitic ''{{lang|hai|háns}}'' 'also, too' is added.&lt;ref name="l145" /&gt; The enclitics ''{{lang|hai|-uu}}'' and ''{{lang|hai|-kw}}'' follow other enclitics.&lt;ref name="l146"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammatical focus|Focus]] and less commonly [[grammatical topic|topic]] are marked with the clitic ''{{lang|hai|-.uu~-huu}}'', placed after a sentence-initial constituent, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|Bill-.uu Mary qing-gan}}'' (Skidegate) "'''Bill''' saw Mary" / "Mary saw '''Bill'''", ''{{lang|hai|7ahl7aaniis-.uu "qaagaa" hin.uu 'la kya.a-gaa-n}}'' "That one, he was called 'qaagaa{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|pp=193, 251–252, 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Masset this is elided after words with final ''{{lang|hai|uu}}'', see {{Harvcoltxt|Enrico|2003|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Question words always take this enclitic, for example ''{{lang|hai|guusuu}}'' "what?", ''{{lang|hai|tláanuu}}'' "where?", ''{{lang|hai|gíisanduu}}'' "when?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways that Haida marks possession. Haida has [[obligatory possession]], a common feature of native North American languages where certain nouns (in Haida, family relationship, body part, and "relational" nouns) must occur with a possessor and cannot stand alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=66, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can say ''{{lang|hai|díi aw}}'' "my mother" but not *''{{lang|hai|aw}}'', though one may use a circumlocution like ''{{lang|hai|nang awáa}}'' 'one who is a mother'.&lt;ref name="l66"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nouns are possessed using the bound objective pronouns, which all precede the noun except ''{{lang|hai|-(a)ng}}'' 'one's own'.&lt;ref name="l67"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The suffix ''{{lang|hai|-(a)ng}}'' behaves like ''{{lang|hai|-aay}}'' tonally, thus for instance ''{{lang|hai|awáng}}'' '[someone's] own mother' has high tone on the suffix.&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the class of obligatorily possessed nouns are so-called "relational nouns" and postpositions, which generally translate to prepositions or prepositional phrases in English and refer to temporal and spatial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=68, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relational nouns take some special third person possessive pronouns (''{{lang|hai|'láa, 'wáa, tl'áa}}'' rather than ''{{lang|hai|hal, ahljíi, tl'}}''), e.g. ''{{lang|hai|'wáa ḵáahlii}}'' "in(side) it" (lit. "its interior").&lt;ref name="l69"/&gt; Non-obligatory possession nouns are possessed by putting them in definite form after the possessor (a noun or a bound objective pronoun) in partitive form, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|ítl'gyaa yaats'áay}}'' "our knife".&lt;ref name="lpos"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;An exception to this construction is that ''{{lang|hai|gyáagan}}'' is used for "my" instead of the expected *''{{lang|hai|díigyaan}}'', e.g. ''{{lang|hai|gyáagan x̱áay}}'' "my dog". See {{Harvcoltxt|Lawrence|1977|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate construction when the possessor is a pronoun is to place an independent objective pronoun after the possessed noun, the latter in definite form, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|náay díinaa}}'' "my house".&lt;ref name="lpos" /&gt; The independent objective pronouns also occur by themselves with possessive force, e.g. ''{{lang|hai|díinaa}}'' "mine".&lt;ref name="l72" /&gt;

A '''hexalogy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἑξα- ''[[wikt:hexa-|hexa-]]'', "six" and -λογία ''-logia'', "discourse") is a compound literary or narrative work that is made up of six distinct works. The word apparently first appeared in English as a borrowing from German, in discussions of [[August Bungert]]'s Wagnerian opera cycle entitled ''Homerische Welt'' based on the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]].&lt;ref name="apthorp"&gt;William Foster Apthorp.

[[File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the [[Institut Lumière]], France]]
The '''history of film technology''' traces the development of film technology from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the end of 19th century to the present time. [[Motion pictures]] were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of [[communication]] and [[entertainment]] in the 20th century. Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption of [[synchronized motion picture sound]], [[color motion picture film]], and the adoption of [[digital film]] technologies to replace physical [[film stock]] at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors.

==Development of film technology==

===Precursors===
{{Main|Precursors of film}}
The [[technology]] of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of [[projector|projection]], [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, [[photography]] and [[optics]].
Early techniques that involve motion and/or projection include:
*[[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|Shadowgraphy]] (probably in practice since prehistoric times)
*[[Camera obscura]] (a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times)
*[[Shadow play|Shadow puppetry]] (possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China)
*[[Magic lantern]] (developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s)
*stroboscopic "[[persistence of vision]]" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868) 
*[[Chronophotography]] (recorded with posed phases since the 1860s, recorded in real-time since 1878)
                 
Live projection of moving images occur in the [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that may have been used artistically since prehistory. The use of a lens in a camera obscura has been dated back to 1550.&lt;ref name=Ilardi&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;ots=0nY6rITCY6&amp;dq=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile camera obscura devices were used since the early 17th century, first in tents and not much later in wooden boxes. The box-type camera would be adapted into a photographic camera in the 1820s and 1830s.

In or before 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. It projected slides that were usually painted in color on glass. A 1659 sketch by Huygens indicates that moving images may have been part of the earliest screenings. Around 1790 multi-media [[phantasmagoria]] spectacles were developed. Rear projection, animated slides, multiple projectors (superimposition), mobile projectors (on tracks or handheld), projection on smoke, sounds, odors and even electric shocks were used to frighten audiences with a convincing ghost horror experience. In the 19th century several other popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, et cetera) or that showed for instance falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving.

The basic stroboscopic principle that allowed the creation of motion pictures was discovered by [[Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau|Joseph Plateau]] in Belgium around December 1832 and published in January 1833. His invention - later known as the [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]] or fantascope - was a cardboard disc with slits through which the viewer could watch a rapid succession of sequential drawings (photography wasn't introduced yet) reflected in a mirror. If a phénakisticope disc spins fast enough it invisibly replaces each picture by the next one and the viewer sees figures in fluent motion. A very similar "Stroboscope Disc" was independently invented in Austria by [[Simon von Stampfer]] around the same time (probably some weeks later). Stampfer also mentioned several possible variations of his [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] invention, including a cylinder (similar to the later '''[[zoetrope]]''') as well as a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film) and a theater-like frame (much like the later [[praxinoscope]] theatre).

In 1845, [[Francis Ronalds]] created an alternative technology – the [[Francis Ronalds#Continuously recording camera|first successful camera]] able to make [[Photography#Science and forensics|continuous recordings]] of the varying indications of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=The Beginnings of Continuous Scientific Recording using Photography: Sir Francis Ronalds’ Contribution|url=http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/|journal=European Society for the History of Photography|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Horse in Motion-anim.gif|thumb|Modern animation from plates of ''The Horse in Motion'' by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] (1878).]]
The first motion sequence photographed in real-time, rather than consisting of a series of posed photographs, was created in the US in 1878 by British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Under the sponsorship of [[Leland Stanford]], he photographed a horse named [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Sallie Gardner]] in rapid motion by using a series of separate still cameras. The experiment took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in [[Palo Alto, California]], with the press present, and was meant to determine whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The cameras were arranged in a line parallel to the edge of the track and spaced 27 inches apart. Each camera shutter was triggered by a thread as the horse passed and each exposure was made in only one thousandth of a second.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clegg|first=Brian|title=The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the pictures were published as cards and plates. From 1879 to 1893 Muybridge also had silhouettes of his pictures painted onto glass discs to project the images onto a screen with a device he called a [[zoopraxiscope]], which can be regarded as the first [[movie projector]]. His innovative process was an intermediate stage toward motion pictures and cinematography.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Soon after the pictures were published, or at least since January 1879, there were several people who placed these in [[zoetrope]]s to watch them in motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muybZOETROPES.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These were most likely the very first viewings of photographic motion pictures that were recorded in real-time.

[[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invented a chronophotographic gun in 1882, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames on the same picture. He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animals and human locomotion. 

An early projector, along similar lines to Muybridge's zoopraxiscope, was built by [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in 1887. His [[Electrotachyscope]] used 24 images on a rotating glass disk.&lt;ref&gt;''Faszination der Bewegung: Ottomar Anschütz zwischen Photographie und Kino'' p. 185, Deac Rossell. {{ISBN|3-87877-774-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 his invention projected moving images&lt;ref&gt;''Industry, liberty, and a vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's kinesigraph'', Stephen Herbert, p. 13, {{ISBN|0-9523941-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin.

===First motion pictures===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Le-prince-type-1-cine-camera-projector-mk2-1888-interior.png|thumb|200x200px|[[Louis Le Prince]]'s [[#LePrince Cine Camera-Projector types|single-lens Cine Camera-Projector MkII]], the first motion-picture camera, built in 1887-1888.]] --&gt;
As a result of the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and Étienne-Jules Marey, inventors in the late 19th century began to realize that the making and showing of photographic 'moving pictures' of a more useful or even indefinite length was a practical possibility.

The first motion picture camera&lt;!-- a multi-lensed one was patented in 1864, although probably never built --&gt; was invented by the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Louis Le Prince]] in the 1880s, while working in [[Leeds]], [[England]]. Le Prince had been inspired by Muybridge's pioneering experiments, and he patented his first invention, a 16-lensed camera, in 1887.&lt;ref name="Naughton"&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/LE_PRINCE_BIO.html Adventures in CyberSound: Le Prince, Louis Aimé Augustin], Dr Russell Naughton (using source: Michael Harvey, NMPFT Pioneers of Early Cinema: 1. Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince)&lt;/ref&gt; The first eight lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film&lt;!-- a shutter on the film??? ---&gt;; the film would then be moved forward, allowing the other eight lenses to operate on the film.&lt;!-- this appears to be incorrect, will need to refresh my memory --&gt; Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it was not a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint, with the result that foreground elements in the [[Movie projector|projected]] scene wove about relative to each other and to the background.

In May 1887,&lt;ref name="Naughton"/&gt; after much trial and error, Le Prince was finally able to develop and patent the first single-lensed motion picture camera in 1888.&lt;!-- conflicting dates in foregoing sentence need resolution --&gt; He used it to shoot the world's earliest known motion picture on film: ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', a short test photographed on October 14, 1888 in [[Roundhay]], [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rNu06-I6IsC|title=On the Origin of Spin: (Or how Hollywood, the Ad Men and the World Wide Web became the Fifth Estate and created our images of power)|author=Brendan Bruce|year=2013|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Prince later used his camera to shoot [[tram]]s and the horse-drawn and pedestrian traffic on [[Leeds Bridge]] (the movie was shot from Hicks the Ironmongers, now the British Waterways building, on the southeast side of the bridge;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991128020048/http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/local_heroes/biogs/biogleprince.shtml BBC Education – Local Heroes Le Prince Biography], BBC, archived on 1999-11-28&lt;/ref&gt; a [[blue plaque]] now marks the spot). He initially shot his motion pictures on [[gelatin]] or [[photographic plate|glass plates]]&lt;!-- did he not also use paper? --&gt; but later switched to the more suitable [[celluloid]], using film 1.75 inches wide.

[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' 1888, the first known motion-picture film.|thumb|left]]
In Leeds in 1889, Le Prince presented the first purely photographic motion picture projection,&lt;!-- bearing in mind Muybridge's 1879 zoopraxiscope projections, which used painted silhouette copies of his photographs, and his display of the actual photographs by using a zoetrope --&gt; using equipment he designed. His single-lensed projector used an electric [[arc lamp]] to project the images onto a white screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qn6_5XqRXVsC|title=A Technological History of Motion Pictures and Television|editor=Raymond Fielding|author=E. Kilburn Scott|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|pages=76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded by many film historians as the father of motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Turning Points In Film History |last=Rausch |first=Andrew |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Citadel Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8065-2592-1 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBYfGYo-8TgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=%22Le+Prince%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of film stock ===
Another early pioneer, working at roughly the same time as Le Prince, was [[William Friese-Greene]]. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of [[celluloid]]. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British ''Photographic News'' on  February 28, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Marta, (1992) ''Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904)'', p. 190, Chicago: University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-07173-1}}''';''' Robinson, David, (1997)   ''From Peepshow to Palace: The Birth of American Film'', p. 28, New York and Chichester, West Sussex, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-10338-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low [[frame rate]] combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression.
  
English anarchist and inventor [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], filed for an early patent in 1876 for a film camera, which he named a "kinesigraph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burns, R. W.|year=1998|title=Television: An International History of the Formative Years|publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]|location=London|isbn=0-85296-914-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time, the necessary materials were not yet available to produce a working motion picture camera, but in 1889, his interest in the possibility was revived when he heard about the successful experiments of [[Louis Le Prince]], who was then working in Donsithorpe's home town of [[Leeds]]. In 1889 he took out a patent, jointly with [[William Carr Crofts]], for a camera using celluloid roll film and a projector system; they then made a short film of the bustling traffic in [[London]]'s [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/donisthorpe|title=Wordsworth Donisthorpe: British inventor and political activist|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Paul T |last=Burns |title=The History of The Discovery of Cinematography - 1885 - 1889 |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1885.htm |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} and {{Cite web |title=Ten Remaining Frames Of  Donisthorpe's 1890 'Trafalgar Square' Footage Come To Life |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/images/trafalgarsquare_animation_small.gif |format=GIF |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert, S.|year=1998|title=Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph|publisher=[[The Projection Box]]|location=London|isbn=0-9523941-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dickson greeting.jpg|thumb|Film still from ''[[Dickson Greeting]]''. In May 1891, it became the first American film shown to a public audience.]]
Another, more successful apparatus was invented by the Scottish inventor and employee of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], [[W. K. L. Dickson]]. His camera, called the [[Kinetograph]], was patented in 1891 and took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated on to a transparent [[Celluloid|celluloid strip]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm wide. The celluloid blocks were thinly sliced, then removed with heated pressure plates. After this, they were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], [[Thomas Edison]] revealed the '[[Kinetoscope]]' to the public. The machine was contained within a large box, and only permitted the images to be viewed by one person at a time looking into it through a peephole, after starting the machine by inserting a coin. The parlours were supplied with film snippets photographed by Dickson, in Edison's [[Edison's Black Maria|"Black Maria"]] studio. These sequences recorded both mundane incidents, such as ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'', and entertainment acts, such as acrobats, [[music hall]] performers and boxing demonstrations. The [[Kinetoscope]] [[Peep show|peep-show]] parlor first opened on April 14, 1894, and was the first commercial exhibition of film. Kinetoscope parlors soon spread successfully to Europe. Edison, however, never attempted to patent these instruments on the other side of the Atlantic, since they relied so greatly on [[Precursors of film|previous experiments and innovations]] from Britain and Europe.

The Pleograph, invented by Polish emigre [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] in 1894&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Ilowiecki, "Dzieje nauki polskiej", Wydawnictwo Interpress, Warszawa 1981, {{ISBN|8322318766}}, p.202 (Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; was another early camera. It also doubled up as a projector. The apparatus used a rectangle of celluloid with perforations between several parallel rows of images. Using an improved pleograph, Prószynski shot short films showing scenes of life in [[Warsaw]], such as people skating in the park. [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] also exhibited his projector, the [[Phantoscope]] before an audience in June 1894.

==Development of the film industry==

===Commercial cinema===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-035-15, Berlin, Wintergarten.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]] was the site of the first [[Movie theater|cinema]] ever, with a short movie presented by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in November 1895]]

The [[Eidoloscope]], devised by [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] for the [[Woodville Latham|Latham]] family, was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from [[Madison Square Garden]]'s roof on May 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Streible|first1=Dan|title=Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520940581|pages=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpc1fk5T5dYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first commercial projection.

In [[Lyon]], [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Louis and Auguste Lumière]] perfected the [[Cinématographe]], an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film. In late 1895 in Paris, father Antoine Lumière began exhibitions of projected films before the paying public, beginning the general conversion of the medium to projection. They quickly became Europe's main producers with their ''[[actuality film|actualités]]'' like ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory]]'' and comic vignettes like ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé|The Sprinkler Sprinkled]]'' (both 1895). Even Edison, initially dismissive of projection, joined the trend with the [[Vitascope]], a modified Jenkins' Phantoscope, within less than six months.

A slightly earlier public motion-picture film presentation was made by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] in Berlin, who projected with their apparatus "Bioscop", a flickerfree duplex construction, November 1 through 31, 1895. However, the equipment was cumbersome and its use was eventually discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1895.htm|title=The History of the Discovery of Cinematography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, [[Robert W. Paul]] and [[Birt Acres]] both independently developed their own systems for projecting a moving image on to a screen. Acres presented his in January 1896, and Paul unveiled his more influential [[Theatrograph]] shortly after on 20 February, on exactly the same day the [[Lumiere Brothers|Lumieres']] films would first be projected in London.&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{cite book|last=Mast|first=Gerald|author2=Kawin, Bruce F.|editor = Costanzo, William|title=A Short History of the Movies|edition=Abridged 9th|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education, inc.|url=http://www.ablongman.com/mast9e|chapter=Birth|pages=23–24|ref=Silent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatrograph pioneered the ‘[[Maltese Cross mechanism|Maltese cross]]’ system that drove sprocket rollers to provide intermittent motion. After some demonstrations before scientific groups, he was asked to supply a projector and staff to the [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra Music Hall]] in [[Leicester Square]], and he presented his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. His device was the prototype for the modern film projector and was sold across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/Collection/Cinematography/ViewingProjection/CollectionItem.aspx?id=1913-549|title=Theatrograph Projector No 2 Mark 1|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1896, it had dawned on the Edison company that more money could be made by showing motion picture films with a projector to a large audience than exhibiting them in peep-show machines. The Edison company took up a projector developed by Armat and Jenkins, the "Phantoscope", which was renamed the Vitascope, and it joined various projecting machines made by other people to show the 480&amp;nbsp;mm width films being made by the Edison company and others in France and the UK.

Initially, a lack of standardization meant that film producers used a variety of different film widths and projection speeds, but after a few years the 35-mm wide Edison film, and the 16-frames-per-second projection speed of the Lumière Cinématographe became the standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Birt Acres]] designed the first [[Home movies|camera for amateur use]] in 1898. He called it the 'Birtac Home Cinema', and it used a 17.5mm gauge. Its purpose, in his words, was 'to place animated photography in the reach of everyone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M17R4C6sp5QC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Cine Cameras|author=Wade, John|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film industry===
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|The [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world (founded 1912) and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]
By the late 1890s, the first motion picture companies were established in the US, France, Britain and elsewhere.

The most successful motion picture company in the United States, with the largest production until 1900, was the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|American Mutoscope]] company. This was initially set up to exploit peep-show type films using designs made by [[William Kennedy Dickson|W.K.L. Dickson]] after he left the Edison company in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony|last=Slide|title=The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry|location=[[Lanham, Maryland]]|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=1998|isbn=0-8108-3426-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His equipment used 70&amp;nbsp;mm wide film, and each frame was printed separately onto paper sheets for insertion into their viewing machine, called the [[Mutoscope]]. The image sheets stood out from the periphery of a rotating drum, and flipped into view in succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soc.org/opcam/06_sp95/mg06_biocam.html |title=The Biograph Camera |journal=The Operating Cameraman |publisher=Society of Camera Operators |issue=Spring 1995 |author=Billy Bitzer |accessdate=2004-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101083922/http://www.soc.org/opcam/06_sp95/mg06_biocam.html |archivedate=2004-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Musser|title=The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|location=[[Berkeley, California]]|publisher=[[University of California]] Press|year=1994|pages=303–313|isbn=0-520-08533-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides American Mutoscope, there were also numerous smaller producers in the United States, and some of them established a long-term presence in the new century. [[Vitagraph Studios|American Vitagraph]], one of these minor producers, built studios in Brooklyn, and expanded its operations in 1905.

[[File:Adrien Barrère13.jpg|thumb|225px|&lt;center&gt;The [[Pathé|Pathé Brothers]], by [[Adrien Barrère]].]]
In France, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière]] company sent cameramen all round the world from 1896 onwards to shoot films, which were exhibited locally by the cameramen, and then sent back to the company factory in Lyon to make prints for sale to whomever wanted them. There were nearly a thousand of these films made up to 1901, nearly all of them actualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Motion Pictures|author=Gina De Angelis|publisher=The Oliver Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-881508-78-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898, [[Georges Méliès]] was the largest producer of fiction films in France, and from this point onwards his output was almost entirely films featuring trick effects, which were very successful in all markets. The special popularity of his longer films, which were several minutes long from 1899 onwards (while most other films were still only a minute long), led other makers to start producing longer films.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Norman. ''Georges Melies : first wizard of cinema''. Flicker Alley. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Charles Pathé]] began film production under the Pathé-Frères brand, with [[Ferdinand Zecca]] hired to actually make the films. By 1905, Pathé was the largest film company in the world, a position it retained until World War I. [[Léon Gaumont]] began film production in 1896, with his production supervised by [[Alice Guy-Blaché|Alice Guy]].&lt;ref&gt;Willems, Gilles "Les origines de Pathé-Natan" In ''Une Histoire Économique du Cinéma Français (1895–1995), Regards Croisés Franco-Américains'', Pierre-Jean Benghozi and Christian Delage, eds.

[[Charles Urban]] became managing director of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1897, where he specialised in actuality film, including newsfilm of the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]]. In July 1903 he formed his own company, the [[Charles Urban Trading Company]], moving to [[London]]'s [[Wardour Street]] in 1908, the first film business to be located in what became the home of the [[British film industry]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/78112161@N00/7223737470/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] was founded by [[Sagar Mitchell]] and [[James Kenyon (cinematographer)|James Kenyon]] in 1897, soon becoming one of the largest film producers in the [[United Kingdom]]. Other early pioneers include [[James Williamson, film pioneer|James Williamson]], [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|G.A. Smith]] and [[Cecil Hepworth]], who in 1899, began turning out 100 films a year, with his company becoming the largest on the British scene.

The [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] in Germany was the first large-scale film studio in the world, founded 1912, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]] with its several establishments of large studios in the early 20th century.

===First cinemas===
{{Main|Movie theater}}
Initially, commercial screenings of motion-pictures for the public were put on in existing [[theatre]]s and [[music hall]]s as a novelty, but the main methods of exhibition quickly became either as an item on the programmes of variety theatres, or by traveling showmen in tent theatres, which they took around the fairs in country towns. It became the practice for the producing companies to sell prints outright to the exhibitors, at so much per foot, regardless of the subject. Typical prices initially were 15 cents a foot in the United States, and one shilling a foot in Britain. [[Hand-colouring|Hand-coloured]] films, which were being produced of the most popular subjects before 1900, cost 2 to 3 times as much per foot. There were a few producers, such as the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, who did not sell their films, but exploited them solely with their own exhibition units.

The first public motion-picture film presentation in the world was done by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]], who projected with their apparatus "Bioscop", a flickerfree duplex construction, from November 1 through 31, 1895.

[[Image:Auditorium Theatre in Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] in 1910 showing "The Heroine of Mafeking".]]
The first theatres dedicated to motion-pictures were established at the turn of the century, soon becoming known as [[Movie theater|cinemas]]. The [[Vitascope Hall]] in [[New Orleans]] was opened in 1896 as one of the first such establishments. It showed two exhibitions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Another early establishment was the [[Islington|Islington Palace]], originally built in 1869 as part of the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]] complex. The concert hall was converted into a full-time cinema in 1901, a year after it showed its first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Penguin Pocket On This Day|publisher=Penguin Reference Library|isbn=0-14-102715-0|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMYo4Abel2EC|title=Cinemas of the World: Film and Society from 1895 to the Present|author=James Chapman|year=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|page=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]]&lt;!-- capitalized as a proper name here because referring to the original one --&gt; was the first successful permanent theatre showing only films, and opened in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1905. By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these "nickelodeons" in operation worldwide.

==Color films==
{{Main|Color motion picture film}}

===Additive process===
[[File:Lee and Turner Colour Projector, 1902. (7996004472).jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[Edward Raymond Turner]]'s three-color projector, 1902&lt;!-- the date of construction, not of the patent --&gt;]]
The first person to demonstrate a natural-color motion picture system was British inventor [[Edward Raymond Turner]], who applied for his [[patent]] in 1899, received it in 1900, and was able to show promising but very mechanically defective results in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/edward-raymond-turner-discovery-re-writes-history-of-early-film/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Patent (B.P.) no. 6,202 (1899), 22 March 1899, 'Means for taking and exhibiting cinematographic pictures'. http://www.brianpritchard.com/GB189906202A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/~/media/Files/NMeM/PDF/PlanAVisit/LeeTurnerTimeline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner's camera used a rotating disk of three color [[filter (optics)|filters]] to photograph color separations on one roll of [[black-and-white]] film. A red, green or blue-filtered image was recorded on each successive [[film frame|frame]] of film. The finished film print was projected, three frames at a time, through the corresponding color filters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianpritchard.com/Lee_Turner_Project.htm Pritchard, B. (2012). "Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum".] Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert1979"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Allen Nowotny|title=The Way of All Flesh Tones | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NrYaytLfSJYC&amp;pg=PR3 | accessdate=2012-09-13 | year = 1979 | publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |isbn=978-0-8240-5109-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}

When Turner died in 1903, his financial backer at that time, pioneering film producer [[Charles Urban]], passed on the development of the process to [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], who by 1906 had developed a simplified version that he later named [[Kinemacolor]]. The Kinemacolor camera had red and green filters in the apertures of its rotating shutter, so that alternating red-filtered and green-filtered views of the subject were recorded on consecutive frames of the [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The Kinemacolor projector did the same thing in reverse, projecting the frames of the black-and-white print alternately through the red and green filters in its rotating shutter.

Both devices were operated at twice the usual frame rate to reduce the color flicker (technically known as "color bombardment") produced by non-simultaneous projection of the two color components, a defect which some viewers barely noticed but which others found obtrusive and headache-inducing. A related defect was the most obvious shortcoming of this process: because the two components had not been photographed at the same time, as pairs of frames, rapidly moving subjects did not adequately match up from one frame to the next when projected on the screen, resulting in color "fringes" or in extreme cases vividly colored "ghosts". A white dog wagging its tail in front of a dark background could appear to have several tails, variously red, green and white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/kinemacolor-book1.htm Widescreen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:kinemacolor1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kinemacolor]], 1911 (appearance of projected image simulated by a color composite of two consecutive frames)]]
The first motion picture exhibited in Kinemacolor was an eight-minute short titled ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'', which was trade-shown in September 1908. The general public first saw Kinemacolor in a program of 21 short films shown on 26 February 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London.  The process was first seen in the US on 11 December 1909, at an exhibition staged by Smith and Urban at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioscopic.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/colourful-stories-no-11-kinemacolor-in-america&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinemacolor released the first drama filmed in the process, ''Checkmated'', in 1910, and the first feature-length [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=2360560|title=Salvage Operations of S.S. Oceana|description=Produced by the Natural Colour Kinematograph Co., Brighton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kinemacolor projectors were installed in some 300 cinemas in Britain, and 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were made in Kinemacolor in the US in 1912–1913,&lt;ref&gt;''La Tosca'' (1912), ''Mission Bells'' (1913), ''The Rivals'' (1913), and ''The Scarlet Letter'' (1913).&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Japan in 1914. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors.

A variant method was promoted by [[William Friese-Greene]]. He called his additive color system "Biocolour". It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if it would bear being cranked at a sufficient rate. Like Kinemacolor, Biocolour suffered from noticeable color flicker and from red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion.

In 1913, French film entrepreneur and inventor [[Léon Gaumont]] unveiled Chronochrome, a full-color additive system. The camera used three lenses with color filters to photograph red, green and blue color components simultaneously on consecutive frames of one strip of 35&amp;nbsp;mm black-and-white film. The projector had a corresponding triad of lenses. To reduce the strain imposed on the film as the mechanism in each device pulled it down three frames at a time, frame height was reduced from the usual four [[film perforations]] to three, resulting in a widescreen image format identical with the modern 16:9 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].

Chronochrome's color quality was impressive, as surviving specimens attest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/gaumont.htm Gaumont Chronochrome at the WideScreen Museum]. Retrieved 24 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and because the three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and color fringes around moving objects were avoided. However, because the camera's three lenses could not all photograph the scene from exactly the same viewpoint, subjects that were too near the camera would exhibit color fringes if the registration of the three projected images was optimized for the background of the scene, and vice versa. A method of notching the prints to trigger automatic adjustment of the projection optics was invented, but expert supervision of the presentation was still a requisite. Light loss due to the color filters and the constrained dimensions of the projection lenses resulted in an image that was too dim for showing in a large auditorium unless a highly reflective metalized screen or rear-projection onto a translucent screen was used, and either solution created a "hot spot" that made the views from the side sections of the auditorium very unsatisfactory. The films were seldom screened outside of Gaumont's own cinemas and the system soon fell into disuse.

===Technicolor===
After experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with [[additive color]] systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, rather than in rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the [[Technicolor]] Motion Picture Corporation developed a [[subtractive color]] print process. As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a [[beam splitter]] that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the normal base thickness. They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly [[complementary color|complementary]] to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as subtractive color reproduction requires.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.

[[File:The-gulf-between-surviving-cell.jpg|thumb|right|A surviving two-color-component image from the first Technicolor feature film, ''[[The Gulf Between]]'' (1917)&lt;!-- Although filmed for additive projection, this and the few other frames of the film that still exist have survived as early tests of Technicolor's subtractive printing process --&gt;]]

The first publicly shown film using this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious all-Technicolor feature was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

In 1928, the system was refined by the adoption of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single one-sided print, thus eliminating the complication of attaching two prints back to back and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technicolor's system was popular for a number of years, but it was an expensive process: shooting cost three times as much as black-and-white photography and printing costs were also much higher. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by the major studios, but then Technicolor introduced a new process which recorded all three primary colors. Utilizing a [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] sandwiched between two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was split into two paths to expose three black-and-white films (two of them in [[bipack]]), one each to record the densities for red, green and blue.&lt;ref name="afitech"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Technicolor" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338-340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three negatives were printed to gelatin matrix films, which were processed with a selectively hardening developer, treated to remove the silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (the inclusion of a "black" image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous two-color processes.&lt;ref name="awsm"&gt;Hart, Martin (2003). "[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]" Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved 2006-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public. The first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first all-color feature in "New Technicolor" was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.

==Sound era==
{{Main|Sound film}}
[[File:The Jazz Singer 1927 Poster.jpg|thumb|[[The Jazz Singer|''The Jazz Singer'']] (1927), was the first full-length film with synchronized sound.]]
Initially, there were technical difficulties in synchronizing images with sound. However, there was still significant interest in motion pictures for films to be produced without sound. The era from the 1890s to the late 1920s, is commonly referred to as the silent era of film. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film.

Experimentation with [[sound film]] technology, both for recording and playback, was virtually constant throughout the silent era, but the twin problems of accurate synchronization and sufficient amplification had been difficult to overcome (Eyman, 1997). In 1926, Hollywood studio [[Warner Bros.]] introduced the "[[Vitaphone]]" system, producing short films of live entertainment acts and public figures and adding [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded sound]] effects and orchestral scores to some of its major features.

During late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;Note: It has been claimed that this was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'', which consisted of projected slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music. There is apparently no evidence that the synchronization was anything more than loose and approximate — adequate for providing musical accompaniment or narration appropriate to the scene being shown on the screen, but not lip-synchronous on-screen speech or singing — or that any simultaneous filming and sound recording was involved.&lt;/ref&gt; The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods such as Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that "talking pictures", or "talkies", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].

== Digital film ==
{{main|Digital cinematography|Digital cinema}}
Digital cinematography, the process of capturing film images using [[digital image sensor]]s rather than through film stock, has largely replaced analog film technology. As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid 2010s most of the movies across the world are captured as well as [[Digital cinema|distributed]] digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qubecinema.com/events/news/2013/qube-cinema-supports-cinecolor-its-transition-digital-cinema-latin-america|title=Qube Cinema Supports Cinecolor in Its Transition to Digital Cinema in Latin America|work=qubecinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/how-digital-conversion-is-killing-independent-movie-theaters-20130904|title=How Digital Conversion Is Killing Independent Movie Theaters|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital |title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And There's a happy ending - Indiewire |author=Michael Hurley |date=2 January 2014 |work=Indiewire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like [[Arri]] and [[Panavision]], as well as new vendors like [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED]], [[Blackmagic Design|Blackmagic]], [[Silicon Imaging]], [[Vision Research Phantom|Vision Research]] and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like [[Sony]], [[GoPro]], and [[Panasonic]].

Current digital film cameras with 4k output are approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity, however, digital film still has a slightly different look to analog film. Some filmmakers and photographers still prefer to use analogue film to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film vs. Digital: A Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages|url=http://petapixel.com/2015/05/26/film-vs-digital-a-comparison-of-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/|website=PetaPixel|accessdate=2016-06-28|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital cinema]], the use of [[Digital data|digital]] technology to [[Film distributor|distribute]] or [[Video projector|project]] [[motion picture]]s has also largely replaced the historical use of reels of [[motion picture film]], such as 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. Whereas traditional film reels had to be shipped to [[movie theater]]s,  a digital movie can be distributed to cinemas in a number of ways: over the [[Internet]] or dedicated [[satellite]] links or by sending [[hard drives]] or [[optical disc]]s such as [[Blu-ray]] discs. Digital movies are projected using a [[digital projector]] instead of a conventional [[movie projector|film projector]]. Digital cinema is distinct from [[high-definition television]] and is not dependent on using television or [[high-definition video]] standards, aspect ratios, or frame rates. In digital cinema, resolutions are represented by the horizontal pixel count, usually [[2K resolution|2K]] (2048×1080 or 2.2 [[megapixel]]s) or [[4K resolution|4K]] (4096×2160 or 8.8 megapixels). As digital cinema technology improved in the early 2010s, most of the theaters across the world converted to digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/digital-cinema-conversion-nears-end-game-1200500975/|title=Digital Cinema Conversion Nears End Game|author=Leo Barraclough|date=June 23, 2013|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''index case''' is the first documented [[patient]] in the onset of an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/webversions/InfectiousDiseases/other/glossary/act1-gloss3.html#i |title=Diseases – Activity 1 – Glossary, page 3 of 5 |publisher=science.education.nih.gov |accessdate=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=index%20case |title=WordNet Search – 3.0 |publisher=Princeton University, wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or more generally, the first case of a condition or syndrome (not necessarily contagious) to be described in the medical literature, whether or not the patient is thought to be the first person affected.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} An index case will sometimes achieve the status of a "classic" case study in the literature, as did [[Phineas Gage]], the first known person to exhibit a definitive personality change as a result of a brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/21/528966102/why-brain-scientists-are-still-obsessed-with-the-curious-case-of-phineas-gage|title=Why Brain Scientists Are Still Obsessed With The Curious Case Of Phineas Gage|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index case may or may not indicate the source of the [[disease]], the possible spread, or which reservoir holds the disease in between [[outbreak]]s, but may bring awareness of an emerging outbreak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Earlier cases may or may not be found and are labeled primary or coprimary, secondary, tertiary, etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol4no4/parry.htm |title=Sporadic STEC O157 Infection: Secondary Household Transmission in Wales |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, www.cdc.gov |date=1 January 1994 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term primary case can only apply to infectious diseases that spread from human to human, and refers to the person who first brings a disease into a group of people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giesecke|first=Johan|title=Primary and index cases|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62331-X|journal=The Lancet|volume=384|issue=9959|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)62331-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In epidemiology, the term is often misused by both scientists and journalists alike to refer to the individual known or believed to have been the first infected or source of the resulting outbreak in a population as the index case, but such would technically refer to the primary case.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/index-case|title=Index case definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those patients, Dugas was supposedly the first to experience an onset of symptoms of AIDS.  In the above graph, Dugas is represented by the circle labeled 0, highlighted in red.]]

In the early years of the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]], a "patient zero" transmission scenario was compiled by [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]] and colleagues at the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).&lt;ref name=avert /&gt; This epidemiological study showed how "patient zero" had infected multiple partners with [[HIV]], and they, in turn, transmitted it to others and rapidly spread the [[virus]] to locations all over the world (Auerbach et al., 1984). The CDC identified [[Gaëtan Dugas]] as a carrier of the virus from Europe to the United States and spreading it to other men he encountered at [[gay bathhouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pence, G. E. (2008). Preventing the Global Spread of AIDS. In Medical Ethics Accounts of the Cases That Shaped and Define Medical Ethics (p. 331). New York, USA, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Randy Shilts]] subsequently wrote about Patient Zero, based on Darrow's findings,&lt;ref name=avert /&gt; in his 1987 book ''[[And the Band Played On]]'', which identified Patient Zero as Gaëtan Dugas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biod3/duga1.html Matt &amp; Andrej Koymasky - Famous GLTB - Gaëtan Dugas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214123317/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biod3/duga1.html |date=December 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugas was a flight attendant who was sexually promiscuous in several North American cities, according to Shilts' book. He was vilified for several years as a "mass spreader" of HIV, and seen as the original source of the HIV epidemic among [[homosexual]] men. Four years later, Darrow repudiated the study's methodology and how Shilts had represented its conclusions.&lt;ref name=avert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/origin-aids-hiv.htm|title=The Origin of HIV and the First Cases of AIDS|publisher=AVERT, www.avert.org|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America by Michael Worobey and Dr. Arthur Pitchenik claimed that, based on the results of genetic analysis, current North American strains of HIV probably moved from [[Africa]] to [[Haiti]] and then entered the United States around 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7068574.stm|work=BBC News|title=Key HIV strain 'came from Haiti'|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2010-05-05|first=Neil|last=Bowdler}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably through a single [[immigrant]].  However, [[Robert Rayford]] died in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], of complications from AIDS in 1969, and most likely became infected before 1966, so there were prior carriers of HIV strains in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/47352/title/HIV-Spread-from-Haiti-to-NYC-in-1970---Patient-Zero--Not-to-Blame/&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6FbQmk__BvGQHfwS2O0fJzzCctj7zRdzh2SylVnL6UqoCqyUlx-p3DuKsm31rsbVrFClClu6svk-BLvVnERiF-tMigw&amp;_hsmi=36580000|title=HIV Spread from Haiti to NYC in 1970,|website=The Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worobey, Michael et al "1970s and 'Patient 0' HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America" Nature (2016) doi:10.1038/nature19827&lt;/ref&gt;

David Heymann, infectious-disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, has questioned the importance of finding patient zero and has said: "Finding patient zero may be important in some instances, but only if they are still alive and spreading the disease. And more often than not, especially in large disease outbreaks, they're not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohammadi|first1=Dara|title=Finding patient zero|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|date=2015-01-15|volume=294|issue=7845|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/finding-patient-zero/20067543.article|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20992">'''Infrarealism''' is a poetic movement founded in [[Mexico City]] in 1975 by a group of twenty young poets, including [[Roberto Bolaño]], [[Mario Santiago Papasquiaro]], José Vicente Anaya, Rubén Medina and José Rosas Ribeyro.

The Infrarealists, also known as “infras”, took for their motto a phrase from the [[Chileans|Chilean]] painter [[Roberto Matta]]: “Blow the brains out of the cultural establishment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Astorga|first1=Antonio|title="Volarle la tapa de los sesos a la cultura oficial es medida ciertamente saludable"|url=http://www.abc.es/20121111/cultura-libros/abci-volarle-tapa-sesos-cultura-201211101935.html|website=ABC.es|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a defined style, the movement was characterised by the pursuit of a free and personal poetry, representative of its members’ attitude towards life on the fringes of conventional society, in a similar manner to the [[Beat Generation]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="2madadariaga2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977.

The origin of the phrase is French. The intellectual [[Emmanuel Berl]] attributes it to one of the founders of [[Surrealism]], the writer and political activist [[Philippe Soupault]] (1897-1990), who was also one of the driving forces behind [[Dadaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herralde|first1=Jorge|title="Para Roberto Bolaño"|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525232719/http://www.elortiba.org/bolano.html|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bolaño, however, the name was originally coined in the 1940s by Roberto Matta, after [[André Breton]] expelled him from the Surrealists. Cast out, Matta became an “Infrarealist”, and the only one up until the term's rebirth as a literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=María Teresa Cárdenas y Erwin Díaz:  Revista de Libros de El Mercurio|url=http://www.letras.s5.com/bolano201103|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castañeda|first1=Eva|title=El infrarrealismo, subversión como propuesta estética|url=http://www.caratula.net/ediciones/38/critica-ecastanedab.php|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third account for the name’s origin can be traced back to [[Russia]]n writer Georgy Gurevich's sci-fi novella ''Infra Dragonis'', originally published in 1959, and mentioned by Bolaño in the first Infrarealist manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruiz|first1=Felipe|title=Infrarrealistas en Ciudad de México. Un recorrido: Bolaño y el país de los soles negros|url=http://www.letras.mysite.com/rb220206.htm|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial phase of Infrarealism, its most important, lasted until the departure of Papasquiaro and Bolaño to Europe in 1977, who were the initiators and primary leaders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=María Teresa Cárdenas y Erwin Díaz: Revista de Libros de El Mercurio|url=http://www.letras.s5.com/bolano201103.htm|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on Papasquiario's return to Mexico City in 1979, the movement continued once more under his leadership until his death in 1998. At present, the movement is maintained by a mix of new and original members.&lt;ref name="4madariaga2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977. Los años que inspiraron 'Los detectives salvajes'.|date=2010|publisher=RIL Editores|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-284-763-6|pages=125-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the movement ==

In 1968, at a time when the future Infrarealist poets were still children and adolescents, the so-called [[Dirty War (Mexico)|Dirty War]] began to take shape in [[Mexico]] during the presidency of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] ([[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], 1964-1970). Amongst its principal consequences was the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]] in the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), where an estimated 300 to 400 students and civilians were murdered by military and police. [[Roberto Bolaño]], 15-years-old, arrived in Mexico City from Chile with his family this same year. &lt;ref name="madariaga2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977. Los años que inspiraron 'Los detectives salvajes'|date=2010|publisher=RIL Editores|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-284-763-6|pages=17-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Luis Echeverría Álvarez]] ([[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], 1970-1976) took up presidency in Mexico. He was the ex-[[Secretariat of the Interior]] in the government of Díaz Ordaz, who was considered by the majority of the Mexican population as one of the principal culprits of the Dirty War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carmona|first1=Doralicia|title=Luís Echeverría Álvarez asume la presidencia de la República para el periodo 1970-1976|url=http://www.memoriapoliticademexico.org/Efemerides/12/01121970.html|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parametría|title="Juicio a Luis Echeverría Álvarez: movimientos sociales del 68 y 71"|url=http://www.parametria.com.mx/carta_parametrica.php?cp=31|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castillo|first1=Gustavo|title=En la guerra sucia militares recibieron la orden de exterminar a guerrilleros|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/06/16/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=010n1pol|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To recapture Mexico’s youth, the new government set up a series of cultural scholarships, in addition to the creation of artistic and cultural workshops in universities and public institutions. Some of these were run by renowned writers such as [[Augusto Monterroso]] and [[Alejandro Aura]]. The Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the [[UNAM]] organised prose and poetry workshops and published the ''Punto de Partida'' magazine through the Department of Cultural Diffusion, which also ran prose, poetry, drama and essay workshops. Further workshops were held at the [[Metropolitan Autonomous University]] (UAM), courses run at the Casa del Lago cultural centre, and scholarships granted to study literature at the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]] (National Institute of Fine Arts).&lt;ref name="madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Infrarealism emerged at the end of Luis Echeverría’s government in the midst of this effervescence of literary workshops in [[Mexico City]], which were allowing many young people to begin to develop as poets and novelists.&lt;ref name="madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Determined to create a new literary movement based on expressive freedom, the liveliness of language and the breaking of conventions, [[Roberto Bolaño]] and [[Mario Santiago Papasquiaro]] began to meet with other friends and poets they considered fit for the project.&lt;ref name="madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sabotages ==

[[File:Paz0.jpg|thumb|[[Octavio Paz]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1990, was considered by Bolaño and the other “infras” as leader of the Mexican cultural establishment, and condemned because of it.]]

According to the Chilean writer Carlos Chimal, president [[Luis Echeverría]]’s measures to promote cultural activity in the country polarised [[Mexico]]’s artistic society into “two worlds: high culture and popular culture, and there was no way that the two would touch”. The first of these worlds referred to artists who were granted scholarships or received benefits in some way from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]'s government – among them, for example, [[José Luis Cuevas]] and Fernando Benítz. For the Infrarealists, this group also included writers and intellectuals of world renown, such as [[Octavio Paz]] or [[Carlos Monsiváis]], who, despite not needing Echeverría's direct support, cultivated a dedicated readership, ran important literary magazines, and also benefited from tax revenues. At the other extreme was the world of popular culture, which the Infrarealists associated with the left-wing revolution and was made up of artists that opposed the buying and selling of talent.&lt;ref name="madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While members of the first group sought to identify themselves with Octavio Paz, members of the second were closer to the poet [[Efraín Huerta]]. The Mexican writer [[Carmen Boullosa]], a contemporary of the Infrarealists, agrees that both groups were exclusive, and recalls that the only poets who traversed between the two groups were Juan Pascoe and Verónica Volkow, a friend of [[Roberto Bolaño|Bolaño]] and granddaughter of [[Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paz Soldán, Edmundo; Faverón Patriau, Gustavo, eds.|title=Bolaño salvaje|date=2013|publisher=Editorial Candaya|location=Avinyonet del Penedés, Barcelona|isbn=978-84-938903-8-4|pages=434-446|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Boullosa maintains that the two groups were not entirely dissimilar.

Rather than for their own readings, the Infrarealists were known for their sabotaging of the readings, book launches, awards ceremonies and general literary activities of poets belonging to this world of “high culture”. The first of these sabotages took place prior to the movement’s foundation. Towards the end of 1973, [[Mario Santiago Papasquiaro]] and his friend Ramón Méndez attempted to throw Juan Bañuelos out of his own poetry workshop in the Department of Cultural Diffusion at [[UNAM]] by acquiring the signatures of participants; though in the end it was them who were thrown out.&lt;ref name="2madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Huerta]], son of [[Efraín Huerta]], in 2009. The Infrarealists sabotaged a reading of his in 1976.]]

The Infrarealists planned these acts in meetings. They sabotaged the events of different writers, including Octavio Paz himself. At the beginning of 1976, they sabotaged a reading by [[David Huerta]], son of Efraín Huerta. While they got along well with his father, they considered David a privileged author who was destined to succeed under the sheltered protection of his surname. Only Bolaño participated in Huerta’s sabotaging. He later distanced himself from these acts, though still asked friends for details after the acts were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977. Los años que inspiraron 'Los detectives salvajes'.|date=2010|publisher=RIL Editores|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-284-763-6|pages=65-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Carmen Boullosa confessed to having been afraid the Infrarealists would sabotage the prize ceremony where she was to receive the Salvador Novo scholarship, awarded to those under 21, which Darío Galicia had also obtained the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paz Soldán, Edmundo; Faverón Patriau, Gustavo, eds.|title=Bolaño salvaje|date=2013|publisher=Editorial Candaya|location=Avinyonet del Penedés, Barcelona|isbn=978-84-938903-8-4|pages=434-446|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other poets began to both fear and hate them for these attitudes. They treated them as arrogant and disrespectful, and managed to isolate them from the established publications of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977. Los años que inspiraron 'Los detectives salvajes'.|date=2010|publisher=RIL Editores|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-284-763-6|pages=65-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, in the ''La cultura en México'' supplement of ''Siempre!'' magazine, edited by [[Carlos Monsiváis]], a number of columns appeared in which a young [[Héctor Aguilar Camín]], José Joaquin Blanco and [[Enrique Krauze]] spoke of a drop in standard in contemporary Mexican literature, which they viewed as resulting from socialist fashion, excessive sexuality and the appearance of so many new, novice writers. Blanco began to explicitly criticise the Infrarealists in these columns, and they confronted him directly, though this time with Bolaño in tow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977. Los años que inspiraron 'Los detectives salvajes'.|date=2010|publisher=RIL Editores|location=Santiago, Chile|isbn=978-956-284-763-6|pages=65-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications and separation ==

In mid-1976, after [[Octavio Paz]] left ''Plural'' magazine due to political problems in what became known as the "[[Excélsior]] coup”,
Robert Rodríguez Baños was named as the magazine’s director and the Infrarealists once again had the opportunity to publish in established magazines. In October of the same year, in ''Plural'' number 61, [[Mario Santiago Papasquiaro]] published a review and translation of poems by the beat poet and novelist [[Richard Brautigan]]. Then, in December, in number 63, the magazine published ''Seis jóvenes infrarrealistas mexicanos'' (''Six Young Mexican Infrarealists''), with editing and introduction from Papasquairo and featuring Darío Galicia, Mara Larrosa, Rubén Medina, Cuauthémoc Méndez, José Peguero and Papasquairo himself. In January 1977, [[Roberto Bolaño]] was published in number 64.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infrarealists also published their own anthology in 1976, ''Pájaro de calor, ocho poetas infrarrealistas'' (''Bird of Heat, Eight Infrarealist Poets''), which contained a prologue by the [[Spain|Spanish]] poet and journalist Juan Cervera Sanchís. Based in [[Mexico]], he was a regular of Café La Habana, where Bolaño and Papasquiaro held their Infrarealist meetings, and sympathised with the youthful energy of the infras.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the publication of ''Pájaro de calor'', and made clear in a poem of said publication, Bolaño’s girlfriend Lisa Johnson broke up with him. This was one of the main reasons for Bolaño’s departure to [[Barcelona]],&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where his mother had been living since leaving Mexico in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madariaga|first1=Monserrat|title=Bolaño infra: 1975-1977.

Once jóvenes poetas latinoamericanos'' (''Naked Boys Under the Rainbow of Fire. Eleven Young Latin American Poets''),  an anthology of poems featuring Luis Suardíaz, Hernán Lavín Cerda, Jorge Pimentel, Orlando Guillén, Beltrán Morales, Fernando Nieto Cadena, Julián Gómez, Enrique Verástegui, Mario Santiago Papasquairo, Bruno Montané and Bolaño himself. Published in July 1979, the book is prefaced by Miguel Donoso Pareja, contains a piece by Efraín Huerta, and was the first from that era of Infrarealists to be paid for entirely by the publisher, rather than themselves.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto Bolaño left Mexico in 1977, shortly followed by Bruno Montané, who he would meet up with again in Barcelona. Mario Santiago Papasquiaro, on the other hand, went to [[Paris]] and [[Israel]] for a while. Rubén Medina and José Peguero, trying to regroup the infras who had remained in Mexico City and at the same time as a symbolic act of farewell, managed the publication of a single issue of the magazine ''Correspondencia Infra'' in October/November of that year. The magazine had a circulation of five thousand copies, of which very few original copies remain, and includes the ''Manifiesto Infrarrealista'' (''Infrarealist Manifesto''), written by Bolaño, and a poem by Papasquiaro titled ''Consejos de un discípulo de Marx a un fanático de Heidegger'' (''Advice from a disciple of Marx to a Heidegger fanatic''). Written in the days when Papasquiaro frequented the [[Alejandro Aura]]’s workshop in Casa del Lago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina|first1=Rubén|title=Perros habitados por las voces del desierto. Poesía infrarrealista entre dos siglos|date=2014|publisher=ALDVS|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-607-774-289-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poem served as inspiration for the title of the first novel by his friend Bolaño, now living in [[Spain]]: ''Consejos de un discípulo de Morrison a un fanático de Joyce'' (''Advice from a disciple of Morrison to a Joyce fanatic''), written in collaboration with [[A. G. Porta]]. The magazine’s poems were characterised by their stylistic variety.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== The following years ==

[[File:Roberto bolaño.jpg|thumb|left|Graffiti stencil of [[Roberto Bolaño]] in [[Barcelona]], 2012.]]

Various other Infrarealists decided to leave [[Mexico City]] in the years following the departure of Bolaño, Papasquiaro and Montané. Only some continued with literary careers, although the majority dedicated themselves to artistic activities. Rubén Medina went to study literature in the United States; Harrington returned to Chile to study film; Gelles Lebrija went to live in [[Tijuana]]; Piel Divina to [[Paris]]; the Méndez brothers returned to their hometown [[Morelia]], where they worked in journalism, and for a time as bakers; José Vicente Anaya dedicated himself to travelling around Mexico for four years; Lorena de la Rocha chose classical music composition and theatre; and the Larrosa sisters stayed in Mexico City, with Vera devoting herself to dance and theatre,&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Mara to painting.&lt;ref name="4madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first phase of the movement ended with Bolaño and Papasquario’s departure to [[Europe]] in 1977, when Papasquario returned to Mexico City in 1979 he began to meet up with both old friends and new Infrarealists.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between April 1980 and February 1981, poems from this new group of Infraealists appeared in three issues of ''Le Prosa'' magazine, edited by Orlando Guillén.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Movimiento Infrarrealista|title=Le Prosa|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103090556/http://publicaciones.infrarrealismo.com/Revistas/LeProsa/leprosa.html|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sabotages also continued through the 80s, with [[Octavio Paz]] the victim of one in January 1980 at an event called the “Meeting of Generations” in the [[UNAM]] bookshop.&lt;ref name="4madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 1984 and July 1990, the Infrarealists published a poetry pamphlet titled ''Calandria de tolvaneras'', which also included poems from older members like Roberto Bolaño and Bruno Montané. Between March 1992 and January 1993, various Infrarealists were published in several issues of ''Zonaeropuerto'' magazine, which was also edited by Orlando Guillén. In March 1992 they published the magazine ''La zorra vuelve al gallinero'', with two further issues in 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Movimiento Infrarrealista.|title=Calandrias de tolvañeras|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103091257/http://publicaciones.infrarrealismo.com/Revistas/Calandria/Calandrias/Calandrias.html|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later issues, however, were without Papasquairo, who died in 1998.&lt;ref name="4madariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A decade after his death, Mario Raúl Guzman and Rebeca López, Papasquario’s widow, published ''Jeta de santo. Antología poética 1974-1977'', which compiled 161 of Papasquario’s poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livaria Cultura|title=Jeta de santo. Antología poética 1974-1977|url=https://www.livrariacultura.com.br/p/livros/literatura-internacional/poesia/jeta-de-santo-antologia-poetica-1974-1977-2594115|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolaño undoubtedly achieved the greatest international prestige out of the older Infrarealists, establishing himself as a novelist in Barcelona and publishing numerous works for [[Editorial Anagrama]]. The standout successes of these publications were [[The Savage Detectives]], a novel which won Spain’s [[Premio Herralde]] and was directly inspired by his life with the Infrarealists in Mexico City; and [[2666]], which won awards in Spain, Chile and the United States and was also set in Mexico.&lt;ref name="3madadariaga2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judge Dee''' (also, '''Judge Di''') is a semi-fictional character based on the historical figure [[Di Renjie]], [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]] and statesman of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] court. The character appeared in the 18th-century Chinese [[detective novel|detective]] and ''[[Gong'an fiction|gong'an]]'' [[Chinese crime fiction|crime]] novel ''Di Gong An''. After [[Robert van Gulik]] came across it in an antiquarian book store in [[Tokyo]], he translated the novel into English and then used the style and characters to write his own original Judge Dee [[historical mystery]] stories.

The series is set in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Dynasty China]] and deals with criminal cases solved by the upright and shrewd Judge Dee, who as county magistrate in the Chinese imperial legal system was both the [[Examining magistrate|investigating magistrate]] and judge.

==Dee Goong An==
{{main|Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee}}

The Judge Dee character is based on the historical figure [[Di Renjie]] (c. 630&amp;ndash;c. 700), magistrate and statesman of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] court. During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) in China, a "folk novel" was written set in former times, but filled with anachronisms. Van Gulik found in the 18th century ''[[Di Gong An]]'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:狄公案 [[Pinyin]]: dí gōng àn, lit. "Cases of Judge Dee") an original tale dealing with three cases simultaneously, and, which was unusual among Chinese mystery tales, a plot that for the most part lacked an overbearing supernatural element which could alienate Western readers.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;Wright, Daniel Franklin (2004). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/136/ Chinoiserie in the novels of Robert Hans van Gulik]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt;  He translated it into English and had it published in 1949 under the title ''[[Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee]]''.

==Van Gulik's stories==
This gave van Gulik the idea of writing his own novels, set with the similar Ming anachronisms, but using the historical character. Van Gulik was careful in writing the main novels to deal with cases wherein Dee was newly appointed to a city, thereby isolating him from the existing lifestyle and enabling him to maintain an objective role in the books.  Van Gulik's novels and stories made no direct reference to the original Chinese work, and so ''Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee'' is not considered to be part of the '''Judge Dee''' series.

Initially Dee is assisted only by his faithful clerk, Sergeant Hoong, an old family retainer.  However, in ''[[The Chinese Gold Murders]]'', which describes Dee's initial appointment and first criminal cases, the judge encounters two highwaymen, euphemistically called "men of the greenwood", Ma Joong and Chiao Tai, who attempt to rob him but are so impressed with his character that they give up their criminal careers and join his retinue on the spot. (This encounter is recounted in a short flashback passage in the original ''[[Di Gong An]]'', taking place when the two are already long-serving loyal members of his retinue).   A little later, in ''[[The Chinese Lake Murders]]'', a third criminal, Tao Gan, an itinerant confidence trickster and swindler, similarly joins.  Judge Dee ends his career being promoted to the position of senior Metropolitan Judge in the capital, and his assistants obtain official ranks in the Army and civil service.

Van Gulik also wrote a series of newspaper comics about Judge Dee in 1964-1967, which totalled 19 adventures.  The first four were regular balloon strips, but the later 15 had the more typically Dutch textblock under the pictures.

Judge Dee, naturally, is responsible for deciding sentences as well as assessing guilt or innocence, although van Gulik notes in the stories that all capital punishments must be referred to and decided by officials in the capital. One of the sentences he frequently has to deal with is [[slow slicing]]; if he is inclined to mercy, he orders the final, fatal, cut to be made first, thus rendering the ceremony anticlimactic.

==Other authors==
Several other authors have created stories based on Van Gulik's Judge Dee character.

* French author [[:fr:Frédéric Lenormand|Frédéric Lenormand]]  wrote 19 new Judge Dee mysteries from year 2004 at Editions Fayard, Paris (not yet translated into English). Some of them have been translated into Spanish (Ediciones Paidos Iberica), Portuguese (Europress), Bulgarian (Paradox), Czech (Garamond) and Polish.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* Sven Roussel, another French author, has written ''La dernière enquête du Juge Ti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roussel, Sven|title=La dernière enquête du Juge Ti|language=French|isbn= 978-2-9532206-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Chinese-American author [[Zhu Xiao Di]] wrote a book about Judge Dee called ''Tales of Judge Dee'' (2006), set when the Judge was the magistrate of Poo-yang (the same time period as ''[[The Chinese Bell Murders]]'' and several other novels). Zhu Xiao Di has no relation to Robert van Gulik but tried to stay faithful to the fictionalized history of van Gulik's Judge Dee.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Judge Dee appears, along with a fictionalized [[Wu Zetian]], in Eleanor Cooney &amp; Daniel Alteri's mystery novel ''Deception: A Novel of Mystery and Madness in Ancient China''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Bibliography==

===By van Gulik===
The following novels and short stories were published in English by van Gulik. The short story collection ''[[Judge Dee at Work]]'' (published in 1967) contains a "Judge Dee Chronology" detailing Dee's various posts in specific years and stories set in these times. Van Gulik's last two books, ''Poets and Murder'' and ''Necklace and Calabash'', were not listed in the chronology, as they were written after ''Judge Dee at Work'', but they are both set in the time when Judge Dee was the magistrate in Poo-yang.

Each [[Paralympic Games]] have a [[mascot]], usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Paralympic flag or organization logos.

The unnamed mascots of the [[1980 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] are possibly the first Paralympic mascots. But since the Gomdoori in the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the Paralympic mascots has been associated with its Olympic counterparts.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mimbres River Basin has an area of about 13,000&amp;nbsp;km² (5,140&amp;nbsp;mi²) and extends slightly into northern [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].&lt;ref name="MRB-NMSU" /&gt;

==Conservation==
A wide diversity of species (37 species; excluding [[arthropod]]s other than [[crustacean]]s) are of great conservation concern. Eighteen species (49%) are classified as "vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled"  statewide as well as nationally. Additionally 13 species are classified as "vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled" in the state although they are  secure nationally. Birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles are also of concern within the  riparian, ephemeral and terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref name=wildlife/&gt;

The use of water from the Mimbres River is still a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mimbres culture==
[[File:Museum Rietberg Schaudepot Amerika Töpferei 3 A.jpg|thumb|Mimbres pot depicting a [[macaw]].]]
{{main|Mogollon culture#Mimbres culture}}
The Mimbres Basin supported the prehistoric Mimbres Culture, which was part of the larger [[Mogollon culture]]. The culture developed from around 200 to 1000 [[Common Era|CE]], known as the pithouse period.  During this time the use of pottery increased and there was a greater dependence on agriculture throughout the [[Mogollon Mountains|Mogollon area]].  This agriculture depended more and more upon irrigation from the perennial and storm flow of the Mimbres River.  In the later part of the pithouse period distinctive [[Mogollon culture#Mimbres pottery|Mimbres pottery black-on-white designs]] grew more complex and ornate.  Villages and irrigation complexes grew larger, and large [[kiva]]s were built. These community ritual constructions were destroyed around 900 CE in huge ceremonial fires. This marked a major transition in  social and ritual practices.&lt;ref name="Hegmon" /&gt;

[[File:BassoonKeys.png |thumb|right|200px|The modern [[bassoon]] was only feasible as an instrument when the mechanical technology for creating precise key mechanisms was developed. In the 2010s, flutes, clarinets and many other woodwind instruments use similar key mechanisms.]]
'''Mechanical music technology''' is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to [[musical composition|compose]], [[music notation|notate]], play back or [[sound recording|record]] songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ians developed stringed instruments, such as [[harp]]s, [[lyre]]s and [[lute]]s, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as [[double clarinet]]s and percussion instruments such as [[cymbals]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the [[horn (instrument)|horn]], pipe, lyre, harp, and [[bagpipe]]. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the [[Middle Ages]], hand-written [[music notation]] was developed to write down the notes of religious [[Plainchant]] melodies; this notation enabled the [[Catholic church]] to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire.

During the [[Renaissance music]] era, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the piano. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]] (1750–1820), [[Beethoven]] added new instruments to the orchestra to create new sounds, such as the [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]]s, and [[Bass drum|untuned percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]. During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of relatively inexpensive [[sheet music]], which amateur middle class music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as [[piston valve]]-equipped [[cornet]]s, saxophones, [[euphonium]]s, and [[Wagner tuba]]s were added to the orchestra. Many of the mechanical innovations developed for instruments in the 19th century, notably on the piano, brass and woodwinds continued to be used in the 20th and early 21st century.

===References in the Bible===
{{Main article|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|right|170px|"David with his harp", from the [[Paris Psalter]], c. 960, [[Constantinople]].]]

According to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. 
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miriam]] and women celebrate the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] with "timbrels" (small hand drums) (from the [[Tomić Psalter]]).]]In addition there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], wood flute, [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and early trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}} There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]]. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[hydraulis]]'' or "water organ". Note the curved trumpet, called the ''bukanē'' by the Greeks and, later, ''cornu'' by the Romans.]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:

*the [[lyre]]: a strummed and occasionally [[plucked string instrument]], essentially a hand-held [[zither]] built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song.
*the [[kithara]], also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the [[lyre]]. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the [[sounding box]] at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a [[plectrum]]. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.
* the ''[[aulos]]'', usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds.
* the [[Pan pipes]], also known as panflute and [[syrinx]] (Greek συριγξ), (so-called for the nymph who was changed into a reed in order to hide from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top).
* the [[hydraulis]], a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius &lt;ref&gt;''De Architectura'' x, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Heron of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatica'', I, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the [[Ancient Roman music|music of ancient Rome]].

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Musicians from Zliten mosaic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Musicians in a detail from the [[Zliten mosaic]] (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying [[gladiator]] combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the ''tuba'', ''hydraulis'' (water pipe organ), and two ''cornua'']]
The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. [[Roman art]] depicts various woodwinds, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], percussion and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

Roman instruments include:
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze trumpet with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] – αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''capistrum'' to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} 
*The ''[[askaules]]'' – a [[bagpipe]].
*Versions of the modern flute and [[panpipes]].
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}
* The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The ''hydraulis'' accompanied [[gladiator]] contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. 
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device called a [[scabellum]] used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and [[tambourine]]s.
*Drum and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. 
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of notation for the [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'', which originated in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi. ''Gregorian Chant''. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
During the [[Medieval Music]] era (476 to 1400) the [[plainchant]] tunes used by monks for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single melody line, with no harmony parts) and transmitted by oral tradition ("by ear"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to centralize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, which stretched from Europe to North Africa, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. So long as the church had to rely on teaching people chant melodies "by ear", it limited the number of people who could be taught. As well, when songs are learned by ear, variations and changes naturally slip in.

Various signs written above the chant texts, called ''[[neumes]]'' were introduced. These little signs indicated to the singer whether the melody went up in pitch or down in pitch. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was "heighted neumes", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval (e.g., a small interval like a tone or a large interval like a sixth) as well as the direction (up in pitch or down in pitch).

At first the little dots were just placed in the space about the words. However, this method made it hard to determine what pitch a song started on, or when a song was returning to the same pitch. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them, and being placed on or above the lines. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d' Arezzo]] (c. 1000–1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes. Singers were expected to be able to improvise the rhythm, using established traditions and norms.

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|140 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310–1320]]
Instruments used to perform medieval music include the early flute, which was made of wood and which did not have any metal keys or pads. Flutes of this era could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument; the wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the related instrument called the [[gemshorn]]; and the [[pan flute]]. Medieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.

The bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]] as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rabāb]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|(1990)|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to "bow" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jaw harp]] were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) existed in the medieval era.

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. One limiting factor to the wider dissemination of musical styles was that [[monk]]s, [[nuns]], [[aristocrat]]s and professional musicians and singers were among the few people who could read music.

Mechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many instruments originated during the Renaissance. Some instruments used during the Renaissance were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were part of [[guild]]s, which kept playing techniques secret. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary.
*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet.
*Trumpet: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. This limited the types of melodies that Renaissance trumpets could play. They were also made in different sizes.
*[[Sackbut]]: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century

Stringed instruments included:
*[[Viol]]: This hollow, wooden stringed instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly had six strings. It was usually played with a bow.
*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small [[harp]], although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum (or "pick"). Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Some newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
*[[Hurdy-gurdy]]: (Also known as the "wheel fiddle"), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its "drone strings" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
*[[Gittern]] and [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]]: these instruments were used throughout Europe. They were the forerunners of modern plucked string instruments including the [[mandolin]] and acoustic guitar.

Percussion instruments included:
*[[Tambourine]]: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck.
*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth.

Woodwind instruments included:

*[[Shawm]]: A typical shawm is keyless and about a foot long, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were commonly made of wood and more expensive models had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular [[double reed]] instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the early predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.
*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.
*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
*[[Transverse flute]]: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.
*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made of wood, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

===Baroque===
During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (ca. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of [[pipe organ]]s and [[harpsichord]]s, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors (timbres and sounds). Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the [[viol|viola da gamba]] stop. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's "golden age," as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as [[Arp Schnitger]], Jasper Johannsen, [[Zacharias Hildebrandt]] and [[Gottfried Silbermann]] constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large [[Pedal keyboard|Pedal]] and Rückpositiv divisions.

Harpsichord builders in the [[Southern Netherlands]] built instruments with two keyboard (two manuals) which could be used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]]. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs (groups) of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound; this enabled the harpsichorist to have two dynamics and tone colours from one instrument). Another approach that could be used on a two manual harpischord would be to use a coupler to make one manual play two choirs of strings (e.g., an 8' set of strings and a 16' set of strings an octave lower), so that this manual could be used for a loud solo sound, and then having another manual set to trigger only one manual, creating an [[accompaniment]] volume. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] choirs, adding to the lower register and [[eight foot pitch|two-foot]] choirs, which added to the upper register.

The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]]. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume and sustain, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control.

Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would [[Damping|damp]] the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano [[Action (piano)|action]] was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more [[sustain]] than the clavichord. The [[harpsichord]] continued to be used in performances during the first 50 years of the piano's existence; however, after 1750, the harpsichord was gradually phased out of orchestras and small music groups.

===Classicism===

From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing [[Industrial Revolution]] with resources such as high-quality steel [[piano wire]] for [[Strings (music)|strings]], and precision [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] for the production of [[Cast iron|iron frames]]. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five [[octave]]s of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.
Early technological progress owed much to the firm of [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]]. [[John Broadwood]] joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, [[Americus Backers]], to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the "grand". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.

They sent pianos to both [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a [[Interval (music)|fifth (interval)]] during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

The [[cornet]], a piston-valved brass instrument related to the trumpet, could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. [[Beethoven]]'s instrumentation for orchestra added [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] (1804–1808). A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver effects of "storm" and "sunshine" in the composer's dramatic [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]]. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] expanded the sound of the orchestra.

===Romanticism===
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in [[chamber music]] groups, such as [[string quartet]]s. Since mass-market sheet music was relatively inexpensive, this enabled composers and songwriters to distribute their songs and musical pieces to a larger audience and over a larger geographic area. While the widespread dissemination of sheet music helped to spread musical styles across a larger area, the impact was nevertheless restricted to the socioeconomic segments that could read music, [[sightsinging|sing melodies from sheet music]] and own pianos and other musical instruments–namely the middle class and the upper class. Individuals from lower socioeconomic segments were only indirectly able to benefit from this wider dissemination of musical styles (i.e., by hearing new songs performed by professional musicians in [[brothel]]s or [[tavern]]s), as poor people could typically not read music or own pianos or other expensive instruments.

New instruments such as the saxophone began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]]. The [[euphonium]] was used in a few late Romantic and works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornet]]s appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] firm manufactured pianos used by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the Érard firm manufactured those used by [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, [[Sébastien Érard]] invented the double escapement [[Action (piano)|action]], which incorporated a ''repetition lever'' (also called the ''balancier'') that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by [[Henri Herz]], the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.

Other improvements of the piano mechanism included the use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by [[Jean-Henri Pape]] in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The [[Sostenuto|sostenuto pedal]], invented in 1844 by [[Jean-Louis Boisselot]] and copied by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

One innovation that helped create the powerful, loud sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string [[Tension (physics)|tension]] that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece [[cast iron]] frame was patented in 1825 in [[Boston]] by [[Alpheus Babcock]],&lt;ref name="isacoff"&gt;Isacoff (2012, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of [[Birmingham]] brought out a form of piano wire made from [[cast steel]]; according to Dolge it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."&lt;ref name="Dolge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolge|first1=Alfred |title=Pianos and Their Makers: A Comprehensive History of the Piano Volume 1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486228568|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvYgWaXfcIYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, which made the piano louder and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] height. The mechanical action structure of the [[upright piano]] was invented in London, England in 1826 by [[Robert Wornum]], and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri, ed.|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93796-2|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright pianos were more compact than grand pianos, and less expensive, so the invention of the upright piano helped make the piano an even more important instrument in private homes (for amateur music-making); in schools; in rehearsal halls; and in some types of performance venues.

'''Number 8 wire''' is a {{define|0.16[[inch|"]]|{{convert|0.16|inch|mm|disp=number|sigfig=4}} mm}}-diameter gauge of wire on the [[Standard Wire Gauge|British Standard Wire Gauge]] that has entered into the cultural [[lexicon]] of [[New Zealand]].

Number 8 wire was the preferred wire gauge for sheep fencing, so remote farms often had rolls of it on hand, and the wire would often be used inventively to solve mechanical or structural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Orsman|editor-first=H. W.|year=2011|title=The Dictionary of New Zealand English|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn = 0-19-558347-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the term "number 8 wire" came to represent the ingenuity and resourcefulness of [[New Zealanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bardsley|first=Dianne|chapter-url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheSettledLandscape/CountryLife/RuralLanguage/1/ENZ-Resources/Standard/3/en|chapter=Rural language: No 8 wire |title=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |date=20 November 2008|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage}}.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1976 when [[Metrication in New Zealand|New Zealand adopted the metric system]], number 8 wire is officially referred to as 4.0 mm gauge wire, although the older term "Number 8 wire" continues to be commonly applied. Fencing now predominantly uses 2.5 mm high-tensile wire.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peden, '"[http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/farm-fencing/page-5 Farm fencing - High-tensile and electric fencing]", Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, page 5, (accessed 5 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Netwing''' is a long-running United Kingdom law enforcement endeavour, headed by Bedfordshire &amp; Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit (BHMCU), investigating allegations of [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] and [[human trafficking]] in [[Bedfordshire, England]] by [[Irish Travellers]].&lt;ref name=beds1&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Netwing – Slavery Arrest Update|url=http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/about_us/news/news_2011/110912_-_operation_netwing.aspx|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=News|publisher=[[Bedfordshire Police]]|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beds2&gt;{{Cite web|title=Arrests For Slavery Offences Made in Leighton Buzzard|work=News|publisher=[[Bedfordshire Police]]|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|url=http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/about_us/news/news_2011/110912_-_slavery_offences.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2011, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) announced that Tommy Connors (30), Patrick Connors (19), James Connors (34) and James Connors (23) had been charged with "conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and requiring them to perform forced labour" and were remanded in custody to appear at Luton Magistrates' Court on 13 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bedfordshire 'slaves' case: Four men charged|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-14891461}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman CPS Thames and Chiltern Complex Casework Unit explained: "These charges relate to four victims who allege they have been held against their will and forced to live and work like slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NI man charged over slavery ring|url=http://www.u.tv/News/NI-man-charged-over-slavery-ring/45e1b4c4-b233-467b-b7ed-bb31741ae234|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[UTV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth person arrested, a woman, Josie Connors (aged 30), whom police revealed was pregnant, was originally released on police bail to be questioned further following the "imminent" birth of her child.&lt;ref name=beds2/&gt;&lt;ref name=hennessy2/&gt; However, on 15 September, she was charged with four offences related to activities at the Greenacres site.

On 21 September 2011, three further arrests took place at the caravan park. One of those arrested, Johnny Connors (30), was charged later that day with four offences including conspiracy to hold someone in servitude, and conspiracy to require someone to perform forced labour.

==Reactions==
[[Andrew Selous]], [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]: "Following this weekend's utterly despicable revelations of the way in which twenty-four of my constituents have been kept as slaves, some for fifteen years, I'd like to commend the robust action of Bedfordshire Police in bringing this to light", and asked the Government to "pay particular attention to the issue of internal trafficking within the UK, given that seventeen of these twenty-four slaves were British citizens." [[Damian Green]] MP, [[Minister of State for Immigration]] said the incident "came as a shock to many of us. What we saw was effective police action, co-ordinated in many ways by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The new [[National Crime Agency]] will have among its functions co-ordinating activity against trafficking, both domestic and international, which will give us a much more effective way of combating this particularly vile crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=MP urges slavery probe after raid|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[Press Association]]|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5i5QQouk1f65ngJWhkxoQXeJ2RE6A?docId=N0342191315842408585A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klara Skrivankova, Trafficking Programme Coordinator at [[Anti-Slavery International]], said: "Slavery and this case which appears to be a case of forced labour is a reality in Britain today but I think what it shows to us is that the police have finally been given proper powers in the new law that has been mentioned in order to investigate and really go after those who are still behaving like slave-masters in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The World Today: UK police uncover slave ring|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Sydney|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3315462.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on 16 April 2008, Dr Donald Kenrick, an expert on the [[Romany language]], is quoted as saying "Dossers are people gipsies pick up to work for them. They are sometimes called slaves or servants. ... It is common among Irish travellers, but the English do it as well."  However he disputed that they were really slaves, saying that the practice meant that otherwise vulnerable people were being cared for. He said the travellers favoured single men, who were strong workers, but of poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Slaves are still common|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/archive/2008/04/16/SLAVE+LABOUR+%28SLAVELABOUR%29/2202528.Slaves_are_still_common|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other related raids at Traveller sites==
The 2011 series of police investigations on Travellers' sites began after the decomposed body of Christopher Nicholls, missing since 2005, was found in March 2008 near the Beggars Roost caravan site in [[Staverton, Gloucestershire]]. Covert surveillance of several Traveller sites began in March 2010 and police observed 22 alleged slaves at the Beggar's Roost site. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Beggars Roost===
On 22 March 2011 police raided Beggar's Roost and arrested William Connors (50) and his wife Breda (46).&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{Cite news|title=Four travellers held by police after '20 years of forcing vulnerable men to work as slaves'|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1370669/4-travellers-held-police-slavery-charges-Gloucestershire.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enderby and Pleasley===
Around 27 March 2011 simultaneous raids were carried out at Traveller sites in [[Enderby, Leicestershire]], where eight alleged slaves were found, and [[Pleasley|Pleasley, Derbyshire]], where seven alleged slaves were found.

Prosecuting solicitor Graham Dono told Cheltenham Magistrates' Court: "They then required them to do manual work for excessive hours for payments of no more than £20 a day and in some cases no payment at all. They were given minimal amounts of food. Movements are restricted, mobile phones are not allowed and victims are kept in fear of reprisals if they attempt to leave ... Men would be forced to work for up to 14 hours a day and moved from location to location around the country. It is clear from police videos that the slaves have minimal clothing, they are always dirty and disheveled, they look extremely unhappy and there is evidence of members of the Connors family at the locations in charge of the workers. Victims who had tried to leave sites had been tracked down and returned by members of the Connors family. These victims are extremely vulnerable and are now in a safe house. We say some of them have been indoctrinated for as much as 20 years working in this way. They are people who are clearly fearful. Twenty victims have so far been recovered from the Connors family but inquiries are at an early stage and it is expected there will be more."&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;

'''Phantom practice''' is the purported phenomenon in which a person's abilities continue to improve, even without practicing at all. It is mostly associated with practicing a [[musical instrument]]. After habitual practicing, a person may believe that they have continued to experience improvement even after they stop practicing. Whether these individuals have actually improved or whether it is simply a subjective perception on their part has not been ascertained by researchers.

==Kinesthetic memory==
The phenomenon of retaining a physical skill that has not been used in a long time is well understood. The physical skills of holding and playing an instrument are held in a reflex-level [[long-term memory]] called "kinesthetic memory", "motor memory", or "[[muscle memory]]." Kinesthetic memory is very durable, and as such, a person may retain the ability to perform on an instrument that they previously played regularly, even if they have not practiced the instrument for weeks or months.

==Confidence==
A sense of [[confidence]] is an important performing skill. In a musical sense, confidence can translate into a stronger tone, more self-assured entrances, and a better stage presence. A nervous, anxious player or singer, on the other hand, is likely to have a wavering tone, uncertain intonation, and hesitant entrances. Since confidence often develops as a person matures and gains life experience, some people may notice an improvement in playing a former childhood instrument that they take up again as an adult. Again, although such a person may attribute their stronger tone and playing style to "phantom practicing", other factors such as increased confidence may have caused the improvements.

==Rhythmic skill==
During the interval of not practicing, a person purporting to have experienced "phantom practicing" may have developed other factors besides instrument practicing which contribute to the quality of musical [[performance]], such as rhythmic skill. For example, a [[drummer]] who abandons music in their teens, and then studies dancing in their 30s may find, if they return to drumming in their 40s, that their sense of rhythm has improved. While this person might attribute their improved drumming skills to "phantom practice", a more likely explanation is that they improved their rhythmic skills and "time feel" confidence in the intervening decades.

==Knowledge of musical styles and idioms==
Another possibility is that a person may improve their knowledge of musical styles and idioms during a period of non-practicing. For example, if a person learns all of the core [[jazz piano]] techniques in their teens, and then abandons the instrument, followed by a 20-year interval of listening to [[jazz]] and going to jazz concerts, this person may feel that they have benefitted from "phantom practicing" if they return to jazz piano playing in their 40s. Instead, it is more likely that the improvement in this person's jazz playing is due to decades of experience of listening to authentic jazz playing "comping" and "blowing".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21737">'''Post-racial United States''' is a theoretical environment in which the [[United States]] is free from [[Racism|racial preference]], [[discrimination]], and [[prejudice]].

== Origins of the term ==
One of the earliest uses of the term "post-racial" to describe the United States was in an October 5, 1971, article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' titled "Compact Set Up for 'Post-Racial' South".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/10/05/79156105.pdf|work = The New York Times|last = Wootens|first = James T.|date = October 5, 1971|title = Compact Set Up for 'Post-Racial' South|access-date = January 2, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article reported the establishment of a "Southern Growth Policies Board" in [[Durham, North Carolina]], "by some 70 politicians and professors who believe their region of 60 million citizens has entered an era in which race relations are soon to be replaced as a major concern by population increase, industrial development, and economic fluctuations".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==2008 Presidential election==
[[File:BarackObamaportrait.jpg|thumb|President Barack Obama|225x225px]] 
Some Americans saw the presidential candidacy of [[Barack Obama]], and his [[United States presidential election, 2008|election in 2008]] as the first [[Black people|black]] [[president of the United States]], as a sign that the nation had, in fact, become post-racial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A New, 'Post-Racial' Political Era in America|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18489466|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10347165|title = One Year Later and the Myth of a Post-Racial Society|last = Dawson|first = Michael C.|date = 2009|journal = Du Bois Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2016-01-01|last2 = Bobo|first2 = Lawrence D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] radio host [[Lou Dobbs]], for example, said in November 2009, "We are now in a 21st-century post-partisan, post-racial society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dobbs calls on listeners to rise above "partisan and racial element that dominates politics"|url = http://mediamatters.org/video/2009/11/12/dobbs-calls-on-listeners-to-rise-above-partisan/156917|website = Media Matters for America|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, [[Chris Matthews]], an [[MSNBC]] host, said of President Obama, "He is post-racial by all appearances. You know, I forgot he was black tonight for an hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MSNBC's Matthews On Obama: "I Forgot He Was Black Tonight" {{!}} RealClearPolitics|url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2010/01/27/msnbcs_matthews_on_obama_i_forgot_he_was_black_tonight.html|website = www.realclearpolitics.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, public opinion on whether the United States is post-racial is itself divided starkly by race. In a [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]/[[ABC News]] poll conducted in December 2014, about 50% of white respondents said they believed that the justice system treats Americans of all races equally, but only 10% of African-Americans said the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = On racial issues, America is divided both black and white and red and blue|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/on-racial-issues-america-is-divided-both-black-and-white-and-red-and-blue/2014/12/26/3d2964c8-8d12-11e4-a085-34e9b9f09a58_story.html?hpid=z4|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-12-26|access-date = 2016-01-02|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Dan|last = Balz|first2 = Scott|last2 = Clement}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2015, according to a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll, 13 percent of black Americans surveyed identified race relations as the most important problem the United States faces, compared with 4 percent of white Americans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Views of Race Relations as Top Problem Still Differ by Race|url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/183572/race-divides-views-race-relations-top-problem.aspx|website = Gallup.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that the United States is ''not'' post-racial frequently emphasize the treatment of African-Americans and other racial minorities in the criminal justice system and in interactions with the police. Killings of unarmed African-Americans, [[List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States|often by police officers]], have been widely publicized. In 2015, according to a study by ''[[The Guardian]]'', police officers in the United States killed 7.13 black Americans per million, compared with 2.91 white Americans per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Counted: people killed by police in the United States in 2015 – interactive|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally:

{{quote|Young black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015, according to the findings of a Guardian study that recorded a final tally of 1,134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers this year.

Despite making up only 2% of the total US population, African American males between the ages of 15 and 34 comprised more than 15% of all deaths logged this year by an ongoing investigation into the use of deadly force by police. Their rate of police-involved deaths was five times higher than for white men of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Young black men killed by US police at highest rate in year of 1,134 deaths|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Jon|last = Swaine|first2 = Oliver|last2 = Laughl|first3 = Jamiles|last3 = Lartey|first4 = Ciara|last4 = McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such killings had a marked effect on public perceptions of [[Racism in the United States|race relations in America]]. The 13 percent of black Americans who called race relations the most pressing problem in the United States in the spring 2015 Gallup poll dwarfed the 3 percent that Gallup reported at the beginning of 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; And the percentage of white Americans who said race relations were the most important issue rose to 4 percent in 2015 from 1 percent in 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2015 that the phrase "post-racial" was "usually employed by talk-show hosts and news anchors looking to measure progress in the Obama era."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; And [[Anna Holmes]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "Chattel slavery and the legacies it left behind continue to shape American society.

Under this view, there is no claim that America has attained a fully post-racial society, however it is argued that news selection is skewed toward amplifying racial conflict, events demonstrating racial harmony are dismissed as non-newsworthy, and that such media conflict-bias acts to undermine trust and impede progress.   Rather, any true measure of race relations must gauge the everyday daily experiences of Americans in interacting with people of differing backgrounds.   An assumption is that the media will cherry-pick the most outrageous, racially-inflammatory events to cover no matter how infrequently they are occurring, and thus misreport progress toward a post-racial ideal.  The central tenet of post-racial problem-solving practice is to seek the "alternative explanation" when conflict arises (presuming non-racist motives in others), in order to find common ground and creatively resolve the conflict.   Examples of post-racial framing in attacking misconduct by the Criminal Justice System are video recording of all police-citizen interactions, creating a Citizens Review Board with investigative powers, and assigning an independent prosecutor.   Or, in the educational sphere, creating charters, academies and school choice to turn around under-performing schools.   The divide in public opinion on the status of race in America was reflected in reactions to the [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter movement]]. In response to the "black lives matter" rallying cry, some people, including politicians, began using the phrase "all lives matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hillary Clinton's 'All Lives Matter' Remark Stirs Backlash|url = https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/24/hillary-clintons-all-lives-matter-remark-stirs-backlash/|website = The New York Times - First Draft|date = 2015-06-24|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Alan|last = Rappeport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Law Enforcement and the Communities We Serve: Bending the Lines Toward Safety and Justice|url = https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/law-enforcement-and-the-communities-we-serve-bending-the-lines-toward-safety-and-justice|website = FBI|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Huckabee Says Civil Rights Icon Dr. King Would Be 'Appalled' By Black Lives Matter Movement|url = http://thinkprogress.org/election/2015/08/19/3692954/huckabee-black-lives-matter-mlk/|website = ThinkProgress|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a sheriff's deputy in [[Harris County, Texas]], was fatally shot while pumping gas in August,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Texas: Sheriff's Deputy Is Fatally Shot at Gas Station|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/texas-sheriffs-deputy-is-fatally-shot-at-gas-station.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-08-29|access-date = 2016-01-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = David|last = Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheriff Ron Hickman claimed that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter activists had contributed to the killing and said, "We've heard 'black lives matter'.

Evidence of continued racial divisions in the United States can also be found in [[Demography|demographics]]. For instance, African-Americans account for less than 15 percent of the total population of [[Michigan]], but more than 82 percent of the population of the state's largest city, [[Detroit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Detroit, MI Population by Race and Ethnicity - CLRSearch|url = http://www.clrsearch.com/Detroit-Demographics/MI/Population-by-Race-and-Ethnicity|website = CLRSearch|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; — and Detroit, like many cities whose residents are predominantly black, has "resegregated schools, dwindling tax bases and decaying public services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Dream Still Deferred|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/opinion/27Sugrue.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-03-26|access-date = 2016-01-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Thomas J.|last = Sugrue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a similar dynamic in [[Louisiana]]; the state was about 64 percent white as of the 2010 Census,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Louisiana QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau|url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22000.html|website = quickfacts.census.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140119205316/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22000.html|archivedate = 2014-01-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but its largest city, [[New Orleans]], is 60 percent black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Orleans (city) QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau|url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/2255000.html|website = quickfacts.census.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102053100/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/2255000.html|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further segregation can be found within New Orleans: the [[Lower Ninth Ward]], for example, is 97 percent black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lower 9th Ward, New Orleans, LA Population &amp; Demographics|url = http://www.areavibes.com/new+orleans-la/lower+9th+ward/demographics/|website = www.areavibes.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the neighborhood that experienced the most catastrophic flooding after [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the government's [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|response to the disaster]] has been cited as evidence of the continued presence of racism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Race An Issue In Katrina Response|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/race-an-issue-in-katrina-response/|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Katrina victims blame racism for slow aid|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10354221/ns/us_news-katrina_the_long_road_back/t/katrina-victims-blame-racism-slow-aid/|website = msnbc.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the victims were black and poor, and class was a major factor in who survived: Those who lived in areas better protected from flooding, and those who were able to evacuate before the storm, tended to be wealthier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hurricane Katrina: The Race and Class Debate|url = http://monthlyreview.org/2006/07/01/hurricane-katrina-the-race-and-class-debate/|website = Monthly Review|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Kristen|last = Lavelle|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, President [[George W.

== Political implications ==
The idea that America is post-racial, or close to it, has played a role in at least one [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision. In ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' in 2013, the court invalidated a section of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] that had required nine states with particularly severe histories of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval for any change to their election laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-06-25|access-date = 2016-01-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Liptak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling, written by Chief Justice [[John Roberts|John G. Roberts Jr.]], said in part, "Our country has changed." It added that in the decades since the Voting Rights Act was passed, "voting tests were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data relevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data reflecting current needs."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf Shelby County v.

'''''Prom Queen''''' is the first [[web television]] series produced by former [[Walt Disney]] CEO [[Michael Eisner]]'s new production company [[Vuguru]] and veteran web television production company [[Big Fantastic]], the creators of ''[[Sam Has 7 Friends]]''. The series, consisting of 80 episodes of 90 seconds each, is one of the best-funded entrants into the world of original programming designed exclusively for online video.&lt;ref name="Wired on Prom Queen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/03/72976|title=Meet Michael Eisner's Prom Date|date=2007-03-15|work=[[Wired Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show generated revenue through sponsorships, by selling some of the clothing worn by the characters, and by carrying advertising for ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]''.&lt;ref name="Red Herring on Prom Queen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=21681&amp;hed=Eisner%E2%80%99s+Indie+Gamble&amp;sector=Industries&amp;subsector=InternetAnd|title=Eisner’s Indie Gamble|date=2007-03-18|work=[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series premiered April 1, 2007 on [[MySpace]], and supplemental scenes can be seen on MySpace as each of the characters has a MySpace page that includes [[blog]]s, [[Video clip|Vlogs]], and comments between the characters. According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', it marks MySpace's boldest push into original video content. The series was also distributed on [[YouTube]], [[Veoh]], and on an original Prom Queen website.&lt;ref name="FT on Prom Queen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2153e480-dd8e-11db-8d42-000b5df10621.html|title=MySpace, Eisner in online video deal|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season ended on June 20, 2007, with over 15 million views of the episodes during the original 12-week run,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blinkx.com/article/blinkx-distribute-prom-queen-summer-heat-spinoff-series~453|title=blinkx.com to Distribute "Prom Queen: Summer Heat," the Spinoff Series of Emmy-Nominated Broadband Drama, "Prom Queen"|date=2007-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221033531/http://www.blinkx.com/article/blinkx-distribute-prom-queen-summer-heat-spinoff-series~453|archivedate=2009-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been viewed by over 40 million people to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2012/10/the-cw-picks-up-vurugus-digital-series-prom-queen/18480/|title=The CW picks up Vurugu’s digital series Prom Queen|date=2012-10-18|work=Television Business International|first=Peter|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-episode spinoff series, ''[[Prom Queen: Summer Heat]]'', debuted on August 27, 2007. On May 7, 2008, a Japanese remake of the series, titled ''Tokyo Prom Queen'', began airing in a similar format.

On October 20, 2008, Michael Eisner confirmed that a third season of "Prom Queen" would be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=eisner1008.htm|title=Michael Eisner|date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2008-10-20}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD of the series was released on October 8, 2008; it included behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries from the cast and creators of the series.

In July 2009 it was announced that a follow-up series was being filmed, entitled ''Prom Queen: The Homecoming''. Starting July 4, 2010, 'Homecoming' began to air on [[Citytv]], a Canada-based television website. Four episodes were released each Monday. "Homecoming" connected 'Sam Has 7 friends' with 'Prom Queen' and primarily focused on the character, Sadie Simmons. 'Homecoming' ended with a cliffhanger, suggesting another season would appear.

In October 2012, "Homecoming" debuted in the United States (along with the original "Prom Queen" and "Sam Has 7 Friends") on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]'s website.&lt;ref name="Zimbio"&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.zimbio.com/TV+News/articles/5OeWZrZrGJL/Popular+Web+Series+Prom+Queen+Sam+7+Friends | title = Popular Web Series 'Prom Queen' and 'Sam Has 7 Friends' Hit the CW Website | author = Jill Slattery | work = [[Zimbio]] | date = 2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2014, the first season can be seen for free on YOUTUBE, at the channel promqueentv. The episodes contain their original edits, without being pasted together as they had been on THE CW website.

It is done to celebrate the holiday and publicize the [[Hanukkah#Traditional view|miracle of Hanukkah]], and is typically accompanied by a public event during one of the nights of Hanukkah attended by invited dignitaries who are honored with lighting the menorah.&lt;ref name="Largest Menorah"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/livewire/archived/the_worlds_largest_menorah/|title=The World's Largest Menorah|last=Lernar|first=Dana|publisher=NYU Jurnalism Institute|accessdate=21 December 2009|location=[[New York City]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113034858/http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/livewire/archived/the_worlds_largest_menorah/|archivedate=13 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public menorah lighting were initiated by Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]] in 1974. The most prominent public menorah celebration takes place in Washington DC, and is known as the [[National Menorah]]. In 2013 Chabad planned 15,000 public menorah lighting events across the globe.

==History==
The concept of lighting a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] in a way that allows the public to see it dates back to ancient times, where menorahs were lit outside of people's homes in order to publicize the miracle of Hanukkah. The concept of lighting a large menorah in public was initiated by Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]], known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

In 1973 Rabbi Schneerson announced his Hanukkah-awareness campaign, encouraging his followers and emissaries to reach out to their fellow Jews and give them the opportunity to kindle the Hanukkah lights. That year they distributed some 60,000 tin menorahs.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/menorah-medina/?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, in continuation of Rabbi Schneerson's Hanukkah awareness campaign, when Rabbi [[Abraham Shemtov]] kindled a menorah at the foot of the Liberty Bell at Independence Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joi.org/bloglinks/JTA%20NEWS%20Chanuka%20Chabad.htm ''Spreading like wildfire, but public menorah lightings still controversial'', JTA, December 5, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006034939/http://joi.org/bloglinks/JTA%20NEWS%20Chanuka%20Chabad.htm |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in 1975, rock promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] sponsored [[Chabad]]'s menorah in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. "The Rebbe's Army, page 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="San Francisco Menorah Lighting"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=18133/|title=FIRST LIGHTING OF HANUKKAH SUNDAY IN TRADITIONAL SAN FRANCISCO UNION SQUARE OBSERVANCE|last=Martinfield|first=Sean|publisher=San Francisco Sentinel|accessdate=5 January 2012|location=[[San Francisco|SF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1974, the concept of public menorahs has expanded. In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] participated in the lighting of the public menorah erected by Chabad. In 2013, Chabad planned 15,000 public menorah lighting events across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Chabad.org [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/2406550/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitchs-Global-Chanukah-Campaign.htm "Chabad-Lubavitch's Global Chanukah Campaign"]&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2014, the public menorah in [[Washington, D.C.]] was kindled by Vice President [[Joe Biden]].

Scholars have cited this initiative by Rabbi Schneerson as a prime factor in Hanukkah becoming such a widely celebrated festival.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Eli Plaut, ''A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to be Jewish''. Rutgers University Press, 2012. Page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''.

==Notable Public Menorah Lightings==

===United States===

====White House National Menorah====

{{Main|National Menorah}}
Since 1979, the [[National Menorah]] has been lit on the [[White House]] grounds in celebration of Hanukkah. President [[Jimmy Carter]] attended that first ceremony, and President [[Ronald Reagan]] designated it the National Menorah.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseMenorah2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/09/lighting-of-national-menorah-marks-the-beginning-of-hanukkah/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 December 2012 | title=Lighting of national menorah marks the beginning of Hanukkah|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the ceremony included then-White House [[Chief of Staff]] [[Rahm Emanuel]] (now mayor of Chicago),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/13/rahm-emanuel-lights-natio_n_390552.html|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=12 December 2012 | title=Rahm Emanuel Lights National Menorah At White House (PHOTOS)|date=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Chief of Staff [[Jack Lew]] in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseMenorah2012"/&gt; In 2012, the first candle was lit with the help of [[Jeffrey Zients]], director of the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]].&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseMenorah2012"/&gt;

====New York City====
The world's largest menorah stands at 32 feet and is lit at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street in [[Manhattan]] near [[Central Park]]. A 4,000-pound structure, it is the work of [[Israelis|Israeli]] artist [[Yaacov Agam]]. Because of the menorah's height, [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]] assists the lighting by using a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] to lift each person to the top. A [[Guinness World Record]] is pending.&lt;ref name="Largest Menorah"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====British Parliament====
Each year, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] holds a menorah lighting at the home of the Speaker of the House of Commons.  The menorah currently used was commissioned by the Rt. Hon. [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael J. Martin]] MP, former Speaker of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mplevene.co.uk/staticpage.aspx?spageid=101480|title=M.P. Levene Special Commissions|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trafalgar Square====
Since 2007, Chabad has organized a public menorah celebration at Trafalgar Square. Each year the event is sponsored by Chabad, the [[Jewish Leadership Council]], the [[London Jewish Forum]] and the mayor of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/events/chanukah-in-the-square |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216020634/https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/events/chanukah-in-the-square |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[File:Hanukkah sign Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.JPG|thumb|right|Public Hanukkah menorah in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
Public menorahs are prominently displayed throughout Israel, notably in the [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Ben Gurion airport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/134929 Massive Chanukah Menorah will Greet Airborne Guests]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Each year Nicosia has lit a National Menorah in celebration of Hanukkah. [[Nicosia]] as the capital of the Republic of Cyprus has been the pioneer city to put a Menorah in its city center.

===Canada===

A large menorah is located at [[Toronto City Hall]] at the south east corner of [[Nathan Phillips Square]] during Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torontograndprixtourist.com/2011/12/menorah-ready-at-city-hall.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as smaller one is also found at [[Old City Hall (Toronto)|Old City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torontograndprixtourist.com/2011/12/menorah-almost-ready-at-old-city-hall.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Image:Chanukka Karlsruhe 1.jpg|thumb|A large [[Chabad]]-style menorah in front of the [[Karlsruhe Palace]] in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]] before a public [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] menorah lighting ceremony (2006).]]

The success of the public menorah campaign has not been without controversy. In 1988, the [[American Jewish Congress]] produced a 28-page report entitled "The Year of the Menorah", criticizing Chabad's public menorah campaign and the litigation that went with it.  It complained of the increase in the number of menorahs placed on public lands, arguing that it was causing tension both within the community and with non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Menorah displays stir Jewish rift'', Miami Herald, June 14, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the [[ACLU]] challenged the legality of a display of a Chabad-owned public menorah in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|County of Allegheny]]. In a court case [[County of Allegheny v. ACLU]] the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the menorah. 

In 1989, the city of [[Burlington, Vermont]] denied the local Chabad chapter, headed by Rabbi Yitzchok Raskin permission to erect a menorah in the city's main park during Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Kaplan v. City of Burlington and Robert Whalen (12/12/89)United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, No. 89-7042; 891 F.2d 1024&lt;/ref&gt; Raskin appealed the decision on two occasions after an initial hearing 1987 found the display to be unconstitutional under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. The ACLU assisted the City of Burlington in a final appeal in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in 1991, and the menorah ban was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Chabad-Lubavitch of Vermont v. City of Burlington, 936 F.2d 109 (C.A.2 (Vt.), 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Twist to Old Fight: Menorah in Vermont Park'', Sally Johnson, New York Times, December 20, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There have been similar cases involving Chabad public menorahs with the courts ruling against Chabad, including [[Chicago]] (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Lubavitch Chabad House, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 917 F.2d 341 (C.A.7 (Ill.), 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]] (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Lubavitch of Iowa, Inc. v. Walters, 808 F.2d 656 (C.A.8 (Iowa), 1986),&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cincinnati]] (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Congregation Lubavitch v. City of Cincinnati, 923 F.2d 458 (C.A.6 (Ohio), 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Chabad-Lubavitch of Georgia v. Miller, 5 F.3d 1383 (C.A.11 (Ga.), 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1991, in [[White Plains, New York]], the [[City council|Common Council]] unanimously rejected the display of a Chabad menorah in a public space in the town with the support of many Jews, affirming a local tradition of keeping parks free of religious and political displays.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/03/nyregion/white-plains-council-blocks-electric-menorah-for-park.html?pagewanted=1 White Plains Council Blocks Electric Menorah for Park]'', Lisa W. Foderaro, [[New York Times]] December 3, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Rabbi Sholom B. Kalmanson of Chabad of [[Southern Ohio]] to light an 18-foot menorah in Cincinnati's [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]]. Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] upheld a lower court ruling that the city could not ban the menorah and other religious displays from the square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/19399/edition_id/393/format/html/displaystory.html ''Supreme Court rules on public chanukiot'', Joe Berkofsky, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, December 6, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/ussc/537/537us1501.html Chabad Of Southern Ohio et al. v. City of Cincinnati, 537 U.S. 1501, (2002) (per curiam)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the menorah being a Jewish symbol, menorahs in public have been subject to [[anti-Semitic]] violence. For instance, in 2009 in [[Moldova]], a group of fundamentalist Orthodox Christians took down a public menorah and replaced it with a cross.&lt;ref name="moldov"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moldovan Christians Tear Down Public Menorah |url=http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/news/jt/international_news/moldovan_christians_tear_down_public_menorah/16116  |agency=JTA Wire Service|newspaper=[[Baltimore Jewish Times]] |publisher= |location=Budapest |accessdate=December 17, 2009 |date=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], a Chabad rabbi was attacked by a [[Muslim]] man while leading the candle lighting ceremony.&lt;ref name="moldov" /&gt;

Controversy has also arisen at the Western Wall in Israel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant menorah is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" {{cite web |url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091022/http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women of the Wall]] sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act." In December 2014 the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.'

'''''Rabindra Sangeet''''' ({{lang-bn|রবীন্দ্রসঙ্গীত}} ''Robindro shonggit'', {{IPA-bn|ɾobindɾo ʃoŋɡit}}), also known as '''Tagore Songs''', are songs from the [[Indian subcontinent]] written and composed by the [[Bengalis|Bengali]] [[polymath]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], winner of the 1913 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name="Sigi 2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sigi|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.&lt;ref name="DasguptaGuha2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs have distinctive characteristics in the [[music of Bengal]], popular in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Tagore 2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tagore|2007|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magic of Rabindra Sangeet"&gt;{{cite news|title=Magic of Rabindra Sangeet|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66947/magic-rabindra-sangeet.html|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HzYTtLhV?url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66947/magic-rabindra-sangeet.html|archivedate=9 July 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dance with Rabindra Sangeet - Kolkata 2011-11-05 6669.JPG|thumb|Dance accompanied by Rabindra Sangeet]] It is characterised by its distinctive rendition while singing which includes a significant amount of ornamentation like [[meend]], [[murki]], etc. and is filled with expressions of [[romanticism]]. The music is mostly based on [[Hindustani classical music]], [[Carnatic Classical Music]], [[Western world|Western]] tunes and the inherent [[Folk music]] of Bengal and inherently possess within them, a near perfect balance, an endearing economy of poetry and musicality.

== History ==
Rabindra Sangeet merges fluidly into Tagore's literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal color of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} Scholars have attempted to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani ''ragas'':

{{quote|the pathos of the ''purabi raga'' reminded Tagore of the evening tears of a lonely widow, while ''kanara'' was the confused realization of a nocturnal wanderer who had lost his way. In ''bhupali'' he seemed to hear a voice in the wind saying 'stop and come hither'.''Paraj'' conveyed to him the deep slumber that overtook one at night's end.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}|2=[[Reba Som]]|3=''Rabindranath Tagore: The Singer and His Song''."{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=38}}}}

Tagore influenced [[sitar]] maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' Buddhadev Dasgupta and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivalling Shakespeare's impact on the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}{{who|date=March 2015}} It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all—big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that "[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs". [[A. H. Fox Strangways]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' introduced non-Bengalis to ''rabindrasangit'' in ''The Music of Hindostan'', calling it a "vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize."{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=359}}

In 1971, ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'' became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written—ironically—to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]] and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

== Songs ==
His songs are affectionately called Rabindra Sangeet, and cover topics from humanism, structuralism, introspection, psychology, romance, yearning, nostalgia, reflection, modernism. Tagore primarily worked with two subjects – first, the human being, the being and the becoming of that human being, and second, Nature, in all her myriad forms and colours, and of the relationship between the human being and Nature and how Nature affects the behavior and the expressions of human beings. ''[[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padavali ]]'' (or ''Bhanusingher Podaboli''), one of Tagore's earliest works in music, was primarily in a language that is similar and yet different from Bengali – this language, [[Brajabuli]], was derived from the language of the [[Vaishnav]] hymns, and of texts like [[Jayadeva]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]'', some influences from [[Sanskrit]] can be found, courtesy Tagore's extensive homeschooling in the [[Puranas]], the [[Upanishads]], as well as in poetic texts like [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Meghadūta]]'' and ''[[Abhigyanam Shakuntalam]]''. Tagore was one of the greatest narrators of all time, and throughout his life, we find a current of narration through all his works that surges with upheavals in the psyche of the people around him, as well as with the changes of seasons. A master of metaphor, it is often difficult to identify the true meaning that underlies his texts, but what is truly great about Tagore, is that his songs are identifiable with any and every possible mood, with every possible situation that is encountered by a person in the course of life. This truly reinforces the notion that Rabindrasangeet has at its heart some unbelievably powerful poetry. The Upanishads influenced his writing throughout his life, and his devotional music is addressed almost always to an inanimate entity, a personal, a private god, whom modernists call the Other.

Rabindranath Tagore was a curator of melodic and compositional styles. In the course of his travels all over the world, he came into contact with the musical narratives of the West, of the South of India, and these styles are reflected in some of his songs. There are several classifications of his work. The ones that beginners most often use is that based on genre – devotional (Puja Porjaay), romantic (Prem Porjaay) [Note: It often becomes difficult, if not impossible, on hearing a song, to determine if it falls in the devotional genre or the romantic. The line between the two is blurred, by certain creations of Tagore himself, e.g. Tomarei Koriyachi Jibonero Dhrubotara. Also, Tagore never made these divisions. Only after his death was the need felt to categorize, compile and thus preserve his work, and the genre-classification system was born out of this need.] seasonal (Prokriti Porjaay) – summer (Grishho), monsoon (Borsha), autumn (Shorot), early winter (Hemonto), winter (Sheet), Spring (Boshonto); diverse (Bichitro), patriotic (Deshatmobodhok). Although Deshatmobodh and patriotism are completely antipodal concepts, yet the difficulties of translation present themselves, apart from songs specified for certain events or occasions (Aanushtthanik) and the songs he composed for his numerous plays and dance-dramas.

== Collections ==
The book forming a collection of all 2,233 songs written by Rabindranath is called ''[[Gitabitan]]''&lt;ref name="DasguptaGuha2013" /&gt; ("Garden of songs")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gitabitan.net/|title=GITABITAN of Rabindranath Tagore - An Encyclopedic Site|last=gitabitan.net|website=www.gitabitan.net|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forms an important part of extant historical materials pertaining to Bengali musical expression. The six major parts of this book are ''Puja'' (worship), ''Prem'' (love), ''Prakriti'' (seasons),  ''Swadesh'' (patriotism), ''Aanushthanik'' (occasion-specific), ''Bichitro'' (miscellaneous) and ''[[Rabindra Nritya Natya|Nrityonatya]]'' (dance dramas and lyrical plays).{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=89-91}}

The ''Swarabitan'', published in 64 volumes, includes the texts of 1,721 songs and their musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Sabyasachi|title=Rabindranath Tagore: an interpretation|date=2011|publisher=Viking, Penguin Books India|location=New Delhi|page=208|isbn=978-0670084555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYpkWGHGkwYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were first published between 1936 and 1955.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Earlier collections, all arranged chronologically, include ''Rabi Chhaya'' (1885), ''Ganer Bahi o Valmiki Pratibha'' (1893), ''Gan'' (1908), and ''Dharmashongit'' (1909).{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=89}}

== Historical influence ==
Rabindra Sangeet has been an integral part of Bengal culture for over a century.&lt;ref name="Magic of Rabindra Sangeet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dasgupta Guha p252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasgupta|Guha|2013|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu monk and Indian social reformer [[Swami Vivekananda]] became an admirer of Rabindra Sangeet in his youth. He composed music in the Rabindra Sangeet style, for example ''Gaganer Thale'' in [[Raga Jaijaivanti]].&lt;ref name="Magic of Rabindra Sangeet" /&gt;

Many of Tagore's songs form the worship hymnal and hymns in many Churches in Kolkata and West Bengal. Some examples are Aaguner Poroshmoni and Aanondoloke Mongolaloke.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-3RNg8dRTY&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''relative age effect''' (RAE), also known as '''birthdate effect''' or '''birth date effect''', is used to describe a bias, evident in the upper echelons of youth sport&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=3720&amp;SearchGroup=research{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/images/109784-birthdate-effects-a-review-of-the-literature-from-1990-on.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps//ceedp93.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participation is higher amongst those born early in the relevant selection period (and correspondingly lower amongst those born late in the selection period) than would be expected from the normalised distribution of live births. The selection period is usually the [[calendar year]], the [[academic year]] or the [[Season (sports)|sporting season]]. The difference in maturity - which can be extreme at young ages: a six-year old born in January is almost 17% older than a six-year old born in December in the same year&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/relative-age-effect-over-long-term|title=Long-term relative age effect: Evidence from Italian football|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; - causes a performance gap that persists over time.

The term '''month of birth bias''' is also used to describe the effect and '''season of birth bias''' is used to describe similar effects driven by different hypothesised mechanisms.

The bias results from the common use of age related systems, for organizing youth sports competition and academic cohorts, based on specific cut-off dates to establish eligibility for inclusion. Typically a child born after the cut-off date is included in a cohort and a child born before the cut-off date is excluded from it.

== In sports ==
The most commonly used cut-off date for youth international sporting competition is 1 January. The [[IOC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Youth_Olympic_Games.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FIFA]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/95/44/82/regulationsfu20wcturkey2013%5fee.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 6 international football confederations ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], [[CONCACAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] and [[UEFA]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/65/31/62/1653162_DOWNLOAD.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all use 1 January as their administrative cut-off date when determining an athlete's eligibility to compete in youth competitions, children born before a specified cut-off date are excluded.

Malcolm Gladwell's book [[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]] and [[SuperFreakonomics]] by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner have popularised the issue in respect of Canadian ice-hockey players, European football players and US Major League baseball players.

The expected distribution of births in any given month across a population correlates closely to the number of days in the month, with February as the shortest month having the fewest births. The first graph shows the distribution of births, by month, for the [[European Union]] over the ten years from 2000 to 2009. There is a slight but clearly perceptible increase in the birth rate in the summer months.

A relative age effect is illustrated in the second graph by the month of birth distribution of over 4,000 youth players involved in the qualifying squads for U17, U19 and U21 tournaments organised by [[UEFA]] in 2010/11.

Research suggests that individuals born closer to the cut-off date are more likely to play professionally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1123/ssj.16.1.54 |title=The Relative Age Effect in Soccer: Cross-Cultural Evidence for a Systematic Discrimination against Children Born Late in the Competition Year |journal=Sociology of Sport Journal |volume=16 |pages=54 |year=1999 |last1=Musch |first1=Jochen |last2=Hay |first2=Roy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dukeorthopaedicjournal.com/mostdownloaded.aspx|title=The Duke Orthopaedic Journal - Jaypee Journals - Jaypee Brother|website=www.dukeorthopaedicjournal.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2011.11.009 |ssrn=1835304 |title=Returns to education in professional football |journal=Economics Letters |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=326–8 |year=2012 |last1=Böheim |first1=René |last2=Lackner |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
Cut-off dates for academic cohort structuring, including the setting of [[Academic term|academic years]], are usually determined by national education authorities and tend to be based on autumn start dates, so August or September cut-off dates are common in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and February or March cut-off dates are common in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. This tendency reflects the historical need for children to be involved in summer-time agricultural work with school starting after harvesting.[[File:Oxford 10 years.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Oxford University RAE profile in aggregate 2004/5 to 2013/14]]A relative age effect in academia is illustrated in the third graph which shows the percent deviation from month of birth profile norms evident in graduations from Oxford University over a 10-year period. Academic relative age effects seem to be moderated by culture.&lt;ref name="RADutch"/&gt;

A 2006 study finds that relative age affects student performance and has long-lasting effects on life outcomes. The authors find that "the youngest members of each cohort score 4–12 percentiles lower than the oldest members in grade four and 2–9 percentiles lower in grade eight… data from Canada and the United States show that the youngest members of each cohort are even less likely to attend university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/qje/121.4.1437 |jstor=25098831 |title=The Persistence of Early Childhood Maturity: International Evidence of Long-Run Age Effects |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=1437–72 |year=2006 |last1=Bedard |first1=K |last2=Dhuey |first2=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study finds that Italian students born in the early months of the year "are more likely to be tracked in more academic schools rather than in vocational schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2014.04.001 |title=The long-lasting effects of school entry age: Evidence from Italian students |journal=Journal of Policy Modeling |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=578–99 |year=2014 |last1=Ponzo |first1=Michela |last2=Scoppa |first2=Vincenzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In leadership positions ==
A relative age effect has also been observed in the context of leadership. Studies have found an over-representation of people born just after the school entry cut-off date in a range of leadership positions. Such an over-representation starts in high-school leadership activities such as sports team captain or club president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2006.08.005 |title=What makes a leader?

== In other spheres ==
Whilst an over-representation of early-born participation is evident in the aspirational fields of elite sport and education there is also evidence of a corresponding disproportionate over-representation of late-born children in [[Epidemiology|epidemiologically]] defined cohorts exhibiting conditions such as [[ADHD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.111619 |pmid=22392937 |pmc=3328520 |title=Influence of relative age on diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=7 |pages=755–62 |year=2012 |last1=Morrow |first1=R.

==Lexicon==
* '''[[wikt:ability grouping|Ability grouping]]''' – cohort selection by ability rather than chronological age.
* '''Corrective Relative Age Adjustments''' – calculated adjustments to competitive outcomes designed to compensate for relative age advantage/disadvantage, for example by the re-calculation of sprint times according to relative age within a cohort.&lt;ref name="Relative Age Effects in Athletic Sprinting and Corrective Adjustments as a Solution for Their Removal"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0122988 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Relative Age Effects in Athletic Sprinting and Corrective Adjustments as a Solution for Their Removal | journal=PLOS One | pages=e0122988 | pmid=25844642 | pmc=4386815 | last1 = Romann | first1 = M | last2 = Cobley | first2 = S| year=2015 | bibcode=2015PLoSO..1022988R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cut-off date''' – an administratively defined date in the calendar which determines the eligibility of individuals to be included in a cohort, usually a competition or an academic year group. A birth date prior to the cut-off date excludes an individual and a birth date after the cut-off date includes an individual.
* '''Multi-age grouping''' – the broadening of cohort selection to encompass multiple chronological age groups. For example, a [[Multi-age classroom]].
* '''Relative Age Advantage''' – a competitive advantage accruing to an individual due to being born early in a selection period. A relative age advantage can also accrue to a group consisting of a majority of relatively older individuals.&lt;ref name="socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca"&gt;http://www.socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca/RelAgeMinorHockeyCJBS.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Relative Age Bias''' – a tendency towards the prioritised selection of relatively older members of a cohort.
* '''Relative Age Characteristic''' (of an individual) – the quality of having been born early or late in the selection period.
* '''Relative Age Competition''' – competition designed to avoid cut-off date rules, such as ‘average team age’ or ‘bio-banded’ competition.
* '''Relative Age Disadvantage''' – a competitive disadvantage accruing to an individual due to being born late in a selection period. A relative age disadvantage can also accrue to a group consisting of a majority of relatively younger individuals.&lt;ref name="socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca"/&gt;
* '''Relative Age Discrimination''' – indirect, systemic discrimination, disadvantaging relatively young individuals in a cohort and advantaging relatively old individuals in the same cohort.
* '''Relative Age Effect''' – an observable '''effect''' resulting from a '''relationship''' between '''chronological age''' and an eligibility '''cut-off date''' used for cohort selection.
* '''Relative Age Environment''' – the system of rules governing inclusion or exclusion from cohorts based on cut-off date eligibility rules.
* '''Relative Age Quota''' – a quota system imposed on a cohort to establish an even distribution of chronological ages.
* '''Relative Age Skew''' – statistically significant differing levels of participation observed amongst relatively older and relatively younger members of a cohort.
* '''Selection Period''' – an administratively or culturally defined timeframe, such as a competition season or an academic year, established by reference to a cut-off date.

'''''Resident Evil 6''''', known in Japan as '''''Biohazard 6''''',{{efn|{{nihongo|''Biohazard 6''|バイオハザード6|Baiohazādo 6|lead=yes}}}} is a [[third-person shooter|third-person shooter game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]]. The ninth main game in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, it was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in October 2012 and for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in March 2013. Players control [[Leon S. Kennedy]], [[Chris Redfield]], Jake Muller, and [[Ada Wong]], who confront the force behind a worldwide bio-terrorist attack; each character has unique abilities and styles.

''Resident Evil 6'' was conceptualized in 2009 and entered full development the following year under ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' producer [[Hiroyuki Kobayashi (producer)|Hiroyuki Kobayashi]]. It had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production.

''Resident Evil 6'' received mixed reviews; some reviewers praised the game's storyline and themes, but the interwoven campaigns and departure from [[survival horror]] received criticism. With over 10 million copies sold, it is the third-bestselling Capcom game. It was rereleased for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] with all [[downloadable content]].

==Plot==

On 24 December 2012, Jake Muller, son of late bio-terrorist [[Albert Wesker]], flees local authorities during a bio-terrorist attack. He partners with Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent and Raccoon City survivor [[Sherry Birkin]] and learns that she is to extract him from the country to create a vaccine for the new C-Virus. However, they are hunted by Ustanak, a hulking bio-weapon. Meanwhile, a Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) strike team led by [[Chris Redfield]] and Piers Nivans is deployed to combat the infected local populace. However, they are attacked by the leader of Neo-Umbrella, who refers to herself as [[Ada Wong]]; she kills most of the BSAA members, using a device that injects them with the C-virus, turning them into monsters, except Chris and Piers. Chris goes into a self-imposed exile, afflicted with [[post-traumatic amnesia]]. Meanwhile, Sherry and Jake's extraction from Edonia by the BSAA is sabotaged, forcing them to crash into the mountains. They are captured by "Ada" for six months.

On 29 June 2013, US President Adam Benford attempts to publicly reveal the truth behind the 1998 Raccoon City incident and the government's dealings with Umbrella, to end further bio-terrorist activity. However, the venue is hit by another attack, infecting the President; the sole survivors, DSO agent and Raccoon City survivor [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and US Secret Service agent Helena Harper, are forced to kill him. The pair encounter the real Ada Wong, and Leon learns that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella and was responsible for the attack. Leon and Helena pursue Simmons into Lanshiang, China, while faking their deaths. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape captivity in Lanshiang.

Chris returns to duty in the BSAA with Piers and a new team, arriving in a besieged Lanshiang. Chris recovers from his amnesia and seeks revenge against Ada, resulting in casualties for his squad. Chris and Piers confront Ada, until Leon intervenes. After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue "Ada" to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry, and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's medical data to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to maintain national security. The two see off a mutated Simmons while Sherry and Jake are captured again. Attempting to leave the city, Leon and Helena are warned by Chris that a missile has been launched, but they are too late to stop it. Leon discloses Jake's real identity to Chris and has him rescue Jake and Sherry in a remote oil platform. With Ada's assistance, Leon and Helena kill Simmons.

On the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, freeing Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon, Haos. Heavily wounded, and in a desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle. He defeats Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation will worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod, using his abilities to destroy the base. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape the facility and kill Ustanak as they ride a rocket-powered lift to the surface.

The imposter Ada was a scientist named Carla Radames, who was forced to transform into Ada by Simmons. The real Ada was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Langshiang. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. After aiding Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons, Ada destroys the lab where her clone was developed, and accepts a new assignment. Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent; and Jake starts a new life fighting zombies in an underdeveloped country with his identity covered up by the BSAA.

The PlayStation 3 version of ''Resident Evil 6'' holds an aggregate score of 74%, PS4 a 60%, Xbox One a 63%, PC a 69%, and the Xbox 360 version a 67% as shown on [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GRX360&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/605604-resident-evil-6/index.html|title=Resident Evil 6 for Xbox 360|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics praised the storyline, themes, graphics, and artificial intelligence. A reviewer from ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated that despite the game did not "hold back"{{Clarify|reason=|date=January 2018}} the decadent experience from being an "unhinged flaming rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref name="informerreview"/&gt; A reviewer from the ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' concluded that the game was an accomplished shooter, and a fittingly "thunderous" send-off for ''Resident Evil'', while also praising the length and variety of the game.&lt;ref name="OXM"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] noted the shift away from the style and tone of past games in the series, yet still praised the overall direction, stating that despite the "old identity stripped away", the game presented itself as a "massive" action game.&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt; Richard George of [[IGN]] was favourable toward the technical and artistic design of the game, stating that the game was among Capcom’s greatest successes with an "incredibly strong" world, lighting, and creature designs. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN also noted the new enemies as "some of the best" designs and concepts in the history of the franchise.&lt;ref name="IGN2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaffrey|first1=Ryan|title=Why I Hate the Resident Evil 6 Demo|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/07/06/opinion-why-i-hate-the-resident-evil-6-demo|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=9 May 2016|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollander Cooper of [[GamesRadar]] praised the improvements to the controls over its predecessor, stating that the game had an emphasis placed on fluidity and movement, although noted that the cover system "never seems to work right".&lt;ref name="radarreview"/&gt; ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' also praised the improved [[AI]] companion that "does a decent job of backing you up and taking the fight to the enemy rather than just standing by", however also disliked the cover system, calling it "the most forgettable new feature of the game".&lt;ref name="escapistreview"/&gt;

The game's four campaigns received criticism from reviewers. Simon Parkin from [[Eurogamer]] was divided over the campaigns, citing Leon's campaign as the strongest and "the closest we get to the series' survival horror roots", along with Ada's as having "diverse flavour". However, Parkin criticised the other two campaigns, stating that Jake's campaign "rarely delights" while citing that Chris' was a "second-rate third-person sprint" with "idiotic" cutscene dialogue.&lt;ref name="euroreview"/&gt; A reviewer from ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' also felt that the campaigns noticeably contrasted in quality more than others.&lt;ref name="edgereview"/&gt; Similarly, Kevin VanOrd from [[GameSpot]] concluded that the game's campaigns were the ultimate test of patience for "even the most dedicated",&lt;ref name="gspotreview"/&gt; while [[Destructoid]] cited ''Resident Evil 6'' as not only a "step back" for the series due to the game's new and unconventional features, but a "step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters".&lt;ref name="dtoidreview"/&gt;

In an interview with the Official PlayStation Blog, ''Resident Evil 6'' executive producer [[Hiroyuki Kobayashi (producer)|Hiroyuki Kobayashi]] responded to fan criticism shortly after release, noting the creative differences with fans. He stated "the fans and us as creators are the two parents [...] and just like real parents, you’re not always going to agree on what is best for raising that child," going on to say, "we want to make sure that what we do pleases them but the initial reaction might not always be positive. We do listen to the fans but we can’t be beholden to them at every turn or I don’t think we’ll ever make progress in terms of the series’ development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/10/02/resident-evil-6-interview-can-capcom-inject-new-life-into-the-undead/|title=Resident Evil 6 Interview: Can Capcom Inject New Life Into the Undead?|publisher=PlayStation|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012|author=Fred Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/capcom-resident-evil-cant-please-everyone-6397591 |title=Capcom: Resident Evil can't please everyone |publisher=GameSpot |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |author=Eddie Makuch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072651/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/capcom-resident-evil-cant-please-everyone-6397591 |archivedate=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Capcom has dubbed the game as a "dramatic horror", several critics instead noted the game's departure from the [[survival horror]] genre compared to previous instalments. Reviewers from GameSpot and GamesRadar noted that the game was no longer considered a survival horror.&lt;ref name="radarreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspotreview"/&gt; Destructoid asserted that Capcom had "abandoned any pretense" of the survival horror genre.&lt;ref name="dtoidreview"/&gt; Many reviewers listed the game's genre simply as a third-person action shooter.&lt;ref name="dtoidreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radarreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="informerreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspotreview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5948171/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review |title=Resident Evil 6: The Kotaku Review |first=Evan |last=Narcisse |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game's release, Capcom's Masachika Kawata considered the possibility of rebooting the franchise back to its "classic horror roots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philipps|first1=Tom|title=Capcom: "there is a possibility" of Resident Evil series reboot|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-31-capcom-there-is-a-possibility-of-resident-evil-series-reboot|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
In May 2012, Capcom announced they expected the game to sell 7 million copies by the end of the 2012 fiscal year,&lt;ref name="AndraStaff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con0zg/capcom_sales_targets/|title=Capcom Shares Sales Targets for Resident Evil 6, Dragon's Dogma, DmC and Lost Planet|publisher=Andriasang|date=11 May 2012|accessdate=11 May 2012|author=Gantayat, Anoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the company lowered their expectations to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ishaan |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/10/31/capcom-2-million-sales-for-monster-hunter-4-re6-drops-to-6-million/ |title=Capcom: 2 Million Sales For Monster Hunter 4; RE6 Drops To 6 Million |publisher=Siliconera |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company.&lt;ref name="ResEv6Sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/10/03/resident-evil-6-ships-4-5-million-copies-worldwide/|title=Resident Evil 6 Ships 4.5 Million Copies Worldwide|publisher=Siliconera|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-11-09-moh-warfighter-sells-300k-in-us-debut-week |title=MOH: Warfighter sells 300k in US debut week &amp;#124; GamesIndustry International |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial projections for the fiscal year as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Matt|title=Capcom slashes profit estimates on weak Resident Evil 6 sales|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-12-19-capcom-slashes-profit-estimates-on-weak-resident-evil-6-sales|website=Gamesindustrybiz|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=9 May 2016|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2012/full/explanation_2012_full_01.pdf|title=Forecast revisions for year ended March 31, 2013 Plan for fiscal year ending March 31, 2014|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.&lt;ref name= "CapcomSales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/31/resident-evil-5-becomes-capcoms-best-seller|title=Resident Evil 5 Becomes Capcom's Best Seller|last1=Karmali|first1=Luke|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=Ziff Davisdate=31 October 2013|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the slow start and mixed reviews, ''Resident Evil 6'' became Capcom's second best-selling title by September 2018, with a lifetime sales of 7.2 million copies worldwide for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="capcomplatinum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html |title=CAPCOM Platinum Titles |publisher=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=20 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208030840/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html |archivedate=8 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Capcom issued in a statement that the game suffered from poor sales due to various development challenges and "inadequate organisational collaboration" across the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=PC PS4 Xbox One Wii U MORE  Reviews News Entertainment Videos  Forums  AA  SIGN IN / JOIN  Search GameSpot Resident Evil 6 suffered due to 'inadequate organizational collaboration'|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-6-suffered-due-to-inadequate-organizational-collaboration/1100-6403653/|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corria|first1=Alexa|title=Resident Evil 6 failed to meet Capcom sales expectations due to development 'challenges,' inadequate marketing|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/8/3967632/resident-evil-6-failed-capcom-sales-expectations-development-challenges|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the PC version of the game sold more than 1.3 million copies on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] as of September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamspy.com/app/221040|title=resident evil 6 / biohazard 6|website=SteamSpy|date=2016-12-31|accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions have sold 1.5 million copies as of November 2018.&lt;ref name="platinum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Platinum Titles |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions combined have sold over 10 million copies.&lt;ref name="platinum"/&gt;

'''Roman art''' refers to the visual arts made in [[Ancient Rome]] and in the territories of the [[Roman Empire]].  Roman art includes [[Roman architecture|architecture]], [[painting]], [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]] and [[Roman mosaic|mosaic work]]. Luxury objects in [[metal-work]], [[engraved gem|gem engraving]], [[ivory carving]]s, and [[Roman glass|glass]] are sometimes considered in modern terms to be minor forms of Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J. M. C. |date=December 1971 |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439–442 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this would not necessarily have been the case for contemporaries.  Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded. The two forms have had very contrasting rates of survival, with a very large body of sculpture surviving from about the 1st century BC onward, though very little from before, but very little painting at all remains, and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. [[Roman coins]] were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

==Introduction==
{{Ancient art history}}
{{double image|right|Menade.jpg|170|Giovane-seduto.JPG|150|'''Left image:''' A Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]] showing a [[Maenad]] in [[History of silk|silk dress]], first century AD&lt;br/&gt;'''Right image:''' A fresco of a young man from the Villa di Arianna, [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD.}}
While the traditional view of the ancient Roman artists is that they often borrowed from, and copied Greek precedents (much of the Greek sculptures known today are in the form of Roman marble copies), more recent analysis has indicated that Roman art is a highly creative [[pastiche]] relying heavily on Greek models but also encompassing [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]], native Italic, and even [[Egyptian art|Egyptian]] visual culture. Stylistic [[eclecticism]] and practical application are the hallmarks of much Roman art.

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Ancient Rome’s most important historian concerning the arts, recorded that nearly all the forms of art&amp;nbsp;– sculpture, landscape, portrait painting, even genre painting&amp;nbsp;– were advanced in Greek times, and in some cases, more advanced than in Rome.  Though very little remains of Greek wall art and portraiture, certainly Greek sculpture and vase painting bears this out. These forms were not likely surpassed by Roman artists in fineness of design or execution.  As another example of the lost "Golden Age", he singled out [[Peiraikos]], "whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few&amp;nbsp;... He painted barbershops and shoemakers’ stalls, donkeys, vegetables, and such, and for that reason came to be called the 'painter of vulgar subjects'; yet these works are altogether delightful, and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest [[paintings]] of many other artists.”&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Ebert-Schifferer, ''Still Life: A History'', Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1998, p. 15, {{ISBN|0-8109-4190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "vulgar" is used here in its original meaning, which means "common".

The Greek antecedents of Roman art were legendary. In the mid-5th century BC, the most famous Greek artists were [[Polygnotos]], noted for his wall murals, and [[Apollodorus (painter)|Apollodoros]], the originator of [[chiaroscuro]]. The development of realistic technique is credited to [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], who according to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] legend, are said to have once competed in a bravura display of their talents, history’s earliest descriptions of [[trompe l’oeil]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In sculpture, [[Skopas]], [[Praxiteles]], [[Phidias]], and [[Lysippos]] were the foremost sculptors. It appears that Roman artists had much Ancient Greek art to copy from, as trade in art was brisk throughout the empire, and much of the Greek artistic heritage found its way into Roman art through books and teaching. Ancient Greek treatises on the arts are known to have existed in Roman times, though are now lost.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 252"&gt;Piper, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Many Roman artists came from Greek colonies and provinces...&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158" /&gt;

[[File:Roman sacrifice Louvre Ma992.jpg|thumb|left| Preparation of an [[animal sacrifice]]; marble, fragment of an architectural [[relief]], first quarter of the 2nd century CE; from Rome, Italy]]
The high number of Roman copies of Greek art also speaks of the esteem Roman artists had for Greek art, and perhaps of its rarer and higher quality.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158"&gt;Janson, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the art forms and methods used by the Romans&amp;nbsp;– such as high and low relief, free-standing sculpture, bronze casting, vase art, [[mosaic]], [[cameo (carving)|cameo]], coin art, fine jewelry and metalwork, funerary sculpture, perspective drawing, [[caricature]], genre and [[portrait painting]], [[landscape painting]], architectural sculpture, and [[trompe l’oeil]] painting&amp;nbsp;– all were developed or refined by Ancient Greek artists.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 248–253&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is the Roman bust, which did not include the shoulders. The traditional head-and-shoulders bust may have been an Etruscan or early Roman form.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 255"&gt;Piper, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually every artistic technique and method used by [[Renaissance]] artists 1,900 years later, had been demonstrated by Ancient Greek artists, with the notable exceptions of oil colors and mathematically accurate perspective.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"&gt;Piper, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greek artists were highly revered in their society, most Roman artists were anonymous and considered tradesmen. There is no recording, as in Ancient Greece, of the great masters of Roman art, and practically no signed works. Where Greeks worshiped the aesthetic qualities of great art, and wrote extensively on artistic theory, Roman art was more decorative and indicative of status and wealth, and apparently not the subject of scholars or philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing in part to the fact that the Roman cities were far larger than the Greek city-states in power and population, and generally less provincial, art in Ancient Rome took on a wider, and sometimes more utilitarian, purpose.  Roman culture assimilated many cultures and was for the most part tolerant of the ways of conquered peoples.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158"/&gt; Roman art was commissioned, displayed, and owned in far greater quantities, and adapted to more uses than in Greek times.  Wealthy Romans were more materialistic; they decorated their walls with art, their home with decorative objects, and themselves with fine jewelry.

In the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350 to 500 CE, wall painting, [[Roman mosaic|mosaic ceiling and floor work]], and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 261"&gt;Piper, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire.  When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under [[Emperor Justinian]] (527–565 CE), who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in the city of [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii Painter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pompeii|Pompeian]] painter with painted statue and framed painting, [[Pompeii]]]]
[[File:Affresco romano - eracle ed onfale - area vesuviana.JPG|thumb|[[Heracles]] and [[Omphale]], Roman fresco [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (45-79 AD), [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], Italy]]
Of the vast body of Roman painting we now have only a very few pockets of survivals, with many documented types not surviving at all, or doing so only from the very end of the period. The best known and most important pocket is the wall paintings from [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and other sites nearby, which show how residents of a wealthy seaside resort decorated their walls in the century or so before the fatal eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 CE. A [[Pompeian Styles|succession of dated styles]] have been defined and analysed by modern art historians beginning with [[August Mau]], showing increasing elaboration and sophistication.

Starting in the 3rd century CE and finishing by about 400 we have a large body of paintings from the [[Catacombs of Rome]], by no means all Christian, showing the later continuation of the domestic decorative tradition in a version adapted - probably not greatly adapted - for use in burial chambers, in what was probably a rather humbler social milieu than the largest houses in Pompeii. Much of [[Nero]]'s palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], survived as grottos and gives us examples which we can be sure represent the very finest quality of wall-painting in its style, and which may well have represented significant innovation in style.  There are a number of other parts of painted rooms surviving from Rome and elsewhere, which somewhat help to fill in the gaps of our knowledge of wall-painting.  From [[Roman Egypt]] there are a large number of what are known as [[Fayum mummy portraits]], bust portraits on wood added to the outside of [[mummy|mummies]] by a Romanized middle class; despite their very distinct local character they are probably broadly representative of Roman style in painted portraits, which are otherwise entirely lost.

Nothing remains of the Greek paintings imported to Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries, or of the painting on wood done in Italy during that period.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 252"/&gt; In sum, the range of samples is confined to only about 200 years out of the about 900 years of Roman history,&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 190"&gt;Janson, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; and of provincial and decorative painting.  Most of this wall painting was done using the secco (“dry”) method, but some [[fresco]] paintings also existed in Roman times.  There is [[Roman mosaic|evidence from mosaics]] and a few inscriptions that some Roman paintings were adaptations or copies of earlier Greek works.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 190"/&gt; However, adding to the confusion is the fact that inscriptions may be recording the names of immigrant Greek artists from Roman times, not from Ancient Greek originals that were copied.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"/&gt;  The Romans entirely lacked a tradition of figurative vase-painting comparable to that of the Ancient Greeks, which the Etruscans had emulated.

===Variety of subjects===
[[File:Zeffiro-e-clori---pompeii.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=1.25|left|''The Wedding of [[Zephyrus]] and [[Chloris]]'' (54–68 AD, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]]) within painted architectural panels from the Casa del Naviglio]]
Roman painting provides a wide variety of themes: animals, still life, scenes from everyday life, portraits, and some mythological subjects. During the Hellenistic period, it evoked the pleasures of the countryside and represented scenes of shepherds, herds, rustic temples, rural mountainous landscapes and country houses.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"/&gt; Erotic scenes are also relatively common. In the late empire, after 200AD, early Christian themes mixed with pagan imagery survive on catacomb walls.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 260"&gt;Piper, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape and vistas===
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 10 20 001.jpg|thumb|[[Boscotrecase]], [[Pompeii]]. Third style]]
The main innovation of Roman painting compared to Greek art was the development of landscapes, in particular incorporating techniques of perspective, though true mathematical perspective developed 1,500 years later. Surface textures, shading, and coloration are well applied but scale and spatial depth was still not rendered accurately. Some landscapes were pure scenes of nature, particularly gardens with flowers and trees, while others were architectural vistas depicting urban buildings. Other landscapes show episodes from mythology, the most famous demonstrating scenes from the ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional view, the art of the ancient East would have known landscape painting only as the backdrop to civil or military narrative scenes.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, defended by [[Franz Wickhoff]], is debatable. It is possible to see evidence of Greek knowledge of landscape portrayal in Plato's ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''  (107b–108b): &lt;blockquote&gt;... and if we look at the portraiture of divine and of human bodies as executed by painters, in respect of the ease or difficulty with which they succeed in imitating their subjects in the opinion of onlookers, we shall notice in the first place that as regards the earth and mountains and rivers and woods and the whole of heaven, with the things that exist and move therein, we are content if a man is able to represent them with even a small degree of likeness&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''  (107b–108b), trans W.R.M. Lamb 1925.

===Still life===
Roman [[still life]] subjects are often placed in illusionist niches or shelves and depict a variety of everyday objects including fruit, live and dead animals, seafood, and shells. Examples of the theme of the glass jar filled with water were skillfully painted and later served as models for the same subject often painted during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraits===

[[File:Fayum-11.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fayum mummy portrait]] of a woman from [[Roman Egypt]] with a ringlet hairstyle. [[Royal Museum of Scotland]].]]

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out&amp;nbsp;... Indolence has destroyed the arts."&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, ''The Portrait in the Renaissance'',  Bollingen Foundation, New York, 1966, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV:2 trans H. Rackham 1952.  Loeb Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was [[panel painting]], i.e. [[tempera]] or [[encaustic painting]] on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the [[Severan Tondo]] from c. 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known [[Fayum mummy portraits]], all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate that similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold glass===
[[File:Galla Placidia (rechts) und ihre Kinder.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[gold glass]] medallion in [[Brescia]] ([[Museo di Santa Giulia]]), most likely [[Alexandria]]n, 3rd century AD&lt;ref name="howells 2015 p7"&gt;Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[http://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council). Accessed 2 October 2016, p. 7: "''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"

"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{further information|List of gold-glass portraits}}
Gold glass, or gold sandwich glass, was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century AD.  There are a very few large designs, including a very fine group of portraits from the 3rd century with added paint, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. They predominantly date from the 4th and 5th centuries. Most are Christian, though there are many pagan and a few Jewish examples. It is likely that they were originally given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25-26,&lt;/ref&gt;  Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture.  As time went on there was an increase in the depiction of saints.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

The earlier group are "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity",&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.7&lt;/ref&gt; and represent the best surviving indications of what high quality Roman portraiture could achieve in paint. The Gennadios medallion in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Late Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local [[dialect]] features.  He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170006564 Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios], Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an [[Early Medieval]] [[crux gemmata]] in [[Brescia]], in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] queen [[Galla Placida]] and her children;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 338-340; Beckwith, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, 611&lt;/ref&gt;  This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the medallion is written in the [[Greeks in Egypt|Alexandrian dialect of Greek]] and hence most likely depicts a family from [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

Oxford, Malden &amp; Carlton: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-2071-5}},  p. 17, Figure 1.3 on p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The medallion has also been compared to other works of contemporaneous Roman-Egyptian artwork, such as the [[Fayum mummy portraits]].&lt;ref name="howells 2015 p7"/&gt; It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using [[Lens (optics)|lenses]].&lt;ref&gt;Sines and Sakellarakis, 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;  The later glasses from the catacombs have a level of portraiture that is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207; Lutraan, 29-45 goes into considerable detail&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genre scenes===
Roman genre scenes generally depict Romans at leisure and include gambling, music and sexual encounters.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some scenes depict gods and goddesses at leisure.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 190"/&gt;

===Triumphal paintings===
[[File:Roman fresco from Boscoreale, 43-30 BCE, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco from the [[Villa Boscoreale]], 43–30 BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Casti Amanti - Banquet.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, [[Pompeii]]]]
From the 3rd century BC, a specific genre known as ''Triumphal Paintings'' appeared, as indicated by Pliny (XXXV, 22).&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%232431&amp;chunk=book online at the Perseus Project]&lt;/ref&gt; These were paintings which showed triumphal entries after military victories, represented episodes from the war, and conquered regions and cities. Summary maps were drawn to highlight key points of the campaign.
[[Josephus]] describes the painting executed on the occasion of [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]]'s [[Destruction of Jerusalem|sack of Jerusalem]]:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;There was also wrought gold and ivory fastened about them all; and many resemblances of the war, and those in several ways, and variety of contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself. For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and ruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of slaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer able to lift up their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon temples was here represented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon their owners: rivers also, after they came out of a large and melancholy desert, ran down, not into a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or for cattle, but through a land still on fire upon every side; for the Jews related that such a thing they had undergone during this war. Now the workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively in the construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done to such as did not see it, as if they had been there really present. On the top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of the city that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Jewish Wars'' VII, 143-152 (Ch 6 Para 5). Trans. William Whiston [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-7.htm Online] accessed 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These paintings have disappeared, but they likely influenced the composition of the historical reliefs carved on military [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], the [[Arch of Titus]], and [[Trajan's Column]].  This evidence underscores the significance of landscape painting, which sometimes tended towards being perspective plans.

[[Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli|Ranuccio]] also describes the oldest painting to be found in Rome, in a tomb on the [[Esquiline Hill]]:

{{quote|It describes a historical scene, on a clear background, painted in four superimposed sections.  Several people are identified, such Marcus Fannius and Marcus Fabius. These are larger than the other figures&amp;nbsp;... In the second zone, to the left, is a city encircled with [[Crenellation|crenellated]] walls, in front of which is a large warrior equipped with an oval buckler and a feathered helmet; near him is a man in a short tunic, armed with a spear...Around these two are smaller soldiers in short tunics, armed with spears...In the lower zone a battle is taking place, where a warrior with oval buckler and a feathered helmet is shown larger than the others, whose weapons allow to assume that these are probably Samnites.}}

This episode is difficult to pinpoint. One of Ranuccio's hypotheses is that it refers to a victory of the consul [[Fabius Maximus Rullianus]] during the second war against [[Samnites]] in 326 BC. The presentation of the figures with sizes proportional to their importance is typically Roman, and finds itself in plebeian reliefs. This painting is in the infancy of triumphal painting, and would have been accomplished by the beginning of the 3rd century BC to decorate the tomb.

==Sculpture==
{{main|Roman sculpture|Roman portraiture}}
[[File:26 colonna traiana da estt 05.jpg|thumb|Section of [[Trajan's Column]], CE 113, with scenes from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]]]
Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]], themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in [[terracotta]], usually lying on top of a [[sarcophagus]] lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding [[Roman Republic]] began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] far east, official and [[Roman patrician|patrician]] sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 58–63; Henig, 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century BC, "most of the sculptors working in Rome" were Greek,&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 24&lt;/ref&gt; often enslaved in conquests such as that of [[Corinth]] (146 BC), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–69; Strong, 36–39, 48; At the trial of [[Verres]], former governor of [[Sicily]], [[Cicero]]'s prosecution details his depredations of art collections at great length.&lt;/ref&gt;

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and [[Roman portraiture|portraiture]] is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of [[Italy|Italic]] style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the [[basilica]]s of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even [[Londinium]] had a near-colossal statue of [[Nero]], though far smaller than the 30 metre high [[Colossus of Nero]] in Rome, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–71&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a successful [[freedman]] (c. 50-20 BC) has a [[frieze]] that is an unusually large example of the "plebeian" style.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66; Strong, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial portraiture was initially Hellenized and highly idealized, as in the [[Blacas Cameo]] and other portraits of [[Augustus]].
[[File:Luk Konstantyna 6DSCF0032.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], 315: [[Hadrian]] lion-hunting (left) and sacrificing (right), above a section of the Constantinian frieze, showing the contrast of styles.]]

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in [[relief]], culminating in the great [[Roman triumphal column]]s with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] (113 CE) and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] (by 193) survive in Rome, where the [[Ara Pacis]] ("Altar of Peace", 13 BC) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined, and the [[Sperlonga sculptures]] it at its most baroque.  Some late Roman public sculptures developed a massive, simplified style that sometimes anticipates Soviet [[socialist realism]].  Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]] (161),&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 73–82;Strong, 48–52, 80–83, 108–117, 128–132, 141–159, 177–182, 197–211&lt;/ref&gt; [[Campana relief]]s were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.

All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver [[Warren Cup]], glass [[Lycurgus Cup]], and large cameos like the [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Gonzaga Cameo]] and the "[[Great Cameo of France]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 6; Strong, 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of [[Ancient Roman pottery|pottery vessels]] and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving through a late 2nd century "baroque" phase,&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 171–176, 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace.  The contrast is famously illustrated in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with [[roundel]]s in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|Four Tetrarchs]]'' (c. 305) from the new capital of [[Constantinople]], now in [[Venice]]. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] found in both monuments the same "stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity&amp;nbsp;– in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 9 (both quotes), more generally his Ch 1; Strong, 250–257, 264–266, 272–280&lt;/ref&gt;

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which [[Christianity]] was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal [[acrolithic]] [[Colossus of Constantine|statue of Constantine]], and the 4th or 5th century [[Colossus of Barletta]].  However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the [[consular diptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 287–291, 305–308, 315–318; Henig, 234–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Roman sculpture is divided into five categories: portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies of ancient Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gazda |first=Elaine K. |year=1995 |month= |title=Roman Sculpture and the Ethos of Emulation: Reconsidering Repetition |journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |volume=97 |issue=Greece in Rome: Influence, Integration, Resistance |pages=121–156 |id=  |accessdate= |quote="According to traditional art-historical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], Roman sculpture is divided into a number of distinct categories--portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies."|doi=10.2307/311303 |publisher=Department of the Classics, Harvard University |jstor=311303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the belief of early archaeologists, many of these sculptures were large [[polychrome]] [[terra-cotta]] images, such as the Apollo of Veii (Villa Givlia, Rome), but the painted surface of many of them has worn away with time.

===Narrative reliefs===
While Greek sculptors traditionally illustrated military exploits through the use of mythological allegory, the Romans used a more documentary style. Roman reliefs of battle scenes, like those on the [[Column of Trajan]], were created for the glorification of Roman might, but also provide first-hand representation of military costumes and military equipment. Trajan's column records the various [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]] conducted by [[Trajan]] in what is modern day [[Romania]]. It is the foremost example of Roman historical relief and one of the great artistic treasures of the ancient world. This unprecedented achievement, over 650 foot of spiraling length, presents not just realistically rendered individuals (over 2,500 of them), but landscapes, animals, ships, and other elements in a continuous visual history&amp;nbsp;– in effect an ancient precursor of a documentary movie. It survived destruction when it was adapted as a base for Christian sculpture.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 256"&gt;Piper, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christian era after 300 AD, the decoration of door panels and sarcophagi continued but full-sized sculpture died out and did not appear to be an important element in early churches.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 261"/&gt;

==Minor arts==
[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|The [[Blacas Cameo]] of [[Augustus]], from his last years or soon after]]
===Pottery and terracottas===
{{main|Ancient Roman pottery|Campana relief}}
The Romans inherited a tradition of art in a wide range of the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative art]]. Most of these flourished most impressively at the luxury level, but large numbers of [[terracotta]] figurines, both religious and secular, continued to be produced cheaply, as well as some larger [[Campana relief]]s in terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman art did not use vase-painting in the way of the ancient Greeks, but vessels in [[Ancient Roman pottery]] were often stylishly decorated in moulded relief.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;  Producers of the millions of small [[oil lamp]]s sold seem to have relied on attractive decoration to beat competitors and every subject of Roman art except landscape and portraiture is found on them in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 200-204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass===
{{main|Roman glass}}
Luxury arts included fancy Roman glass in a great range of techniques, many smaller types of which were probably affordable to a good proportion of the Roman public. This was certainly not the case for the most extravagant types of glass, such as the [[cage cup]]s or ''diatreta'', of which the [[Lycurgus Cup]] in the [[British Museum]] is a near-unique figurative example in glass that changes colour when seen with light passing through it. The Augustan [[Portland Vase]] is the masterpiece of Roman [[cameo glass]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 215-218&lt;/ref&gt; and imitated the style of the large [[engraved gem]]s ([[Blacas Cameo]], [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Great Cameo of France]]) and other [[hardstone carving]]s that were also most popular around this time.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 152-158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosaic===
{{main|Roman mosaic}}
Roman mosaic was a minor art, though often on a very large scale, until the very end of the period, when late-4th-century Christians began to use it for large religious images on walls in their new large churches; in earlier Roman art mosaic was mainly used for floors, curved ceilings, and inside and outside walls that were going to get wet.  The famous copy of a Hellenistic painting in the ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' in Naples was originally placed in a floor in [[Pompeii]]; this is much higher quality work than most Roman mosaic, though very fine panels, often of [[still life]] subjects in small or [[micromosaic]] [[tesserae]] have also survived.  The Romans distinguished between normal ''[[opus tessellatum]]'' with ''tesserae'' mostly over 4&amp;nbsp;mm across, which was laid down on site, and finer ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' for small panels, which is thought to have been produced offsite in a workshop, and brought to the site as a finished panel.  The latter was a Hellenistic genre which is found in Italy between about 100 BC and 100 AD.  Most signed mosaics have Greek names, suggesting the artists remained mostly Greek, though probably often slaves trained up in workshops.  The late 2nd century BC [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]] is a very large example of the popular genre of [[Nilotic landscape]], while the 4th century [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in Rome shows several large figures in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 116-138&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orpheus mosaic]]s, often very large, were another favourite subject for villas, with several ferocious animals tamed by [[Orpheus]]'s playing music. In the transition to Byzantine art, hunting scenes tended to take over large animal scenes.

===Metalwork===
Metalwork was highly developed, and clearly an essential part of the homes of the rich, who dined off silver, while often drinking from glass, and had elaborate cast fittings on their furniture, jewellery, and small figurines.  A number of important [[hoard]]s found in the last 200 years, mostly from the more violent edges of the late empire, have given us a much clearer idea of Roman silver plate.  The [[Mildenhall Treasure]] and [[Hoxne Hoard]] are both from [[East Anglia]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 140-150; jewellery, 158-160&lt;/ref&gt;  There are few survivals of upmarket [[ancient Roman furniture]], but these show refined and elegant design and execution.

===Coins and medals===
[[File:HADRIANUS RIC II 938-789065.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian]], with "RESTITVTORI ACHAIAE" on the reverse, celebrating his spending in [[Achaia (Roman province)|Achaia]] (Greece), and showing the quality of ordinary bronze coins that were used by the mass population, hence the wear on higher areas.]]
Few [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] reach the artistic peaks of the best Greek coins, but they survive in vast numbers and their iconography and inscriptions form a crucial source for the study of Roman history, and the development of imperial iconography, as well as containing many fine examples of portraiture. They penetrated to the rural population of the whole Empire and beyond, with barbarians on the fringes of the Empire making their own copies.  In the Empire medallions in precious metals began to be produced in small editions as imperial gifts, which are similar to coins, though larger and usually finer in execution.  Images in coins initially followed Greek styles, with gods and symbols, but in the death throes of the Republic first [[Pompey]] and then [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on coins, and portraits of the emperor or members of his family became standard on imperial coinage.  The inscriptions were used for propaganda, and in the later Empire the army joined the emperor as the beneficiary.

==Architecture==
{{Main|Roman architecture}}
[[File:Aqueduct of Segovia 08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aqueduct of Segovia]].]]
[[File:Teatro romano de Mérida (2).jpg|thumb|Roman theatre in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]]]]
It was in the area of architecture that Roman art produced its greatest innovations. Because the Roman Empire extended over so great of an area and included so many urbanized areas, Roman engineers developed methods for city building on a grand scale, including the use of [[concrete]].  Massive buildings like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] and the [[Colosseum]] could never have been constructed with previous materials and methods.  Though concrete had been invented a thousand years earlier in the Near East, the Romans extended its use from fortifications to their most impressive buildings and monuments, capitalizing on the material’s strength and low cost.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 160"&gt;Janson, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete core was covered with a plaster, brick, stone, or marble veneer, and decorative polychrome and gold-gilded sculpture was often added to produce a dazzling effect of power and wealth.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 160"/&gt;

Because of these methods, Roman architecture is legendary for the durability of its construction; with many buildings still standing, and some still in use, mostly buildings converted to churches during the Christian era.  Many ruins, however, have been stripped of their marble veneer and are left with their concrete core exposed, thus appearing somewhat reduced in size and grandeur from their original appearance, such as with the Basilica of Constantine.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 165"&gt;Janson, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Republican era, Roman architecture combined Greek and Etruscan elements, and produced innovations such as the round temple and the curved arch.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power grew in the early empire, the first emperors inaugurated wholesale leveling of slums to build grand palaces on the Palatine Hill and nearby areas, which required advances in engineering methods and large scale design.  Roman buildings were then built in the commercial, political, and social grouping known as a forum, that of Julius Caesar being the first and several added later, with the Forum Romanum being the most famous.  The greatest arena in the Roman world, the [[Colosseum]], was completed around 80 AD at the far end of that forum. It held over 50,000 spectators, had retractable fabric coverings for shade, and could stage massive spectacles including huge gladiatorial contests and mock naval battles. This masterpiece of Roman architecture epitomizes Roman engineering efficiency and incorporates all three architectural orders&amp;nbsp;– Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 162"&gt;Janson, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Less celebrated but just as important if not more so for most Roman citizens, was the five-story ''insula'' or city block, the Roman equivalent of an apartment building, which housed tens of thousands of Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the reign of Trajan (98–117 AD.) and Hadrian (117–138 AD) that the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent and that Rome itself was at the peak of its artistic glory&amp;nbsp;– achieved through massive building programs of monuments, meeting houses, gardens, aqueducts, baths, palaces, pavilions, sarcophagi, and temples.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 256"/&gt; The Roman use of the [[arch]], the use of [[concrete]] building methods, the use of the [[dome]] all permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled the building of these public spaces and complexes, including the palaces, [[public baths]] and [[basilicas]] of the "Golden Age" of the empire. Outstanding examples of dome construction include the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. The Pantheon (dedicated to all the planetary gods) is the best preserved temple of ancient times with an intact ceiling featuring an open "eye" in the center. The height of the ceiling exactly equals the interior diameter of the building, creating an enclosure that could contain giant sphere.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 165"/&gt; These grand buildings later served as inspirational models for architects of the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. By the age of Constantine (306-337 AD), the last great building programs in Rome took place, including the erection of the [[Arch of Constantine]] built near the [[Colosseum]], which recycled some stone work from the forum nearby, to produce an eclectic mix of styles.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 260"/&gt;

[[Roman aqueducts]], also based on the arch, were commonplace in the empire and essential transporters of water to large urban areas. Their standing masonry remains are especially impressive, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] (featuring three tiers of arches) and the [[aqueduct of Segovia]], serving as mute testimony to their quality of their design and construction.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 162"/&gt;

[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg eText 17034.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Story of the Three Bears|The Three Bears]]]]

The '''rule of three''' is a [[writing]] principle that suggests that a [[wiktionary:trio|trio]] of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers in execution of the story and engaging the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Use the "Rule of Three" to Create Engaging Content - Copyblogger|url = http://www.copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the mysterious ‘Rule of Three’? {{!}} Copywriters of Distinction|url = http://rule-of-three.co.uk/what-is-the-rule-of-three-copywriting/|website = rule-of-three.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Writing: The power of three|url = http://www.jonathancrossfield.com/blog/2009/06/writing-the-power-of-three.html|website = www.jonathancrossfield.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.

Slogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.toastmasters.org/~/media/258B5612D2D547DBA5C95D1890972E70.ashx|title = Toastmasters, November 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Toastmaster|last = |first = |page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]], and the [[Three Musketeers]]. Similarly, adjectives are often grouped in threes to emphasize an idea.

The [[Latin]] phrase ''"omne trium perfectum"'' (everything that comes in threes is perfect, or, every set of three is complete) conveys the same idea as the rule of three.

== Meaning ==
The rule of three can refer to a collection of three words, phrases, sentences, lines, paragraphs/stanzas, chapters/sections of writing and even whole books.&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Do You Use The Rhetorical "Rule of Three"?|url = https://atcounseltable.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/do-you-use-the-rhetorical-rule-of-three/|website = At Counsel Table|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Alex|last = Craigie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three elements together are known as a '''triad'''.&lt;ref name="sixminutes dlugan"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Use the Rule of Three in Your Speeches|url = http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/rule-of-three-speeches-public-speaking/#more-440|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique may be used not just in prose but [[poetry]], oral storytelling, films and [[advertising]]. In photography, the [[rule of thirds]] produces a similar effect by dividing an image into three vertically and horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rule of Thirds - Digital Photography School|url = http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Isocolon|tricolon]] is a more specific use of the rule of three where three words or phrases are equal in length and grammatical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = One, Two, Three: What Is a Tricolon?|url = http://grammar.about.com/od/rhetoricstyle/a/tricolon3.htm|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hendiatris]] is a figure of speech where three successive words are used to express a single central idea.&lt;ref name="sixminutes dlugan"/&gt; As a slogan or motto, this is known as a '''tripartite motto'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ODLT dictionary definition of Tripartite motto|url = http://www.odlt.org/ballast/tripartite_motto.html|website = www.odlt.org|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Blair|last = Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slogans and catchphrases ==
Many advertising campaigns and public information slogans use the technique to create a catchy, memorable way of displaying information. In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising:

''"The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of success, it is a successful advertisement."''{{Citation needed|date = September 2016}}

Better-known examples include:
* [[Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness]] – Rights outlined in ''[[The Declaration of Independence]]''
* [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Slogan of the French Republic|url = http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/slogan-french-republic.html|accessdate = 2015-06-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512230857/http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/slogan-french-republic.html|archivedate = 2015-05-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; – The slogan of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] predating 1790

==Comedy==
In comedy, it is also called a ''comic triple''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rule of Three and the Comic Triple {{!}} Critique Circle|url = http://www.critiquecircle.com/blog.asp?blogID=132|website = Critique Circle|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third element is often used to create an effect of surprise with an audience, especially if it differs from the first two.&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield" /&gt; For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals—such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead—where the surprise or punchline of the joke comes from the third character.

{{cleanup list|date=August 2012}}
In [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely ''beginning, middle, and end'', from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]. [[Syd Field]] wrote a popular handbook of [[screenwriting]], in which he touted the advantages of [[three-act structure]] over the more traditional [[Act (drama)|five-act structure]] used by [[William Shakespeare]] and many other famous playwrights.

[[File:Franz Jüttner Schneewittchen 4.jpg|thumb|[[Snow White]] receives three visits from her wicked stepmother]]

[[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, Vladimir. ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:
* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.
* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while she is searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).
* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.
* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.
* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.
* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.

==Literature==
* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, "Spirit, I fear you most of all."
* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase "on the other hand" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that "No, there is no other hand."
* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.

==Rhetoric and public speaking==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}

The use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech "Non-Violence and Racial Justice" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: "insult, injustice and exploitation", followed a few lines later by "justice, good will, and brotherhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The "Segregation Now, Segregation Forever" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to "[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to "blood, sweat and tears".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3. The Rule of Three|url = http://www.presentationmagazine.com/presentation-skills-3-the-rule-of-three-7283.htm|website = www.presentationmagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' describes the importance of community, without which life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad "nasty, brutish and short".

The [[Welsh Triads]] and [[Triads of Ireland|Irish Triads]] suggest the use of three's was also a mnemonic device—easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.

==Law==
A common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase "I give, devise and bequeath ..."

Usually (in court) a common example is quoted: "tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = N.D.R.Ct. 6.10 Courtroom Oaths|url = http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/rules/ndroc/rule6.10.htm|website = www.ndcourts.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}

'''Saka guru''', or '''soko guru''' in Javanese, is the four main posts which supported certain Javanese buildings, e.g. the [[pendopo]], the [[Javanese traditional house|house proper]] and the [[List of mosques in Indonesia|mosque]]. The saka guru is the most fundamental element in [[Javanese_culture#Architecture|Javanese architecture]] because it supports the entire roof of the building. Because of its importance, the saka guru is imbued with symbolism and treated with certain rituals. 

==Structure and construction== 
[[File:Masjid Ki Ageng-Sunan Pandanaran - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The saka guru of a Javanese mosque.]]
The saka guru construction is employed in buildings that are constructed with a [[joglo]]-type or tajug-type (pyramidal) roofs. The joglo type roof is only reserved for the house of the nobles, while the tajug-type roof is used to support sacred buildings e.g. mosques or temples. In Javanese architecture, walls are merely boundaries of room and the exterior with no structural purposes. The main structural columns/posts of a Javanese house (the saka guru) supports directly the roof and not the wall. Each of these four main posts sits on top of an ''umpak'', three-dimensional trapezoidal stone which acts as a transition between the post and foundation. Umpak size varies from 20 x 20 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to more than a square meter, depending on the dimension of the posts, which commonly ranges between 12 x 12 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 40 x 40 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Umpak prevents the wooden post from the infiltration of groundwater, and reduces the horizontal forces caused by earthquakes.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}}  

During the construction of the saka guru, the northeast ''umpak'' is the first stone to be placed on site. This ''umpak'' is designed to look like the [[Padma (attribute)|padma flower]], imbuing it with the quality of strength. The next ''umpak'' to be placed is the southeast ''umpak'', followed by northwest, and finally the southwest. The wooden posts are always placed according to the direction of tree growth. After the saka guru is completely erected, in the evening an offering ceremony is held.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}} 

Each wooden post of the saka guru has pens at both ends; the bottom pen fixes the post into the ''umpak''; the top pen (''purus pathok'' (the pile pen)) plugs into the hole of the two main beams. The first beam to be set is the ''pengeret'' (literally "cross beam"), then the second beam ''blandar'' (literally "beam") is set on top of the ''pengeret''. The two beams lock together, receiving compression forces of the saka guru structure.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}} 

Each wooden post of the saka guru also contains a hole at the upper portion, to be filled by the pen of secondary beams. The first beam is known as ''sunduk'' ("skewer") which also contains a pen known as ''purus wedokan'' ("female pen"). The pen ''purus wedokan'' contains a hole which will be locked by a pen of a second beam after it is inserted into the saka guru. The second beam is known as ''kili'' ("anchor"), while its pen is known as ''purus lanang'' ("male pen"). The structural element of ''kili'' and ''sunduk' stabilizes the saka guru structure. The Javanese term for pen is ''purus'' meaning the male sex organ.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}}

Upon the completion of all the plug-in procedure, the saka guru is stable and can support the roof on top of it. Two or three parallel beams join the post at its top. The posts may directly support roof trusses or roof beams. In the case of joglo, the main posts are usually topped by two sets of inward stepped wooden piles, ''[[tumpang sari]]'', and outward stepped piles, ''elar''. The number of steps in a ''tumpang sari'' reveals the status of the owner.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}} 

The ''usur-duduk'' is [[Rafter|hip rafter]] running from an external corner to the ridge that is called traditionally as ''molo''.{{sfn|Tjahjono|2008|pp=206-7}}  

==Symbolism==
Saka guru consists of the word ''saka'' and ''guru''. According to the Javanese text of Kawruh Kalang, the ''guru'' or "teacher" is a title given to the four wooden beams, while ''saka'' or "post" is for the four main posts. Thus the whole configuration is known as ''sakaguru'', or more correctly ''sakaning guru'' or ''saka ingkang nyanggi guru'' (Javanese "the ''saka'' which supports the ''guru'').{{sfn|Prijotomo|2005|p=102}}

In Indonesian language, the term saka guru is used to signifies a fundamental principle. For example, "the Indonesian [[Cooperative]] is the saka guru of the National Economy".

==Other rituals==
The space beneath the saka guru was considered a very important sacred space. In modern day, the area has no specific usage, but traditionally, this area was where incense was burnt once a week to honor the rice goddess [[Dewi Sri|Sri]]. The space below the tumpang sari is also the place where the bride and bridegroom are seated during their marriage ceremony.{{sfn|Tjahjono|1998|p=35}}

'''''Snow White: The Sequel''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Blanche-Neige, la suite'''}}) is a 2007 Belgian/French/British X-rated animated film directed by [[Picha]]. It is based on the fairy tale of [[Snow White]] and intended as a sequel to Disney's classic animated adaptation. However, like all of Picha's cartoons, the film is actually a sex comedy featuring a lot of bawdy jokes and sex scenes.

It wasn't the first pornographic animated adaptation of Snow White. Already in 1973 an 11-minute short cartoon called ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]'' was made in Germany.

==Synopsis==
Prince Charming was supposed to live long and happily with Snow White after kissing her back to life. However the jealous 'good' fairy decides that she and the prince were meant to be, only the start of a whole series of perversions of various fairy tale characters' traditional good nature. The dwarfs (Horny, Grungy, Scumy, Filth, Funky, Spotty and Mental) suddenly become a greedy, blackmailing loan shark syndicate. Sleeping Beauty is now a hypocritical, overly virtuous, selfish Princess. Cinderella's case is more than just a 'rags to riches' story. 
The Prince must figure out how to deal with all of these problems and more to get back to his sweet, innocent, ''uncomplicated'' Snow White.

'''The Old School Emulation Center (TOSEC)''' is a [[retrocomputing]] initiative dedicated to the [[cataloging]] and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of [[software]], [[firmware]] and resources for [[arcade game|arcade machines]], [[microcomputer]]s, [[minicomputer]]s and [[video game console]]s. The goal of the TOSEC project is to maintain a database which describes all software and firmware images for all arcade machines, microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. In addition to this, the project also catalogs other computing and gaming resources such as software and hardware manuals, magazine scans, computing catalogs, comics and videos. The catalogs provide an overview and cryptographic identification of media including [[application software|applications]], firmware, magazine cover disks, device drivers, games, operating systems, magazines, comic books, product box art, and videos of advertisements, training, and TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tosecdev.org/index.php/the-project/what-is-tosec/|title=What is TOSEC?|author=PandMonium|work=TOSEC Project Homepage|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of release 2016-11-11, TOSEC catalogs over 280 unique computing platforms and continues to grow. As of this time the project had identified and cataloged 810,864 different software images and sets, describing a source set of 5.02TB of software and resources.

==Plot==
A panic-stricken little girl wakes up on an aeroplane and finds everybody asleep. She picks a mobile phone up and hears [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] announce "Welcome to the Final Problem".

[[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft Holmes]] is at home where Sherlock and Watson disable his home security to trick him into revealing his sister, [[Eurus Holmes|Eurus]], exists.  At 221b Baker Street, Mycroft explains that Eurus was an era-defining genius on par with [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], with abilities far greater than Sherlock's and Mycroft's, coupled with a total lack of [[empathy]]. Mycroft reveals that their parents sent Eurus to a mental institution after she kidnapped and drowned Sherlock's dog Redbeard, and after she burned their home down. Mycroft withheld this from Sherlock because Eurus had psychologically traumatized him as a child, leading to Sherlock [[Memory suppression|suppressing his memories]] of her. An adult Mycroft then sent her to a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum-security facility]] in the [[North Sea]], Sherrinford, and told their parents that she had died. When Mycroft insists that she is secured, a [[quadcopter]] carrying a motion-activated grenade flies into Sherlock's flat. John, Sherlock, and Mycroft flee as the bomb detonates.

Later, John and Sherlock hijack a [[Fishing vessel|fishing trawler]] to travel to Sherrinford and carry a diversion plan out so that Sherlock can reach Eurus' cell. Mycroft and John corner the prison governor, discovering that he has explicitly disobeyed Mycroft's protocol and has allowed Eurus to interact with prison staff. Using her skill to manipulate everyone she speaks with, Eurus has effectively taken full control of the prison. Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. The guards lock Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell.

Mycroft reveals that five years ago, he granted Eurus five unsupervised minutes with Moriarty as a [[Christmas]] present in exchange for detecting national security threats to Britain. During this time, Moriarty agreed to record video messages for her. In the present day, Eurus leads the captives in a series of psychological ordeals, forcing Sherlock into sinister games to save lives while videos of Moriarty [[Heckler|heckle]] him. Although Eurus forces Sherlock onward with the prospect of saving the girl on the aeroplane, he eventually stops the games by threatening to shoot himself when she orders him to shoot either John or Mycroft. Furious, Eurus uses tranquilliser darts on the three of them.

Sherlock wakes up near his family's old house. He speaks to the girl in the aeroplane to try to guide her in landing safely. John wakes up at the bottom of a well. When he finds human bones there, Sherlock realizes that what he thought was his dog Redbeard was in fact his best friend, Victor Trevor. Eurus threw him into the well and left him for dead because she felt left out of Sherlock's attention as a child. Sherlock then deciphers the real meaning of the song that Eurus originally taunted him with when Victor went missing, which reveals that she wants him to find her. Sherlock deduces that the girl in the plane is actually Eurus's mental metaphor and that the game has been a cry for help. With Eurus' puzzle solved, Sherlock is able to send her back to Sherrinford after rescuing John.

Mycroft explains to his and Sherlock's parents, who are angry that they had been told that Eurus was dead, that she refuses to speak to people anymore. Sherlock frequently visits her and they play the violin together, giving performances for their parents and Mycroft. While helping Sherlock repair his destroyed flat, John receives a video sent by Mary before she died, encouraging him to continue working with Sherlock.

==Broadcast and reception==
{{neutrality section|date=January 2017}}
"The Final Problem" received mixed reviews from critics. Among the more positive reviews was Sean O'Grady of ''[[The Independent]]'' who gave the episode four out of five stars, stating that "[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] and [[Martin Freeman|Tim Freeman]] {{sic}} are their usual accomplished double act" although suggesting "Maybe Sherlock needs a little more reimagining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean O&amp;#039;Grady |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/last-nights-tv-sherlock-the-final-problem-bbc1-a7526171.html |title=Sherlock season 4 episode 3 review: 'The Final Problem' maybe needs reimagining |publisher=The Independent |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the episode five out of five stars, praising that "the dazzling script delivered laughs, excitement, and emotion .. we were left with a wiser Holmes and Watson." He also commented about the possibility of series 4 being the last series for Sherlock, stating "if this was the last-ever episode, which it surely won't be, it worked well as a sign off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Hogan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/sherlock-episode-3-final-problem-review-exhilarating-thrill/ |title=Sherlock episode 3: The Final Problem, review: 'an exhilarating thrill-ride' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa Mellor of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' wrote "this was fun to watch. Fun and ultra-tense with a terrific, whooshing sense of momentum. It went like the clappers, held its breath, went like the clappers again, held its breath some more until you thought you might pass out with the dizziness."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/sherlock/46513/sherlock-series-4-episode-3-review-the-final-problem&lt;/ref&gt; Neela Debnath of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was also positive, writing "I can't fault the thrill ride that The Final Problem takes viewers on from the begin to the end. Sherlock has clawed itself back from the edge."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/754593/Sherlock-The-Final-Problem-review-Moriarty-Andrew-Scott-Benedict-Cumberbatch&lt;/ref&gt; Two separate reviews in ''[[The Observer]]'' or ''[[The Guardian]]'' were positive, with one describing it as too byzantine, but "much better than it looked"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The week in TV: Horizon: Clean Eating – The Dirty Truth; Sherlock; Endeavour; A Series of Unfortunate Events; Antiques Roadshow |first=Euan |last=Ferguson |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 January 2017 |accessdate=30 January 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/horizon-clean-eating-dirty-truth-sherlock-endeavour-series-unfortunate-events-review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other writing "with a visual swagger far beyond the budget – and including an eerily beautiful high-security violin duet for Sherlock and Eurus – this was a fine way to go."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/15/sherlock-finale-trumped-by-russian-leak-online&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some reviews were more critical. A third ''Guardian'' review was negative, stating Holmes had "become a parody of himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heritage|first1=Stuart|title=Sherlock: how the TV phenomenon became an annoying self-parody|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/16/sherlock-how-the-tv-phenomenon-became-an-annoying-parody-of-itself|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=the Guardian|date=16 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaite Welsh of [[IndieWire]] scored the episode a grade of B-, writing "Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss wrap up their 13th episode on an elegiac note, musing on the legend that is Sherlock and Watson. It's just a shame the rest of the episode was such a mess, really".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kaite Welsh |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/sherlock-review-the-final-problem-season-4-episode-4-spoilers-finale-1201769310/ |title=Sherlock Review: ‘The Final Problem’ Is A Problematic Season Finale |publisher=IndieWire |date= |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Hyland of ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' stated that he preferred it "when Holmes and Watson were just solving fairly believable mysteries. If it went back to that I'd welcome another series or two with open arms." He compared the series to the [[BBC]] series ''[[Taboo (2017 TV series)|Taboo]]'', suggesting that the latter would be a better television series for those who love Sherlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=, 16 January 2017Updated10:33, 16 January 2017 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/preferred-sherlock-watson-were-just-9629652 |title=I preferred it when Sherlock and Watson were just solving fairly believable mysteries - Ian Hyland - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aja Romano of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] also criticized the episode, praising the usual drama of Sherlock, but being critical of the fact that the episode "collapses into a muddled mess of melodrama and confusion ... there is even less logic." Romano considered the episode to be an anticlimax, saying "the episode feels like a window dressing on a completely different story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Nathanael |url=https://www.vox.com/2017/1/16/14279588/sherlock-finale-final-problem-review |title=Sherlock season 4, episode 3: "The Final Problem" might be the series finale. If it is, it's a huge disappointment. |publisher=Vox |date= |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Stevens for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ended up awarding the episode zero stars (following his one-star review of [[The Six Thatchers]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4080726/amp/CHRISTOPHER-STEVENS-Sherlock-s-clever-clever-s-stupid.html?client=ms-android-motorola|title=CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: Sherlock's now so clever-clever, it's stupid|last=Driver|first=Ben|date=|website=The Daily Mail|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; highly critical of what was seen as poor writing, describing the "problems" of the episodes as "all so callow, so contrived, so undergraduate" and a proneness to become self-satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Christopher |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4122872/After-enduring-shocking-self-indulgent-hyped-Sherlock-finale-exasperated-TV-critic-asks-BBC-bigwigs-fig-viewers.html |title=Do BBC bigwigs give a fig about Sherlock viewers? &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=19 October 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of representation within the episode were raised by some commentators. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of [[The Daily Dot]] called the episode the "most sexist" of the TV show. She noted that Eurus, a stereotypical female villain, "ticks every box for the kind of madwoman who gets locked up in an asylum in a 19th century melodrama" and commits crimes only motivated "by a desire for male attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavia Baker-Whitelaw |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/sherlock-final-problem-review-eurus-finale/ |title='The Final Problem' is season 4's most entertaining 'Sherlock' episode—and its most sexist |publisher=The Daily Dot |date= |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Smurfs''''' ({{lang-fr|Les Schtroumpfs}}; {{lang-nl|De Smurfen}}) is a Belgian [[comic]] franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in [[mushroom]]-shaped houses in the forest. ''The Smurfs'' was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the [[Belgian comics]] artist [[Peyo]] (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as ''Les Schtroumpfs''. There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as "Jokey Smurf", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. "Smurfette" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear [[Phrygian cap]]s, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.

The word “smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French "schtroumpf", which, according to Peyo, is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist [[André Franquin]] when he could not remember the word salt.&lt;ref name=Franquin/&gt;&lt;ref name="nl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/smurf|title=SMURF (BLAUW STRIPFIGUURTJE)|last=De Coster|first=Marc|date=2007|website=etymologiebank.nl|publisher=Meertens Institute|language=nl|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/peyo.htm|title=Peyo|website=lambiek.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Smurfs'' franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, [[ice capade]]s, video games, theme parks, and dolls.

==Origin==
At the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series titled ''Johan et Pirlouit'' (translated to English as ''[[Johan and Peewit]]''), set in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] and including elements of [[sword-and-sorcery]]. Johan serves as a brave young page to the [[monarch|king]], and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, [[midget]] [[sidekick]]. 
In 1958, ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine started to publish the ''Johan et Pirlouit'' story ''La Flûte à six trous'' ("The Flute with Six Holes").&lt;ref name=BDO-s&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Spirou année 1958|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/annees/1958.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adventure involved them recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a "Schtroumpf", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in ''Spirou'' on October 23, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Smurfs preparing big 50th birthday celebrations |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/art/2008/01/16/139306/Smurfs-preparing.htm  |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[The China Post]] |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in ''Spirou'' in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled ''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (also the title of the [[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute|movie version of the story]]).

With the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting [[PVC]] Smurfs and Smurf merchandise.

===Name===
''Schtroumpf'' is pronounced like the German word "Strumpf" meaning "sock". However, according to Peyo, the original author of the Smurfs comic strip, the term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he had with his colleague and friend [[André Franquin]] at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word "salt", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the ''schtroumpf''. Franquin jokingly replied, "Here's the ''Schtroumpf''—when you are done ''schtroumpfing'', ''schtroumpf'' it back..." and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in "''schtroumpf'' language".&lt;ref name=Franquin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franquin.com/amis/peyo_amis.php |title=Franquin's official Web site |publisher=Franquin.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek" /&gt; The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English.&lt;ref name="nl" /&gt;

Both the comics and cartoons have been translated in many languages. In most cases, the original name "Schtroumpf" is replaced by a new term. The most common are variations on the Dutch translation "Smurf", while other names are indicative of their [[gnome|gnome-like]] appearance.

In Spanish, they are called "Pitufos", a term invented by Miguel Agustí who was the head of the Spanish magazine ''Strong'' which first published the cartoon in Spanish. According to Agustí, he was walking around Barcelona while trying to come up a name for the cartoon. He came across a sculpture of the Ox of [[Patufet]] and was inspired by the word Patufet. From Patufet he derived the non-existent word Pitufo. The name later spread to most Spanish-language versions of the cartoon.

==Smurfs universe==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--many paragraphs without citations--&gt;
===Smurfs===
The storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: [[Smurfette]], Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (three apples high),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110324032830/http://www.smurf.com/smurf.php/www/meet/en SMURF]. smurf.com&lt;/ref&gt; with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a [[Phrygian cap]], and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, "Handy Smurf" wears [[Overall (bib-and-brace)|overalls]] instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]] (a species of ''[[Smilax]]'') leaves, whose berries the Smurfs naturally call "smurfberries" (the smurfberries appear only in the cartoon; in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the sarsaparilla).

The Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: "Lazy Smurf", "Grouchy Smurf", "Brainy Smurf", and so on. All Smurfs, with the exception of Papa, Baby, Smurfette, Nanny and Grandpa, are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 99 Smurfs, but this number increased as new Smurf characters appeared, such as Sassette and Nanny. All of the original Smurfs were male; later female additions are Smurfette and Sassette—Smurfette being Gargamel's creation, while Sassette was created by the Smurflings.

===Language {{anchor|smurf_as_a_word}}===
A characteristic of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word "smurf" and its derivatives in a variety of meanings. The Smurfs frequently replace both [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s in everyday speech with the word "smurf": "We're going ''smurfing'' on the River Smurf today." When used as a verb, the word "Smurf" typically means "to make", "to be", "to like", or "to do".

Humans have found that replacing ordinary words with the term "smurf" at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement "I'm smurfing to the smurf" means "I'm going to the wood", but a Smurf corrects him by saying that the proper statement would be "I'm smurfing to the smurf"; whereas what Peewit said was "I'm warbling to the dawn". So "I'm smurfing to the smurf" is not the same as "I'm smurfing to the smurf".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Sortilège de Maltrochu'' (French for "Maltrochu's Spell"), written and drawn by Peyo, published in 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animated series, only some words (or a portion of the word) are replaced with the word "smurf". Context offers a reliable understanding of this speech pattern, but common vocabulary includes remarking that something is "just smurfy" or in some cases, "smurftastic".

In ''Schtroumpf vert et vert Schtroumpf'' (see ''[[Smurf Versus Smurf]]''), published in Belgium in 1972, it was revealed that the smurf village was divided between North and South, and that the Smurfs on either side had different ideas as to how the term "smurf" should be used: for instance, the Northern Smurfs called a certain object a "bottle smurfer", while the Southern Smurfs called it a "smurf opener". This story is considered a [[parody]] on the still ongoing ''[[taalstrijd]]'' (language war) between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/murray/20071106.html |title=CBC News: Reports from abroad, Nov 2007 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smurf village===
When they first appeared in 1958, the Smurfs lived in a part of the world called "''Le Pays Maudit''" (French for "the Cursed Land"). To reach it required magic or travelling through dense [[forest]]s, deep [[marsh]]es, a scorching [[desert]] and a high [[mountain range]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (published in 1958) and ''Le Pays maudit'' (published in 1961), both written and drawn by Peyo&lt;/ref&gt; The Smurfs themselves use [[stork]]s in order to travel long distances, such as to the kingdom where Johan and Pirlouit live, and keep up-to-date with events in the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (published in 1958), written and drawn by Peyo&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Johan et Pirlouit'' stories, the Smurf village is made up of mushroom-like houses of different shapes and sizes in a desolate and rocky land with just a few trees. However, in the Smurf series itself, the mushroom-like houses are more similar to one another and are located in a clearing in the middle of a deep forest with grass, a river, and vegetation. Humans such as [[Gargamel]] are shown to live nearby, though it is almost impossible for an outsider to find the Smurf village except when led by a Smurf.

===Smurf economy===
The Smurfs' [[commune|community]] generally takes the form of a [[cooperative]], sharing, and kind environment based on the principle that each Smurf has something he or she is good at, and thus contributes it to Smurf society as he or she can. In return, each Smurf appears to be given their necessities of life, from housing and clothes to food without using any [[money]] in exchange.

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of The Smurfs characters}}
Papa Smurf is the leader of the community. Other Smurfs are generally named after their personality disposition, much like [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Disney's Seven Dwarfs]]; for example, Brainy, Greedy, Vanity, Lazy, Clumsy, Hefty, Jokey, Dreamy, Grouchy, or their profession, for example, Poet, Actor, Handy, Harmony, Farmer, Clockwork, Painter, Tailor, Miner, Architect, Reporter, Timber, Barber and Doctor Smurf. The first female Smurf, Smurfette, was created by Gargamel to lure the other Smurfs. Papa Smurf then changed her into what we see today. The non-Smurf characters who would appear later would include their enemies the wizard [[Gargamel]], his cat Azrael, an ugly witch, Hogatha and Gargamel's godfather Balthazar; and their friends the page Johan and his young friend Peewit and the wizard Homnibus. There are 105 Smurfs.

==Smurf comics==
{{Main article|The Smurfs (comics)}}
Since the first appearance of the Smurfs in ''Johan et Pirlouit'' in 1958, 31 Smurf comics volumes have been created, 16 of them by Peyo, the others by his studio. Originally, the Smurf stories appeared in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher [[Dupuis]], many comics were first published in dedicated Smurf magazines, which existed in French, Dutch, German and Turkish. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected into comic books next to the regular series of 30 including a newly released Smurfs comics enitiled ''Les Schtroumpfs de L'ordre'' (''The Order [[Law]] of the Smurfs''). English translations have been published in the U.S. by the graphic novel publisher Papercutz as well as a mini series published by [[Marvel Comics]] in the mid-1980s.

==Other media==

===Motion pictures===
In 1965, a [[black-and-white]] 87-minute [[animated]] [[film]] called ''[[Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs]]'' was released in theatres in Belgium. It consisted of five short cartoons made in the previous years for broadcasting on [[Walloons|Walloon]] TV. German copies and copies with Dutch subtitles are known to exist. The stories were based on existing Smurf stories like ''The Black Smurfs'' and ''The Smurfs and the Egg'', and were created by writer [[Maurice Rosy]] and artist [[Eddy Ryssack]] from the small Dupuis animation studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledoux.be/nl/jeunesjong.htm |title=Koninklijk Belgisch Filmarchief |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=Koninklijk Belgisch Filmarchief |language=Dutch |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070510035306/http://www.ledoux.be/nl/jeunesjong.htm |archivedate = May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, ten animated shorts were created between 1961 and 1967, the first series in black and white and the later ones in colour.

In 1976, ''La Flûte à six schtroumpfs'' (an adaptation of the original "Johan et Pirlouit" story) was released. [[Michel Legrand]] provided the musical score to the film. The film would be released in the United States in 1983 (after the animated series became popular there) in an English language dubbed version titled ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]''. A few more full-length Smurf films were made, most notably ''The Baby Smurf'' and ''Here are the Smurfs'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258438/ IMDb entry for The Baby Smurf], [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258649/ IMDb entry for Here are the Smurfs]&lt;/ref&gt; created from episodes of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon series.

[[Sony Pictures]] has announced plans to begin a [[trilogy]] of [[live-action]]/[[computer-animated]] Smurf films, with the [[The Smurfs (film)|first]] film released on July 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smurfs – Sony Pictures Official Movie Site|url=http://www.smurfhappens.com/|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had been in various stages of development since 2003.&lt;ref name=Time50&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1703303,00.html |title=The Smurfs Are Off to Conquer the World – Again|accessdate=2008-01-15 |author=Leo Cendrowicz |date=January 15, 2008 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]] had acquired film rights from Lafig Belgium.

===Television series===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (TV series)}}
The Smurfs secured their place in North American [[pop culture]] in 1981, when the [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday-morning cartoon]] series ''The Smurfs'', produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in association with SEPP International S.A.R.L, aired on [[NBC]] from September 12, 1981 to December 2, 1989 (reruns until August 25, 1990). The show continued to air on the USA network until 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]] until 2003. ''The Smurfs'' is still broadcast on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] channel throughout the United States. The show became a major success for NBC, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. ''The Smurfs'' was nominated multiple times for [[Daytime Emmy]] awards, and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982–1983.&lt;ref name=Time50/&gt; ''The Smurfs'' television show enjoyed continued success until 1990, when, after nearly a decade of success, NBC cancelled it due to decreasing ratings and plans to extend their ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' [[breakfast television|morning show]] franchise to create a [[Weekend Today|Saturday edition]], although they did not do so until [[1992 in American television|1992]] (two years later). The decreased ratings were the result of the network changing the format of the show, resulting in the final season featuring regular time travel with only a few Smurfs.

In the TV series, many classical masterpieces are used as background music during the episodes, among them [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished Symphony]] (Symphony No. 8 in B minor), [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s [[Pictures at an Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/071097/jfl1.html Montreal Mirror article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030129150440/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/071097/jfl1.html |date=January 29, 2003 }}, [http://www.astrostreasurechest.net/websmurfclub/faq.htm Astro's Treasure Chest website article]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115113055/http://www.astrostreasurechest.net/websmurfclub/faq.htm |date=November 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reruns of the show are played on the Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang.

''The Smurfs'' was named the 97th best animated series by [[IGN]]. It was called "kiddie cocaine" for people growing up during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ign100"&gt;{{cite web |title=97, The Smurfs |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/97.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-01-23 |date=January 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005239/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/97.html |archivedate=January 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DVD releases====
On February 26, 2008, [[Warner Home Video]] released Season 1 Volume 1 on [[DVD]], containing the first 19 episodes. On October 7, 2008, Warner Bros. released Season 1 Volume 2 on DVD, containing the remaining 20 episodes from season 1. Though Warner Bros. has decided to discontinue the season sets and release single-disc volume sets instead, they are reportedly still following the correct order of episodes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Crossovers===
{{main article|Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue}}
Papa Smurf, Hefty Smurf, and Brainy Smurf appeared in the cartoon crossover ''Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue'' along with [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]] (from the [[Looney Tunes]] franchise), [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] (from ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Tigger]], [[Alvin and the Chipmunks (1983 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]], the [[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies|Muppet Babies]] ([[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Piggy]] and [[Gonzo the Great|Gonzo]] respectively), [[Ghostbusters (franchise)#Slimer|Slimer]] (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''), ''[[List of ALF characters#Gordon Shumway|ALF]]'', [[Michelangelo (TMNT)|Michelangelo]] (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''). Smurfette appeared on the promotional poster, but never{{clarify|date=April 2013}} appeared in the actual film.

===Merchandising===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (merchandising)}}
From 1959 until the end of the 1960s, Dupuis produced Smurf figurines. But the best known and most widely available Smurf figurines are those made by [[Schleich]], a German toy company. Most of the Smurf figurines given away as promotional material (e.g. by National Garages in the 1970s and [[McDonald's]] in the 1990s) are also made by Schleich.

New Smurf figures continue to appear; in fact, only in two years since 1969 (1991 and 1998) have no new Smurfs entered the market. Schleich currently produces 8 to 12 new figurines a year. Over 300 million of them have been sold so far.&lt;ref name="Time50"/&gt;

Other Smurf figurines have been created for advertising purposes, e.g. worldwide for McDonald's and [[Kinder Surprise]], or nationally for e.g. [[Albert Heijn]] in the Netherlands, and [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] in Belgium.

Special Smurf comics were often created for advertising campaigns. This started in the 1960s for [[Kwatta (chocolate)|Kwatta]] and [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], and later for companies like [[BP]] in the UK and Australia, or [[Benco]] (a Dutch chocolate drink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/sfigures6/schtroumpfs/benco.htm |title=Benco et les Schtroumpfs at |publisher=Bdoubliees.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These comics were often only part of a larger campaign, e.g. the Benco comics were accompanied by a TV ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ina.fr/pub/alimentation-boisson/video/PUB3213293047/benco-poudre-chocolatee-les-stroumpfs.fr.html ad available at the INA (Institut national de l'audiovisuel) website]. Ina.fr (September 14, 1979). Retrieved on 2013-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Smurf balloon/float/[[Falloon]] (which is half float half balloon) continues to be presented in holiday parades such as [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2008 Parade Lineup |url=http://holidays.consummatecompendium.com/Thanksgiving/2008-Macy's-Thanksgiving-Day-Parade-Lineup.html |website=holidays.consummatecompendium.com |accessdate=March 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130120034214/http://holidays.consummatecompendium.com/2008-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-lineup/ |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smurfs had two cereals in the 1980s made by [[Post Cereals]]: Smurf-Berry Crunch cereal and Smurfs Magic Berries. Both had animated commercials on Saturday morning. Two Smurfs pastas, made by [[Chef Boyardee]] and [[DelVerde]] were made in the 1980s, as well. Also [[Libby's]] &amp; [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] came out with Smurf-A-Getti canned pasta for the American and Canadian market.

The Smurfs had a commercial in the 1980s for the Mexican snack cake company [[Marinela]] Submarinos with a rare version of ''Smurfette (Pitufina)'' dressed in a red dress and her hair done in pigtails.

===Music recordings===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (music)}}
Over the decades, many singles and albums of Smurf music have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. The best known is the single ''[[The Smurf Song]]'' and its accompanying album, created by Dutch musician [[Pierre Kartner]] who sings under the alias Father Abraham, which reached the #1 position in 16 countries. Worldwide, more than 10 million CDs with Smurf music have been sold between 2005 and 2007 alone.&lt;ref name=Time50/&gt;

In 1989, I.M.P.S and R-Tek Music, International created [[Smurfin!: Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Album]], released by Quality Special Products in Canada and The US and Dino Music in Australia. It was also released in parts of Europe. The Album came out on LP, CD and cassette. The LP featured 20 tracks (The Canadian CD and cassette had 16, the American CD had 10). The songs were covers of popular songs like [[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]], [[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]], [[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]] and [[I Think We're Alone Now]], as well as two original songs.

===Smurfs on Ice===
For several years, the Smurfs were the children's act in the [[Ice Capades]] travelling ice show. After they were retired from that function, the Smurf suits from the show were issued to Ice Capades Chalets, the show's subsidiary chain of [[ice rink]]s, lasting until the show was sold to a group of investors led by [[Dorothy Hamill]]. The Chalets were sold to Recreation World. The Smurfette suit in particular had a somewhat different hairstyle from what was portrayed in the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

===Smurfs in theme parks===
{{Main article|The Smurfs merchandising}}
In 1984, the Smurfs began appearing in North American theme parks owned by [[Kings Entertainment Company|Kings Entertainment Corporation]]. Each park featured a Smurf attraction and Smurf walk-around figures. [[Canada's Wonderland]] had an entire Smurf village to walk through, ending with Gargamel's Castle. "[[Phantom Theater#Smurf's Enchanted Voyage (1984–1991)|The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage]]" was located in [[Kings Island]]. [[Kings Dominion]] has "[[Smurf Mountain]]". [[California's Great America]] featured a pint-sized steel coaster, "[[Woodstock's Express (California's Great America)|The Blue Streak]]". [[Carowinds]] had an artificial island that was named Smurf Island that had a Smurf village—including toadstool houses which could be entered. [[Hanna–Barbera Land]] had a Smurf district.

In 1989, in the France region of Lorraine, the Sorépark group opened a complete Smurfpark, named [[Walygator Parc|Big Bang Schtroumpf]]. In 1991, the park was bought by the successful Belgian Walibi Group and renamed Walibi Schtroumpf with new attractions. After the Walibi Group was acquired by [[Six Flags]], the park was named Walibi Lorraine, and all the Smurfs references in the park were removed in 2003.

Comics Station, [[Motiongate Dubai]], [[MAPS Perak|Movie Animation Park Studios]] and [[Island of Dreams (amusement park)|Dream Island]] feature Smurf sections.

===Video games===
{{main article|List of The Smurfs video games}}

In 2010, the Smurfs expanded into the world of apps for Android, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch with the game ''Smurf Village''.

===UNICEF===
In 2005, an advertisement featuring the Smurfs was aired in Belgium in which the Smurf village is annihilated by warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did UNICEF bomb the Smurf Village?|url=http://bluebuddies.com/help/unicef_smurf_bombing.htm|website=bluebuddies.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed as a [[UNICEF]] advertisement, and with the approval of the family of the Smurfs' late creator Peyo, the 25-second episode was shown on the national television after the 9 p.m. timeslot to avoid children having to see it. It was the keystone in a fund-raising campaign by UNICEF's Belgian arm to raise money for the rehabilitation of former [[Military use of children|child soldiers]] in [[Burundi]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]—both former Belgian colonies.

In honour of their 50th anniversary in 2008, the Smurfs began a year-long "Happy Smurfday Euro Tour" in connection with UNICEF. The Smurfs visited fifteen European countries on the day of their 50th "Smurfday" in the form of publicly distributed white figurines. The recipients could decorate and submit them to a competition. The results of this contest were auctioned off and raised a total amount of 124,700 euros for benefit of UNICEF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Charity-auction-of-15-celebrity-Smurfs-on-50th-anniversary/tabid/418/articleID/77210/Default.aspx | title=Charity auction of 15 celebrity Smurfs on 50th anniversary | publisher=[[3news.co.nz]] | agency=Associated Press | date=October 25, 2008 | accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coins===
The 50th anniversary of the Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator [[Peyo]], were celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors' coin: the Belgian 5 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2008 coinage|50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

==Sociological discussion==
In 1998, writer Marc Schmidt wrote a parody article citing the Smurfs as an example of the impact of socialism in continental European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/03/142_30610.html |title=Smurfs: Metaphor for Socialism? |publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Marc|title=Socio-Political Themes in The Smurfs|url=http://www.pop-cultured.net/socio-political-themes-in-the-smurfs/|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Schmidt's essay was scrutinised in a response essay by Kate Krake, who examined the nature of cultural theory built on textual observation and warned against creating false allegories out of texts like The Smurfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krake|first=Kate|title=In Theory – A Response to Socio-Political Themes in The Smurfs |url=http://www.pop-cultured.net/in-theory-a-response-to-socio-political-themes-in-the-smurfs// |publisher=Pop Cultured|accessdate=August 13, 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French sociologist Antoine Buéno described them in a 2011 book as a totalitarian and racist utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/the-smurfs-are-racist-ant_n_870758.html|publisher=Huffington Post |title=The Smurfs Are Racist, Anti-Semites, Antoine Buéno Suggests in 'Le Petit Livre Bleu' |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Peyo head Thierry Culliford, the son of Peyo, dismissed Buéno's accusations as "grotesque and frivolous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2011/sieg-smurf/ |title=Sieg Smurf ! |publisher=forbidden planet international |date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
The '''''Treatise of the Three Impostors''''' ({{lang-la|De Tribus Impostoribus}}) is a book denying all three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]]. Although some versions describe [[Numa Pompilius]], founder of the [[Roman religion|Roman civil religion]], as a fourth impostor, the three "impostors" of the title were [[Jesus]], [[Moses]], and [[Muhammad]]. The existence of such a book, and the attribution of its authorship to various heretics and political enemies, was a running theme from the 11th to the 18th centuries, when hoaxes in Germany and France produced two physical books.

==The myth of the Treatise of the Three Impostors==
* 1239 [[Gregory IX]] ascribes such a work to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].
* c.1250 [[Thomas de Cantimpré]] ascribes such a work to [[Simon of Tournai]] (c. 1130–1201).
* 1643 [[Thomas Browne]] ascribes authorship of such a work to [[Bernardino Ochino]].

Authorship of such a book is also laid at the door of various Jewish and Muslim writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2163&amp;letter=A Averroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''De imposturis religionum''==
''De imposturis religionum'' was an anonymous attack, possibly Jewish or Muslim, on Christianity published in 1598, but dated earlier by G. Bartsch. It became known in the auctioning in 1716 of the library of the Greifswald theologian [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (theologian)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]]. To this text the Jurist [[Johannes Joachim Müller]] (1661–1733) wrote the two missing parts — against Moses and Muhammed — and the finished work appeared 1753 as ''De Tribus Impostoribus''.

==''Traité sur les trois imposteurs''==
The first printing of ''Traité sur les trois imposteurs'' was credited to the printer M. M. Rey, but may have existed in manuscript form for some time before it was published. The first trace we have of it as a manuscript comes from a letter to [[Prosper Marchand]] from his old friend, Fritsch. He reminds Marchand about how another friend, Charles Levier, got the manuscript of the treatise from the library of [[Benjamin Furly]] in 1711. This gives a clue as to the provenance of the manuscript, now all but confirmed, as the work of the Irish satirist and freethinker [[John Toland]] (Seán Ó Tuathaláin 1670–1722).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Even if it is not by Toland, it is certainly from the early eighteenth century and traceable to Marchand's circle that included [[Jean Aymon]] and [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and these may have edited Toland's hoax manuscript. It is unlikely to have been around since the time of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] which was part of the mythology of the manuscript. According to historian [[Silvia Berti]], the book was originally published as ''La Vie et L'Esprit de Spinosa'' (The Life and Spirit of Spinoza), containing both a biography of [[Benedict Spinoza]] and the anti-religious essay, and was later republished under the title ''Traité sur les trois imposteurs''. It is believed the author of the book may have been a young Dutch diplomat called [[Jan Vroesen]].&lt;ref&gt;See Berti's essay in ''Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment'' edited by [[Michael Hunter (historian)|Michael Hunter]] and [[David Wootton]]. Clarendon, 1992. {{ISBN|0-19-822736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document purported to be a text handed down from generation to generation detailing how the three major figures of Biblical religion: [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]] and [[Moses]] were in fact misrepresenting what had happened to them. At the time, this novel approach was used to allow thinkers to conceptualize a world where explanation ruled over mere "mystery", a term used for the miraculous intervention on earth by God. It was useful to both [[Deism|Deists]] and [[Atheism|atheists]] in legitimizing their world view and being a common source of intellectual reference.

The book was republished in Cleveland in 1904 by an anonymous publisher under the pseudonym "Alcofribas Nasier the Later" (using an anagram of François Rabelais, minus the cedilla on the c, which [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] used to publish ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'').

===Answer of Voltaire===
In 1770, the great Enlightenment satirist [[Voltaire]] published a response to the hoax treatise entitled ''[[Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs]]'', which contains one of his best-known quotations, "If God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent Him." This was responded to a century later by [[Mikhail Bakunin]], the anarchist political philosopher and activist, with "If God did exist it would be necessary to abolish him".

[[File:Leighton-Tristan and Isolde-1902.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tristan]] and [[Iseult]] as depicted in ''The End of the Song'' by [[Edmund Leighton]] (1902)]]

'''Tristan and Iseult''' is an influential [[Chivalric romance|romance]] story, retold in numerous sources with as many variations since the 12th century. The story is a [[tragedy]] about the adulterous love between the Cornish knight [[Tristan]] (Tristram) and the Irish princess [[Iseult]] (Isolde, Yseult, etc.). The narrative predates and most likely influenced the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] romance of [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]], and has had a substantial impact on [[art of Europe|Western art]] and [[Western literature|literature]] since it first appeared in the 12th century. While the details of the story differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same.

==Legend==
There are two main traditions of the [[Tristan]] legend. The early tradition comprised the French romances of two poets from the second half of the 12th century, [[Thomas of Britain]] and [[Béroul]]. Later traditions come from the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] (c. 1240), which was markedly different from the earlier tales written by Thomas and Béroul. The Prose ''Tristan'' became the common medieval tale of Tristan and [[Iseult]] that would provide the background for the writings of Sir [[Thomas Malory]], the English author who wrote ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (c. 1469).

The story and character of Tristan vary from poet to poet. Even the spelling of his name varies a great deal, although "Tristan" is the most popular spelling. Most versions of the Tristan story follow the same general outline.

[[File:Rogelio de Egusquiza Tristan und Isolde.jpg|thumb|[[Rogelio de Egusquiza]]'s ''Tristan und Isolde'' (1915)|left]]

After defeating the Irish knight [[Morholt]], Tristan travels to [[Gaelic Ireland|Ireland]] to bring back the fair Iseult for his uncle, King [[Mark of Cornwall]], to marry. Along the way, they ingest a love potion which causes the pair to fall madly in love. In the courtly version, the potion's effects last a lifetime, but, in the common versions, the potion's effects wane after three years. In some versions, they ingest the potion accidentally; in others, the potion's maker instructs Iseult to share it with Mark, but she deliberately gives it to Tristan instead. Although Iseult marries Mark, she and Tristan are forced by the potion to seek one another, as lovers. While the typical noble Arthurian character would be shamed by such an act, the love potion that controls them frees Tristan and Iseult from responsibility. The king's advisors repeatedly endeavour to have the pair tried for adultery, but the couple continually use trickery to preserve their façade of innocence. In Béroul's version, the love potion eventually wears off, and the two lovers are free to make their own choice as to whether to cease their adulterous relationship or to continue.

As with the Arthur-Lancelot-Guinevere love triangle, Tristan, King Mark, and Iseult of Ireland all love each other. Tristan honours, respects, and loves King Mark as his mentor and adopted father; Iseult is grateful that Mark is kind to her; and Mark loves Tristan as his son and Iseult as a wife. But every night, each has horrible dreams about the future. Tristan's uncle eventually learns of the affair and seeks to entrap his nephew and his bride. Also present is the endangerment of a fragile kingdom, the cessation of war between Ireland and [[Cornwall]] ([[Dumnonia]]). Mark acquires what seems proof of their guilt and resolves to punish them: Tristan by hanging and Iseult by burning at the stake, later lodging her in a [[leper colony]]. Tristan escapes on his way to the gallows. He makes a miraculous leap from a chapel and rescues Iseult. The lovers escape into the forest of Morrois and take shelter there until discovered by Mark. They make peace with Mark after Tristan's agreement to return Iseult of Ireland to Mark and leave the country. Tristan then travels to [[Brittany]], where he marries (for her name and her beauty) Iseult of the White Hands, daughter of [[Hoel]] of Brittany and sister of [[Kahedin]].

[[File:Boys King Arthur - N. C. Wyeth - p190.jpg|thumb|A 1922 illustration by [[N. C. Wyeth]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; "King Mark slew the noble knight Sir Tristram as he sat harping before his lady la Belle Isolde."&lt;/small&gt;]]

In the Prose ''Tristan'' and works derived from it, Tristan is mortally wounded by Mark, who treacherously strikes Tristan with a poisoned lance while the latter is playing a harp for Iseult. The poetic versions of the Tristan legend offer a very different account of the hero's death. According to Thomas' version, Tristan was wounded by a poison lance while attempting to rescue a young woman from six knights. Tristan sends his friend Kahedin to find Iseult of Ireland, the only person who can heal him. Tristan tells Kahedin to sail back with white sails if he is bringing Iseult, and black sails if he is not. Iseult agrees to return to Tristan with Kahedin, but Tristan's jealous wife, Iseult of the White Hands, lies to Tristan about the colour of the sails. Tristan dies of grief, thinking that Iseult has betrayed him, and Iseult dies swooning over his corpse. Several versions of the Prose ''Tristan'' include the traditional account of Tristan's death found in the poetic versions. 

In French sources, such as those carefully picked over and then given in English by the well-sourced and best-selling Belloc translation of 1903, it is stated that a thick bramble briar grows out of Tristan's grave, growing so much that it forms a bower and roots itself into Iseult's grave. It goes on that King Mark tries to have the branches cut three separate times, and each time the branches grow back and intertwine. This behaviour of briars would have been very familiar to medieval people who worked on the land. Later tellings sweeten this aspect of the story, by having Tristan's grave grow a briar, but Iseult's grave grow a rose tree, which then intertwine with each other. Further tellings refine this aspect even more, with the two plants being said to have been [[hazel]] and [[honeysuckle]].

A few later stories even record that the lovers had a number of children. In some stories they produced a son and a daughter they named after themselves; these children survived their parents and had adventures of their own. In the romance ''Ysaie the Sad'', the eponymous hero is the son of Tristan and Iseult; he becomes involved with the [[fairy]] king [[Oberon]] and marries a girl named Martha, who bears him a son named Mark.

==Origins of the legend==
===Persian and Western===
There are many theories present about the origins of Tristanian legend, but historians disagree over which is the most accurate. Some scholars suggest that the 11th-century [[Persian Empire|Persian]] story ''[[Vis and Rāmin]]'' must have been the model for the Tristan legend because the similarities are too great to be coincidental.&lt;ref name="Roman"&gt;Stewart Gregory (translator), Thomas of Britain, ''Roman de Tristan'', New York: Garland Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8240-4034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dīn Gurgānī 2008"&gt;Fakhr al-Dīn Gurgānī, and Dick Davis. 2008. Vis &amp; Ramin. Washington, DC: Mage publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for the Persian origin of Tristan and Iseult is very circumstantial&lt;ref&gt;Grimbert, Joan T. 1995. Tristan and Isolde: a casebook. New York: Garland Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; and different theories have been suggested how this Persian story might have reached the West, some suggesting story-telling exchanges during the crusades in Syrian court&lt;ref name="Dīn Gurgānī 2008"/&gt; and through minstrels who had free access to both [[Crusades|Crusader]] and [[Saracen]] camps in the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;Grimbert, Joan T. 1995. Tristan and Isolde: a casebook. p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a "[[Mark of Cornwall#The Drustanus Stone|Drustanus Stone]]" in Cornwall with an inscription referring to ''Drustan'', but not all historians agree that the Drustan referred to is the archetype of Tristan. There are references to ''March ap Meichion'' ("Mark") and ''Trystan'' in the [[Welsh Triads]], in some of the [[gnomic poetry]], ''[[Mabinogion]]'' stories and in the 11th-century [[hagiography]] of [[Illtud]].

A character called Drystan appears as one of [[King Arthur]]'s advisers at the end of ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'', an early 13th-century tale in the Welsh prose collection known as the ''Mabinogion'', and Iseult is listed along with other great men and women of Arthur's court in another, much earlier ''Mabinogion'' tale, ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Gantz (translator), ''Culhwch and Olwen'', from ''The Mabinogion'', Penguin, November 18, 1976. {{ISBN|0-14-044322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogues===
Possible Irish antecedents to the Tristan legend have received much scholarly attention. An ill-fated ''triantán an ghrá'' or love triangle features into a number of Irish works, most notably in the text called ''[[The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne|Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne]]'' or ''The Pursuit of [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne|Diarmuid]] and [[Gráinne]]''. In the story, the aging [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] takes the young princess, Gráinne, to be his wife. At the betrothal ceremony, however, she falls in love with Diarmuid, one of Fionn's most trusted warriors. Gráinne gives a [[sleeping potion]] to all present but him, eventually convincing him to elope with her. The fugitive lovers are then pursued all over Ireland by the [[Fianna]]. Another Irish analogue is ''Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin'', preserved in the 14th-century [[Yellow Book of Lecan]]. In this tale, Cano is an exiled Scottish king who accepts the hospitality of King Marcan of Ui Maile. His young wife, Credd, drugs all present, and then convinces Cano to be her lover. They try to keep a tryst while at Marcan's court, but are frustrated by courtiers. Eventually Credd kills herself and Cano dies of grief. In the Ulster Cycle there is the text ''Clann Uisnigh'' or ''Deirdre of the Sorrows'' in which [[Naoise|Naoise mac Usnech]] falls for Deirdre, who was imprisoned by King [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] due to a prophecy that [[Ulster]] would plunge into civil war due to men fighting for her beauty. Conchobar had pledged to marry Deirdre himself in time to avert war, and takes his revenge on Clann Uisnigh. The death of Naoise and his kin leads many Ulstermen to defect to [[Connacht]], including Conchobar's stepfather and trusted ally [[Fergus mac Róich]], eventually precipitating the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]''.

Some scholars believe [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', as well as the story of [[Ariadne|Ariadne at Naxos]] might have also contributed to the development of the Tristan legend.&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; The sequence in which Tristan and Iseult die and become interwoven trees also parallels Ovid's love story of [[Baucis and Philemon]] in which two lovers are transformed in death into two different trees sprouting from the same trunk. However this also occurs in the saga of Deidre of the Sorrows making the link more tenuous.

===Association with King Arthur===
In its early stages, the tale was probably unrelated to contemporary Arthurian literature,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} but the earliest surviving versions already incorporated references to Arthur and his court. The connection between Tristan and Iseult and the Arthurian legend was expanded over time, and sometime shortly after the completion of the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]] (or the Lancelot-Grail) in the first quarter of the 13th century, two authors created the vast Prose ''Tristan'', which fully establishes Tristan as a [[Knights of the Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]] who even participates in the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]].

==Early medieval Tristan literature==
===Courtly branch===
The earliest representation of what scholars name the "courtly" version of the Tristan legend is in the work of [[Thomas of Britain]], dating from 1173. Only ten fragments of his ''Tristan'' poem, representing six manuscripts, have ever been located: the manuscripts in Turin and Strassburg are now lost, leaving two in [[Oxford]], one in [[Cambridge]] and one in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; In his text, Thomas names another ''[[trouvère]]'' who also sang of Tristan, though no manuscripts of this earlier version have been discovered. There is also a passage telling how Iseult wrote a short [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]] out of grief that sheds light on the development of an unrelated legend concerning the death of a prominent [[troubadour]], as well as the composition of lais by noblewomen of the 12th century.

The next essential text for knowledge of the courtly branch of the Tristan legend is the abridged translation of Thomas made by [[Brother Robert]] at the request of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonson]] of Norway in 1227. King Haakon had wanted to promote [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]]-Norman culture at his court, and so commissioned the translation of several French Arthurian works. The Nordic version presents a complete, direct narrative of the events in Thomas' Tristan, with the telling omission of his numerous interpretive diversions. It is the only complete representative of the courtly branch in its formative period.&lt;ref&gt;P. Schach, ''The Saga of Tristram and Isond'', University of Nebraska Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the work of Brother Robert chronologically is the ''Tristan and Isolt'' of [[Gottfried von Strassburg]], written circa 1211–1215. The poem was Gottfried's only known work, and was left incomplete due to his death with the retelling reaching half-way through the main plot. The poem was later completed by authors such as [[Heinrich von Freiberg]] and [[Ulrich von Türheim]], but with the "common" branch of the legend as the ideal source.&lt;ref name="Gottfried"&gt;Norris J. Lacy ''et al.'' "Gottfried von Strassburg" from ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', New York: Garland, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common branch===
The earliest representation of the "common branch" is [[Béroul]]'s ''Le Roman de Tristan'', the first part of which is generally dated between 1150 and 1170, and the latter part between 1181 and 1190. The branch is so named due to its representation of an earlier non-chivalric, non-courtly, tradition of story-telling, making it more reflective of the Dark Ages than of the refined High Middle Ages. In this respect, they are similar to [[Layamon's Brut|Layamon's ''Brut'']] and the ''[[Perlesvaus]]''. As with Thomas' works, knowledge of Béroul's is limited. There were a few substantial fragments of his works discovered in the 19th century, and the rest was reconstructed from later versions.&lt;ref name="EFTP"&gt;"Early French Tristan Poems", from Norris J. Lacy (editor), ''Arthurian Archives'', Cambridge, England; Rochester, NY: D.S. Brewer, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8240-4034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more substantial illustration of the common branch is the German version by [[Eilhart von Oberge]]. Eilhart's version was popular, but pales in comparison with the later Gottfried.&lt;ref name="Gottfried"/&gt;

===Questions regarding a common source===
The French medievalist [[Joseph Bédier]] thought all the Tristan legends could be traced to a single original poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the "Ur-Tristan", and wrote his still-popular ''Romance of Tristan and Iseult'' as an attempt to reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, Common Branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, Bédier relied heavily on Eilhart, Béroul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. Some scholars still consider Bédier's argument convincing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A new English translation of Bédier's ''Roman de Tristan et Iseut'' (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by [[Hilaire Belloc]], first published in 1913, was republished in 2005.

==Later medieval versions==
===French===
Contemporary with Béroul and Thomas, the famous [[Marie de France]] presents a Tristan episode in one of her [[The Lais of Marie de France|lais]]: "[[Chevrefoil]]". It concerns another of Tristan's clandestine returns to Cornwall in which the banished hero signals his presence to Iseult by means of an inscription on a branch of a [[hazelnut]] tree placed on the road she will travel. The title refers to the symbiosis of the [[honeysuckle]] and hazelnut tree which die when separated, as do Tristan and Iseult: "Ni vous sans moi, ni moi sans vous." ("Neither you without me, nor me without you.") This episode is reminiscent of one in the courtly branch when Tristan uses wood shavings put in a stream as signals to meet in the garden of Mark's palace.

There are also two 12th-century ''Folies Tristan'', [[Old French]] poems identified as the Berne and the [[Folie Tristan d'Oxford|Oxford versions]], which relate Tristan's return to Marc's court under the guise of a madman. Besides their own importance as episodic additions to the Tristan story and masterpieces of narrative structure, these relatively short poems significantly contributed to restoring the missing parts of Béroul's and Thomas' incomplete texts.&lt;ref&gt;Norris J. Lacy (editor) ''Arthurian Archives: Early French Tristan Poems''. Cambridge (England); Rochester, NY : D.S. Brewer, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8240-4034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great ''[[trouvère]]'' [[Chrétien de Troyes]] claims to have written a Tristan story, though no part of it has ever been found. He mentions this in the introduction to [[Cligès]], a romance that many see as a kind of anti-Tristan with a happy ending. Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chretien to write ''Cligès'' – a story with no Celtic antecedent – to make amends.&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Lacy (''et al.''). ''Cliges'' from ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia''. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Béroul and Thomas, the most important development in French Tristaniana is a complex grouping of texts known broadly as the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']]. Extremely popular in the 13th and 14th century, the narratives of these lengthy versions vary in detail from manuscript to manuscript. Modern editions run twelve volumes for the long version, which includes Tristan's participation in the Quest for the Holy Grail, or five volumes for a shorter version without the Grail Quest.&lt;ref&gt;Before any editions of the ''Prose Tristan'' were attempted, scholars were dependent on an extended summary and analysis of all the manuscripts by Eilert Löseth in 1890 (republished in 1974). Of the modern editions, the long version is made up of two editions: Renée L. Curtis, ed. ''Le Roman de Tristan en prose'', vols. 1–3 (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1963–1985) and Philippe Ménard, exec. ed. ''Le Roman de Tristan en Prose'', vols. 1–9 (Geneva: Droz, 1987–1997). Curtis' edition of a simple manuscript (Carpentras 404) covers Tristan's ancestry and the traditional legend up to Tristan's madness. However, the massive amount of manuscripts in existence dissuaded other scholars from attempting what Curtis had done until Ménard hit upon the idea of using multiple teams of scholars to tackle the infamous Vienna 2542 manuscript. His edition follows from Curtis' and ends with Tristan's death and the first signs of Arthur's fall. Richard Trachsler is currently preparing an edition of the "continuation" of the ''Prose Tristan''. The shorter version, which contains no Grail Quest, is published by Joël Blanchard in five volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a great influence on later medieval literature, and inspired parts of the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], the ''[[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Roman de Palamedes]]'', and Thomas Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur''.

===English===
The earliest complete source of the Tristan material in English was ''[[Sir Tristrem]]'', a romance of some 3344 lines written circa 1300. It is preserved in the famous [[Auchinleck manuscript]] at the [[National Library of Scotland]]. The narrative largely follows the courtly tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement can only be described as average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody. Its first editor, Sir [[Walter Scott]], provided a sixty line ending to the story, which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Lupak Kalamazoo (editor). ''Lancelot of the Laik and Sir Tristrem''. Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other medieval handling of the Tristan legend in English is Sir Thomas Malory's ''The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyones'', a shortened "translation" of the French ''Prose Tristan'' in ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Since the [[Winchester Manuscript]] surfaced in 1934, there has been much scholarly debate whether the Tristan narrative, like all the episodes in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', was originally intended to be an independent piece or part of a larger work.

===Nordic===
The popularity of Brother Robert's version spawned a unique parody, ''Saga Af Tristram ok Ísodd'', as well as the poem ''Tristrams kvæði''. In the collection of [[Old Norse]] prose-translations of Marie de France's lais – called ''[[Strengleikar]]'' (Stringed Instruments) – two lais with Arthurian content have been preserved, one of them being the "Chevrefoil", translated as "Geitarlauf".&lt;ref&gt; von Rudolph, Meissner (trans.), ''Die Strengleikar : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der altnordischen Prosalitteratur'' (Halle a.S : M. Niemeyer, 1902) &lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, scholars had found Tristan legends spread across the Nordic world, from Denmark to the [[Faroe Islands]]. These stories, however, diverged greatly from their medieval precursors. In one Danish ballad, for instance, Tristan and Iseult are made brother and sister. Other unlikely innovations occur in two popular Danish [[chapbook]]s of the late 18th-century ''Tristans saga ok Inionu'' and ''En tragoedisk Historie om den ædle og tappre Tistrand'', in which Iseult is made the princess of India. The popularity of these chapbooks inspired Icelandic poets [[Sigurður Breiðfjörð]] and Níels Jónsson to write [[rímur]], long verse narratives, inspired by the Tristan legend.&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Lacy (''et al.''). ''Tristan'' from ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia''. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch===
A 158 line fragment of a Dutch version (ca. 1250) of Thomas of Britain's ''Tristan'' exists. It is being kept in [[Vienna]], [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], Series nova 3968.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

===Welsh===
A short Tristan narrative, perhaps related to the Béroul text, exists in six Welsh manuscripts dating from the late 16th to the mid 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tristan Legend Hill''. Leeds England: Leeds Medieval Studies. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish===
In the first third of the 14th century, the famous [[Arcipreste de Hita]] wrote a version of the Tristan story. ''Carta enviada por Hiseo la Brunda a Tristán''. ''Respuesta de Tristán'' was a unique 15th-century romance written in the form of imaginary letters between the two lovers. Then there was a famous [[Spanish language|Spanish]] reworking of the French Prose Tristan, ''Libro del muy esforzado caballero Don Tristán de Leonís y de sus grandes hechos en armas'' first published in [[Valladolid]] in 1501, then republished in [[Seville]] in 1511, 1520, 1525, 1528, 1533 and 1534; additionally a second part, ''Tristan el Joven'', was created which dealt with Tristan's son, Tristan of Leonis.&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Lacy (''et al.''). "Carta enviada por Hiseo la Brunda Tristan", "Repuesta de Tristan" from ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia''. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech===
A 13th century verse romance exists in [[Czech language|Czech]], based on the German Tristan poems by [[Gottfried von Strassburg]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]] and [[Eilhart von Oberge]]. It is the only known ''verse'' representative of the Tristan story in a [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]].&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Lacy (''et al.'').

The Tristan legend proved very popular in Italy; there were many ''cantari'', or oral poems performed in the public square, either about him, or frequently referencing him:

* ''Cantari di Tristano''
* ''Due Tristani''
* ''Quando Tristano e Lancielotto combattiero al petrone di Merlino''
* ''Ultime imprese e morte Tristano''
* ''Vendetta che fe Messer Lanzelloto de la Morte di Messer Tristano''

There are also four differing versions of the Prose Tristan in medieval Italy, most named after their place of composition or library in which they are currently to be found:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The New Arthurian Encyclopedia |author= N. J. Lacy (''et al.'')|location= New York |publisher= Garland Publishing |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Tavola Ritonda''
* ''Tristano Panciaticchiano''
* ''Tristano Riccardiano''
* ''Tristano Veneto''

===Belarusian===
The Belarusian prose ''Povest o Tryshchane'' represents the furthest eastern advance of the legend, and, composed in the 1560s, is considered by some critics to be the last "medieval" Tristan or Arthurian text period.

Its lineage goes back to the ''Tristano Veneto''. [[Venice]], at that time, controlled large parts of the [[Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Croatia]]n language area, engendering a more active literary and cultural life there than in most of the Balkans during this period. The manuscript of the Povest states that it was translated from a (lost) Serbian intermediary. Scholars assume that the legend must have journeyed from Venice, through its Balkan colonies, finally reaching a last outpost in this Slavic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Byelorussian Tristan |first=Z |last=Kipel |location=New York |publisher=Garland Publishing |year= c. 1988 |ISBN= 0-8240-7598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The Tristan story was very popular in several art media, from [[ivory]] mirror-cases to the 13th-century Sicilian [[Tristan Quilt]]. Many of the manuscripts with literary versions are [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] with miniatures.

==Modern works==
===Literature===
In English, the Tristan story suffered the same fate as the [[Matter of Britain]] generally. After being mostly ignored for about three centuries, there was a [[renaissance]] of original Arthurian literature, mostly narrative verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Tristan material in this revival included [[Alfred Tennyson]]'s ''The Last Tournament'', one of his ''[[Idylls of the King]]''; [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Tristram and Iseult]]''; and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s epic poem ''[[Tristram of Lyonesse]]''. [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse'' is a one-act play which was published in 1923 (the book includes an imaginary drawing of the castle at the period).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Thomas (1923) ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse''. London: Macmillan; two drawings by Hardy reproduced as plates&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutland Boughton]]'s opera ''The Queen of Cornwall'' (1924) was based on Thomas Hardy's play.

After [[World War II]], most Tristan texts were in the form of prose novels or short stories:

* [[Bernard Cornwell]] includes a "historical" interpretation of the legend as a side story in ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'' book ''[[Enemy of God (novel)|Enemy of God]]''. 
* Novelist [[Thomas Berger (US novelist)|Thomas Berger]] retold the story of Tristan and Isolde in his 1978 interpretation of Arthurian legend, ''[[Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel]]''.
* The story is also referenced in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.
* The [[Cornwall|Cornish]] writer [[Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch]] ("Q") started ''Castle Dor'', a retelling of the Tristan and Iseult myth in modern circumstances with an innkeeper in the role of King Mark, his wife as Iseult and a [[Breton people|Breton]] onion-seller as Tristan, the plot set in "Troy", his name for his home town of [[Fowey]]. The book was left unfinished at Quiller-Couch's death and was completed many years later, in 1962, by [[Daphne du Maurier]]. 
* [[Rosalind Miles]] wrote a trilogy about Tristan and Isolde. The first book is called ''The Queen of the Western Isle'', second ''The Maid of the White Hands'' and third ''The Lady of the Sea''.
* [[Nancy McKenzie]] wrote a book ''Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte'' as part of her Arthurian series.
* [[Rosemary Sutcliff]] also wrote two early adult/children's novels based on the story of Tristan and Iseult. The first, ''Tristan and Iseult'', is a retelling of the story for young adults and was first published in 1971. It received the Boston-Globe Horn Book Award in 1972, and was runner-up for the 1972 Carnegie Medal. It is set primarily in Cornwall in the southern peninsula of Britain. The story appears again as a chapter of her later Arthurian novel, ''The Sword and the Circle'' (1981).
* [[Diana L. Paxson]]'s 1988 novel ''The White Raven'' tells the tale of Tristan and Iseult, called in her book "Drustan" and "Esseilte," from the perspective of Iseult's handmaiden Brangien ("Branwen"), who was mentioned in various of the medieval stories.
* In [[Bengali literature]] the story has been depicted by author [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]] in the novel ''Sonali Dukkho''. 
* Joseph Bédier's ''Romance of Tristan and Iseult'' is quoted as a source by [[John Updike]] in the afterword to his novel [[Brazil (novel)|''Brazil'']] about the lovers Tristão and Isabel.
* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[alternate history]] ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]] (who lives longer in the novel's timeline than he did in our history) writes a play called ''Yseult and Tristan'' to compete with his friend [[William Shakespeare]]'s immensely popular ''[[Hamlet]]''. No details of the play are given.

===Music===
[[File:DR 1933 505 Nothilfe Wagner Tristan und Isolde.jpg|thumb|Wagner's opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' celebrated in a 1933 German stamp]]

In 1832, [[Gaetano Donizetti]] references this story in ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' as the character of Adina sings the story to the ensemble, inspiring Nemorino to ask the charlatan Dulcamara for the magic elixir. Composed in 1859, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]] is now considered one of the most influential pieces of music of all time. In his work, Tristan is portrayed as a doomed romantic figure, while [[Isolde]] fulfils Wagner's quintessential feminine rôle as the redeeming woman. 

Twentieth-century composers also used the legend (often with Wagnerian overtones) in their compositions. [[Olivier Messiaen]] built his ''[[Turangalila Symphony]]'' around the story. [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[Tristan (orchestral composition)|Tristan]]'' borrowed freely from the Wagnerian version as well as retellings of the legend.
*The Swiss composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] wrote a chamber opera ''Le vin herbé'' between 1938–1940 after being influenced by Wagner.
*[[Blind Guardian]], a [[power metal]] band from Germany, also has a song inspired by Tristan and Iseult's story, "The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight", from their [[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|''A Night at the Opera'']] album.
*[[Colin Meloy]]'s former band [[Tarkio (band)|Tarkio]] have a song entitled "Tristan and Iseult" from their ''Sea Songs for Landlocked Sailers'' ep.
*[[Patrick Wolf]], English singer and songwriter, has a song about the Tristan and Iseult legend: "Tristan" from his second album ''[[Wind in the Wires]]''.
*Inspired by Thomas Hardy's play ''The Famous Tragedy of The Queen of Cornwall'' the English composer [[Rutland Boughton]] composed the music-drama ''The Queen of Cornwall''. The first performance took place at the Glastonbury Festival in 1924. Already famous for "The Immortal Hour" and "Bethlehem", Boughton's growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the Tristram and Isolde legend. Feeling that Hardy's play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright's permission to import a handful of lyrics from his earlier published poetical works. The result is an altogether impressive and effective work, thought by many to be Boughton's masterpiece in this genre. In 2010 it was recorded on the Dutton Epoch label, in which [[Ronald Corp]] conducts the [[New London Orchestra]], members of the [[The London Chorus|London Chorus]] and with soloists [[Neol Davies|Neal Davies]] (King Mark), Heather Shipp (Queen Iseult), [[Jacques Imbrailo]] (Sir Tristam) and [[Joan Rodgers]] (Iseult of Brittany).

===Films===
The story has also been adapted into film many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Films named ''Tristan and Isolde'' |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Tristan%20and%20Isolde;s=tt }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* The earliest is probably the 1909 French film ''Tristan et Yseult'', an early, silent version of the story.&lt;ref name="Harty"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin J. |last=Harty |title=Arthurian Film from the Camelot Project at the University of Rochester |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/acpbibs/harty.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another French film of the same name two years later, which offered a unique addition to the story. Here, it is Tristan's jealous slave Rosen who tricks the lovers into drinking the love potion, then denounces them to Mark. Mark has pity on the two lovers, but they commit double suicide anyway.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt; A third silent French version appeared in 1920, and follows the legend fairly closely.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt;

* One of the most celebrated and controversial Tristan films was 1943's ''[[L'Éternel Retour]]'' (''The Eternal Return''), directed by [[Jean Delannoy]] (screenplay by [[Jean Cocteau]]). It is a contemporary retelling of the story with a man named Patrice in the Tristan role fetching a wife for his friend Marke. However, an evil dwarf tricks them into drinking a love potion, and the familiar plot ensues.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt; The film was made in France during the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], and elements in the movie reflect [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology, with the beautiful, blonde hero and heroine off-set by the [[Untermensch]] dwarf. The dwarf is given a larger role than in most interpretations of the legend; its conniving rains havoc on the lovers, much like the Jews of Nazi stereotypes.
* This was followed by the [[avant-garde]] French film ''Tristan et Iseult'' in 1972 and the Irish ''Lovespell'', featuring [[Nicholas Clay]] as Tristan and [[Kate Mulgrew]] as Iseult; coincidentally, Clay went on to play Lancelot in [[John Boorman]]'s epic ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt;
* The 1970 Spanish film ''Tristana'' is only tangentially related to the Tristan story. The Tristan role is assumed by the female character Tristana, who is forced to care for her aging uncle, Don Lope, though she wishes to marry Horacio.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt;
* The popular German film ''[[Fire and Sword]]'' premiered in 1981. It was very accurate to the story, though it cut the Iseult of Brittany subplot.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt;
* French director [[François Truffaut]] adapted the subject to modern times for his 1981 film ''[[La Femme d'à côté]]'' (''The Woman Next Door''), while 1988's ''[[In the Shadow of the Raven]]'' transported the characters to medieval Iceland. Here, Trausti and Isolde are warriors from rival tribes who come into conflict when Trausti kills the leader of Isolde's tribe, but a local bishop makes peace and arranges their marriage.&lt;ref name="Harty" /&gt;
* [[Bollywood]] director [[Subhash Ghai]] transfers the story to modern India and the United States in his 1997 musical ''[[Pardes (film)|Pardes]]''. The [[Indian American]] Kishorilal ([[Amrish Puri]]) raises his orphaned nephew Arjun ([[Shahrukh Khan]]). Eventually, Pardes sends Arjun back to India to lure the beautiful Ganga ([[Mahima Chaudhary]]) as a bride for his selfish, shallow son Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). Arjun falls for Ganga, and struggles to remain loyal to his cousin and beloved uncle. The film features the Bollywood hit "I Love My India".
* The 2002 French animated film ''Tristan et Iseut'' is a bowdlerized version of the traditional tale aimed at a family audience.
* The most recent Tristan film is 2006's ''[[Tristan &amp; Isolde (film)|Tristan &amp; Isolde]]'', produced by [[Tony Scott]] and [[Ridley Scott]], written by Dean Georgaris, directed by [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]], and starring [[James Franco]] and [[Sophia Myles]]. In this version, Tristan is a Cornish warrior who was raised by Lord Marke after his parents were killed at a young age. In a fight with the Irish, Tristan defeats Morholt, the Irish King's second, but is poisoned in the process. The poison dulls all his senses and his companions believe him dead. He is sent off in a boat meant to cremate a dead body. Isolde, dismayed over her unwilling betrothal to Morholt, leaves her home and finds Tristan on the Irish coast. She tells Tristan that she is called Bragnae, which is the name of her maidservant. Isolde takes care of him and hides him from her father. They spend long days together and come to care for each other. Eventually they confess their feelings for one another and consummate their love. Tristan's boat is discovered and Isolde's father begins a search for a Cornish warrior in Ireland. Isolde helps Tristan escape but cannot leave with him. Tristan returns to England and learns of a tournament between the Cornish tribes for the hand of the Irish princess named Isolde. He agrees to participate to win the princess as Marke's wife. After winning the tournament and discovering that the princess is the woman who had rescued him, Tristan is devastated but decides to bury his feelings, because her marriage to Marke would end decades of bloodshed. Eventually Tristan cannot stand to be apart from Isolde any longer and they start their adulterous relationship. Later, they are found out but Marke frees them after hearing their story. Tristan, however, returns to defend Marke against a rebellion. He dies a hero, with Isolde at his side.

The '''US-Soviet Space Bridge''' was a series of experimental, international [[Broadcasting|telecasts]] between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United States|U.S.]] viewers, performed by group of communication enthusiasts during the late [[Cold War]] era. Translated from the Russian word ''telemost'' (literally, "TV bridge"), a space bridge was a public interactive television link between two or more geographically separate and culturally distinct locations, a form of public [[Videoconferencing|videoconference]].

The first space bridge was an arrangement between the Unison Corporation and [[Gosteleradio]] of the USSR for the [[US Festival]], sponsored by computer pioneer [[Steve Wozniak]]. On [[US Festival|September 5th, 1982]], a TV-link was established for the first time between the Soviet Union and the United States. On the Soviet side  [[Joseph Goldin]] and Yulii Gusman were in charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://ria.ru/interview/20071029/85788741.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in that space bridge could see each other, ask questions and receive answers and could also hold a musical dialogue.  The programs of the subsequent space bridges consisted not only of music-hall turns and greetings but also discussions on different subjects, in which prominent scientists, public figures, cosmonauts and journalists took part. [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Vladimir Posner|Vladimir Pozner]] hosted the meeting between the US and the USSR respectively. According to Pozner's book, ''[[Parting With Illusions]]'', many US TV companies did not want to purchase those space bridges. Thus only eight million people in the US watched the programs, versus 180 million in the USSR.

'''''Wordplay''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Patrick Creadon]].  It features [[Will Shortz]], the editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'' [[crossword puzzle]], crossword constructor [[Merl Reagle]], and many other noted crossword solvers and constructors.  The second half of the movie is set at the 2005 [[American Crossword Puzzle Tournament]] (ACPT), where the top solvers compete for a prize of $4000. Wordplay was the best reviewed documentary film of 2006, according to Rottentomatoes.com  

The movie focuses on the following crossword solvers:
*Ellen Ripstein: [[Editing|editor]] living in [[New York City]] and 2001 ACPT champion. She is also known for her [[Baton (twirling)|baton twirling]].
*[[Trip Payne]]: professional puzzlemaker living in [[South Florida]] and three-time ACPT Champion. He held the record as the youngest champion after winning the tournament in 1993 at the age of 24.
*[[Tyler Hinman]]: student at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]]. At the 2005 ACPT, he challenged Trip Payne for the title of youngest champion ever.
*[[Jon Delfin]]: [[pianist]] living in New York City and seven-time ACPT champion.
*Al Sanders: project manager at [[Hewlett-Packard]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He is a frequent finalist at the ACPT.

The movie contains appearances by many celebrity fans of the ''Times'' puzzle, including [[Bill Clinton]], [[Bob Dole]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Mike Mussina]], [[Daniel Okrent]], and the [[Indigo Girls]].

A 2008 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]", is based on the film.  [[James L. Brooks]] got the inspiration for the episode after watching ''Wordplay''.  "We felt both Will and Merl were very compelling, off-the-beaten-track personalities [in ''Wordplay''], who would fit into our universe very well," Brooks said.  The episode was written by [[Tim Long]], and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]], and guest starred crossword puzzle creators [[Merl Reagle]] and [[Will Shortz]] as themselves.

''Wordplay'' features a theme song, "Every Word," written and performed by [[Gary Louris]] of [[Jayhawks (band)|The Jayhawks]]. The Wordplay DVD features a music video of "Every Word."

The '''Züschen tomb''' ({{lang-de|Steinkammergrab von Züschen}}, sometimes also ''Lohne-Züschen'') is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near [[Fritzlar]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. Classified as a [[gallery grave]] or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (''hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in [[Central Europe]]. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]]. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric [[rock art]] elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at [[Warburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

== Discovery and excavation ==
The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of [[sandstone]] blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a [[basalt]] outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the [[Chatti]], a local [[Iron Age]] tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the [[antiquarian]] Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], still in 1894, by [[Johannes Boehlau]], former director of the State Museum at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Story of discovery from Boehlau &amp; von Gilsa 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of [[Marburg]].&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"&gt;Kappel 1990, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb architecture ==
The rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 3; Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

A terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5&amp;nbsp;m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called ''Seelenloch'' (German for "soul hole"), of 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some [[ritual]], perhaps an [[Sacrifice|offering]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"/&gt; Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in [[France]], is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial [[tumulus]]. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human remains ==
The earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an [[Urnfield]] period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grave offerings ==
Most finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related [[Lohra (megalithic tomb)|Lohra tomb]] and collared bottles connected with the northern [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture]]. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called ''Giant Urn'' belongs to the later burial.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373; Kappel 1990, 6; W.

[[File:Züschen tomb2.JPG|thumb|300px|Carvings inside the tomb.]]
One of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373-5, Kappel 1990, 6-7; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-9&lt;/ref&gt; Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent ([[Bronze Age|Bronze]] or [[Iron Age]]) carvings at [[Valcamonica]] near [[Capo di Ponte]], [[Northern Italy]] and at [[Mont Bégo]] in the [[France|French]] part of the [[Ligurian Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;I. 1978: ''Steinkammergräber und Menhire in Nordhessen.'', ed.

==Reconstruction==
A reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (''Hessisches Landesmuseum'') in [[Kassel]].

==Relationships with other sites==
Like any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150&amp;nbsp;m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent [[basalt]] dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4&amp;nbsp;km to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 375-7&lt;/ref&gt;
