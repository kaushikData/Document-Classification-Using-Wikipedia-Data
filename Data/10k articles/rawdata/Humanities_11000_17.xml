[[File:MII.png|thumb|180px|A copy of the second Medicean manuscript of ''Annals'', [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|Book 15, chapter 44]]]]
The '''''Annals''''' ({{lang-la|Annales}}) by Roman historian and senator [[Tacitus]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.html |title=The Annals ''(109 A.C.E.)''|authors= Tacitus &amp; [[Alfred John Church|Church, Alfred John]] &amp; Brodribb, William Jackson |}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a history of the [[Roman Empire]] from the reign of [[Tiberius]] to that of [[Nero]], the years AD 14–68.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; The ''Annals'' are an important source for modern understanding of the history of the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD;&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt; it is Tacitus' final work, and modern historians generally consider it his greatest writing.&lt;ref name=Woodmanx /&gt; Historian [[Ronald Mellor (historian)|Ronald Mellor]] calls it "Tacitus's crowning achievement,” which represents the "pinnacle of Roman historical writing".&lt;ref name=Mellor23&gt;{{cite book|title=Tacitus' Annals|author=Mellor, Ronald |date=2010 |isbn=0-19-515192-5 |publisher=Oxford University press|location=Oxford| page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus'  ''Histories'' and ''Annals'' together amounted to 30 books; although some scholars disagree about which work to assign some books to, traditionally 14 are assigned to ''Histories'' and 16 to ''Annals''. Of the 30 books referred to by [[Jerome]] about half have survived.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt;

Modern scholars believe that as a [[Roman senator]], Tacitus had access to ''[[Acta Senatus]]''—the Roman senate's records—which provided a solid basis for his work.&lt;ref name=Woodmanx /&gt; Although Tacitus refers to part of his work as "my annals", the title of the work ''Annals'' used today was not assigned by Tacitus himself, but derives from its year-by-year structure.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt; The name of the current manuscript seems to be "Books of History from the Death of the Divine Augustus" (''{{lang|la|Ab Excessu divi Augusti Historiarum Libri}}'').

==Background and structure==
[[File:Karl von Piloty Nero Róma égését szemléli.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The ''[[Fire of Rome]]'', July 64, during the reign of [[Nero]], by [[Karl von Piloty]], 1861.]]
The ''Annals'' was Tacitus' final work and provides a key source for modern understanding of the history of the [[Roman Empire]] from the beginning of the reign of [[Tiberius]] in AD 14 to the end of the reign of [[Nero]], in AD 68.&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt; Tacitus wrote the ''Annals'' in at least 16 books, but books 7–10 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing.&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt;

The period covered by the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' (written before the ''Annals'') starts at the beginning of the year AD 69, i.e. six months after the death of [[Nero]] and continues to the death of [[Domitian]] in 96.&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt; It is not known when Tacitus began writing the Annals, but he was well into writing it by AD 116.&lt;ref name=Yardley &gt;''The Annals: The Reigns of Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero'' by Cornelius Tacitus and J. C. Yardley {{ISBN|0-19-282421-X}} Oxford pages ii to xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars believe that as a senator, Tacitus had access to ''[[Acta Senatus]]'', the Roman senate's records, thus providing a solid basis for his work.&lt;ref name=Woodmanx /&gt;

Together the ''Histories'' and the ''Annals'' amounted to 30 books.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; These thirty books are referred to by [[Saint Jerome]], and about half of them have survived.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; Although some scholars differ on how to assign the books to each work, traditionally fourteen are assigned to ''Histories'' and sixteen to the ''Annals''.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; Tacitus' friend Pliny referred to "your histories" when writing to him about his earlier work.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; Although Tacitus refers to part of his work as "my annals", the title of the work ''Annals'' used today was not assigned by Tacitus himself, but derives from its year-by-year structure.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt;

Of the sixteen books in ''Annals'', the reign of Tiberius takes up six books, of which only Book 5 is missing. These books are neatly divided into two sets of three, corresponding to the change in the nature of the political climate during the period.&lt;ref name=Martin104 /&gt; 

The next six books are devoted to the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. Books 7 through 10 are missing.  Books 11 &amp; 12 cover the period from the treachery of [[Messalina]] to the end of Claudius' reign.

The final four books cover the reign of [[Nero]] and Book 16 cuts off in the middle of the year AD 66.&lt;ref name=Martin104 &gt;''Tacitus and the Writing of History'' by Ronald H. Martin 1981 {{ISBN|0-520-04427-4}} pages&amp;nbsp;104–105&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves the material that would have covered the final two years of Nero's reign lost.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt;

==Content and style==

Tacitus documented a Roman imperial system of government that originated with the [[Battle of Actium]] in September 31 BC. Yet Tacitus chose not to start then, but with the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in AD 14, and his succession by [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref name=Woodmanx &gt;''The annals'' by Cornelius Tacitus, Anthony John Woodman 2004 {{ISBN|0-87220-558-4}} pages x to xx&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', Tacitus maintains his thesis of the necessity of the [[principate]]. He says again that Augustus gave and warranted peace to the state after years of civil war, but on the other hand he shows us the dark side of life under the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]]. The history of the beginning of the principate is also the history of the end of the political freedom that the senatorial aristocracy, which Tacitus viewed as morally decadent, corrupt, and servile towards the emperor, had enjoyed during the republic. During Nero's reign there had been a widespread diffusion of literary works in favor of this suicidal ''exitus illustrium virorum'' ("end of the illustrious men"). Again, as in his ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus is opposed to those who chose useless martyrdom through vain suicides.

In the ''Annals'', Tacitus further improved the style of portraiture that he had used so well in the ''Historiae''. Perhaps the best portrait is that of Tiberius, portrayed in an indirect way, painted progressively during the course of a narrative, with observations and commentary along the way filling in details.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; Tacitus portrays both Tiberius and Nero as tyrants who caused fear in their subjects.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt; But while he views Tiberius as someone who had once been a great man, Tacitus considers Nero as simply despicable.&lt;ref name=Yardley /&gt;

==Provenance and authenticity==
[[File:Milkau Das Kloster von Corvey 178-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Corvey Abbey]], where Annals 1–6 were discovered.&lt;ref name=Conte/&gt;]]

Since the 18th century at least five attempts have been made to challenge the authenticity of the ''Annals'' as having been written by someone other than Tacitus, [[Voltaire]]'s criticism being perhaps the first.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence W. Mendell, ''Tacitus: The Man And His Work'' (Yale University Press/Oxford University Press, 1957) page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire was generally critical of Tacitus and said that Tacitus did not comply with the standards for providing a historical background to civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Classical Foundations of Modern Historiography'' by Arnaldo Momigliano and Riccardo Di Donanto {{ISBN|0-520-07870-5}} Univ California Press 1992 page 127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 John Wilson Ross and in 1890 Polydore Hochart suggested that the whole of the ''Annals'' had been forged by the Italian scholar [[Poggio Bracciolini]] (1380–1459).&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Ross, ''Tacitus and Bracciolini: The Annals Forged In The XVth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-4068-4051-3}}. Originally published London: Diprose and Bateman, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polydore Hochart 1890, ''De L'Authenticité Des Annales Et Des Histoires de Tacite'' republished by Bibliobazar, 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-22125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= VVorst42/&gt; According to [[Robert Van Voorst]] this was an "extreme hypothesis" which never gained a following among modern scholars.&lt;ref name= VVorst42&gt;[[Robert Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' 2000 {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[provenance]] of the manuscripts containing the ''Annals'' goes back to the [[Renaissance]]. While Bracciolini had discovered three minor works at [[Hersfeld Abbey]] in Germany in 1425, [[Zanobi da Strada]] (who died in 1361) had probably earlier discovered Annals 11–16 at Monte Cassino where he lived for some time.&lt;ref name=Conte&gt;''Latin Literature: A History'' by Gian Biagio Conte, Don P. Fowler, Glen W. Most and Joseph Solodow (Nov 4, 1999) {{ISBN|0-8018-6253-1}} Johns Hopkins University Press page 543&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K1174 /&gt; The copies of Annals at Monte Cassino were probably moved to [[Florence]] by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (1313–1375), a friend of da Strada, who is also credited with their discovery at Monte Cassino.&lt;ref name=K1174&gt;''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' by Christopher Kleinhenz (Nov 2003) {{ISBN|0-415-93931-3}} page 1174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton327&gt;''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'' by Francis Newton (29 Apr 1999) {{ISBN|0-521-58395-0}} Cambridge University Press page 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Fortunes of Apuleius'' by Julia Haig Gaisser (Jan 3, 2008) {{ISBN|0-691-13136-8}} Princeton University Press pages&amp;nbsp;93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether the Monte Cassino manuscripts were moved to Florence by Boccaccio or da Strada, Boccaccio made use of the Annals when he wrote ''Commento di Dante'' c. 1374 (before the birth of Poggio Bracciolini), giving an account of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s death directly based on the Tacitean account in [[Wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15|Annals book 15]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Deaths of Seneca'' by James Ker {{ISBN|0-19-538703-1}} Oxford University Press 2009 page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy'' by Giovanni Boccaccio, Michael Papio 2009 {{ISBN|0-8020-9975-0}} University of Toronto Press page 233, also see [http://www.iperteca.it/download.php?id=442 PDF file]&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Newton states that it is likely that Annals 11–16 were in [[Monte Cassino]] during the first half of the rule of Abbot Desiderius (1058–1087) who later became [[Pope Victor III]].&lt;ref name=Newton104&gt;''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'' by Francis Newton (29 Apr 1999) {{ISBN|0-521-58395-0}} Cambridge University Press pages&amp;nbsp;104–105&lt;/ref&gt; Annals 1–6 were then independently discovered at [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany in 1508 and were first published in Rome in 1515.&lt;ref name=Conte/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In [[Donna Leon]]'s third Commissario Brunetti novel, ''[[Donna Leon#List of Commissario Brunetti novels|Dressed for Death]]'' (1994), the protagonist reads Tacitus' ''Annals'' in his spare time in the evenings, and various references to that material are made throughout the novel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5800">[[File:vossius.jpg|thumb|right| A later contribution by [[Gerardus Vossius]]]]

'''''Ars Historica''''' was a genre of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[historiography]] in the later [[Renaissance]]. It produced a small library of treatises underscoring the stylistic aspects of writing history as a work of art, but also introducing the contributions of [[philology]] and [[textual criticism]] in its precepts and evaluations.

==Background==

At the summit of his ''[[ars oratoria]]'' [[Cicero]] had celebrated history as the ''[[magistra vitae]]''. In his ''[[De Oratore]]'' he proposed history as the summit of ''[[ars rhetorica]]'', the rhetorical culture in which eloquence is at the service of the truth of  human experience. 

Within the context of the rhetorical culture of humanism, the ''ars historica'' was an attempt to introduce critical and scholarly criteria into historical literature. Its significance was great during the period of  confessional struggle between Protestants and Catholics in the later sixteenth century. In addition to the examples of the classical historians ([[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]), the contemporary works of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Guicciardini]] enhanced the prestige of historical writing. Two further Greek writers were classical sources for the ''ars historica'': [[Lucian of Samosata]] and [[Dionysius of  Halicarnassus]].

==Sixteenth century== 

The attempt to raise history to the status of a classical ''ars'' derived impetus from the mid-century critical renewal brought about by the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Ars Poetica]]'' of [[Aristotle]]. The text of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' was an inspiration in Italy, renewing the critical discourse about literature.  [[Francis Robortello]], known as the father of [[hermeneutics]] and an Aristotelian exponent, also wrote the first treatise ''De arte historica'' in 1548.

[[Francesco  Patrizi]] wrote ten dialogues on history in 1560.  In 1566 [[Jean Bodin]] published his ''Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem'', a seminal work. Using the critical apparatus of humanist historiography  Bodin reviews and evaluates the classical and contemporary  bibliography of historical writing. The idea of method was also a leading systematic concept of the era, expanding  the scope of the classical ''ars''.&lt;ref&gt;Neal W. Gilbert,(1960) ''Renaissance Concepts of Method'', New York, Columbia UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin's ''Methodus'' reflects the search for new historical principles based on intellectual reform of textual criticism. Such an attempt speaks for the elevation of history as a pre-scientific organizing principle for the contemporary encyclopedia and its bibliography.

[[File:perna printer's device 1558.pdf|thumb|right|Perna printer's device &amp; motto: ''Verbum tuum lucerna pedibus meis'']]

The vogue of the genre was international, stretching beyond the Italy of Robortello, Patrizi and their followers and the France of Bodin to the [[Basel]] humanists ([[Simon Grynaeus]] and [[Theodor Zwinger]]. Further it reached  Protestant historians such [[David Chytraeus]], Flanders ([[Francois Baudouin]]), Spain ([[Sebastian Fox Morcillo]]) and as far as England ([[Thomas Blundeville]]). In Basel [[Pietro Perna]] distinguished himself as a promoter of a new cultural and religious model rooted in [[Erasmian]] critical standards in religion and medicine but also in historical scholarship. As a historical printer he is best known for his illustrated editions of [[Paolo Giovio]], but also for editions of standard and contemporary works, including Protestant chronicles and histories. Perna  brought together all the major authors and works of the ''ars historica '' in two compilations. The ''Methodus  historica '' (1576) featured Bodin followed by another dozen titles. The ''[[Artis Historicae Penus]]'' (1579) adds another five titles for a total of 18 works.

Subsequently, Perna's work served the Jesuit [[Antonio Possevino]] for his critique of Bodin [1592] and as the target and textual source for his ''[[Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam]]'' (1597). It plagiarizes Bodin, but also updates his bibliography ([[Justus Lipsius|Lipsius]], [[Caesar Baronius|Baronio]], [[Carolus Sigonius]], [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]) and censures works on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.

==Seventeenth century== 

In the century that followed, interest in the rhetoric of the genre continued, though its intellectual content was exhausted. The literary focus of [[Agostino Mascardi]]'s ''Dell’arte historica '' reflects the intellectual demotion of the ''[[magistra vitae]]'' concepts with the advent of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and scientific [[rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Cotroneo (1971) ''I trattatisti dell'Ars Historica'', Naples, Giannini. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerardus Vossius]] published a work in 1623 by this title that had subsequent editions, including the one pictured above from 1653. [[Degory Wheare]]'s Oxford contribution, ''De ratione et methodo legendi historias'', also appeared in 1623.

''Asian fetish'' is a [[slang]] expression derived from [[sexual fetishism]], which in medical terms is a sexual [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] on a nonliving object or nongenital body part.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Fetishistic Disorder, 302.81 (F65.0)| editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 700}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word ''fetish'' is used in common discourse with a much broader scope than its psychiatric definition, including a preference for objects or activities in non-sexual contexts.&lt;ref name="scorolli"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scorolli, C., Ghirlanda, S., Enquist, M., Zattoni, S., &amp; Jannini, E.

An Asian fetish is distinct from an interracial partnership. Interracial relationships may occur for reasons distinct from race. Asian fetishes have been criticised for treating the fetishized person as an object rather than an equal partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/12/asian-woman-fetishes-hurtful/|title=5 Ways 'Asian Woman Fetishes' Put Asian Women in Serious Danger|last=Kuo|first=Rachel|date=December 25, 2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Asiaphile''' is sometimes used to describe the same phenomenon, as is "yellow fever" for East Asians (not to be confused with the disease [[yellow fever]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title='Yellow fever' fetish: Why do so many white men want to date a Chinese woman?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10935508/Yellow-fever-fetish-Why-do-so-many-white-men-want-to-date-a-Chinese-woman.html|newspaper=Telegraph|location=London|date=1 Jul 2014|author=Yuan Ren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicky"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vicky|last=Nam|title=YELL-oh Girls!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbknNviHHPEC|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-095944-4 |year=2001|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phoebe"&gt;{{cite book|first=Phoebe|last=Eng|year=2000|title=Warrior Lessons: An Asian American Woman's Journey into Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsPk-4yj3hgC|chapter=Lesson Five: She Takes Back Desire|pages=115–42|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-00957-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
A Western fetish for Asian things developed out of a European tradition of fascination with the East, and a history of [[othering]] the inhabitants of those regions. Middle Eastern women were fetishised during the 17th and 18th centuries, and after the [[First Opium War]] in the 1840s and the opening of the Chinese [[treaty ports]] to foreign merchants, East Asia became the focus of Western interest. Western powers, including the United States, established a presence in the port cities of China, Japan and Korea and made substantial profits from the lucrative trade routes. One result of this was a developing appetite amongst the Western middle class for Asian goods and art. Some of this art, such as postcards and fans, featured sexualized depictions of [[geisha]]s, portrayed as petite, heavily made-up and richly dressed women. The prominence of this provocative geisha image on trade goods fostered, in the eyes of Western men, the idea of the geisha and East Asian women as decorative, sexual objects. The 1887 novel ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (novel)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'' by [[Pierre Loti]] and [[Puccini]]'s 1904 opera ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' served to popularise the image of the submissive and doll-like East Asian woman, while [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] promoted the sexualised Asian [[femme fatale]] in the form portrayed by [[Anna May Wong]] as [[Fu Manchu]]’s daughter. The image of the sexualized Asian woman in the United States was further solidified by the presence of the U.S. military in Asia during the Second World War, the Korean War, and the Vietnam war. Brothels formed in towns surrounding U.S. military bases, their primary clientele being U.S. soldiers. American men who may not have had preconceived notions about Asian women were drafted and sent to fight in Asia where they saw Asian women working in the sex industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Patricia|date=Fall 2014|title=The Madame Butterfly Effect|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/the-madame-butterfly-effect-asian-fetish-history-pop-culture|journal=Bitch Magazine: Feminist Response to Pop Culture|volume=no. 64|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known stereotype of Asian women is that they are subservient, passive and quiet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Maggie|date=1 April 2006|title=Made in the USA: Rewriting Images of the Asian Fetish|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=uhf_2006|journal=Undergraduate Humanities Forum 2005-6: Word &amp; Image|volume=6|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history in the Western world, the image of an Asian women was "geisha-like", meaning overly sexual but silent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Asian women are seen giving suggestive gazes but remaining quiet while seducing the man. This image persists today, along with the idea of Asian women being exotic and submissive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Asian women are often referred to as a '[[Stereotypes of East Asians#"China doll" stereotype|china doll]]', meaning they are dainty and beautiful, but also meaning they have no feelings and are able to be controlled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In movies, television and media, this stereotypical representation of Asian women is of them being seen as objects rather than humans. Continuous exhibition of such in mainstream media has led to the idea of the "Asian fetish".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Terminology and usage ==
In the afterword to the 1988 play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', the writer [[David Henry Hwang]], using the term "yellow fever", a pun on the [[Yellow fever|disease of the same name]], discusses white men with a "fetish" for (east) Asian women.  The term "yellow fever" describes someone who is inflicted with a disease, meaning that someone with an Asian fetish has a sickness. Hwang argues that this phenomenon is caused by [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|stereotyping of Asians in Western society]].&lt;ref name=Hwang&gt;{{cite book|first=David Henry|last=Hwang|year=1988|title=M. Butterfly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vubuCQXYJSoC|chapter=Afterward|page=98|publisher=Plume Books|location=New York|isbn=0-452-26466-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''yellow fever'' is analogous to the term ''jungle fever'', an offensive slang expression used for [[racial fetishism]] associated with white women whose sexual interests focus on black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Guardian|title='As a black woman I'm always fetishised': racism in the bedroom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/black-woman-always-fetishised-racism-in-bedroom|date=13 Jan 2018|author= Afua Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names used for those with an Asian fetish are rice kings, rice chasers and rice lovers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[gay slang|slang]] term used for a gay man, usually white, who exclusively dates men of Asian descent is "[[Queen (slang)|rice queen]]".&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202084912/http://www.glaad.org/poc/api/embracing_diversity.php |archivedate=2 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |url=http://www.glaad.org/poc/api/embracing_diversity.php |title=Embracing Diversity? - Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders Discuss Racism in the LGBT Community |last=Bohling |first=James |work=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayres|first=Tony|year=1999|title=China doll - the experience of being a gay Chinese Australian|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v36n03_05|doi=10.1300/J082v36n03_05|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=36|issue=3-4|pages=87-97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study on racial preferences in dating ==

In a two-year study on dating preferences among 400 [[Columbia University]] students, researchers did not find evidence of a general preference among white men for Asian women. Furthermore, the study found that there is a significantly higher pairing of white men with East Asian women because East Asian women discriminate against black and Hispanic/Latino men. The study took data from "thousands of decisions made by more than 400 daters from Columbia University's various graduate and professional schools".&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2007/11/an_economist_goes_to_a_bar.single.html|title=An Economist Goes to a Bar - And Solves the Mystery of Dating|first=Ray|last=Fisman|date=7 November 2007|work=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Asian fetish places a psychological burden on Asian women, who are forced to cope with constant doubt and suspicion that men who find them attractive have an Asian fetish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Robin|date=2016|title=Why Yellow Fever Isn't Flattering: A Case against Racial Fetishes|doi=10.1017/apa.2016.25|journal=Journal of the American Philosophical Association|volume= 2|issue=3|pages=400–419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian American women report both in popular media such as blogs, and in social scientific literature, that they are often uncertain whether people are only interested in them for their race.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The doubt that targets of Asian fetish experience stems from feelings of depersonalization, which compound on the objectification Asian females already face as women, to create a further sort of objectification where Asian women feel like interchangeable objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fetishized body of the Asian woman becomes a symbol of other people’s desires; she is not valued for what she is, but what she has come to represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=SanSan|date=Winter 2002|title=Scratching the Lotus Blossom Itch|url=http://tessera.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/tessera/article/view/25260/23454|journal=Tessera|volume= 31|pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial depersonalization can be especially hurtful to Asian women in situations where being recognized as an individual is important, such as romantic relationships, because a person may feel unloved if they sense they could be replaced by someone with similar qualities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another effect of Asian fetish is that it causes its targets to feel like an Other, because they are isolated and held to different standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Asian American women report being complimented in ways that imply they are attractive because they are Asian or despite being Asian. Because of Asian fetish, an Asian woman’s racial difference is either seen as a failure to conform to mainstream white standards of beauty, or as something that can be appreciated only on an alternative scale.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can cause insecurity, and affect a woman’s self-worth and self-respect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Men with an Asian fetish are also affected by the stigma that accompanies the term.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These men are viewed as inferior, and it is assumed that they date Asian women because they are unable to date White women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This logic holds that Asian women are lesser than White woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The stereotype that the Asian fetish perpetuates, about the sexual superiority of Asian women, reduces Asian women to objects that are only valuable for sex and not as complete human beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[NPR]] correspondent [[Elise Hu]] offers that this can be a source of insecurity in Asian women's dating lives, "Am I just loved because I'm part of an ethnic group that's assumed to be subservient, or do I have actual value as an individual, or is it both?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chow, Kat|author2=Hu, Elise|title=Odds Favor White Men, Asian Women On Dating App|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/30/247530095/are-you-interested-dating-odds-favor-white-men-asian-women|website=NPR|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hu|first1=Nian|title=Yellow Fever: The Problem With Fetishizing Asian Women|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/column/femme-fatale/article/2016/2/4/yellow-fever-fetishization/|website=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=3 June 2016|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other direction, it has been argued that the notion of an Asian fetish creates the unnecessary perception of multiracial relationships as being characterized by "patriarchal, racist power structures" in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Vivienne|title=So, He Likes You Because You’re Asian|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vivienne-chen/asian-fetish_b_1626467.html|website=Huffpost Women|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Agness Kaku believes the mainstream white culture undermines efforts to combat sexual harassment based on Asian fetish. Noting how frequently women of Asian descent are subjected to verbal and online harassment, Kaku argues that Asian fetish "thrives on double standards that make light of racial bias against Asians" and states this downplaying leaves women vulnerable to stalking and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kaku, Agness|title=Death by Fever|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/death-fever-agness-kaku|website=LinkedIn|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20% of married Asian American women and 7% of married Asian American men have a non-Asian spouse, 17.1% of married Asian American women are married to a white spouse, and 3.5% of married Asian men have a spouse classified as "other".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dVUvp-XcLB8C|last=Chou|first=Rosalind|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2012|isbn=9781442209244|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of Asian/white marriages involve an Asian female and a white male.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There was a spike in white male/Asian female marriages during and following the U.S.'s involvement with wars in Asia, including WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In preparation for a documentary on Asian fetish called ''Seeking Asian Female'',  Chinese-American filmmaker Debbie Lum interviewed non-Asian men who posted online [[personal ad]]s exclusively seeking Asian women. Things that the men found appealing in Asian women included subtlety and quietness, eye-catching long black hair, a mysterious look in dark eyes, and a propensity to give more consideration to how their partner feels than to themselves. Lum described the stereotype associated with an Asian fetish as an obsession with seeking "somebody submissive, traditional, docile... the perfect wife who is not going to talk back".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/22/155571292/for-one-man-she-had-to-be-pretty-and-asian|title=For One Man, She Had to be Pretty and Asian|last=Martin|first=Michel|date=22 June 2012|publisher=NPR|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian women are viewed by white men as "good wives"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, as in they are perceived to be able to properly take care of their children during the day and fulfill their partner's sexual desires at night. In interviews done by Bitna Kim, white men explain their fetish for Asian women. The white men interviewed fantasize that an Asian woman possesses both beauty and brains&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11089-010-0312-9|title=Asian Female and Caucasian Male Couples: Exploring the Attraction|journal=Pastoral Psychology|date=April 2011|volume=60|issue=2|pages=233–244|first=Bitna|last=Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that she is "sexy, intelligent, successful, professional, caring, and family oriented".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, that she does not wear “white girl clothes” and heavy makeup, and that they are not high maintenance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hence, the men believe that Asian women have respectable mannerisms.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These men see Asian women to be exotic, thus desirable, because of their supposed mysterious beauty and possession of a physical appearance perceived to be petite.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sexually, the men in these interviews had a commonality. They all believed that Asian women have submissive sex. They believed that an Asian woman did not mind putting her partner’s pleasure above hers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These interviews show that white men believe that an Asian woman embodies a perfect wife as a "princess in public and a whore in the bedroom".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A white woman is seen by white men to lack the same femininity that an Asian woman has to offer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Instead, a white man gets the next best option that will benefit him most.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Since 2002, marriages between Eastern European men and Asian women have become increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.population-europe.eu/pop-digest/cross-border-marriages-sweden|title=Cross-Border Marriages In Sweden|publisher=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|location=Munich|website=Population Europe|author=|date=|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, the number of Thai women marrying westerners began to rise in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of Prime Minister [[Sarit Thanarat]]'s economic policies which attracted foreign investment and western men to Thailand. There is a social stigma in the country against Thai women marrying white men, but research published in 2015 indicated that an increasing number of young middle class Thai women were marrying foreign men. A generation earlier, Thai women marrying foreign men had mostly been working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prachatai.org/english/node/5352|title=New trend of young, educated Thai women with farang husbands emerges: researcher|website=Prachatai English|author=Yiamyut Sutthichaya|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In media ==

In her essay "Hateful Contraries: Media Images of Asian Women", British filmmaker [[Pratibha Parmar]] comments that the media's imagery of Asian women is "contradictory" in that it represents them as "completely dominated by their men, mute and oppressed" while also presenting them as "sexually erotic creatures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Parmar|author-first=Pratihba|editor-first=Amelia|editor-last=Jones|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|chapter=Hateful Contraries: Media Images of Asian Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nge6bJ-hP8kC|isbn=9780415267052|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian women have traditionally been stereotyped in mass media in the United States. In her essay ''Lotus Blossoms Don't Bleed: Images of Asian Women'', American filmmaker [[Renee Tajima-Peña]] identifies two basic stereotypes. The Lotus Blossom Baby is a feminine and delicate sexual-romantic object. In contrast, the [[Dragon Lady]] is treacherous and devious, and in some cases a prostitute or madam. Tajima suggests that this view of Asian women contributes to the existence of the Asian mail-order bride industry in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Waves: An Anthology of Writings By and About Asian American Women|publisher=Beacon Press|chapter=Lotus Blossoms Don't Bleed: Images of Asian Women|url=http://www.samfeder.com/PDF/Making%20Waves_%20Renee%20E.%20Tajima.pdf|first=Renee E. |last=Tajima|editor=Asian Women United of California|location=Boston|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media continuously furthers the progression of the Asian woman stereotype.

'''Buenaventura''' is a coastal seaport city on the department of [[Valle del Cauca]], [[Colombia]] ([[South America]]). Buenaventura (Spanish for "good fortune") is the main port of [[Colombia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/21/world/fg-colombia-port21|title=Colombian crackdown appears to be paying off|first=Chris|last=Kraul|date=21 September 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buenaventura is a city with a population of 333,194&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=338014296&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=abcdefghinoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;pt=c&amp;va=|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130209183418/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=338014296&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=abcdefghinoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;pt=c&amp;va=|deadurl=yes|title=World Gazetteer: Buenaventura - profile of geographical entity includ…|author=|date=9 February 2013|archivedate=9 February 2013|website=world-gazetteer.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of the 2005 census (most of city development lies on Cascajal Island) and it is the size of [[Los Angeles]]' metropolitan area; most of the city's land is rural with scattered small villages throughout. It is served by the [[Gerardo Tobar López Airport]].

The city is part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] after it was named "City of Gastronomy" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/travel/buenaventura-colombia-pacific-coast.html|title=Once Colombia’s ‘Deadliest City,’ Buenaventura Is Coming Back|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The city was founded on July 14, 1540, by Juan de Ladrilleros through orders from Pascual de Andagoya.  At that time it was inhabited by the [[Buscaja]]s. The city was destroyed by Native Americans before 1600; it was later rebuilt.  Buenaventura thrived after the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914; and in the 1950s became a regular stopover for the 'international jet set'. Today, the city is crucial for sending raw materials to nearby areas; this has brought prosperity and allowed recent new development to occur.

==Demographics==
The city is, as of 2011, affected by very high levels of poverty and violence, and is considered a center for the cocaine trade in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13141498|title=DIY subs join Colombia's cocaine trade|first=John|last=Otis|date=27 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buenaventura's population is mostly of African descent (85%) with 10% mixed European/Native Indian and 5% Hispanic.

==Transport==
===Port===
The city is one of the major ports on the continent, accounting for nearly 60% of all Colombian sea imports and exports.&lt;ref name="news.vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/video/buenaventura-dismemberment-and-displacement-full-length|title=Buenaventura: Dismemberment and Displacement (Full Length) - VICE News|author=|date=|website=VICE News|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its strategic position, the city's economy has been hampered by gang-related activity fighting over control of the port, making it the most impoverished cities in Colombia.&lt;ref name="news.vice.com"/&gt;

===Rivers===
The city is surrounded by an immense number of rivers, including: the Dagua; the Anchicayá; the Calima; the Raposo; the Mayorquín; the Cajambre; the Yurumanguí; and part of the right arm of the Naya River and part of the left arm of the River San Juan at its mouth. In addition, it has an enormous amount of streams and smaller rivers, such as Agua Clara, San Marcos, Sabaletas, San Cipriano and Escalerete, which supplies the municipal capital through a modern aqueduct. 

===Road===
Well paved and maintained roads, that are designed to be unaffected by landslides, leave the city via Loboguerrero, where it divides to go to Cali, or Buga and then onwards to the cities of Armenia, Medellín and Bogotá. This route is known as "La Vía al Mar", as it connects large and different parts of the country together.

===Airport===
[[Gerardo Tobar López Airport]] connects Buenaventura with direct flights of 1 hour 20 minutes to Bogotá via Satena , as well as to other cities.

==Crime==
{{Further information|Crime in Colombia}}
Buenaventura has had a notorious history plagued by the [[Colombian armed conflict]], drug trafficking, violence, and the presence of guerrilla and paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6951683.stm|title=Colombia's new urban drugs war|author=|date=18 August 2007|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian authorities have seized almost US$28 million in cash from drug kingpins. The money found was in several shipping containers sent from [[Manzanillo, Colima]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Houston]] (USA), that belonged to brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, also known as the ‘Combas’.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/5946-colombian-authorities-hauled-drug-money-almost-us-28-million.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/17/eveningnews/main6592858.shtml|title=U.S. Targets Powerful, Profitable "Super Cartel"|author=|date=|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2010, the number of reported homicides in the city doubled. In 2010, the murder rate of Buenaventura was 175.2 homicides per 100,000, a rate 24 times that of New York City. To counter the violence, the Colombian government has set up a marine special forces unit in the worst area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/americas/25colombia.html|title=Bomb Kills at Least 6 in Port City in Colombia|first=|last=Reuters|date=24 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it seemed that counter-violence efforts had improved crime metrics, even while aspects of the Colombian drug war in that city worsened. According to community activist Victor Hugo Vidal, "If you ask the authorities, they will tell you [the city] is better -- that the homicide rates are way down. But for us [living here], during the last 10 years, there has been no change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/08/colombias-invisible-war/242775/|title=Colombia's Invisible War|first=Elizabeth|last=Dickinson|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a variety of '''Christian views on poverty and wealth'''. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. 

Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]] that shapes the Western world. [[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in {{bibleref|Mark|10:23–27}} as having "imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion encyclopedia of theology |first=Jack |last=Mahoney |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780977461059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, David W.

==Wealth and faith==

===Wealth as an offense to faith===

According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as "especially sinful". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when "the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed."&lt;ref name=Kahan43&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century [[Manichaeanism|Manicheans]] who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;  Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus.  As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to "take nothing for the journey."{{bibleref2|Mark|6:8–9}}

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] advocate [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty.

And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, such as [[New Monasticism|New Monastics]], may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle, in part as a protest against "a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power."&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA307|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2416-5|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth as an obstacle to faith===
According to David Miller, [[Martin Luther]] viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as "the most common idol on earth".  Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler {{bibleverse|Mark|10:17–31}} as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith.  According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus.  Miller cites [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s observation in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1st Timothy]] that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:9}}.  Paul continues on with the observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil."
{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:10}}  Miller emphasizes that "it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the [[Eye of a needle#Christianity|eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the "good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.&lt;ref name=Kahan43 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. {{bibleverse|Matthew|6|19:21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." {{bibleref2|Mark|9:42–49}}.  In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty.  Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.&lt;ref name=WellsQuash&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Christian Ethics |first1=Samuel |last1=Wells |first2=Ben |last2=Quash|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ezy6wZJHFCoC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Christian+land+wealth+usury#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20land%20wealth%20usury&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405152778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the "Great Renunciation" in which "millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name."&lt;ref name=Kahan43/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholicism]], poverty is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  Pope [[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes "poverty ''chosen''" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty ''to be fought''" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.htmlWorldPeaceDayAddress2009 Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[religious institute]]s also take a [[vow]] of extreme poverty. For example, the [[Franciscan]] orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.

===Wealth as an outcome of faith===
One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty.  This perspective is generally ascribed to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Puritan]] theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves.  [[John Wesley]] was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous "Sermon 50," in which he said, "gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt; It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools.  

Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound [[prosperity theology]], teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the "health and wealth gospel") is a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious belief whose proponents claim the [[Bible]] teaches that financial blessing is the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with [[continuationism]].

Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the [[United States]] during the [[Healing Revival]]s in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the [[New Thought]] movement. It later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the [[charismatic movement]] and has been promoted by Christian [[missionaries]] throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream [[evangelicalism]] as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]].

==Precursors to Christianity==

Professor [[Cosimo Perrotta]] describes the early Christian period as one which saw "the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian." Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth.  Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and [[Christian culture]]s either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them.  However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.&lt;ref name=Perrotta43&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament===
{{further|Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity}}

Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being "completely different from the classical view."  He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers.  Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.  The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt.  Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands."  In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".  However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament.  The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;  Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor.  However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor.  Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy.  In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less.  The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780814653135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{quote|''Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:20|Luke 6:20]]}}

===The Gospels===
Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example).  He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the [[Parable of the Sower]], where it is said:

:"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful"  – Mark 4:19.

Jesus makes [[Mammon]] a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.

In the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:

:"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  Those who heard this were astonished, "Who then can be saved?", they asked.  Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."   – Luke 19:23–27

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with "a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys" (Lk 12.33); and he adds "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Lk 12.34).

In [[The Parable of the Rich Fool]] Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:

:"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'" – Luke 12:16–20.

And Jesus adds, "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God" (Lk 12.21).

[[Jesus and Zacchaeus]] (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).

Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.

Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:

:"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."  – Luke 4:18–19

Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the [[Beatitudes]], the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).

God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological "great reversal" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in [[The Magnificat]] (Lk 1.46–55):

:He has shown the might of his arm:
:and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts.
:He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones,
:and exalted the lowly.
:He has filled the hungry with good things;
:and the rich has sent empty away.
:—Luke 1:51–53

and in Jesus repeated use of the tag "many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 &amp; Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 &amp; Lk 18.14).

In the [[Parable of the Wedding Feast]], it is "the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).

===Acts of the Apostles===

Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the [[common ownership|community of goods]] for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).

===Epistles===
For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of
the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.

A concept related to the accumlation of wealth is [[World (theology)#Christianity|Worldliness]], which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John:  "Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).

The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the [[Psalter]]'s convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption,  pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent [[Day of Judgement]].

===Revelation===
Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).

==Early Christianity==
[[File:Vespiolla Apostoli 3.jpg|thumb|240px|15th-century fresco of the Apostles, [[Turin]], Italy]]
Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible.  However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an "acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged" that Frederick sees as "adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to business ethics |first=Robert |last=Frederick |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=292–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+business#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20business&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405101028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of "a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed."&lt;ref name=Kahan44&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors.  Kahan acknowledges that, "Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own."  However, as Kahan puts it, "Never before had any god been conceived of as poor."&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt;  He characterizes Christian charity as being "different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition."&lt;ref name=Kahan42&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca.  The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor.  According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.&lt;ref name=Kahan42/&gt;

Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being "much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture."&lt;ref name=Perrotta43 /&gt;  However, [[Irving Kristol]] suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament.  Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.&lt;ref name=Kristol437&gt;{{cite book |title=Neoconservatism: the autobiography of an idea |first=Irving |last=Kristol |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=437 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780028740218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as [[Socrates]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|the Cynics]] and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;

==Patristic era==

Many of the [[Church Fathers]] condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow.  However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a "necessary evil resulting from the fall of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of economics |first1=Richard Theodore |last1=Ely |first2=Thomas Sewall |last2=Adams |first3=Max Otto |last3=Lorenz |first4=Allyn Abbott |last4=Young |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 |page=743 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TiYuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert Grant]] noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the "love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.&lt;ref name=Grant49&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world |first=Robert McQueen |last=Grant |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2004 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20fathers%20attitudes%20money%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780664227722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success.  He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.

==Medieval Europe==
{{further|Apostolic poverty}}
By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was "thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe."  Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hunt10&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies  |first=E.

Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was "organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.&lt;ref name=Gray119&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protestant Reformation: belief, practice, and tradition |first=Madeleine |last=Gray |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2003 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z1qRnlLwWsgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Protestant+Reformation+money+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781903900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants.  For example, he cites [[Honorius of Autun]] who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved.  He further cites [[Gratian]] who wrote that "the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple."&lt;ref name=Kahan46&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an ''immoderate'' desire for wealth.  Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have "external riches" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his "condition of life".  This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry.  What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life.&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt; The period saw fierce debates on [[Absolute Poverty of Christ|whether Christ owned property]].

The church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate.  The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth.  Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Monasticism===
As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the [[Consensoria Monachorum]].&lt;ref name=Bishko &gt;Charles J. Bishko, "The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum", ''The American Journal of Philology'' Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/290910] also at [http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= power &gt;''Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages'' by Frans Theuws, Mayke De Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 {{ISBN|90-04-11734-2}} p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, [[Benedictine]] monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility.  Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence.  In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval panorama |first=Robert |last=Bartlett |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2001 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjI5t3DE00wC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=monastic+communities+Christian+medieval#v=onepage&amp;q=monastic%20communities%20Christian%20medieval&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]] departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. [[Francis of Assisi]] viewed poverty as a key element of the [[imitation of Christ]] who was "poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross".&lt;ref name= Miles160 &gt;''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'' by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking "awkward questions".&lt;ref name="Placher1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Carl Placher|author-link=William Placher |title=Readings in the History of Christian Theology: From its beginnings to the eve of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rya0v9bgwT8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=11 October 2011|date=15 April 1988|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24057-8|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usury===
{{main|Usury}}

[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|right |thumb |Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]

[[Usury]] originally was the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law.  Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.

The first of the scholastics, [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Reformation==

The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of commerce and industry |first=Cheesman Abiah|last=Herrick |publisher=Macmillan Co. |year=1917 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=medieval+Europe+Christian+church+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20Europe%20Christian%20church%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===

One school of thought attributes [[Calvinism]] with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]](1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in {{cite book |last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven |year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puritanism==

For [[Puritan]]s, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life.  Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on "the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation."&lt;ref name=Conforti42&gt;{{cite book |title=Saints and strangers: New England in British North America |first=Joseph A. |last=Conforti |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zsO6_qJ0s9UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780801882531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the "acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American religious studies: an interdisciplinary anthology |first=Gayraud S. |last=Wilmore |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989  |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-9vTPu5Z6QC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0822309262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to "contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church."  Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Conforti42 /&gt;

==The rise of capitalism==

In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist [[Max Weber]] propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber argued that [[capitalism]] in northern Europe evolved because the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) [[Protestant work ethic|ethic]] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprises]] and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] that influenced the development of [[capitalism]].

Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development.  Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism.  Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions.  Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url=http://eh.net/node/2724 |first=Stanley L. |last=Engerman |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chamberlain wrote that "Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roots of Capitalism |first=John |last=Chamberlain |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success|first=Rodney|last=Stark|location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |isbn=1-4000-6228-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9j6OoeWqK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christianity+capitalism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John B. Cobb]] argues that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"/&gt;

==Social justice==

[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|right|Much of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s theology dealt with issues of social justice.]]

It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], [[Social Gospel]] from Episcopalians and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the [[leftist|left]] of the [[political spectrum]].

According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poverty and Morality: Religious and Secular Perspectives |first1=William A. |last1=Galston |first2=Peter H. |last2=Hoffenberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010  |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyzuGet8080C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Christianity+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9781139491068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic social teaching===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}

[[Catholic social teaching]] is a body of doctrine developed by the [[Catholic Church]] on matters of [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], [[economics]], [[social organization]] and the role of the [[state (polity)|state]].  Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 [[encyclical|encyclical letter]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which advocated economic [[distributism]] and condemned [[socialism]].

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], its purpose "is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper",&lt;ref&gt;(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope John Paul II]], its foundation "rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity".&lt;ref&gt;(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55).&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns echo elements of [[Jewish law]] and the prophetic books of the [[Old Testament]], and recall the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] recorded in the [[New Testament]], such as his declaration that "whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of [[modernity|modern]] social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: [[liberalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', § 99 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fascism]], and [[Nazism]] have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.

===Marxism===

Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian.

===Christian socialism===
{{main|Christian socialism}}

[[Christian socialism]] generally refers to those on the [[Christian left]] whose politics are both [[Christian]] and [[socialist]] and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include [[Liberation theology]] and the doctrine of the [[social gospel]].

The ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] of [[Leo XIII]] (1891) was the starting point of a [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic doctrine]] on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, ''Rerum novarum'' explicitly rejects what it calls "the main tenet of socialism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property." ''Rerum novarum'', paragraph 16.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical promotes a kind of [[corporatism]] based on [[social solidarity]] among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.

In the November 1914 issue of ''The Christian Socialist'', Episcopal bishop [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] of Utah, U.S.A. stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place."&lt;ref name="D.Berman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=David|title=Radicalism in the Mountain West 1890–1920|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Colorado|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of [[Europe]] the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new [[Christian democracy|Christian-inspired Socialist parties]].  A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the [[International League of Religious Socialists]]. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.

Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the [[egalitarian]] and anti-establishment message of [[Jesus]], who–according to the [[Gospel]]–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes [[anti-clerical]] message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active [[Communism|Communists]]. This phenomenon was most common among [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[China]], the most notable being [[James Gareth Endicott]], who became supportive of the struggle of the [[Communist Party of China]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

[[Michael Moore]]'s film [[Capitalism: A Love Story]] also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a [[sin]] and whether [[Jesus]] would be a capitalist,&lt;ref name="ChurchMoore"&gt;{{cite news| last=Moore|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Moore|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/for-those-of-you-on-your_b_308948.html|title=For Those of You on Your Way to Church This Morning ...|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 4, 2009| accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among [[Christian right#History|evangelical conservatives]] who support free market ideals.

[[Liberation theology]]&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christian movement]] in [[political theology]] which interprets the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianized [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=2013-09-04 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation''. Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien,''Catholicism''(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez,''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology", in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptocrystalline''' is a [[rock (geology)|rock]] [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] made up of such minute [[crystal]]s that its crystalline nature is only vaguely revealed even microscopically in [[thin section]] by transmitted [[polarized light]].  Among the [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[chert]] and [[flint]] are cryptocrystalline. [[carbonado (diamond)|Carbonado]], a form of diamond, is also cryptocrystalline.  [[Volcanic]] rocks, especially of the [[acid]]ic type such as [[felsite]]s and [[rhyolite]]s, may have a cryptocrystalline [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]] as distinguished from pure [[obsidian]] (acidic) or [[tachylyte]] (basic), which are natural rock [[glass]]es. [[Onyx]] is also a cryptocrystalline.

{{Culture of Kosovo}}

[[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} is a partially recognized state located in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in Southeastern Europe. The majority of Kosovars are ethnically Albanian or Serbian. Kosovo has an expansive cultural heritage, including monuments, clothing items, museums, and traditional food.

== Monuments ==
 {{main|Monuments of Kosovo}}
Many monuments of Kosovo date from the neolithic period. Throughout history many monuments were changed, destroyed and new elements were added to them. There are different types of monuments that date from the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] period continuing with the [[Roman empire|Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine Empire]], [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Middle Ages]], [[Ottoman Empire]] period, etc. Most of the historical monuments are stationed in the district of the cities of [[Pristina]], [[Prizren]] and Peja. Monuments in Kosovo mostly consist of ancient cities, castles (Kulla), monasteries, mosques and churches.
[[File:Visoki Dečani, exterior view, Julian Nitzsche.jpg|thumb|[[Visoki Dečani|Visoki Dečani Monastery]] (1327) in Dečani]]
Some of the most famous monuments in Kosovo are:

*[[Ulpiana|The ancient city of Ulpiana]] (I – VII) was an ancient Roman city. Site for archaeological excavations in which several objects were found. These objects include a woman's head, a man's head, head of eros and a tragic mask.  
*[[Visoki Dečani|Visoki Dečani Monastery]] (1327–1335) A major Serbian Orthodox Christian monastery. It is the largest medieval church containing the most extensive fresco decoration.
*[[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]] (1235)A Serbian Orthodox monastery. The complex of churches is the spiritual seat and mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs.  
*Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque in Pristina (1461)Located right in the heart of the old town center. It is Pristina's largest and most prominent mosque. Its cupola was once the biggest in the region. The square in front of Mbretit Mosque has always been a popular meeting point.
*The house of [[League of Prizren]] (1878)): One of Kosovo's most important historical site. It is a museum complex of four buildings.

Castles are also very common in Kosovo. The castle of Prizren, the city and castle of Artanë which was a huge trade city in the 13th century and earlier, the castle of Kekola an ancient Dardan castle which dates from the Bronze era (1300-1100 b.c), etc.

Unfortunately because of the many wars that Kosovo went through in different years and times, many monuments were destroyed.

== Museums ==

=== Kosovo museum ===
Founded in 1949, the Kosovo museum has departments of [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]], and [[natural science]], to which a department for the study of history and the National Liberation Struggle was added in 1959. It has been active in sponsoring archaeological excavations, conservation and other scientific work. Since 1956 it has published an annual journal called 'Buletin i Muzeut të Kosovës', with articles in Albanian (with summaries in French, English or German).&lt;ref&gt;Riedlmayer, Andres. "Bosnia Report." Bosnia Report -March - June 2000. N.p., Mar. 2000. Web. 23 Feb. 2013. http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/marjune00/museums.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Kosovo has seven active museums all over its territory. The museums are the:
[[File:Museum of Kosova.JPG|thumb|National Museum of Kosovo.]]
*[[National Museum of Kosovo]]: Housed in an [[Austro-Hungarian style]] house, containing more than 50,000 items exhibited through various pavilions. Also housed here are exhibits expressing the day in the life for the people in various regions. 
*Railway museum of Kosovo: : A one-room exhibit dedicated to the railways 
*[[Ethnological Treasure of Kosovo|Ethnological museum]] "Emin Gjiku" in Prishtinë: Monument of culture since the 18th century. At this museum you could find displays of ancient clothing, tools, containers, furniture and old weapons. 
*Albanian league of Prizren:One of Kosovos most important historical sites. It's a complex of four buildings that had been completely reconstructed. Represents where patriots and intellectuals joined to start the political, military and cultural struggle to against the Ottoman Empire in order to appeal for an autonomous Albanian state. 
*Archeological museum in Prizren: Once functioned as a Turkish bathhouse. Now fully renovated and filled with over 800 items of archeological interest from antiquity to the 19th century. Building also acts as a clock tower built at the end of the 19th century. 
*Museum in Mitrovica

=== National museum of Kosovo ===
[[File:Etnological Items Kosovo (5).JPG|thumb|Ethnological items.]]
National Museum Of Kosovo is stationed in Pristina was built by Austrians for the Turkish army in 1898, and was used by the Yugoslav national army until 1975. Housed in an Austro Hungarian style house, contained more than 50,000 items exhibited through various pavilions. Also housed here are exhibits expressing the day in the life for the people in various regions. The museum used to have a rich collection of prehistoric objects uncovered in Kosovo – these were all spirited off to Belgrade just before the troubles started in 1998, and hundreds of archaeological finds and ethnographic items yet have to be returned. The extensive permanent archaeology exhibition details life in the region in the Illyrian, Dardanian and Roman periods. Centre stage is the 6,000-year-old Hynesha në Fron (Goddess on a throne) statue, found at Tjerrtorja in 1956 and returned to Pristina in 2002. In front of the building recent history is represented by some artillery hardware, and two large Jewish gravestones. The museum objectives are to save, protect and present the Cultural Heritage of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;"Kosovo Museum." InYourPocket. N.p., n.d.

=== Traditional clothes in Kosovo ===
[[File:Kostume popullore - Flickr - Shkumbin (3).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Traditional Albanian clothing]]]]
Traditional clothes in Kosovo take a special place in Cultural heritage of Kosovo. They were homemade clothes or made by craftsman specialized in that field. Traditional clothing in Kosovo resembles much of the Albanian traditional clothing if not all the same. There are over 200 different kinds of clothing and styles of wearing the clothes all depending of where you're from, the history of your fis (clan), and many more reasons.
First is the headgear, a woolen cone-shaped plis for the male, and a pashnik headdress for the female of a common red color. The plis is white and in some regions men cover it round with a pashnik and in region of Rugova men cover it round with a white cotton scarf.
Second is the pants or dress, depending on the style and gender. The men usually have on long woolen white pants called tirq or a fustanella which is a skirt like costume. The women wear a xhubleta which is a skirt like type of clothing as well, only it can resemble more as an apron in the front instead. Before wearing the shoes, both men and women had socks or Çorape and finally came the Openga or shoes worn by men, whereas women would usually wear wooden clogs.&lt;ref name="beinkosovo.com"&gt;"Kosovo Culture - Be in Kosovo - Visit Kosovo - Business in Kosovo - Invest in Kosovo - Tourism in Kosovo - Rent a Car in Pristina - Guides in Kosovo - Study in Kosovo."Be In Kosovo. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013. http://beinkosovo.com/en/kosovo-culture&lt;/ref&gt; In the past they used decorated guns, decorated pocket clocks, decorated cigarettes boxes etc. . Today plis and tirq are being worn combined with European modern clothes to symbolize national identity. What specifies the region of Metohija is the white scarf which they cover they head with, the region of Drenica is specified with woman with a lot of jewelries and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Ismajli, Rexhep, and Mehmet Kraja. Kosova: Vështrim Monografik. Prishtinë: Akademia E Shkencave Dhe E Arteve E Kosovës, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lazarke.jpg|thumb|200px|Girls from [[Štrpce]] in [[Serbian traditional clothing|Serbian traditional costumes]]]]

Traditional Clothing is one of the major factors that has distinguished this nation from its neighboring countries. The motifs and patterns on these garments can be explained by prehistoric religion and chromatically there are three basic colors, the most symbolic of which is red. Overall, women's clothing was better preserved than men as there are regional variations in how these traditional clothes are worn. The most famous was the 'pështjellak', which consisted of a long white shirt and two aprons one for the front and one for the back. Another clothing style worn by the women of Kosovo is the xhubleta, which is a bell wavy skirt which is held by two straps on the shoulders, worn on top of a long-sleeved white linen shirt. The next style is often referred to as the most beautiful of Kosovo clothing. The Veshja e Dukagjinit was a white long sleeve cotton shirt but the edges were colorfully embodied. The last style for the women was that of the southern region of has. This clothing was more distinctive and is commonly found today as it has survived and embraced changes in styles. This look consists of a short white shirt and a full length linen dress.  Men's clothing was a symbol of beauty, however it was less preservative. Unlike women's clothing men's clothing is more uniformed and seemed to change less from region to region. The most popular was the "tirqi" apparel. The look similar to women with the white shirt and vest, the tirqi which were woollen white pants where strictly a characteristic of the men.babies

=== Traditional food in Kosovo ===

The best-known of all and most distinctive one, "flija", is prepared year-round but is a summer favourite. Flija made with "saç" is a speciality from the traditional Albanian cuisine, that is mostly prepared in mountainous areas. It is most certainly one of the typical Kosovar dishes that everyone local will recommend. Baklava is one of the traditional pastries of the Kosovar cuisine, although of Turkish origin. Bakllasarem is also a traditional food of Kosovo it is a salty pie with yoghurt and garlic covering. The Kosovo cuisine developed under the influence Albanian, Turkish, Serbian, Croatian Greek and Italian dishes. The national food of Kosovo is Cheese Byrek. Byrek is a type of baked or filled pastry. They are made of a thin flaky dough known as phyllo dough and are filled with salty cheese (often feta), minced meat, potatoes or other vegetables. Meat is well represented in their daily meals. Due to the harsh continental climate vegetables are seasonal flourishing mainly in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;"Kosovar Cuisine." Kosovo. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Feb. 2013. http://www.kosovoguide.com/?cid=2,227&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intangible culture ==
Generally speaking, Albanians are a very secular people. The majority of the Albanian people in Kosovo are of Muslim background and there is still a high percentage of Muslims in Kosovo. On the other hand, the Spiritual Kosovan Culture is not very influenced by the religion. One can quote a line from a poem of Pashko Vasa, a 19th-century Catholic writer, who said that [[O moj Shqypni|"The religion of the Albanians is Albanianism"]], meaning that the Albanians identity doesn't derive from their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, Tim. "Albanians." Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; What influences the Kosovan-Albanian cultural heritage the most is the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]]. This set of laws and rules used to be oral and got published later. Due to the fact that a part of them is very primitive, they aren't used as much anymore, however these rules are a great part of the Kosovar cultural heritage.

=== Folklore ===
[[File:Ensemble "Kolo" dancing folk dance of Gnjilane.jpg|thumb|[[Serbian dances|Serbian traditional dance]] ([[Kolo (dance)|kolo]]) from [[Gnjilane]]]]
[[Ottoman Empire|The Ottoman Empire]] left behind their religion, their language, and their people in Kosovo(dating back to the 14th century). All three mark important facts of the Kosovar culture today. Kosovo has 2 official languages, Albanian and Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;library&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have strong Turkish roots in their folkloric music, the mass are not fluent in Turkish, it is only the elders in secular groups and municipalities that speak Turkish. According to the Kosovo Ministry of Education, each student must master and demonstrate their mother tongue during primary and secondary schooling in whichever language they choose (although most students take up the Albanian mother tongue).&lt;ref name="masht-gov"&gt;http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/New%20Kosova%20Curriculum%20Framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the first foreign language that every student must demonstrate proficiency, is English.&lt;ref name="masht-gov"/&gt; The influence of the Ottomans had a spill-over effect of cultural and religious identity which resulted in the construction of many religious monuments and artifacts in Kosovo. Over 90% of Kosovar-Albanians are of Islamic religion primarily due to the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Turkish-religious-structural influences, the current Kosovar culture was also influenced by other ethnic minorities within the region constituting, but not limited to: Roma, Serb, Bosnian, Ashkali, Gorani, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rootsworld.com/turkey/cumbus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09187.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, instruments like the Kemenche&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Pinksterboer, Tipbook: Cello (2002), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional dances such as Hora from the Turkish culture become a symbol of Kosovar ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncturkishfestival.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=114 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312043050/http://www.ncturkishfestival.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=114 |archivedate=2009-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the instrument knows as the Cifteli, is also a widely used instrument in Kosovo with origins from the Turkish culture that dates back to the early Ottoman Empire.  Likewise, the Serbians adopted music known as "[[tallava]]", a fast-paced folk music type, which has had a great influence in the recent years in Kosovo culture.&lt;ref name="beinkosovo.com"/&gt;
[[File:Traditional Dance.jpg|thumb|[[List of Albanian dances|Albanian traditional Dance]]]]
Folklore and Oral tradition have been present throughout the history of Kosovo, where these two elements played a crucial role in communicating important information, history and events among communities and generations. A low literacy rate and dynamics of life style in rural areas limited the ability to document important developments in written formats. Consequently, communities transmitted important national events and collective memories to younger generations through oral traditions, including legends, songs, proverbs and stories.&lt;ref name=Intangible&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/kosovo/Article-2ndDialogue_en.pdf Intangible Cultural Heritage: A Strangely Familiar Concept!] N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

 [[File:Patriarchate of Peć 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]], the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] from the 14th century]]
There is no official religion in Kosovo, although the country is predominantly Muslim as the majority of Albanians are Muslim. Most of the ethnic Serbs practice Eastern Orthodoxy.

=== Oral history ===
Unwritten or customary rules are very frequently practiced as law and order among Kosovans with its principles being as followed:
*Personal honor
*The equality of persons
*The freedom of each to act in accordance with own honor, with law limits, and without being subject to another's commands
*The word of honor known as "[[besa (Albanian culture)|besa]]" creating a situation of inviolable trust (upon Besa, Kosovars take the person's honor and the person's life the remote areas of the country.
Among the current modern times, the former customs and traditions are gradually vanishing due to the influence of the western world
The elderly generations are the ones who assist in keeping such customs and traditions alive.
[[File:Lahutari.jpg|thumb|Lahutari - An old man telling a story]]
Oral traditions have served as vehicles to pass cultural values to next generations and taught lessons about collective memories and experiences, which played a bridge role between generations.  While oral traditions had a very positive effect over the centuries, they also enforced social and legal regulations, such as the five-century old [[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]] and [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]], which were established and maintained by the traditional institution named oda (chamber).&lt;ref name=Intangible/&gt;

==== Oda ====
The concept of "[[Oda (Albania)|Oda]]", whether it is considered as gathering at a space or a traditional institution, is a rooted spiritual cultural heritage asset in Kosovo. Figuratively, "Oda" represents a special and distinguished space of a house (a room), which is exclusively dedicated to the elderly men to discuss important family, community or national issues. Moreover, Oda symbolizes the court of law where men, gather to discuss and solve property problems, blood feuds etc. This space was also an important platform of social, cultural life and entertainment for men.  Today, after many centuries of practice, "Oda" is still alive and valued in certain communities in Kosovo (mainly rural).&lt;ref name=Intangible/&gt;

==== Besa ====
"[[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]" is a famous feature of all Albanian people. It mainly represents a "word of honor" or "promise". The "man of Besa" connotes a man of respect and honour, someone to whom you can trust your life and family. The man who breaks Besa is a man unable to save his Besa and is worth nothing. A man like that will risk of being banished from the community. Besa is the moral testament of Albanians since the appearance of its earliest national and social mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kushova, Alma. "Besa." (2004): n. pag. Besa | OpenDemocracy. Web. 24 Feb. 2013. http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts/article_2114.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kanun ====
[[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]] is a set of unwritten laws and rules which were only published in the 20th century. Kanun of Lekë Dukaghini is composed of 12 books and 1,262 articles. These are the twelve books:
# Church;
# Family;
# Marriage;
# House, Livestock and Property;
# Work;
# Transfer of Property;
# Spoken Word;
# Honor;
# Damages;
# Law Regarding Crimes;
# The kanun of the elderly;
# Exemptions and Exceptions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Language preservation ===
[[Albanian language|The Albanian Language]] is the main language in Kosovo. Albanian, has two main dialects: Geg (in the northern part) and Tosk (in the southern part). Therefore, the Albanian language ''spoken'' in Kosovo is much more similar to the Geg dialect, even though the standard Albanian language has been established long ago based on the Tosk dialect. However, the main official language in Kosovo is: standard Albanian. Despite that, minorities in Kosovo still strive to protect their own languages. For example, in Prizren, almost every institution has its name written in Turkish as well. The [http://www.osce.org/ OSCE] said Kosovo should do more to enable members of different communities to learn each other's languages and overcome linguistic barriers. The legislative framework in Kosovo obliges institutions to provide services in the official languages in use, but there are shortcomings in how that is being implemented.
"Those shortcomings can be overcome with capacity building within institutions, be it by enabling municipalities to hire translators or to better train the existing ones or by helping them develop forms and signs in the official languages," Gaon told SETimes.&lt;ref&gt;"Overcoming Language Barriers in Kosovo." (SETimes.com). N.p., 27 Aug. 2012. Web. 24 Feb. 2013. http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/08/27/feature-03&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protecting the cultural heritage ==
[[File:Gracanica 1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Gračanica Monastery]] was inscribed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]]]
Because of the Wars (especially [[Kosovo War|the recent one]]) that took place in Kosovo, many monuments and other cultural properties of Kosovo were destroyed or stolen. During the 1998-1999 conflict, more than a third of Kosovo's 600 mosques were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;UNESCO Courier.

Born in [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], Sindh (now in [[Pakistan]]), Maybury-Lewis attended the [[University of Oxford]], at which he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree. In 1960, he joined the Harvard faculty, and was Edward C. Henderson Professor of Anthropology there from 1966 until he retired in 2004. His extensive ethnographic fieldwork was conducted primarily among indigenous peoples in central [[Brazil]], which culminated in his ethnography among the [[Xavante people|Xavante]], as well as [[post-modernist]] renditions. In 1972, he co-founded with his wife Pia [[Cultural Survival]], the leading US-based [[advocacy]] and documentation organization devoted to "promoting the rights, voices and visions of [[indigenous people]]s."

'''Dağlı Castle''' ({{lang-tr|Dağlı Kalesi}}) is a castle ruin in [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]]

==Geography==
The castle is around [[Dağlı, Erdemli|Dağlı]] Village of [[Erdemli]] District at {{coord|36|42|N|34|15|E}}. The distance between Erdemli and the village is {{convert|17|km}} and the distance between the castle and [[Mersin]] is {{convert|52|km}}. There is no vehicle road from the village to castle. Although a short portion of ancient castle road survives, the castle is accessible only through walking and partial climbing from the village. The altitude of the village is {{convert|510|m}}, the altitude of the castle is over {{convert|900|m}} and the total walking track is about {{convert|2|km}}.

==History==
The castle was built during the [[Roman Empire]]. But it was used during the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. It probably controlled ancient and medieval caravan routes.

==The castle==
The castle is on a hill overlooking Karakız valley. Most of the buildings as well as the walls are in ruins. But a big room, known as the ''queen’s room'', survives. There are also two small compartments which are thought to be toilet and some dark quarters which may be dungeons. Next to the main gate there is a [[rock relief]] showing two soldiers and one pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://okulweb.meb.gov.tr/33/05/671525/cevre_incelemesi.htm Environment data for schools] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a highly effaced inscription. Although it was thought to be in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], up to now only a few words could be deciphered. According to Professor  Bogos Levon Zekiyan, only four words are readable; ''to son, Armenians, king and date''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkeosev.blogspot.com/2011/02/dagl-kalesi-girisindeki-ermenice-yazt.html Page of Aarchaeology enthusiast] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">The '''Dead Media Project''' was initially proposed by science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]] in 1995 as a compilation of obsolete and forgotten communication technologies.&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/deadMedia/dM_Manifesto.html Dead Media Project: A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sterling's original motivation for compiling the collection was to present a wider historical perspective on communication technologies that went beyond contemporary excitement for the [[internet]], [[CD-ROM]]s and [[virtual reality|VR]] systems.  Sterling proposed that this collection take form as "The Dead Media Handbook" — a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, book about the failures, collapses and hideous mistakes of media. In raising this challenge he offers a "crisp $50 dollar bill" to the first person to publish the book, which he envisions as a "rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper [[coffee-table book]]".

After articulated in the manifesto "The Dead Media Project — A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal,"&lt;ref name="proposal" /&gt; The Dead Media Project began as a number of persons collecting their notes and the spreading of the archive through a mailing list, moderated by [[Tom Jennings]]. This resulted in a large collective of "field notes" about obsolete communication technologies, about 600 in total [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055700/http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index.html archived online]. The project lost momentum in 2001 and the mailing list died.

The project archive includes a wide variety of notes from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]]s and home computers of the 1980s. Dead still-image display technologies include the [[stereopticon]], the [[Protean View]], the [[Zogroscope]], the [[Polyorama Panoptique]], Frith's [[Cosmoscope]], Knight's [[Cosmorama]], Ponti's [[Megalethoscope]] (1862), Rousell's [[Graphoscope]] (1864), [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone's]] [[stereoscope]] (1832), and dead [[Viewmaster]] knockoffs.

In 2009, artist [[Garnet Hertz]] published a bookwork project titled "A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptlab.com/problems/ A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)]&lt;/ref&gt; which strived to fulfill some of [[Bruce Sterling]]'s vision for a handbook of obsolete media technologies.  In the book, Hertz presents images of many of the media technologies compiled through the Dead Media mailing list and invites readers to submit their sketches and ideas of a Dead Media Handbook.

[[File:Chinese - Wine Pot - Walters 44569 - Side (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Wine Pot'',  ca. 18th century, China, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_-_Wine_Pot_-_Walters_44569_-_Side_(cropped).jpg Walters Art Museum]]]
The '''decorative arts''' are arts or crafts whose object is the [[design]] and manufacture of objects that are both beautiful and functional. It includes [[interior design]], but not usually [[architecture]]. The decorative arts are often categorized in distinction to the "[[fine arts]]", namely [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and large-scale [[sculpture]], which generally produce objects solely for their [[aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] and capacity to stimulate the [[intellect]]. "[[Applied arts]]" is synonymous with the "decorative arts".

==Distinction from the fine arts==
[[File:Surahi national Museum India.JPG|thumb|right|Surahi, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], 17th Century CE. [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]
The distinction between the decorative and fine arts essentially arose from the post-[[Renaissance]] art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most valued works, or even all works, include those in decorative media. For example, [[Islamic art]] in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[plants in culture|plant forms]], as does the art of many traditional cultures. The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating [[Chinese art]], and neither is it for understanding Early [[Medieval art]] in [[Europe]]. In that period in [[Europe]], fine arts such as [[manuscript illumination]] and [[monumental sculpture]] existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in [[goldsmith]] work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as [[ivory carving]]. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for [[mosaic]], which for the period must be considered a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be considered decorative. The term "ars sacra" ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art executed in metal, ivory, textiles, and other more valuable materials but not for rarer secular works from that period.

==Influence of different materials==
Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine art media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media.  Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be "recycled" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed.  Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.

==Renaissance attitudes==
The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as [[Vasari]] promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the [[High Renaissance]], that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci]], reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity.  Most European art during the [[Middle Ages]] had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued.  In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries: [[ink and wash painting]], mostly of [[landscape art|landscapes]], was to a large extent produced by and for the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] or "literati", and was intended as an expression of the artist's imagination above all, while other major fields of art, including the very important [[Chinese ceramics]] produced in effectively industrial conditions, were produced according to a completely different set of artistic values.

==Arts and Crafts movement==
[[File:Artichoke wallpaper Morris and Co J H Dearle no borders.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arts and Crafts movement]] "Artichoke" wallpaper by Morris and Co.]]

The lower status given to works of decorative art in contrast to fine art narrowed with the rise of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. This aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was born in England and inspired by [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The movement represented the beginning of a greater appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts movement to a new generation led the English architect and designer [[Arthur H. Mackmurdo]] to organize the Century Guild for craftsmen in 1882, championing the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists' ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Arts and Crafts Movement |title=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2014|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37281/Arts-and-Crafts-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Arts and Crafts movement led to the decorative arts being given a greater appreciation and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law. Until the enactment of the Copyright Act 1911 only works of fine art had been protected from unauthorised copying. The 1911 Act extended the definition of an "artistic work" to include works of "artistic craftsmanship".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Section 35(1) |title=UK Legislation, Copyright Act 1911 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/46/section/35/enacted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Edmund Eldergill |url=http://www.vivalagoon.com/en/content/8-decorative-arts-copyright-uk |title=The Decorative Arts and Copyright |year=2012 |publisher=Lagoon Contemporary Furniture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecotheology''' is a form of [[constructive theology]] that focuses on the interrelationships of [[religion]] and [[nature]], particularly in the [[list of environmental issues|light of environmental concerns]]. Ecotheology generally starts from the [[premise]] that a relationship exists between human religious/spiritual [[world view|worldview]]s and the [[environmental degradation|degradation of nature]]. It explores the interaction between ecological values, such as [[sustainability]], and the human domination of nature. The movement has produced numerous religious-environmental projects around the world.

The burgeoning awareness of environmental crisis has led to widespread religious reflection on the human relationship with the earth. Such reflection has strong precedents in most religious traditions in the realms of [[ethics]] and [[cosmology]], and can be seen as a subset or corollary to  the theology of nature.

It is important to keep in mind that ecotheology explores not only the relationship between religion and nature in terms of [[environmental degradation|degradation of nature]], but also in terms of [[ecosystem management]] in general. Specifically, ecotheology seeks not only to identify prominent issues within the relationship between nature and religion, but also to outline potential solutions. This is of particular importance because many supporters and contributors of ecotheology argue that science and education are simply not enough to inspire the change necessary in our current environmental crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Valerie|title=The Rise of Ecotheology|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.4/brown.html|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The relationship of theology to the modern ecological crisis became an intense issue of debate in Western [[academia]] in 1967, following the publication of the article, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis, " by [[Lynn White]], Jr., Professor of History at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]]. In this work, White puts forward a theory that the Christian model of human dominion over nature has led to environmental devastation, providing a voice for "The Ecological Complaint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Lynn|title=The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/155/3767/1203.citation|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cengage|first=Gale|title=Ecotheology|url=http://www.enotes.com/ecotheology-reference/ecotheology|publisher=Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, theologian [[Jack Rogers (clergy)|Jack Rogers]] published an article in which he surveyed the published studies of approximately twelve theologians which had appeared since White's article. They reflect the search for "an appropriate theological model" which adequately assesses the biblical data regarding the relationship between God, humans, and nature.

==Precedents in religious thought==
Some scholars argue that Christians actually helped bring about the current global environmental crisis by instructing followers that God, and by extension mankind, transcends nature. Much of the development of ecotheology as a theological discourse was in response to this argument, which has been called "The Ecological Complaint". Defendants of this perspective essentially claim that [[Christianity]] promotes the idea of human dominion over nature, treating nature itself as a tool to be used and even exploited for survival and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cengage|first=Gale|title=Ecotheology|url=http://www.enotes.com/ecotheology-reference/ecotheology|publisher=Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Christianity has often been viewed as the source of positive values towards the environment, and there are many voices within the [[Christian tradition]] whose vision embraces the well-being of the earth and all creatures. While [[Francis of Assisi]] is one of the more obvious influences on Christian ecotheology, there are many theologians and teachers, such as [[Isaac of Nineveh]] and [[Seraphim of Sarov]], whose work has profound implications for Christian thinkers. Many of these are less well known in the West because their primary influence has been on the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Church]] rather than the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The significance of indigenous traditions for the development of ecotheology also cannot be overstated. Systems of [[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]], in combination with modern scientific methods of [[ecosystem management]], are steadily gaining interest as environmental activists realize the importance of locally invested groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Milton|title=The Nature and Utility of Traditional Ecological Knowledge|url=http://www.carc.org/pubs/v20no1/utility.htm|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further exploration==
Christian ecotheology draws on the writings of such authors as [[Jesuit]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[Passionists|Passionist]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and [[cultural historian|historian]] [[Thomas Berry]]. It is well represented in [[Protestantism]] by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]],  [[Jürgen Moltmann]], and [[Michael Dowd]]; in [[ecofeminism]] by [[feminist theology|feminist theologians]] [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]], and [[Sallie McFague]]; in Roman Catholicism by [[John F. Haught]]; and in [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodoxy]] by Elizabeth Theokritoff and George Nalunnakkal (currently Bishop [[Geevarghese Mor Coorilose]] of the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]). Besides works on theology per se, interpreters of the ecological significance of scripture, such as Ellen Davis,&lt;ref&gt;Scripture, Culture and Agriculture: An Agrarian Reading of the Bible (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; also play an important role.

[[Creation Spirituality]] is another important expression of ecotheology that has been developed and popularized by [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], a former Catholic [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar turned [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest.

[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] and [[Martin Buber]], both [[Judaism|Jewish]] philosophers, have also left their mark on [[Christianity and environmentalism|Christian ecotheology]], and provide significant inspiration for [[Judaism and environmentalism|Jewish ecotheology]]. The most recent and most complete expression of Jewish ecotheology to date can be found in [[David Mevorach Seidenberg]]'s work on [[Kabbalah]] and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabbalahandecology.com Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World] (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism|Hindu]] ecotheology includes writers such as [[Vandana Shiva]]. [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyid Hossein Nasr]], a [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialist]] scholar and [[Iranian philosophy|Persian]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], was one of the earlier Muslim voices calling for a reevaluation of the Western relationship to nature.

[[Elisabet Sahtouris]] is an  [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] and [[futures studies|futurist]] who promotes a vision she believes will result in the [[sustainability|sustainable]] health and well-being of humanity within the larger [[ecosystem|living system]]s of Earth and the cosmos. She is a lecturer in [[Gaia Theory]] and a coworker with [[James Lovelock]] and [[Lynn Margulis]].

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Image:End of cobbles.jpg|thumb|Strata turned sideways by [[Orogeny|orogenic]] forces near [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]]]]
The '''geologic record''' in [[stratigraphy]], [[paleontology]] and other [[natural sciences]] refers to the entirety of the layers of rock [[stratum|strata]] &amp;mdash; deposits laid down by [[volcanism]] or by [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition of sediment]] derived from [[weathering]] detritus ([[clay]]s, [[sand]]s etc.) including all its [[fossil]] content and the information it yields about the history of the Earth: its past [[climate]], geography, geology and the [[evolution]] of life on its surface. According to the [[law of superposition]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] rock layers are deposited on top of each other. They harden over time to become a solidified ([[Competence (geology)|competent]]) rock column, that may be intruded by [[igneous rock]]s and disrupted by [[tectonic]] events.

==Correlating the rock record==
[[Image:Horseshoe Canyon Alberta Nov 1988.jpg|thumb|Horseshoe Canyon Formations exposed in [[Horseshoe Canyon (Alberta)|Horseshoe Canyon]] near [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]]]]
At a certain locality on the Earth's surface, the rock column provides a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of the [[natural history]] in the area during the time covered by the age of the rocks. This is sometimes called the ''rock history'' and gives a window into the natural history of the location that spans many geological time units such as ages, epochs, or in some cases even multiple major [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]&amp;mdash;for the particular [[geography|geographic]] region or regions. The geologic record is in no one place entirely complete&lt;ref name= NRC &gt;{{Citation| author = Committee on the Geologic Record of Biosphere Dynamics, Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, Board on Life Sciences, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council| year = 2005| title = The Geological Record of Ecological Dynamics: Understanding the Biotic Effects of Future Environmental Change| publisher = National Academies Press| page = 14| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4gNzGoih00YC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=incomplete+geologic+record&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V1OgUJsRK3&amp;sig=2bm3WoJmIV9iFprktoRzojOJbSA&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y8XPU4mrFqPJsQTImoHwCg&amp;ved=0CHMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=incomplete%20geologic%20record&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Reference with religious character and not scientific: &lt;ref name="Burky1990"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-23|url=http://www.wcg.org/lit/booklets/science/burky2.htm|title=An Overview of the Geologic Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; for where geologic forces one [[age (geology)|age]] provide a low-lying region accumulating [[stratum|deposits]] much like a layer cake, in the next may have uplifted the region, and the same area is instead one that is [[weathering]] and being torn down by chemistry, wind, temperature, and water. This is to say that in a given location, the geologic record can be and is quite often interrupted as the ancient local environment was converted by geological forces into new [[landform]]s and features. Sediment core data at the mouths of large riverine drainage basins, some of which go {{convert|7|mi}} deep thoroughly support the law of superposition.

However using broadly occurring deposited layers trapped within differently located rock columns, geologists have pieced together a system of units covering most of the [[geologic time scale]] using the law of superposition, for where [[tectonics|tectonic forces]] have uplifted one ridge newly subject to [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] in [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] the strata, they have also created a nearby trough or [[structural basin]] region that lies at a relative lower elevation that can accumulate additional deposits. By comparing overall formations, geologic structures and local strata, calibrated by those layers which are widespread, a nearly complete geologic record has been constructed since the 17th century.

==Discordant strata example==
[[Image:Biostratigraphie usgs.png|thumb|left|USGS correlation diagram]]
Correcting for discordancies can be done in a number of ways and utilizing a number of technologies or field research results from studies in other disciplines.

In this example, the study of layered rocks and the fossils they contain is called [[biostratigraphy]] and utilizes amassed [[geobiology]] and [[paleobiology|paleobiological]] knowledge. Fossils can be used to recognize rock layers of ''the same or different [[age (geology)|geologic ages]]'', thereby coordinating locally occurring [[stage (geology)|geologic stages]] to the overall [[geologic time scale|geologic timeline]].

The pictures of the fossils of monocellular algae in this [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] figure were taken with a scanning electron microscope and have been magnified 250 times.

In the U.S. state of [[South Carolina]] three marker species of fossil algae are found in a core of rock whereas in [[Virginia]] only two of the three species are found in the [[Eocene]] [[series (geology)|Series]] of rock layers spanning three [[stage (geology)|stages]] and the geologic ages from 37.2&amp;ndash;55.8 [[Year#SI_prefix_multipliers|MA]].

Comparing the record about the discordance in the record to the full rock column shows the non-occurrence of the missing species and that portion of the local ''rock record'', from the early part of the middle Eocene is missing there. This is one form of discordancy and the means geologists use to compensate for local variations in the rock record. With the two remaining marker species it is possible to [[correlate]] rock layers of the same age (early Eocene and latter part of the middle Eocene) in both South Carolina and Virginia, and thereby "calibrate" the local rock column into its proper place in the overall geologic record.

==Lithology vs paleontology==
Consequently, as the picture of the overall rock record emerged, and discontinuities and similarities in one place were cross-correlated to those in others, it became useful to subdivide the overall geologic record into a series of component sub-sections representing different sized groups of layers within known geologic time, from the shortest time span [[stage (geology)|stage]] to the largest thickest strata [[eonothem]] and time spans [[eon (geology)|eon]]. Concurrent work in other natural science fields required a time continuum be defined, and earth scientists decided to coordinate the system of rock layers and their identification criteria with that of the geologic time scale. This gives the pairing between the physical layers of the left column and the time units of the center column in the table at right.

In [[religion]], [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]] "'''good and evil'''" is a very common [[dichotomy]]. In cultures with [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] and [[Abrahamic]] religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"&gt;Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. ''Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation''. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. P. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a [[Monism|oneness]].&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"/&gt;

[[Evil]], in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. Often, evil is used to denote profound [[immorality]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822012937/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, Jan 14, 2004. P. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[ethics|philosophical]] questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Meta-ethics]] concerning the nature of good and evil, [[Normative ethics]] concerning how we ought to behave, and [[Applied ethics]] concerning particular moral issues.

==History and etymology==

Every language has a word expressing ''good'' in the sense of "having the right or desirable quality" ([[Arete (moral virtue)|ἀρετή]]) and ''bad'' in the sense "undesirable". A sense of [[morality|moral judgment]] and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are [[cultural universals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630210030/http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm |date=2012-06-30 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
{{main article|Zoroastrianism}}
In the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran|Persia]] almost three thousand years ago a religious philosopher called [[Zoroaster]] simplified the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of early Iranian gods&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_6-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=6–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Dualistic cosmology|two opposing forces]]: [[Ahura Mazda]] ([[Light (theology)|Illuminating]] [[Wisdom]]) and [[Angra Mainyu]] ([[devil|Destructive Spirit]]) which were in conflict. 
{{main article|Gnosticism}}
This idea developed into a religion which spawned many [[sect]]s, some of which embraced an extreme [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] belief that the [[nature|material world]] should be shunned and the [[Sacred|spiritual world]] should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many [[Ancient history|ancient]] religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion| year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK|author=John Hinnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teach that ''[[gnosis]]'' (variously interpreted as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[salvation]], [[emancipation]] or [[Buddhahood|'oneness with God']]) may be reached by practising [[philanthropy]] to the point of personal [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence]] (as far as possible for ''[[wikt:disciple#Noun|hearers]]'', total for ''[[Initiation|initiates]]'') and diligently searching for [[wisdom]] by helping others.&lt;ref name=gph&gt;{{cite book |title=Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times|first=Tobias |last=Churton|publisher=Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company |date=2005|ISBN=978-159477-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ancient [[Egypt]], there were the concepts of [[Ma'at]], the principle of justice, order, and cohesion, and [[Isfet_(Egyptian_mythology)|Isfet]], the principle of chaos, disorder, and decay, with the former being the power and principles which society sought to embody where the latter was such that undermined society. This correspondence can also be seen reflected in ancient Mesopotamian religion as well in the conflict between [[Marduk]] and [[Tiamat]].

===Classical world===
In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], in particular [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Kahn, ''Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology'', The American Journal of Philology (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of [[Plato]], together with the emergence of [[monotheistic]] thought (notably in ''[[Euthyphro]]'', which ponders the concept of piety ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in [[Late Antiquity]] by [[Neoplatonists]], [[Gnostics]], and [[Church Fathers]].

This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ''[[ethics]]'' and ''[[morality]]'' both being derived from terms for "regional custom", Greek ήθος and Latin ''mores'', respectively (see also ''[[:wikt:siðr|siðr]]'').

===Medieval period===
Medieval theology was largely shaped by [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo, [[sin]] is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."[3][4]

Many medieval Christian [[theologian]]s both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of  ''Good and evil'' until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition|author=Farley, E|publisher=Fortress Press / Vanderbilt University|year=1990|isbn=978-0800624477}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
*a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn [[praise]] or [[punishment]] from the [[Theocracy|religious authorities]]
*religious obligation arising from [[Divine law]] leading to [[saint]]hood or [[damnation]]
*a generally accepted [[Norm (social)|cultural standard]] of behaviour which might enhance group [[Human evolution (origins of society and culture)|survival]] or [[wealth]]
*[[natural law]] or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction
*[[State (polity)|statute law]] imposing a legal [[duty]]

===Modern ideas===

Today the basic [[dichotomy]] often breaks down along these lines:
*''Good'' is a broad concept often associated with [[life]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], continuity, [[happiness]], [[love]], or [[justice]].
*''[[Evil]]'' is often associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The nature of ''being good'' has been given many treatments; one is that the good is based on the natural [[love]], bonding, and affection that begins at the earliest stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing [[truth]]. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an ''aberration'' that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. "[[The Fall of Man]]"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of [[free will]] and [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an [[ignorance]] of [[truth]] (i.e., human value, [[sanctity]], [[divinity]]). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical [[social structure]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Theories of moral goodness==
{{other uses of|good|Good (disambiguation)}}

===Chinese moral philosophy===
{{Main|Confucius#Ethics|Taoism#Ethics}}
In [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], there is no direct analogue to the way good and evil are opposed, although references to demonic influence is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Evil would thus correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|basic virtues of Taoism]] (compassion, moderation, and humility) can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W. Chan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Chinese Philosophy'' Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===

====Pyrrhonism====
[[Pyrrhonism]] holds that good and evil do not exist by nature, meaning that good and evil do not exist within the things themselves. All judgments of good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging. 

====Spinoza====
[[Benedict de Spinoza]] states:
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

====Nietzsche====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', where he essentially says that the natural functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong). He also makes a critique of morality by saying that many who consider themselves to be moral are simply acting from cowardice (wanting to do evil but scared of the repercussions).

=== Psychology ===

====Carl Jung====
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of the Devil''. People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906151252/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ |date=2008-09-06 }}: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philip Zimbardo ====
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183946/http://www.lucifereffect.com/ |date=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main article|Problem of evil}}

====Bahá'í Faith====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept for the lacking of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|author='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions |year=1982 |publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust |location=Wilmette, Ill. |isbn=0-87743-162-0 |translator=Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist, and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

====Buddhism====
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th Century Japan)]]
{{Main article|Buddhist Ethics}}

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer however from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226193619/https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2017-12-26 }} Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563-483 B.C.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. However, the main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 4.07-08&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. However, once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Moh]], or Attachment
*[[Lobh]], or Greed
*[[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
*[[Kaam]], or Lust
*[[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
*[[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

====Islam====
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] sense. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[Allah]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will to disobey Allah's orders. See [[Devil (Islam)]].

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, evil does not have a positive existence in itself and is merely the lack of good, just as darkness is the result of lack of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth | page=193 | accessdate=June 25, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225308/https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{see also|Yetzer hara}}
In [[Judaism]], no individual can be defined as categorically, absolutely "good" or "evil."  Judaism recognizes human beings' psychological complexity.  God gave the [[Children of Israel]] the [[Torah]] as a guide to overcome evil.  A common theme of [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish philosophy before Maimonides|medieval Jewish philosophy]] is that people who do good deeds will be rewarded in ''[[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]''.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html "Good &amp; Evil."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020040331/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html |date=2016-10-20 }} ''Jewish Virtual Library''.  2008.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has two conflicting attitudes toward the existence of evil.  In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions.  In the other interpretation, evil was created by God since God created everything and to suggest otherwise would be to engage in [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and is therefore antithetical to the core Jewish belief in [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="JVL" /&gt;

====Christianity====
{{see also|Devil#Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''contrary'' to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament.  Therefore, evil in a Christian world view is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God. Similarly, good according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''consistent'' with the character or the will of God, for God is good, the ultimate goodness. 

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises “the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.”&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.

====Zoroastrianism====
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battle ground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Descriptive, meta-ethical, and normative fields==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
It is possible to treat the essential theories of value by the use of a philosophical and academic approach. In properly analyzing theories of value, everyday beliefs are not only carefully ''catalogued'' and ''described'', but also rigorously ''analyzed'' and ''judged''.

There are at least two basic ways of presenting a theory of value, based on two different kinds of questions:
* What do people find good, and what do they despise?
* What really is good, and what really is bad?

The two questions are subtly different. One may answer the first question by researching the world by use of social science, and examining the preferences that people assert. However, one may answer the second question by use of reasoning, introspection, prescription, and generalization. The former kind of method of analysis is called "[[descriptive]]", because it attempts to describe what people actually view as good or evil; while the latter is called "[[Normative ethics|normative]]", because it tries to actively prohibit evils and cherish goods. These descriptive and normative approaches can be complementary. For example, tracking the decline of the popularity of slavery across cultures is the work of [[descriptive ethics]], while advising that slavery be avoided is normative.

[[Meta-ethics]] is the study of the fundamental questions concerning the nature and origins of the good and the evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language. In this respect, meta-ethics is not necessarily tied to investigations into how others see the good, or of asserting what is good.

==Theories of the intrinsically good==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
A satisfying formulation of goodness is valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration, or prioritization. One could answer the ancient question, "How should we then live?" among many other important related questions. It has long been thought that this question can best be answered by examining what it is that necessarily makes a thing valuable, or in what the source of value consists.

===Platonic idealism===
One attempt to define goodness describes it as a property of the world with [[Platonic idealism]]. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. [[Plato]] advocated this view, in his expression that there is such a thing as an eternal realm of [[substantial form|forms]] or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good.  The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint.  The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm.  The good is the [[harmony]] of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of [[virtues]], and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature.  The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.

A [[theism|theist]] is a person who believes that the [[God|Supreme Being]] exists or [[deity|gods]] exist ([[monotheism]] or [[polytheism]]). A theist may, therefore, claim that the universe has a purpose and value according to the will of such [[creator deity|creator]](s) that lies partially beyond human understanding. For instance, [[Thomas Aquinas]]—a proponent of this view—believed he had proven the [[existence of God]], and the right relations that humans ought to have to the divine [[first cause]].

Monotheists might also hope for infinite universal love. Such hope is often translated as "[[faith]]", and [[wisdom]] itself is largely defined within some religious doctrines as ''a knowledge and understanding of innate goodness.'' The concepts of [[innocence]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[wikt:Purity|purity]], and [[salvation]] are likewise related to a concept of being in, or returning to, a state of '' goodness''—one that, according to various teachings of "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]", approaches a state of ''holiness'' (or ''Godliness'').

===Perfectionism===
[[Aristotle]] believed that virtues consisted of realization of potentials unique to humanity, such as the use of reason. This type of view, called [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]], has been recently defended in modern form by [[Thomas Hurka]].

An entirely different form of perfectionism has arisen in response to rapid technological change. Some [[techno-optimist]]s, especially [[transhumanism|transhumanists]], avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, [[genetic engineering]] of humans, [[artificial intelligence]]. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by [[persuasion technology]] and probably brute force of violent [[technological escalation]], which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.

===Welfarist theories===
Welfarist theories of value say things that are good are such because of their positive effects on human well-being.

====Subjective theories of well-being====
It is difficult to figure out where an immaterial trait such as "goodness" could reside in the world. A counterproposal is to locate values inside people. Some philosophers go so far as to say that if some [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] does not tend to arouse a desirable subjective state in self-aware beings, then it cannot be good.

Most philosophers that think goods have to create desirable mental states also say that goods are experiences of self-aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call "inherent"  goods. Failing to distinguish the two leads to a [[subject–object problem]] in which it is not clear who is evaluating what object.

Some theories describe no higher collective value than that of maximizing ''pleasure'' for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called [[hedonism]], a ''monistic theory of value''. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean.

''Simple hedonism'' is the view that physical pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher [[Epicurus]] used the word 'pleasure' in a more general sense that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of the mind to bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness.

[[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham's]] book ''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'' prioritized goods by considering pleasure, pain and consequences. This theory had a wide effect on public affairs, up to and including the present day. A similar system was later named [[Utilitarianism]] by [[John Stuart Mill]]. More broadly, utilitarian theories are examples of Consequentialism. All utilitarian theories are based upon the ''maxim of utility'', which states that ''good'' is whatever provides ''the greatest happiness for the greatest number''. It follows from this principle that what brings happiness to the greatest number of people, is good.

A benefit of tracing good to pleasure and pain is that both are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may come in the form of ''empathy''—the ability of a being to "feel" another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the [[ethical relationship]] view and has given rise to the [[animal rights]] movement and parts of the [[peace movement]]. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] views, including [[David Hume]]'s stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and fellow feeling for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments.

A view adopted by James Griffin attempts to find a subjective alternative to hedonism as an intrinsic value. He argues that the satisfaction of one's informed desires constitutes well-being, whether or not these desires actually bring the agent happiness. Moreover, these preferences must be life-relevant, that is, contribute to the success of a person's life overall.

Desire satisfaction may occur without the agent's awareness of the satisfaction of the desire. For example, if a man wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it.

[[Meher Baba]] proposed that it is not the satisfaction of desires that motivates the agent but rather "a desire to be free from the limitation of all desires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad, and those experiences and actions which tend to emancipate the mind from limiting desires are good."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 93. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through good actions, then, that the agent becomes free from selfish desires and achieves a state of well-being: "The good is the main link between selfishness thriving and dying. Selfishness, which in the beginning is the father of evil tendencies, becomes through good deeds the hero of its own defeat. When the evil tendencies are completely replaced by good tendencies, selfishness is transformed into selflessness, i.e., individual selfishness loses itself in universal interest."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 31. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective theories of well-being====
{{See also|Wealth#separate analysis}}
The idea that the ultimate good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic ([[classical economics]], [[green economics]], [[welfare economics]], [[gross national happiness]]) and scientific ([[positive psychology]], the [[science of morality]]) [[measuring well-being|well-being measuring]] theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so-called [[genuine progress indicator]]. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and [[statistics]] replaces the simple ordering of values.

For example, in both economics and in folk wisdom, the value of something seems to rise so long as it is relatively scarce. However, if it becomes too scarce, it leads often to a conflict, and can reduce collective value.

In the classical [[political economy]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], and in its critique by [[Karl Marx]], ''human labour'' is seen as the ultimate source of all new economic value. This is an ''objective'' theory of value (see [[value theory]]), which attributes value to real production-costs, and ultimately expenditures of human labour-time (see also [[law of value]]). It contrasts with [[marginal utility]] theory, which argues that the value of labour depends on subjective preferences by consumers, which may however also be objectively studied.

The economic value of labour may be assessed technically in terms of its [[use-value]] or [[utility]] or commercially in terms of its [[exchange-value]], [[price]] or production cost (see also [[labour power]]. But its value may also be socially assessed in terms of its contribution to the [[wealth]] and [[well-being]] of a society.

In non-market societies, labour may be valued primarily in terms of skill, time, and output, as well as moral or social criteria and legal obligations. In market societies, labour is valued economically primarily through the [[labour market]]. The price of labour may then be set by supply and demand, by [[strike action]] or legislation, or by legal or professional entry-requirements into occupations.

====Mid-range theories====
[[Conceptual metaphor]] theories argue against both subjective and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] conceptions of value and meaning, and focus on the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an [[ontology]] problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some [[abstraction]] or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to understand each other's views.

==Philosophical questions==

=== Universality ===
[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You. Stop Him^ - NARA - 534297.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | title=Top 25 Political Icons - Adolf Hitler | work=Time | date=February 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | author=Sanburn, Josh | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826220011/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | archivedate=August 26, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about 50 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003). ''Government Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 83. {{ISBN|978-1-57356-153-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. However, the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the [[United States]]—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

The [[Nazism|Nazis]], during [[World War II]], considered [[genocide]] to be acceptable,&lt;ref name="evil"&gt;Gaymon Bennett, Ted Peters, Martinez J. Hewlett, Robert John Russell (2008). ''The evolution of evil''. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. p.318. {{ISBN|3-525-56979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[Hutu]] [[Interahamwe]] in the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="Gourevitch, 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gourevitch |first=Philip |title=We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With our Families |publisher=Picador |isbn=0-312-24335-9 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline: the triumph of evil.|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|accessdate=2007-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419061642/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil.{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2010}} Other universalists might argue that although the commission of an evil act is always evil, those who perpetrate may not be wholly evil or wholly good entities. To say that someone who has stolen a candy bar, for instance, becomes wholly evil is a rather untenable position. However, universalists might also argue that a person can choose a decidedly evil or a decidedly good life career, and genocidal dictatorship plainly falls on the side of the former.

Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps:

* [[Moral absolutism]] holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a [[deity]] or [[deities]], nature, morality, common sense, or some other source.
* [[Amoralism]] claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature.
* [[Moral relativism]] holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice.
* [[Moral universalism]] is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans.

[[Plato]] wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sources of Evil According to Plato |first=Harold |last=Cherniss |authorlink=Harold F. Cherniss |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=1954 |isbn=9004052356 |pages=23–30 |jstor=3143666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil, and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} in which the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983;1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessary evil===
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings... ."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women, or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodness and agency==

===Goodwill===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
[[John Rawls]]' book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to [[justice]]. Rawls defined justice as ''fairness'', especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals'  goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the [[original position]], a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations.

One problem{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} with the thinkings of Rawls is that it is overly procedural. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.

Applying procedural fairness to an entire society therefore seems certain to create recognizable inefficiencies {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, and therefore be unfair, and (by the equivalence of justice with fairness) unjust.

However, procedural processes are not always necessarily damning in this way. [[Immanuel Kant]], a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', it is important{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does—i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty—acting for the Summum Bonum for him, ''The Good Will''—and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} is that the outcome of the Orange's distribution would not be such a simple process for Kant as the reason why it would be wanted by both parties would necessarily have to be a part of the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.

===Society, life and ecology===
{{essay|section|date=September 2012}}
Many views value ''unity'' as a good: to go beyond [[eudaimonia]] by saying that an individual person's flourishing is valuable only as a means to the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of [[Confucianism]] are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society.

According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of society is not, or not the only, intrinsically good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to [[biology]], and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as [[Great Ape personhood]]. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value.

By another approach, one achieves peace and agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), but on the common environment.  The reasoning:  As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an [[ecosystem]] that supports [[life]]. Indeed, if we weren't, we could neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The [[anthropic principle]] in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] recognizes this view.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Under [[materialism]] or even [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] values, or in any system that recognizes the validity of [[ecology]] as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, [[Earth]]. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words,  good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning to be satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called [[Contentment|satisfaction]].

Values and the people that hold them seem necessarily subordinate to the ecosystem. If this is so, then what kind of being could validly apply the word "good" to an ecosystem as a whole? Who would have the power to assess and judge an ecosystem as good or bad? By what criteria? And by what criteria would ecosystems be modified, especially larger ones such as the [[atmosphere]] ([[climate change]]) or [[ocean]]s ([[extinction]]) or [[forests]] ([[deforestation]])?&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see debates on [[monoculture]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Remaining on Earth" as the most basic value. While [[green politics|green]] [[list of ethicists|ethicists]] have been most forthright about it, and have developed theories of [[Gaia philosophy]], [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]], [[bioregionalism]] that reflect it, the questions are now universally recognized as central in determining value, e.g. the economic "[[value of Earth]]" to humans as a whole, or the "[[value of life]]" that is neither whole-Earth nor human. Many have come to the conclusion that without assuming ecosystem continuation as a universal good, with attendant [[virtue]]s like [[biodiversity]] and [[ecological wisdom]] it is impossible to justify such operational requirements as [[sustainability]] of human activity on Earth.

One response is that humans are not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that only a tiny fraction of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do [[technological escalation]] on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that [[extraterrestrial life]] would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a [[locust]] species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no [[extraterrestrials]] who compete with [[humans]] to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] than it would take to construct some new habitat.

Accordingly, remaining on Earth, as a living being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement of the most basic values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable.

However, most religious systems acknowledge an [[afterlife]] and improving this is seen as an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks [[honour|honor]] or power over self is less desirable—consider [[seppuku]] in [[bushido]], [[kamikaze]]s or the role of [[suicide attack]]s in [[Jihadi]] rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value.

Radical values [[environmentalism]] can be seen as either a very old or a very new view: that the only intrinsically good thing is a flourishing ecosystem; individuals and societies are merely instrumentally valuable,  good only as means to having a flourishing ecosystem. The [[Gaia philosophy]] is the most detailed expression of this overall thought but it strongly influenced [[deep ecology]] and the modern [[Green Parties]].

It is often claimed that [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples never lost this sort of view. [[Anthropological linguistics]] studies links between their languages and the ecosystems they lived in, which gave rise to their [[knowledge]] distinctions. Very often, environmental cognition and [[moral]] cognition were not distinguished in these languages. Offenses to nature were like those to other people, and [[Animism]] reinforced this by giving nature "personality" via [[mythology|myth]]. [[Anthropological theories of value]] explore these questions.

Most people in the world reject older [[situated ethics]] and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.

===History and novelty===
{{wikiquote|goodness}}
{{wikiquote|evil}}

An event is often seen as being of value simply because of its ''novelty'' in fashion and art. By contrast, cultural history and other antiques are sometimes seen as of value in and of themselves due to their ''age''. Philosopher-historians Will and Ariel Durant spoke as much with the quote, "As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction" (The Lessons of History, 72).

Assessment of the value of old or historical artifacts takes into consideration, especially but not exclusively: the value placed on having a detailed knowledge of the past, the desire to have tangible ties to ancestral history, or the increased market value scarce items traditionally hold.

[[Creativity]] and [[innovation]] and [[invention]] are sometimes upheld as fundamentally good especially in Western industrial society—all imply newness, and even opportunity to profit from novelty. [[Bertrand Russell]] was notably pessimistic about creativity and thought that [[knowledge]] expanding faster than [[wisdom]] necessarily was fatal.

==Goodness and morality in biology==
The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with [[morality]], is regarded by some biologists (notably [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]], [[Jeremy Griffith]], [[David Sloan Wilson]] and [[Frans de Waal]]) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward Osborne |last=Wilson |authorlink= E.

'''Hazorasp''' ({{lang-uz|Hazorasp}}, Ҳазорасп), also known as '''Khazarasp''' ({{lang-ru|Хазарасп}}), or by its more ancient name '''Hazarasp''' ({{lang-fa|هزار اسپ}}, meaning ''"thousand horses"''), is a town in [[Uzbekistan]] at the head of the [[Amu Darya]] delta south of the [[Aral Sea]].  It was an important trading center during the medieval period. During its history, the town has been subject to various battles; between the [[Ghaznavid]] Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and the [[Ma'munids|Ma'munid]] ruler [[Abu'l-Harith Muhammad]] in 1017; between the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] and the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmian]] ruler [[Atsiz]] in 1147; and between the Khwarazmian ruler [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Muhammad II]] and the [[Ghurid]] ruler [[Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad]]. The town was finally destroyed during the [[Mongol invasions]].

The town was later rebuilt, and only retained some of its importance. It was later a stronghold under the [[Mongol]] [[Khanate of Khiva|Arabshahids]], and was also used as a residence by the Arabshahid princes. It was captured by the Russians during the [[Khivan campaign of 1873]]. The city has survived to present day, and is today a part of Uzbekistan. It was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on January 2008, in the Cultural category &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5310/ |title=Khazarasp - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Hindu philosophy''' refers to a group of ''darśanas'' (philosophies, world views, teachings)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in ancient [[India]]. These include six systems (''[[darśana|ṣaḍdarśana]]'') – [[Sankhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name=andrewoverview&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt; These are also called the [[Āstika and nāstika|Astika]] (orthodox) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the [[Vedas]] as authoritative, important source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="KK26" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|M Chadha (2015), in The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, states that Vedas were knowledge source but interpreted differently by different schools of Hindu philosophy: "The sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are variously interpreted by the six traditional Hindu philosophical schools. Even within a single school, philosophers disagree on the import of Vedic statements. (...) Hindu intellectual traditions must be understood as standing for the collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection. There is no single, comprehensive philosophical doctrine shared by all intellectual traditions in Hinduism that distinguishes their view from other Indian religions such as Buddhism or Jainism on issues of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, ethics or cosmology. The Vedas are regarded as Apauruseya, but by the same token, they are not the Word of God either.&lt;ref&gt;M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Elisa Freschi (2012): The Vedas are not [[Deontological ethics|deontic]] authorities in absolute sense and may be disobeyed, but are recognized as an [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority by an orthodox school of Hindu philosophy;&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Freschi (2012), Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004222601}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: This differentiation between epistemic and deontic authority is true for all Indian religions)}} Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called ''nāstika'' (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=andrewoverview/&gt;&lt;ref name="KK26" /&gt; Nāstika Indian philosophies include [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Ājīvika]], and others.&lt;ref name=bilimoriaastika&gt;P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies, such as the realism of the Nyāya, the naturalism of the Vaiśeṣika, the dualism of the Sāṅkhya, the [[monism]] and knowledge of Self as essential to liberation of Advaita, the self-discipline of yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.&lt;ref name=klaussaiva&gt;Klaus K.

==Classifications==
{{further|Āstika and nāstika}}
In the [[history of Hinduism]], the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Students' Britannica India (2000), Volume 4, Encyclopædia Britannica, {{ISBN|978-0852297605}}, page 316&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Hindu philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=98-102}}

Since ancient times Indian philosophy has been categorized into ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' schools of thought.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} The orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy have been called '''ṣaḍdarśana''' ("six systems"). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by [[Vedanta|Vedantins]].&lt;ref name=uh14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Andrew J. |title=Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history |date=2014 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSg0RGmMaTwC |isbn=9780231149877}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}} It was then adopted by the early Western [[indology|Indologists]], and pervades modern understandings of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=uh14/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

===Āstika===
There are six āstika (orthodox) schools of thought.{{refn|group=note|For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453–487.}} Each is called a [[darśana]], and each darśana accepts the [[Vedas]] as authoritative and the premise that ''[[ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' (soul, eternal self) exists.&lt;ref name="KK26"&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier]] (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Plott, James Dolin and Russell Hatton (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IAST|āstika}} schools are:
# [[Samkhya]], an atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of [[Purusha|consciousness]] and [[Prakṛti|matter]].
# [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], a school emphasising [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], [[Samadhi|contemplation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]].
# [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] or [[Indian logic|logic]], which explores [[pramana|sources of knowledge]]. ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]''.
# [[Vaiśeṣika]], an [[empiricism|empiricist]] school of [[atomism]].
# [[Mīmāṃsā]], an anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of [[orthopraxy]].
# [[Vedanta|Vedānta]], the last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or ''jñānakāṇḍa''. Vedānta came to be the dominant current of [[Hinduism]] in the post-medieval period.

===Nāstika===
{{see also|Buddhist philosophy|Jain philosophy}}
Schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are nāstika philosophies, of which four {{IAST|nāstika}} (heterodox) schools are prominent:&lt;ref name=bilimoriaastika/&gt;
# [[Cārvāka]], a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will.&lt;ref name=bhattacarv/&gt;&lt;ref name=bronkhorst/&gt;

==Overview==
===Epistemology===
{{main|Pramana}}
[[Epistemology]] is called [[pramana|pramāṇa]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. Pramāṇa is a Hindu theory of knowledge and discusses means by which human beings gain accurate knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} The focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=172}}

Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge.{{sfn|Guttorm Fløistad|1993|p=137-154}} For example, the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge,{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} the [[Samkhya]] school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony),{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}

==Sāmkhya==
{{Main|Samkhya}}

Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in [[Hinduism]],{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=232}} with origins in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[rationalism|rationalist]] school of [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref name="Mike Burley 2012 pages 43-46"/&gt; and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=royper&gt;Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 149-158&lt;/ref&gt; Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose [[epistemology]] accepted three of six ''[[Pramana|pramāṇas]]'' as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These were ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''sabda'' (''Āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

Samkhya school espouses [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] between consciousness and matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Michaels |first = Axel |title = Hinduism: Past and Present |year = 2004 |publisher = Princeton University Press |page=264 |isbn = 0-691-08953-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: ''[[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'' (consciousness) and ''[[prakriti]]'' (matter). ''[[Jiva]]'' (a living being) is that state in which ''puruṣa'' is bonded to ''prakriti'' in some form.&lt;ref name=sambri/&gt; This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of ''buddhi'' (awareness, intellect) and ''ahankara'' (individualized ego consciousness, “I-maker”). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.&lt;ref name=sambri&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520526/Samkhya Samkhya - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of [[Guṇa|gunas]] (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 154-206&lt;/ref&gt; Guna, it states, are of three types: ''Sattva'' being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; ''Rajas'' guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and ''Tamas'' being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three ''gunas'', but in different proportions.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay of these ''gunas'' defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.&lt;ref&gt;T Bernard (1999), ''Hindu Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1373-1}}, pages 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haney"&gt;Haney, William S., Culture and Consciousness: Literature Regained, Bucknell University Press (1 August 2002).

The ''[[Samkhyakarika|Samkhya karika]]'', one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be "three&lt;ref&gt;''adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika'' - that is, suffering caused internally by self, cause by other human beings, caused by acts of nature&lt;/ref&gt; kinds of human suffering" and means to prevent them.&lt;ref name=colebrookesktrans&gt;[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
From the triad of suffering, arises this inquiry into the means of preventing it.&lt;br /&gt;That is useless - if you say so, I say: No, because suffering is not absolute and final. – Verse 1&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Guṇa]]s (qualities) respectively consist in pleasure, pain and dullness, are adapted to manifestation, activity and restraint; mutually domineer, rest on each other, produce each other, consort together, and are reciprocally present. – Verse 12
Goodness is considered to be alleviating and enlightening; foulness, urgent and persisting; darkness, heavy and enveloping. Like a lamp, they cooperate for a purpose by union of contraries. – Verse 13&lt;br /&gt;
There is a general cause, which is diffuse. It operates by means of the three qualities, by mixture, by modification; for different objects are diversified by influence of the several qualities respectively. – Verse 16
Since the assemblage of perceivable objects is for use (by man); Since the converse of that which has the three qualities with other properties must exist (in man); Since there must be superintendence (within man); Since there must be some entity that enjoys (within man); Since there is a tendency to abstraction (in man), therefore soul is. – Verse 17

==Yoga==
{{main|Yoga (philosophy)}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] philosophical system aligns closely with the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] premises of the [[Samkhya]] school.&lt;ref name=edbryant&gt;Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''] IEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god ([[Ishvara]]), unlike Samkhya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= |last=Radhakrishnan |first=S. |authorlink=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |author2=Moore, CA |title=A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy |year=1967 |publisher=Princeton |location= |isbn=0-691-01958-4 |page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= |last=Zimmer |first=Heinrich |authorlink=Heinrich Zimmer |title=Philosophies of India |year=1951 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New York City |isbn=0-691-01758-1 }} Bollingen Series XXVI; Edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], page 280&lt;/ref&gt; The [[epistemology]] of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge:{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''śabda'' (''āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: [[purusha|puruṣa]] (consciousness) and [[prakṛti]] (matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as "seer, experiencer" and "seen, experienced" than the Samkhya school.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages x-xi, 101-107, 142 and Introduction chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

A key text of the Yoga school is the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. [[Patanjali]] may have been, as [[Max Müller]] explains, "the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras."&lt;ref&gt;Max Müeller, [https://archive.org/stream/sixsystemsofindi00mulliala#page/410/mode/2up The six systems of Indian philosophy], Longmans, page 410&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as [[rāja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga|jñāna yoga]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'' by Georg Feuerstein&lt;/ref&gt; [[karma yoga]], [[bhakti yoga]], [[tantra]] yoga, [[mantra]] yoga, [[Kundalini yoga|laya yoga]], and [[hatha yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and [[Tantra]]'', [[Georg Feuerstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that [[jñāna]] (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha.&lt;ref name=edbryant/&gt; Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of [[monism|monistic]] personalism.&lt;ref name=shphillips&gt;{{cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/ Personalism] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye (2006), Educated Imagination and Other Writings on Critical Theory, 1933-1962, University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0802092090}}, page 291&lt;/ref&gt; Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Mike McNamee and William J. Morgan (2015), Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415829809}}, pages 135-136, Quote: "As a dualistic philosophy largely congruent with Samkhya's metaphysics, Yoga seeks liberation through the realization that Atman equals Brahman; it involves a cosmogonic dualism: purusha an absolute consciousness, and prakriti original and primeval matter."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaiśeṣika==
{{main|Vaisheshika}}
The Vaiśeṣika philosophy is a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] school.&lt;ref name="Dale Riepe 1996 pages 227-246"/&gt; It is a form of [[atomism]] in natural philosophy.&lt;ref name=jganeri&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to ''paramāṇu'' ([[atom]]s), and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.&lt;ref name=olilv/&gt; Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vaiśeṣika school.&lt;ref name=olilv/&gt; The Vaiśeṣika darśana is credited to [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kaṇāda Kaśyapa]] from the second half of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=olilv&gt;Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, 1999, page 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Brannigan 2009 page 7"&gt;Michael Brannigan (2009), Striking a Balance: A Primer in Traditional Asian Values, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0739138465}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The foundational text, the ''[[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]]'', opens as follows:

{{Quote|Dharma is that from which results the accomplishment of Exaltation and of the Supreme Good. The authoritativeness of the Veda arises from its being an exposition of ''dharma''. The Supreme Good results from knowledge, produced from a particular ''dharma'', of the essence of the Predicables, Substance, Attribute, Action, Genus, Species and Combination, by means of their resemblances and differences.

Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 38-54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Vaiśeṣika school is related to the Nyāya school but features differences in its [[epistemology]], metaphysics and ontology.&lt;ref&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, pages 172-175&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school, like [[Buddhism]], accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable – perception and inference.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=225}} The Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}&lt;ref name="bilimoriaved"/&gt;

Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire). Each of these four are of two types:&lt;ref name=jganeri/&gt; atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible.&lt;ref name=jganeri/&gt; The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their [[guṇa]] (quality), ''karma'' (activity), ''sāmānya'' (commonness), ''viśeṣa'' (particularity) and ''amavāya'' (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).&lt;ref name=olilv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, pages 228-237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nyāya==
{{main|Nyāya}}

The Nyāya school is a [[philosophical realism|realist]] āstika philosophy.&lt;ref name=nyabri&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/423058/Nyaya Nyaya: Indian Philosophy] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=221-227}} The school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of [[logic]], methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;B Gupta (2012), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge and Freedom, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 171-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 223&lt;/ref&gt; The foundational text of the Nyāya school is the ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'' of the first millennium BCE. The text is credited to Aksapada Gautama and its composition is variously dated between the sixth and second centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] "Perception. An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge" (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Brannigan 2009 page 7"/&gt;

Nyāya epistemology accepts four out of six ''prāmaṇas'' as reliable means of gaining knowledge – ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}}

In its [[metaphysics]], the Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than the others.&lt;ref name=nyabri/&gt; It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance).&lt;ref&gt;Vassilis Vitsaxis (2009), Thought and Faith, Somerset Hall Press, {{ISBN|978-1935244042}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality.&lt;ref&gt;BK Matilal (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807174}}, pages 353-357&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyāya Sūtras begin:
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;Perception, Inference, Comparison and Word – these are the means of right knowledge.
Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable and non-erratic.
Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds: a priori, a posteriori, and commonly seen.
Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.
Word is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.
It [knowledge] is of two kinds: that which is seen, and that which is not seen.
Soul, body, senses, objects of senses, intellect, mind, activity, fault, transmigration, fruit, suffering and release – are the objects of right knowledge.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Mīmāṃsā==
{{main|Mīmāṃsā}}
The [[Mīmāṃsā]] school emphasized [[hermeneutics]] and [[exegesis]].&lt;ref name=olilm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 298-335&lt;/ref&gt; The classical Mīmāṃsā school is sometimes referred to as ''pūrvamīmāṃsā'' or ''Karmamīmāṃsā'' in reference to the first part of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=olilpm&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The [[Prabhākara|Prābhākara]] subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).&lt;ref name="dpsb"/&gt;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} The [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.&lt;ref name=olilpm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To them, [[dharma]] meant rituals and duties, not [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods), because devas existed only in name.&lt;ref name=olilpm/&gt; The Mīmāṃsākas held that the [[Vedas]] are "eternal authorless infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'' (injunctions) and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''karya'' (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the [[Upanishads]] and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the [[Vedanta]] school disagreed with.&lt;ref name=olilm/&gt;&lt;ref name=olilpm/&gt;

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools,&lt;ref&gt;Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), {{ISBN|978-3110181593}}, pages 23-24, 551-663&lt;/ref&gt; their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also ''describe'', ''develop'' and ''derive''.&lt;ref name=olilpm/&gt; Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasized ''karmakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the [[śruti]] which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized ''jñānakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).&lt;ref name=olilm&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedānta==

The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge:&lt;ref name=bilimoriaved&gt;P Bilimoria (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154&lt;/ref&gt; ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} All of these have been further categorized by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.&lt;ref name=bilimoriaved/&gt;

The emergence of Vedanta school represented a period when a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge. These focussed on ''jnana'' (knowledge) driven aspects of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and the Upanishads. This included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and [[Brahman]], and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77;&lt;br /&gt;JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), Oxford University Press, page 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251;&lt;br /&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advaita===
{{main|Advaita Vedanta}}
''Advaita'' literally means "not two, sole, unity". It is a sub-school of Vedanta, and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Advaita Vedanta] Sangeetha Menon (2012), IEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Nakamura | first =Hajime | year =1990 | title =A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy. Part One | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|pages=110–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its metaphysics is a form of absolute [[monism]], that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=239-244}}&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pages 10-14&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. The foundational texts of this school are the [[Brahma Sutras]] and the early [[Upanishads]] from the 1st millennium BCE.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=239-244}} Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar [[Adi Shankara]], who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher [[Gaudapada]]. He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/522509/Shankara Adi Shankara], Sengaku Mayeda, Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks (1969), The Meaning of 'Real' in Advaita Vedānta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 19, No. 4, pages 385-398&lt;/ref&gt; Its metaphysics includes the concept of [[Maya (illusion)|māyā]] and ātman. Māyā connotes "that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal".&lt;ref&gt;AC Das (1952), Brahman and Māyā in Advaita Metaphysics, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 2, No. 2, pages 144-154&lt;/ref&gt; The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore "transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be".&lt;ref&gt;H.M.

Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence.&lt;ref&gt;John Koller (2007), in Chad Meister and Paul Copan (Editors): The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-134-18001-1}}, pages 98-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sharmaadv/&gt; They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of ''māyā'' as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. [[Jivanmukta|Jīvanmukti]] (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (1993), The question of the importance of Samadhi in modern and classical Advaita Vedanta, Philosophy East &amp; West.

===Viśiṣṭādvaita===
{{Main|Vishishtadvaita}}
[[Ramanuja]] (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism. Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Viśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Etter|title=A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA62|date=30 April 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-39312-1|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja saw [[Vishnu]] as a personification of Brahman.

===Dvaita===
[[Dvaita]] refers to a theistic sub-school in [[Vedanta]] tradition of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hindu-ph/ Hindu Philosophy], IEP, Quote: "Dvaita: Madhva is one of the principal theistic exponents of Vedānta. On his account, Brahman is a personal God, and specifically He is the Hindu deity Viṣṇu.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also called as ''Tattvavāda'' and ''Bimbapratibimbavāda'', the Dvaita sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar [[Madhvacharya]].&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the [[Vedas]], espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities.&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"/&gt; The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of [[Vishnu]] or Brahman.&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"/&gt; Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Myers (2000), Brahman: A Comparative Theology, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712571}}, pages 124-127&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic [[Advaita Vedanta]], is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Etter (2006), A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism, iUniverse, pp. 59-60, {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Vishishtadvaita]] Vedanta subschool, Dvaita philosophy also embraced [[Vaishnavism]], with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with Vishnu and the one and only [[Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Edwin |last= Bryant| title=Krishna : A Sourcebook (Chapter 15 by Deepak Sarma)| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 2007| isbn= 978-0195148923| page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stokeriep&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhva (1238-1317) |first= Valerie| last= Stoker| publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011 |accessdate=29 February 2016| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/madhva/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the dualism of Dvaita was permanent.&lt;ref name=lochtefelddvaita/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeaneane D.

===Dvaitādvaita (Bhedabheda)===
[[Dvaitadvaita|Dvaitādvaita]] was proposed by [[Nimbarka]], a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter. Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent. Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is [[Krishna]] and his consort [[Radha]], attended by thousands of ''[[gopi]]s''; of the [[Vrindavan]]; and devotion consists in self-surrender.

===Śuddhādvaita===
[[Shuddhadvaita|Śuddhādvaita]] is the "purely non-dual" philosophy propounded by [[Vallabha Acharya]] (1479–1531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā [[sampradaya|sampradāya]] ("tradition of Vallabh") or [[Pushtimarg|''Puṣṭimārga'']], a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. [[Vallabhacharya]] enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world.&lt;ref&gt;Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, “Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)”, Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; That is why [[Shuddhadvaita]] is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire.&lt;ref&gt;“Brahmavād Saṅgraha”, Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acintya Bheda Abheda===
{{Main|Achintya Bheda Abheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534), stated that the soul or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, [[Govinda]], and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (''[[bhakti]]''). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html Lord Chaitanya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020607045307/http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html |date=7 June 2002 }} (krishna.com) "This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference."&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy of "inconceivable oneness and difference".

Much of the primary literature of Carvaka, the [[Barhaspatya sutras]] (ca. 600 BCE), however, are missing or lost.&lt;ref name=radhacarvaka/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2013), The base text and its commentaries: Problem of representing and understanding the Carvaka / Lokayata, Argument: Biannual Philosophical Journal, Issue 1, Volume 3, pages 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the [[shastra]]s, [[sutra]]s and the [[Indian epic poetry]] as well as from the texts of [[Buddhism]] and from [[Jain literature]].&lt;ref name=radhacarvaka/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Ramakrishna|title=Cārvāka Fragments: A New Collection|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|date=2002 |volume=30| issue = =6 |pages=597–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 53-58&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the widely studied principles of Cārvāka philosophy was its rejection of [[inference]] as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowell |first1=E.

==Shaivism==
{{Saivism}}
Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Tattwananda |first = Swami |year = 1984 |title = Vaisnava Sects, Saiva Sects, Mother Worship |place = Calcutta |publisher = Firma KLM Private Ltd. |edition = First Revised |page=45 |isbn =}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|''{{IAST|Śvetāśvatara}} Upanishad'']] (400 – 200 BCE){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=86}} is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Chakravarti |first = Mahadev |year = 1994 |title = The Concept of Rudra-Śiva Through The Ages |place = Delhi |publisher = Motilal Banarsidass |edition = Second Revised |page=9 |isbn = 81-208-0053-2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (''abheda''), dualist (''bheda''), and non-dualist-with-dualist (''{{IAST|bhedābheda}}'') perspectives. [[Vidyaranya]] in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought—[[Pashupata Shaivism]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and Pratyabhijña ([[Kashmir Shaivism]]).&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell and Gough (1882), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pāśupata Shaivism===
Pāśupata Shaivism (''Pāśupata'', "of Paśupati") is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (2003), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by ''[[Lakulish]]'' in the 2nd century CE. ''Paśu'' in [[Pashupati|Paśupati]] refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, soul possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Pāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, [[Classical element|four elements]] and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaiva Siddhanta===
Considered normative [[Tantra|Tantric]] Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Irudayaraj,"Saiva Siddanta," in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.10 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Irudayaraj, "Self Understanding of Saiva Siddanta Scriptures" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.14 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (2006), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace).&lt;ref&gt;Flood (2006), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the [[Nayanars]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=168}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===
Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, By Lakshman Jee&lt;/ref&gt; or ninth century CE&lt;ref&gt;Dyczkowski, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kashmir]] and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Śaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is categorised by various scholars as [[monistic]]&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, Swami Lakshman Jee, pp. 103&lt;/ref&gt; [[idealism]] ([[absolute idealism]], theistic monism, realistic idealism,&lt;ref name="vibration"&gt;Dyczkowski, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; transcendental physicalism or concrete monism&lt;ref name="vibration"/&gt;). It is a school of [[Śaivism]] consisting of [[Trika]] and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (2005), pp. 56–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness (''Chit'' or ''Brahman''),&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Jaideva. Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam. Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008. PP. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dyczkowski, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').&lt;ref&gt;Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, Advaita holds that Brahman is inactive (''niṣkriya'') and the phenomenal world is an illusion (''māyā'').&lt;ref&gt;Shankarananda, (Swami). Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism. PP. 56–59&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realize one's already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, K.  Kashmir Saivism, The Central Philosophy of Tantrism. PP. 330–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">''' House of Yahweh ostracon''' is the name sometimes given to Ostracon 18, a pottery sherd dated to the 6th century BCE found with a collection of other ostraca in the excavation of [[Tel Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel exploration journal reader. 1 (1981) edited by Harry Meyer Orlinsky P:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Life in Biblical Times By Oded Borowski P103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/arad.html|title=Ancient Arad|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription read as follow:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
To my lord Eliashib
May YHWH inquire after your well-being. 
And now, give to Shemaryahu a measure (of flour), and to the Kerosite you will give a measure (of flour). 
And concerning the matter about which you commanded me, it is well. 
He is staying in the house of YHWH.”
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

More than 100 ancient [[Ostracon|ostraca]] with [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo–Hebrew]] inscriptions were found on the same spot as well as at the Israelite Temple destroyed in 8th century BCE.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; As the temple of [[Tel Arad|Arad]] was already destroyed by the 6th century BCE, and as the ostraca refer to the place from where it was sent, after the period of [[Josiah]]'s religious reforms and the concentration of worship in Jerusalem, the temple referred to by the ostracon seems to be the [[First Temple|one in Jerusalem]], which if true would make the ostraca the only direct proof of the [[First Temple]]'s existence thusfar uncovered by archeology. This is further in accord with the fact that one of the bearers of the letter is a Kerosite, possibly related to the [[Nethinim]] that some consider to have been Temple slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521227179|page=397|author=T.C.

'''hprints''' ([[pronunciation|pronounced]] in [[English language|English]] as '''aitch prints''') is an [[archive]] for electronic [[preprint]]s of academic papers in the fields of [[humanities|arts and humanities]]. It can be accessed freely via the [[Internet]] since it is an [[open access]] [[repository (publishing)|repository]] aiming at making scholarly documents publicly available to the widest possible audience.

==The hprints project==
The aim of hprints is to make [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] research available through an open access online electronic full text archive, but the limitation to Nordic countries is claimed to be mainly an initial restriction for funding reasons. The archive will primarily contain electronic research documents in the form of preprints, reprints, working papers, book chapters, conference reports, invited lecture manuscripts etc. The archive is set up, maintained and promoted by [[Copenhagen University]] Library and consortium members. The consortium original members were:
* [[Copenhagen University]] Library, part of the [[Danish Royal Library]])
* The Faculty of Humanities, at [[Copenhagen University]]
* [[Lund University]] Library
* [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], an academic publisher
* [[University of Oslo]] Library
Submissions of electronic text material to the archive is decentral and take place at the local individual researcher, or research group level.

==Using hprints==
Hence hprints is a tool for scientific communication between academic scholars, who can upload full-text research material such as articles, papers, conference papers, book chapters etc. The content of the deposited material should be comparable to that of a scientific paper that a scholar would consider suitable for publication in for example a peer reviewed scientific journal.

It is possible to search and find the paper by defined topics through an Internet search. Secondly, all submitted papers are stored permanently and receive a stable web address, as for example the paper in this example:

 Pietism and the politics of catechisms
 Horstbøll H.
 Scandinavian Journal of History 29, 2 (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;143-160
 http://www.hprints.org/hprints-00254947/en/

==History==
May 2007 the Nordic funding agency for libraries, [[Nordbib]], granted the hprints project 287,000 DKK as part of its financing programme ''Work Package 2: Focus area on Content and Accessibility''. The plan was to launch an archive one year from this date i.e. approximately June 2008: The hprints project wishes to provide a policy and a technical infrastructure that permits [[open access]] to research within the arts and humanities. The assumption was that this will result in a number of advantages with respect to the electronic accessibility and visibility of the arts and humanities research area.

October 2007, the Advisory Board of the [[Nordbib]] "hprints project" chose the system to be used for the Nordic arts and humanities e-print archive. Three possible alternatives existed: [[EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], LUR from [[Lund University]] Libraries, and [[Hyper Articles en Ligne|HAL]] from the French national research council (CNRS). Both EPrints and LUR are free [[Open-source software|open source]] software that can be set up locally  or hosted commercially, while HAL is a functioning archive, to which portals can be set up.

At the hprints Advisory Board meeting in October, it was decided to collaborate with the French research council, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). Hence, the hprints e-print archive for Nordic arts and humanities is set up as a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] HAL portal with its own layout and adapted to the requirements of hprints.

March 2008 hprints opened for public access. Since the archive is a part of HAL and  papers will be shared with the French national archive.

==Career==
Epps Jr. came to California to become a director, but he did not have the money or know-how to do so. He decided to first write a script and to hope that this would lead to directing. Partnering with Anderson House, they sold a script to ''Hawaii Five-O''. He continued to work with House for a few years, before partnering with Jim Cash.&lt;ref name="Old School Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Jack Epps Jr. screenwriter of Top Gun &amp; more - Kickin' it Old School|url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1970118087|publisher=Old School Blog|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Gun'' and later successes===
After completing seven unproduced screenplays together, Epps Jr. and Cash produced ''Top Gun''. This film went on to become the number-one worldwide box office hit in 1986. After this, they quickly wrote other screenplays that were produced, including ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of my Success]]''. Epps co-authored over 25 screenplays and eight motion pictures that he produced well into the following decade, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' and ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]''.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie"&gt;{{cite web|title=JACK EPPS JR.|url=http://angelsintheskythemovie.com/the-talent-team/8-bios/14-jack-epps-jr|publisher=Angels in the Sky Movie|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for some of the most successful actors in the industry including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Warren Beatty]] and others.

==Teaching==
Epps Jr. is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Writing for Screen and Television Division in the School of Cinematic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jack-epps-jr&lt;/ref&gt; Using techniques he had developed over his career and applied to classes, he authored a screenwriting manual, ''Screenwriting is Rewriting: The Art and Craft of Professional Revision'', in 2016.

'''John Eleuthère du Pont''' (November 22, 1938 – December 9, 2010) was an American [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], heir to the [[Du Pont family]] fortune, and a convicted murderer.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He had been a published [[ornithology|ornithologist]], [[philately|philatelist]], [[conchology|conchologist]], sports [[enthusiast]], and self-styled wrestling coach. He died in prison while serving a sentence of 30 years for the murder of [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]].

In 1972, du Pont founded and directed the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] and contributed to [[Villanova University]] and other institutions.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In the 1980s, he established a wrestling facility at his [[William du Pont Jr.#Foxcatcher Farm|Foxcatcher Farm]] after becoming interested in the sport and the [[pentathlon]] events. He became a prominent supporter of [[amateur sports]] in the United States and a sponsor of [[USA Wrestling]].

In the 1990s, friends and acquaintances were concerned about his erratic and paranoid behavior, but his wealth shielded him.&lt;ref name="Longman"/&gt;

On February 25, 1997, he was convicted of [[third-degree murder#Pennsylvania|murder in the third degree]] for the January 26, 1996, shooting death of [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]], an Olympic champion [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle wrestler]] living and working on du Pont's estate. He was ruled to have been mentally ill but not insane and was sentenced to prison for 13 to 30 years. He died in prison at age 72 on December 9, 2010. He was the only member of the [[Forbes 400]] richest Americans ever to be convicted of murder.

Du Pont is the subject of the [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Foxcatcher]],'' in which he is portrayed by [[Steve Carell]], who earned an Oscar nomination for his performance.

==Early life==
[[File:John du Pont at the University of Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|John du Pont (pictured bottom left) during his time at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]]]
John du Pont was born on November 22, 1938, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the youngest of four children of [[William du Pont, Jr.]] and Jean Liseter Austin (1897–1988). He grew up at Liseter Hall, a mansion built in 1922 in [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square, Pennsylvania]], by his maternal grandfather on more than 200 acres of land given to his parents at their wedding by his maternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="mid-atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|title=Last hurrah for historic Liseter Hall Farm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726085931/http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|archivedate=2011-07-26|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred|date= September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents' families had emigrated from Europe to the United States at the beginning of the 19th century and became highly successful.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the couple acquired more land and developed Liseter Hall Farm for Thoroughbred breeding, showing, and racing. His mother retained Liseter Hall Farm after the couple divorced in 1941. She added a dairy herd of [[Guernsey cattle|Guernseys]] and bred [[Welsh pony|Welsh ponies]] at the farm. John was 2 when his parents divorced. He had two older sisters, Jean and Evelyn, an older brother Henry E. I. du Pont, and a younger half brother, William du Pont III, born of their father's second marriage.

Du Pont graduated from [[Haverford School]] in 1957. He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he belonged to the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity, and withdrew before completing his freshman year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|last2=Bensen|first2=Clea|title=The Prince Of Newtown Square John Du Pont Had Millions But Lacked The Thing He Really Wanted: Expertise.

Owre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James A. Kushlan|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v108n03/p0705-p0705.pdf |title=IN MEMORIAM: OSCAR T.

Du Pont went on to complete a [[doctorate]] in natural science from [[Villanova University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DuPont heir dies in prison|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/12/09/DuPont-heir-dies-in-prison/63641291931466/|accessdate=9 September 2015|agency=UPI|date=Dec 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an October 2015 podcast, [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] revealed that when John was about 30 years old, a horse he was riding threw him onto a fence, injuring his [[testicles]]. They became infected and were [[Orchiectomy|removed]], resulting in [[Androgyny|androgynous]] characteristics for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast| url=http://www.ontheblockradio.com/episodes/2015/9/4/episode-4-mark-schultz| title=Episode 7 - Mark Schultz| website=On the Block Radio.com| host=Andrew Gurevich| date=October 25, 2015| time=1:04:45| access-date=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science career==
During his graduate work, du Pont participated in several scientific expeditions to study and identify species of birds in the Philippines and South Pacific. As an [[Ornithology|ornithologist]], du Pont is credited with the discovery of two dozen species of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Newsweek staff|title=AN ECCENTRIC HEIR'S WRESTLE WITH DEATH|url=http://www.newsweek.com/eccentric-heirs-wrestle-death-179902|accessdate=9 June 2016|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munroe|first1=John|title=History of Delaware|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&amp;pg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20dupont%20founded%20delaware%20museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he served on the board, helping guide the institution toward opening in 1972.

==Personal life==
At the age of 45, on September 3, 1983, du Pont married 29-year-old Gale Wenk, an occupational therapist. They met after he injured his hand in an auto accident.&lt;ref name=hewitt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hewitt|first1=Bill|title=A Man Possessed|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20102757,00.html|accessdate=December 14, 2014|work=People Magazine|date=February 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived together for less than six months.&lt;ref name=mainline&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pirro|first1=J.F.|title=The Foxcatcher Murder|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/May-2014/The-Foxcatcher-Murder/|accessdate=December 14, 2014|work=MainLine Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Pont filed for divorce when they had been married for ten months. Wenk sued du Pont for $5 million, claiming he had pointed a gun at her and tried to push her into a fireplace.&lt;ref name=hewitt/&gt; The divorce became final in 1987.&lt;ref name=mainline /&gt; Du Pont's will excluded her from inheriting any of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Will and Testament of John Eleuthere du Pont|date=September 16, 2010|url=http://archive.delawareonline.com/assets/pdf/BL175750617.PDF|website=Delaware Online|accessdate=December 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213114959/http://archive.delawareonline.com/assets/pdf/BL175750617.PDF|archivedate=December 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, it was estimated that John du Pont was worth $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/2014/08/03/foxcatcher-fodder-john-du-ponts-bizarre-downfall/13556321/ |title='Foxcatcher' fodder: John du Pont's bizarre downfall |publisher=Courierpostonline.com |date=2015-01-11 |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==
[[File:British Guiana 13.jpg|thumb|The British Guiana 1c magenta postage stamp]]

===Philately===
Du Pont was also a [[Philately|philatelist]]. Bidding anonymously in a 1980 auction, he paid $935,000 for one of the rarest stamps in the world, the [[British Guiana]] 1856 [[British Guiana 1c magenta|1c black on magenta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Rachlin | first= Harvey | title=Lucy's Bones, Sacred Stones, and Einstein's Brain: The Remarkable Stories Behind the Great Artifacts of History, From Antiquity to the Modern Era| publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-8050-6406-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, this stamp was sold at auction for $9.5 million (inclusive of buyer's premium) at Sotheby's June 17, 2014. For the fourth time, the stamp broke the record for a single stamp's sale.&lt;ref name="delaware20140618" /&gt; The unique stamp was part of the estate of du Pont. According to du Pont's will—unsuccessfully challenged by several parties—80 percent of the sale proceeds go to the family of Bulgarian wrestler [[Valentin Yordanov|Valentin Jordanov Dimitrov]] and 20 percent goes to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Foundation, based in Paoli, Pennsylvania, a group du Pont founded to support Pacific wildlife.&lt;ref name="delaware20140618"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2014/06/18/stamp-owned-delaware-murderer-john-du-pont-sells-million/10723161/ |title=Stamp owned by Delaware murderer John du Pont sells for $9.5 million |publisher=Delawareonline.com |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, competing as "John Foxbridge", he won the Grand Prix d'Honneur in the [[Federation Internationale de Philatelie|FIP]] Championship Class at the [[STOCKHOLMIA 86]] international [[stamp exhibition]] for his display of "British North America".&lt;ref&gt;"The Three Previous Stockholmia World Philatelic Exhibitions" by Bengt Bengtsson, ''Bulletin 1'', STOCKHOLMIA2019, Sweden, 2017, pp. 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; While du Pont continued to buy stamps while in prison, he was not allowed to bring them there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestampblog.com/1/post/2015/03/john-dupont-and-collecting-stamps-in-jail.html "John du Pont and collecting stamps in jail"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529195944/http://www.thestampblog.com/1/post/2015/03/john-dupont-and-collecting-stamps-in-jail.html |date=May 29, 2015 }} The Stamp Blog, March 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
After his mother's death, du Pont developed the {{convert|440|acre|km2|adj=on}} Liseter Hall Farm in [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square]] as a high-quality wrestling facility for amateur wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos-pa.com/ |title=The Value of Open Space, Save Open Space, Everything Old is New Again |work=Save Open Space |date=April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208135541/http://sos-pa.com/ |archivedate=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the private group "Team Foxcatcher," after his father's noted racing stable. Du Pont established an Olympic swimming and wrestling training center and sponsored competitive events at the estate. He also allowed some people, such as Olympic champion wrestlers [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] and later his older brother [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] and his wife, to live in houses on the grounds for years. Dave Schultz also coached the Foxcatcher team.

Du Pont became a sponsor in wrestling, swimming, track, and the [[modern pentathlon]]. He was also involved in promoting a subset of the modern pentathlon (run, swim, shoot) as a separate event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080219/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303001523/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080219/index.htm|archivedate=2014-03-03| author=Alice Higgins|title=Trials Of A Busy Pentathlete: Young John du Pont, host to the national championships, found that organizing the event could be a handicap for a dedicated competitor|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=August 28, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/ns/history/bookonline/part_3_11.asp Chapter XI: "20th-Century Personages and the Arts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726151845/http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/ns/history/bookonline/part_3_11.asp |date=July 26, 2011 }}, ''Historic Newtown Square'', Newtown Square Historical Preservation Society&lt;/ref&gt; He took up athletics and became a competitive wrestler in his 50s. His only prior wrestling experience was as a freshman in high school. He began competing again at the age of 55 in the 1992 Veteran's World Championships in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]; following that in 1993 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; in 1994 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silverbackswrestling.com/wldfs94.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071336/http://silverbackswrestling.com/wldfs94.html|archivedate=2011-07-16|title=SILVERBACKS: 1994 Masters 3rd Freestyle Wrestling World Championships|website=silverbackswrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1995 in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].

==Lawsuit==
In August 1988, a problem-plagued wrestling program he funded at Villanova was shut down after just two years. In December 1988, a lawsuit (which was settled out of court) claimed du Pont had made improper sexual advances to Villanova assistant coach Andre Metzger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/3586290/blood-on-the-mat/|title=Blood on the Mat: The killing of an Olympic gold medalists suggest that John du Pont, patron of wrestling, was no angel|author=John Greenwald|date=February 5, 1996|publisher=Time Magazine|others=Mubarak Dahir, Sharon E. Epperson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Dave Schultz==
On January 26, 1996, du Pont shot and killed [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] in the driveway of Schultz's home on du Pont's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate. Schultz's wife Nancy and du Pont's head of security Patrick Goodale were present and witnessed the crime. The security chief was sitting in the passenger seat of du Pont's car when du Pont fired three bullets into Schultz. Police did not establish a motive. Schultz had worked with du Pont to coach the wrestling team for years.&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Longman |first1=Jere|last2=Belluck|first2=Pam |last3=Nordheimer |first3=Jon|title=For du Pont Heir, Question Was Control|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/us/a-life-in-pieces-for-du-pont-heir-question-was-control.html |work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont's friends said the shooting was uncharacteristic. Joy Hansen Leutner, a triathlete from [[Hermosa Beach, California]], lived for two years on the estate.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-31/sports/sp-35663_1|page=2|author=Randy Harvey|title=Signposts to a Tragedy – Du Pont Heir|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leutner said du Pont helped her through a stressful period in the mid-1980s. She later said, "With my family and friends, John gave me a new lease on life. He gave more than money; he gave himself emotionally." She expressed incredulity about the killing.

King's son, Charles "Chuckie" King Jr., said he considered du Pont his friend during his childhood.

Many people had noticed du Pont's increasingly disruptive behavior in the months before the murder.&lt;ref name="Harvey" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 3 of 3 --&gt; Charles King Sr. blames du Pont's "security consultant", Patrick Goodale, for influencing what happened. King said, "I don't think John could shoot someone unless he was pushed to, or was on drugs. After that guy started hanging around him, my son always said Johnny changed. He was scared of everything. He was always a little off. But I never had problems with him, and my son never had problems."&lt;ref name="In Memory of a Murder"/&gt; After the shooting, du Pont locked himself in his mansion for two days while he negotiated with police on the telephone. Police turned off his power and were able to capture him when he went outside to fix his heater. In September 1996, du Pont was ruled incompetent to stand trial, as experts testified that he was [[psychotic]] and could not participate in his own defense. He was committed to a mental hospital and his condition was to be reviewed by the court in three months.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-25/news/mn-47411_1_john-e-du-pont |agency=Associated Press|title=Du Pont Is Ruled Incompetent for Trial in Killing of Wrestler|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 September 1996|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, one of the defense's expert [[psychiatric]] witnesses described du Pont as a [[schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]] who believed Schultz was part of an international conspiracy to kill him.&lt;ref name="vigoda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vigoda|first1=Ralph|last2=Ordine|first2=Bill|title=Defense Doctors: Du Pont Feared He Was Target Of Conspiracy He Worried About The Russians, One Said.

Du Pont pleaded "not guilty by reason of insanity." The insanity defense was thrown out by the court, and on February 25, 1997, a jury found him guilty of [[third-degree murder#Pennsylvania|third-degree murder]] but [[mentally ill]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{ cite web |author=[[CNN]] |title=Du Pont guilty but mentally ill in Olympic wrestler's murder |date=25 February 1997 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/25/dupont.verdict/reax.html |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, third-degree murder is a lesser charge than first-degree (intentional) or second-degree (a passionate killing or a killing occurring during the perpetration of a felony), and indicates a lack of intent to kill. In Pennsylvania criminal code, "insanity" applies to someone whose "disease or defect" leaves him unable either to understand that his conduct is wrong or to conform it to the law (The M'Naghten Rule).&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/pennsylvania/crimes-and-offenses/index.html Law and Legal Research, Lawyers, Legal Websites, Legal News and Legal Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418163325/http://law.onecle.com/pennsylvania/crimes-and-offenses/index.html |date=April 18, 2009 }}, Onecle, Crimes And Offenses – 18 Pa.

The jury verdict of "guilty but mentally ill" meant the sentencing would be referred to the judge, Patricia Jenkins. She could have sentenced du Pont to 5 to 40 years. Du Pont was sentenced to 13 to 30 years' incarceration and was housed at the [[State Correctional Institution – Mercer]], a minimum-security institution in the Pennsylvania prison system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/14/us/heir-sentenced-up-to-30-years-for-killing-of-olympic-wrestler.html|title=Heir Sentenced Up to 30 Years For Killing of Olympic Wrestler|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 14, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Pont was initially confined to [[State Correctional Institution – Cresson|Cresson Correctional Institute]].&lt;ref name="mid-atlantic"/&gt; Following the guilty verdict, Nancy Schultz, Dave's widow, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against du Pont. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', citing anonymous sources, reported du Pont was to pay Schultz at least $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Pont, Wrestler's Widow Settle Suit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/28/063r-112899-idx.html|publisher=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont's attorneys filed appeals. In 2000, his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the verdict. Du Pont was first eligible for parole on January 29, 2009; it was denied. Du Pont's maximum sentence would have ended on January&amp;nbsp;29, 2026, when he would have been 87.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/151512 What Ever Happened to: Imprisoned Chemical Heir John du Pont?].

==Death==
Du Pont died at the age of 72 on December 9, 2010, from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). A spokesperson for the [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] said du Pont was found unresponsive in his bed at the [[State Correctional Institution – Laurel Highlands]].

==Philanthropy and institutions==
Du Pont founded the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] in 1957, which opened to the public in 1972 on a site near [[Winterthur, Delaware|Winterthur]] donated by his relative [[Henry Francis du Pont]]. John du Pont served on the board for many years. He also helped fund a new [[basketball]] arena at [[Villanova University]], which opened in 1986. Originally it was called the John Eleuthère du Pont Pavilion, but after his conviction, his name was removed from the facility. Today it is called [[The Pavilion]].

===Foxcatcher Farm===
After his mother's death in 1988, du Pont assumed stewardship of Liseter Farm and renamed it "Foxcatcher Farm" after his father's famed [[Thoroughbred]] racing stable.&lt;ref name=mdhorse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm |author=Michael Yockel|title=Last hurrah for historic Liseter Hall Farm|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred|date=September 2005|accessdate=October 23, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325183033/http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|archivedate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; John never lived in the manor house; he occupied a smaller house on the estate. Days after his mother's death, he moved into the main house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-02-02/news/25656683_1_jean-liseter-austin-foxcatcher-farm-du-pont |title=When Life In The Du Pont Mansion Began To Crumble At Foxcatcher, The Obsessions Of The Son Quickly Overrode His Dead Mother's Blueblood Elegance|publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained much of her work, but added a wrestling facility and supporting buildings for that interest.

After his arrest, du Pont sold off the dairy herd, nearly 70 [[Guernsey cattle|Guernseys]], in the fall of 1996. He ordered all the buildings at Foxcatcher Farm to be painted a matte black. The Delaware Museum of Natural History, which du Pont formerly headed and which held the dairy farm in trust, sold that portion in January 1998 after his conviction and sentencing to prison. A {{Convert|123|acre|km2|adj=mid}} segment is now occupied by the campus of the [[Episcopal Academy]], a private independent K–12 school founded in 1785, which moved there in 2008 from split campuses located in the nearby [[Philadelphia Main Line]] communities of [[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]] and [[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, Jeff [http://articles.philly.com/2007-10-21/news/25233421_1_episcopal-leaders-rohm-haas-campus "Episcopal Academy prepped for big change Expansion trumps angst over move from Merion"], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 90-year-old du Pont mansion, Liseter Hall, in which du Pont was raised and had lived for 57 years, was demolished by Glenn Miller Demolition in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Bannan, Pete [http://www.mainlinemedianews.com/articles/2013/01/25/main_line_suburban_life/news/doc510172af81da4619756296.txt "Historic DuPont mansion goes under the wrecker's ball"] ''Main Line Media News'', January 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion stood on a {{Convert|400|acre|km2|adj=mid}} portion of the property that is now being developed by [[Toll Brothers]] into a "master planned community of 449 luxury homes" called "Liseter Estate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10145149.htm "Liseter Estate at Route 252 and Goshen Road in Newtown Square to be Developed by Toll Brothers"] PRWeb, November 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the outbuildings were torn down, though an existing 7,000-square-foot historical barn will be used as a clubhouse in the new development.

==Disputed will==
Du Pont had been worth an estimated US$200 million in 1986, about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000000|1986|r=-7}}}} in current dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2010/12/10/death-in-prison-for-ex-forbes-400-member/ |title=Death In Prison For Ex-Forbes 400 Member |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed 80 percent of his estate to [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] wrestler [[Valentin Yordanov]], an Olympic champion who had trained at Foxcatcher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.bg/bg/faculty/department/branch,5/subpage,113 |script-title=bg:Знаменити борци, възпитаници на НСА |trans-title=Famous Wrestlers from the National Sports Academy |publisher=[[National Sports Academy "Vasil Levski"]]|accessdate=20 February 2015 |language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yordanov's relatives. In June 2011, du Pont's niece Beverly A. du Pont Gauggel and nephew William H. du Pont filed a petition to challenge the will in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], asserting that du Pont was not "[[Non compos mentis|of sound mind]]" when he made his will. The petition claims that during that period, John du Pont asserted alternately that he was [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Dalai Lama]], and a Russian [[tsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://delcotimes.com/articles/2011/06/15/news/doc4df80d533d6a9358592494.txt?viewmode=fullstory|author=Alex Rose|title=Du Pont Relatives Contest Validity of Late Killer's Will|publisher=Delaware County Daily Times|date=June 15, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311063815/http://delcotimes.com/articles/2011/06/15/news/doc4df80d533d6a9358592494.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archive-date=March 11, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-judge panel of the Superior Court affirmed that ruling on November 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="superiorcourt"/&gt;

[[File:Kai-Donner-1916.jpg|thumb|150px|Kai Donner in 1916.]]
'''Kai (Karl) Reinhold Donner''' (April 1, 1888 in [[Helsinki]] &amp;ndash; February 12, 1935) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] linguist, [[ethnography|ethnographer]] and [[politician]]. He carried out expeditions to the [[Nenets people|Nenets people (Samoyeds)]] in [[Siberia]] 1911&amp;ndash;1914 and was [[docent]] of [[Uralic languages]] at the [[University of Helsinki]] from 1924. He was, among other things, a pioneer of modern anthropological fieldwork methods, though his work is little known in the English-speaking world.

Donner was the son of professor (later senator) [[Otto Donner]], himself a noted philologist. Kai Donner studied [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugrian]] philology at the University of Helsinki from 1906. In 1909, he studied at Cambridge under [[James Frazer]], [[A.C. Haddon]], and [[W.H.R. Rivers]] at the same time as his better-known contemporary, [[Bronisław Malinowski]].

Studying the [[Finno-Ugrian peoples]] of Siberia had become an important part of the "national sciences" — Finno-Ugrian philology and ethnology, folklore studies, and archaeology — that arose in answer to the interest in national "roots" that followed the "National Awakening" of the mid-19th century. Kai Donner had decided early on that he wanted to follow in the footsteps of pioneer philologist and explorer M.A. Castrén (1813–1852) and study the peoples who lived beyond the Urals. On his first trip (1911–1913) he traveled along the upper reaches of the Ob and most of the Yenisei. His second trip took him to the Ob, Irtysh, and upper Yenisei. Living with the Nenets and Khant people, Donner studied not only the language but also the way of life and beliefs of his hosts. His travelogue, "Bland Samojeder i Sibirien åren 1911-1913, 1914" ("Among the Samoyeds in Siberia in the years 1911-1913, 1914"), was first printed in 1915.

During World War I, Donner was active in the Finnish independence movement which was secretly sending young men to Germany to receive military training in preparation for an armed struggle for independence from Imperial Russia. Betrayed to the [[Okhrana]] in 1916, he fled to Sweden and lived there and in [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] as a refugee until 1918. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], Kai Donner served as General [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]]'s [[aide-de-camp]].

In the 1920s and early 1930s he was one of the more influential leaders of the [[political right|rightist]] [[Lapua Movement]]. [[Finland-Swedish]] by mother tongue, he expressed reservations about the persecution of Swedish speakers, which was commonly supported by conservative Finns in those decades.

He was the father of the Finnish politician and film producer [[Jörn Donner]] and geologist Joakim Donner. He is buried in the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa – merkittäviä vainajia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Helsingin seurakuntayhtymä|access-date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7054">This is a '''list of impeached Nigerian state governors''' since the inception of democracy in 1999.

[[Nigeria]] is a country organized into [[States of Nigeria|36 state]], and a [[Federal territory]] ([[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|FCT]]).  Each state is governed by a Governor who is elected for a four-year term through an election process by an independent body known as  [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC), while the FCT is administered by a Minister appointed by the president.  Under certain terms and conditions, the Governor may be replaced by another, for example through death, impeachment or if an election is annulled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13820">It is common practice in legal documents to cite to other publications by using standard abbreviations for the title of each source. Abbreviations may also be found for common words or legal phrases. Such citations and abbreviations are found in court decisions, statutes, regulations, journal articles, books, and other documents. Below is a basic list of very common abbreviations. Because publishers adopt different practices regarding how abbreviations are printed, one may find abbreviations with or without periods for each letter. For example, the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' may appear abbreviated as "C.F.R." or just as "CFR."

For abbreviations not found in this list, here are alternate websites to search:

==Terminology==
[[Transgender]] (trans) is the state of one's [[gender identity]] or gender expression not matching one's [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]]. Transgender men are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] female at birth who identify as men. Transgender women are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] male at birth who identify as women. Some gender nonconforming people do not [[Gender identity|identify]] with either male or female. [[Cisgender]] men and women are individuals whose gender experiences conform to the sex assigned to them at birth.

[[File:Dečani4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Dečani Monastery]]]]
The '''Medieval Monuments in Kosovo''' are a [[World Heritage Site]] consisting of four [[Serbian Orthodox Christian]] churches and [[Serbian monasteries|monasteries]] which represent the fusion of the eastern Orthodox [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and the western [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ecclesiastical architecture to form the Palaiologian Renaissance style. The construction was founded by members of [[Nemanjić dynasty]], the most important dynasty of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]]. The sites are located in the disputed territory of [[Kosovo]].

In 2004, [[UNESCO]] recognized the '''[[Visoki Dečani monastery|Dečani monastery]]''' for its outstanding universal value. Two years later, the site of patrimony was extended as a serial nomination, to include three other religious monuments: [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] and [[Gračanica monastery]].

In 2006 the property was inscribed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] due to difficulties in its management and conservation stemming from the region's political instability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/268 World Heritage Committee puts Medieval Monuments in Kosovo on Danger List and extends site in Andorra, ending this year’s inscriptions], ''[[UNESCO|UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]'', July 13, 2006. Accessed April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO controversy==
There is an ongoing controversy over Kosovo's bid to join the UNESCO, which would result in the sites being listed as part of Kosovo and not Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/kosovo-serbia-fights-unesco-membership/27320037.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments have come under attack, especially during the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|ethnic violence]] in 2004, during Kosovo's [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] rule, when the [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] was heavily damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safeguarding of Cultural Heritage in Kosovo |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection and Preservation of Cultural Heritage in Kosovo |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001395/139567eb.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2005|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Violence: Ethnic Albanian Attacks on Serbs and Roma |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/kosovo0704/7.htm|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reconstruction Implementation Commission for Serbian Orthodox Religious Sites in Kosovo|url=http://www.coe.int/t/DG4/CULTUREHERITAGE/COOPERATION/RIC/inc/eng/home.html|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 Kosovo was recommended for membership by the UNESCO Executive Board. The bid for membership was voted at the UNESCO General Conference in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/kosovo-serbia-unesco-membership/27319064.html|title = Kosovo Moves Closer To UNESCO Membership|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tomislav Nikolić]], [[President of Serbia]], posted at his YouTube channel a video about the destruction of churches and attacks on monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kU1JwflxFg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isa Mustafa]], Prime Minister of [[Kosovo]] stressed "the positive campaign that Kosovo is leading" for its UNESCO bid. He condemned the Serbian leadership for their "string of unimaginable attacks that have nothing to do with the truth." Mr. Mustafa also underscored that the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo will continue to enjoy "the protection and retain[s] rights, privileges and immunity" and that Kosovo had given "international guarantees" for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kryeministri-ks.net/?page=1,9,5336|title = Kryeministri Isa Mustafa: Kosova e meriton të bëhet pjesë e UNESCO-s|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] has not accepted [[Kosovo]] as a member, the proposal failed to gain a two-thirds majority at the organization's General Conference in [[Paris]] on November 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://tass.ru/en/world/834899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/09/world/europe/ap-unesco-kosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of primary reasons for this rejection of Albanian request&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_id=95418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.mk/articles/21960/Albania+Applied+for+Kosovo's+Admission+to+UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-kosovo-hopes-to-join-unesco-vows-to-protect-serb-heritage-2015-11&lt;/ref&gt; is [[2004 unrest in Kosovo]], when 35 [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches were [[Desecration|desecrated]], damaged or destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/DG4/CULTUREHERITAGE/COOPERATION/RIC/inc/eng/docs/2005_eng.pdf RIC, RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION COMMISSION FOR ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS SITES IN KOSOVO ACTIVITY REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b92"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=65852|title=Six years since March violence in Kosovo |publisher=[[B92]] |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] which is a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;For details and photos see here: http://www.spc.rs/eng/prizren_our_lady_ljevis_xiv_century_burnt_inside_photo_2232004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and here: "Around 900 houses and 35 churches and monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church were set on fire, including mediaeval holy sites such as the Church of Our Lady of Ljevis in Prizren which dates back to the 14th century."  http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/52282.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The church is subject to constant looting - even of its construction material, specifically valuable lead has repeatedly been stolen from the roof.&lt;ref&gt;See the link: {{cite web |url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2011/04/church-roof-stolen-in-prizren-bishop-protests/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223130309/http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2011/04/church-roof-stolen-in-prizren-bishop-protests/ |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumption of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary into Heavens''' ({{lang-es|Catedral Metropolitana de la Asunción de la Santísima Virgen María a los cielos}}) is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="View of Guadalupe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peerlesstravel.com/view/176:11/israel/Guadalupe/ |title=View of Guadalupe |accessdate=2012-05-22 |publisher=PEERLESS |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428213219/http://peerlesstravel.com/view/176:11/israel/Guadalupe/ |archive-date=2012-04-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated atop the former [[Aztec]] sacred precinct near the [[Templo Mayor]] on the northern side of the [[Plaza de la Constitución]] in Downtown Mexico City.  The cathedral was built in sections from 1573 to 1813 around the original church that was constructed soon after the [[Spanish conquest]] of [[Tenochtitlan]], eventually replacing it entirely.  Spanish architect [[Claudio de Arciniega]] planned the construction, drawing inspiration from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Spain.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761586713/Catedral_de_M%C3%A9xico.html |title=Catedral metropolitana de México |accessdate=2008-09-18 |publisher=MSN |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKd4Ddo?url=http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761586713/Catedral_de_M%C3%A9xico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, México D.F., México, 2013-10-16, DD 95.JPG|thumbnail|Organ]]
The cathedral has four [[façade]]s which contain [[Portal (architecture)|portal]]s flanked with columns and statues.  The two [[bell tower]]s contain a total of 25 bells. The tabernacle, adjacent to the cathedral, contains the [[baptistery]] and serves to register the parishioners.  There are two large, ornate altars, a [[sacristy]], and a choir in the cathedral.  Fourteen of the cathedral's sixteen [[chapel]]s are open to the public.  Each chapel is dedicated to a different saint or saints, and each was sponsored by a [[Confraternity|religious guild]]. The chapels contain ornate [[altar]]s, [[altarpiece]]s, [[retablo]]s, paintings, furniture and sculptures.  The cathedral is home to two of the largest 18th-century [[organ (music)|organ]]s in the Americas. There is a [[crypt]] underneath the cathedral that holds the remains of many former archbishops.

Over the centuries, the cathedral has suffered damage. A fire in 1967 destroyed a significant part of the cathedral's interior. The restoration work that followed uncovered a number of important documents and artwork that had previously been hidden.    Although a solid foundation was built for the cathedral,&lt;ref name="EncMex"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alvarez |first=Jose Rogelio |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico |title=Catedral de Mexico |year=2000 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=3 |location=Mexico City |isbn=1-56409-034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the soft clay soil it is built on has been a threat to its structural integrity.  Dropping [[water table]]s and accelerated sinking caused the structure to be added to the [[World Monuments Fund]] list of the 100&amp;nbsp;Most Endangered Sites. Reconstruction work beginning in the 1990s stabilized the cathedral and it was removed from the endangered list in 2000.&lt;ref name="Sacred Destinations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/mexico/mexico-city-cathedral.htm |title= Metropolitan Cathedral Mexico City |accessdate=2008-09-18 |publisher=Sacred Destinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the [[conquistadors]] decided to build their church on the site of the [[Templo Mayor]] of the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]] to consolidate Spanish power over the newly conquered domain. [[Hernán Cortés]] and the other conquistadors used the stones from the destroyed temple of the Aztec god of war [[Huitzilopochtli]], principal deity of the Aztecs, to build the church.&lt;ref name="Sacred Destinations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  Cortés ordered the original church's construction after he returned from exploring what is now [[Honduras]]. Architect Martín de Sepúlveda was the first director of this project from 1524 to 1532. [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first [[Bishop]] of the first [[Episcopal see|See]] of the [[New World]], established in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], promoted this church's completion. Zumárraga's [[Cathedral]] was located in the northeast portion of what is now the cathedral.  It had three naves separated by three [[Tuscan column]]s.  The central roof was ridged with intricate carvings done by Juan Salcedo Espinosa and gilded by Francisco de Zumaya and [[Andrés de la Concha]]. The main door was probably of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]].  The choir area had 48&amp;nbsp;seats made of [[Pinus ayacahuite|ayacahuite]] wood crafted by Adrian Suster and Juan Montaño.  However, this church was soon considered inadequate for the growing importance of the capital of New Spain.

In 1544, ecclesiastical authorities in [[Valladolid]] ordered the creation of new and more sumptuous cathedral. In 1552, an agreement was reached whereby the cost of the new cathedral would be shared by the Spanish crown, [[encomendero]]s and the native inhabitants under the direct authority of the archbishop of New Spain.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;  The cathedral was begun by being built around the existing church in 1573.  When enough of the cathedral was built to house basic functions, the original church was demolished to enable construction to continue.&lt;ref name="Sacred Destinations"/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Mexico DF Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Interior of Mexico City Cathedral]]
The cathedral was constructed over a period of over two centuries, between 1573 and 1813. Its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated during the colonial period, [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classic]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

Initial plans for the new cathedral were drawn up and work on the foundation began in 1562. The decision to have the cathedral face south instead of east was made in 1570.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; In the same year, construction commenced, working from the Gothic designs and models created by [[Claudio de Arciniega]] and [[Juan Miguel de Agüero]], inspired by cathedrals found in Spanish cities such as [[Valladolid]] and [[Jaén Cathedral|Jaén]].&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;

Because of the muddy subsoil of the site, work on the foundation continued past the work on the walls to 1581. In 1585, work on the first of the cathedral's chapels began and by 1615, the cathedral's walls reached to about half of their final height.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; Construction of the interior of the current cathedral began in 1623&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciudadmexico.com.mx/atractivos/catedral.htm |title=Cathedral Metropolitan |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what is now the vestry was where Mass was conducted after the first church was finally torn down.&lt;ref name="arsvirtual-history"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.arsvirtual.com/visitas/visitas/catedral_mexico/alta/mexico/mexico.htm |title=Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City –History |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313170508/http://www.arsvirtual.com/visitas/visitas/catedral_mexico/alta/mexico/mexico.htm |archivedate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1629, work was interrupted by flooding,&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; over two metres in depth. Parts of the city were damaged, especially around the main plaza or [[Zocalo]].&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |encyclopedia= Enciclopedia de Mexico |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Mexico City |isbn=1564090345 |volume= 16 |pages=8273–8280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of such damage, this site was almost abandoned and a new cathedral project was begun in the hills of the [[Tacubaya]] area to the west.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

Despite these problems, the project continued in its current location, and under the direction of [[Luis Gómez de Transmonte]], the interior was finished and consecrated in 1667.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico" /&gt;  The cathedral still lacked bell towers, the complete front facade, and many of the other features it has now at the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

In 1787, [[José Damian Ortiz de Castro]] was in charge of finishing work on the cathedral. He did most of the work on the bell towers, putting in most of the [[fretwork]] and capping them with roofs in the shape of bells. With his death in 1793, he did not live to see the cathedral completed, and [[Manuel Tolsá]] finished the cathedral by adding  the [[cupola]], the central front facade, the [[balustrade]]s, and the statues of Faith, Hope and Charity at the top of the front facade. Tolsa's work was the last major construction to the cathedral and the appearance it had when he finished is the basic look the cathedral has today.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The cathedral faces south and is approximately {{convert|54.5|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|110|m|ft}} long. It consists of two [[bell tower]]s, a central [[dome]], three main [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], five [[nave]]s, 51&amp;nbsp;vaults, 74&amp;nbsp;arches and 40&amp;nbsp;columns. Inside the cathedral are five large [[altar]]s, sixteen [[chapel]]s, a choir area, a corridor, capitulary room, and sacristy. The cathedral has approximately 150&amp;nbsp;windows.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galind |first=Carmen |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exterior==

===Facades and portals===
[[File:MainPortalCathedralDF.JPG|thumb|upright|left|150px|Main portal with view of clock]]
The main facade of the cathedral faces south.  The main [[portal (architecture)|portal]] is centered in the main [[facade]] and is the highest of the cathedral's three portals.  Statues of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] stand between the columns of the portal, while [[Saint Andrew]] and [[James the Just]] are depicted on the secondary doorway.  In the center of this doorway is a [[High relief#High relief|high relief]] of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Virgin Mary]], to whom the cathedral is dedicated.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  This image is flanked by images of [[Saint Matthew]] and [[Saint Andrew]].  The [[coat of arms of Mexico]] is above the doorway, with the eagle's wings outstretched.  There is a clock tower at the very top of the portal with statues representing Faith, Hope and Charity, which was created by sculptor [[Manuel Tolsá]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The west facade was constructed in 1688 and rebuilt in 1804.  It has a three-section portal with images of the [[Four Evangelists]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;  The west portal has high reliefs depicting [[Jesus]] handing the [[Keys of Heavens]] to Saint Peter.

The east facade is similar to the west facade.  The reliefs on the east portal show a ship carrying the four [[apostles]], with Saint Peter at the helm.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  The title of this relief is ''The ship of the Church sailing the seas of Eternity.''&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The northern facade, built during the 16th&amp;nbsp;century in the [[Herrerian|Renaissance Herrera]] style, is oldest part of the cathedral and was named after [[Juan de Herrera]], architect of the [[El Escorial]] monastery in Spain.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; While the eastern and western facades are older than most of the rest of the building, their third level has [[Solomonic column]]s which are associated with the Baroque period.

All the high reliefs of the portals of the cathedral were inspired by the work of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

===Bell towers===
[[File:Mexico City Cathedral bell tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The west bell tower]]
The [[bell tower]]s are the work of [[Xalapa]]n artist José Damián Ortiz de Castro.  They are capped with bell-shaped roofs made of [[tezontle]] covered in ''chiluca'', a white stone. Ortiz de Castro was in charge of the cathedral's construction in the latter half of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century until he died, unexpectedly.  [[Manuel Tolsá]] of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], who had built other notable buildings in Mexico City, was hired to finish the cathedral. At this point, the cathedral had already been 240&amp;nbsp;years in the making. He added the neo-Classic structure housing the clock, the statues of the three theological virtues ([[Theological virtues|Faith, Hope, and Charity]]), the high [[balustrade]] surrounding the building, and the dome that rises over the [[transept]].

The cathedral has 25&amp;nbsp;[[Bell (instrument)|bells]]—eighteen hang in the east bell tower and seven in the west tower. The largest bell is named the ''Santa Maria de Guadalupe'' and weighs around {{convert|13000|kg|lb}}. Other major bells are named the ''Doña Maria'', which weighs {{Convert|6900|kg}}, and ''La Ronca'' ("the hoarse one"), named so because of its harsh tone. Doña Maria and La Ronca were placed in 1653 while the largest bell was placed later in 1793.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The statues in the west tower are the work of [[José Zacarías Cora]] and represent [[Pope Gregory VII]], [[Saint Augustine]], [[Leander of Seville]], St. [[Fulgentius of Écija]], St.[[Francis Xavier]], and [[Saint Barbara]]. The statues in the east tower are by [[Santiago Cristóbal Sandoval]] and depict Emilio, [[Rose of Lima]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]], [[Ambrogio]], [[Jerome]], [[Philip of Jesus]], [[Hippolytus of Rome]], and [[Isidore the Laborer]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

In 1947, a novice bell ringer died in an accident when he tried to move one of the bells while standing under it.  The bell swung back and hit him in the head, killing him instantly.  The bell was then "punished" by removing the clapper. In the following years, the bell was known as ''la castigada'' ("the punished one"), or ''la muda'' ("the mute one"). In 2000, the clapper was reinstalled in the bell.&lt;ref name="eluniversal_lacastigada"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cancino |first=Fabiola |title=Restauran el reloj de la Catedral tras nueve años |publisher=El Universal Online México, S.A. de C.V |date=2006-07-21 |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/vi_77995.html |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October&amp;nbsp;2007, a [[time capsule]] was found inside the stone ball base of a cross, in the southern bell tower of the cathedral.  It was placed in 1742, supposedly to protect the building from harm. The lead box was filled with religious artifacts, coins and parchments and hidden in a hollow stone ball. The ball was marked with the date of 14&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1791, when the building's topmost stone was laid.  A new time capsule will be placed in the stone ball when it is closed again.&lt;ref name="timecapsule"&gt;{{cite news |last=PMC |title=Found atop Mexico City Cathedral - Time capsule from 1791 |url=http://mexicotrucker.com/2008/01/17/found-atop-mexico-city-cathedral-time-capsule-from-1791/ |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tabernacle===
[[File:EntranceSagrariumDF.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Tabernacle's southern façade, opening out towards the Zócalo.]]
Situated to the right of the main cathedral, the Metropolitan Tabernacle (Spanish: ''Sagrario Metropolitano'') was built by [[Lorenzo Rodríguez]] during the height of the Baroque period between 1749 and 1760,&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; to house the archives and vestments of the archbishop.&lt;ref name="lonely"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lonely Planet Mexico City |last=Noble |first=John |year=2000 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |location=Oakland, CA |language=Spanish |isbn=1-86450-087-5 |pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also functioned and continues to function as a place to receive [[Eucharist]] and register parishioners.&lt;ref name="oficial"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad de Mexico |last=Horz de Via |first=Elena |year=1991 |publisher=INAH-SALVAT |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-32-0540-2 |pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first church built on the cathedral site also had a tabernacle, but its exact location is unknown. During the construction of the cathedral, the [[tabernacle]] was housed in what are now the Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady of Agony of Granada. However, in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral.&lt;ref name="oficial"/&gt; It is constructed of ''[[tezontle]]'' (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone in the shape of a [[Greek cross]] with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[File:MainAltarSagrariumDF.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Tabernacle's main altar]]
The interiors of each wing have separate uses. In the west wing is the [[baptistry]], in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by inside corner walls made of ''chiluca'' stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] of the structure is an octagonal [[dome]] framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet at the top of the dome.&lt;ref name="oficial"/&gt; The principal altar is in the ornate ''Churrigueresque'' style and crafted by indigenous artist [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]]. It was inaugurated in 1829.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The exterior of the Baroque styled tabernacle is almost entirely adorned with decorations, such as curiously shaped niche shelves, floating drapes and many [[cherubs]]. Carvings of fruits such as grapes and [[pomegranates]] have been created to in the shape of ritual offerings, symbolizing the [[Blood of Christ]] and the Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous ''[[chalchihuite]]''.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The tabernacle has two main outside entrances; one to the south, facing the Zócalo and the other facing east toward Seminario Street. The southern façade is more richly decorated than the east façade. It has a theme of glorifying the Eucharist with images of the [[Apostles]], Church Fathers, saints who founded [[Institute of Consecrated Life|religious orders]], [[martyr]]s as well as scenes from the [[Bible]]. Zoomorphic reliefs can be found along with the anthropologic reliefs, including a rampaging lion, and the eagle from the [[coat of arms of Mexico]]. The east facade is less ambitious, but contains figures from the [[Old Testament]] as well as the images of [[John Nepomucene]] and [[Ignacio de Loyola]]. Construction dates for the phases of the tabernacle are also inscribed here.&lt;ref name="oficial"/&gt;

===Altars===
====High Altar====
This disappeared in the forties of the twentieth century. On the occasion of the Jubilee of the year 2000, a new altar table was made to replace the previous one. This was built in modernist style by the architect Ernesto Gómez Gallardo.

====Altar of Forgiveness====
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, México D.F., México, 2013-10-16, DD 84.JPG|thumb|right|The Altar of Forgiveness]]
The Altar of Forgiveness ({{lang-es|Altar del perdón|links=no}})is located at the front of the central nave. It is the first aspect of the interior that is seen upon entering the cathedral. It was the work of Spanish architect [[Jerónimo Balbás]], and represents the first use of the ''estípite'' column (an inverted triangle-shaped [[pilaster]]) in the Americas.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

There are two stories about how the name of this altar came about. The first states that those condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] were brought to the altar to ask for forgiveness in the next world before their execution. The second relates to painter [[Simon Pereyns]], who despite being the author of many of the works of the cathedral, was accused of [[blasphemy]]. According to the story, while Pereyns was in jail, he painted such a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary that his crime was forgiven.&lt;ref name="forasteros"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia de Forasteros Centro Historico Ciudad de Mexico |last=Cano de Mier |first=Olga |year=1988
|publisher=Guias Turisticas Banamex |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |pages=32–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This altar was damaged by fire in January 1967 but has been completely restored.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

====Altar of the Kings====
[[File:Altar of the kings.JPG|thumb|upright|150px|Altar of the Kings]]
The [[:es:Retablo de los Reyes|Altar of the Kings]] ({{lang-es|Altar de los Reyes|links=no}}) was also the work of Jerónimo Balbás, in Mexican [[Baroque]] or [[Churrigueresque]] style.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  It was begun in 1718 by Balbás&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; in cedar, and was gilded and finished by Francico Martínez, debuting in 1737.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;  It is located at the back of the Cathedral, beyond the Altar of Forgiveness and the [[choir (architecture)|choir]].  This altar is {{convert|13.75|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|25|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} deep. Its size and depth gave rise to the nickname ''la cueva dorada'' ("the golden cave").

It takes its name from the statues of saintly royalty which form part of its decoration,&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; and is the oldest work in churrigueresque style in Mexico, taking 19&amp;nbsp;years to complete.  At the bottom, from left to right, are six female royal saints: [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]], [[Helena of Constantinople]], [[Elisabeth of Hungary]], [[Elizabeth of Aragon]], [[Cunigunde of Luxemburg|Empress Cunegunda]] and [[Edith of Wilton]]. In the middle of the altar are six canonized kings, four of whom are: [[Hermenegild]] a [[Visigoth]] martyr, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]] of Poland. Above these four are Saints [[Louis IX of France|Louis of France]] and [[Ferdinand III of Castile]]. In between these kings an oil painting of the ''Adoration of the Magi'' by [[Juan Rodriguez Juarez]] shows Jesus as the ''King of kings''. The top portion features a painting of the ''Assumption of Mary'' as celestial queen flanked by oval [[bas relief]]s, one of [[Saint Joseph]] carrying the infant Jesus and the other of Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] with a quill in her hand and the Holy Spirit above her, inspiring her to write. Above this are figures of Jesus and Mary among sculptures of angels crowned with an image of God, the Father.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

This altar has been under restoration since 2003.&lt;ref name="arsvirtual-history"/&gt;

===Sacristy===
The Herrera door opens into the [[sacristy]], the oldest part of the cathedral. It is a mixture of Renaissance and Gothic styles.

The walls hold large canvases painted by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], such as ''The Apotheosis of Saint Michael'', ''The Triumph of the Eucharist'', ''The Church Militant and the Church Triumphant'', and ''The Virgin of the Apocalypse''.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  The ''Virgin of the Apocalypse'' depicts the vision of [[John of Patmos]].&lt;ref name="Epoca"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1 April 2002 |title=Catedral Metropolitano: 478 años de historia |journal=Epoca |volume=565 |pages=52–59 |publisher=Archdiocese of Mexico |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other canvases, ''Entering Jerusalem'' and ''The Assumption of the Virgin'', painted by [[Juan Correa]], are also here.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; An additional painting, attributed to [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]], hangs in the Sacristy.

On the north wall, there is a niche that holds a statue of the crucifix with a Christ image sculpted in ivory. Behind this, is another mural that depicts the [[Juan Diego]]'s of [[Virgin of Guadalupe|Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. The Sacristy used to house Juan Diego's cloak, upon which the Virgin's image purportedly appears, but after massive flooding in 1629, it was removed from the Sacristy to better protect it.&lt;ref name="Epoca"/&gt;

A cabinet on the west wall of the Sacristy, under the ''Virgin of the Apocalypse'' painting, once held golden [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s and cups trimmed with precious stones, as well as other utensils.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1957, The wooden floor and platform around the perimeter of the Sacristy were replaced with stone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Chapels===
[[File:ChapelAgoniesGranadaDF.JPG|thumb|upright|Chapel of Our Lady of the Agonies of Granada.]]
The cathedral's sixteen [[chapel]]s were each assigned to a [[Confraternity|religious guild]], and each is dedicated to a saint. Each of the two side naves contain seven chapels. The other two were created later on the eastern and western sides of the cathedral. These last two are not open to the public.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  The fourteen chapels in the east and west naves are listed below.  The first seven are in the east nave, listed from north to south, and the last seven are in the west nave.

====Chapel of Our Lady of the Agonies of Granada====
The Chapel of Our Lady  of the Agonies of Granada ({{lang-es|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de las Angustias de Granada|links=no}}) was built in the first half of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, and originally served as the sacristy.  It is a medieval-style chapel with a ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and two relatively simple altarpieces.  The narrow [[altarpiece]] contains an oval painting of ''[[Raphael (angel)|Saint Raphael, Archangel]] and the young Tobias'', a 16th&amp;nbsp;century painting attributed to Flemish painter [[Maerten de Vos]].  At the top of this altarpiece is a painting of ''[[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]]'', and above this is a painting of the ''[[Last Supper]]''. At the back of the chapel is a churrigueresque painting of ''Our Lady of the Agonies of Granada''.

====Chapel of Saint Isidore====
The Chapel of [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore]] ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Isidro|links=no}}) was originally built as an annex between 1624 and 1627, and was once used as the [[baptistery]].  Its vault contains plaster casts representing Faith, Hope, Charity, and Justice, considered to be basic values in the Catholic religion.  After the Tabernacle was built, it was converted into a chapel and its door was reworked in a churrigueresque style.

====Chapel of the Immaculate Conception====
[[File:ChapelImmacConceptionDF.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Chapel of the Immaculate Conception]]

The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception ({{lang-es|Capilla de la Inmaculada Concepción|links=no}}) was built between 1642 and 1648.  It has a churrigueresque altarpiece which, due to the lack of columns, most likely dates from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  The altar is framed with molding—instead of columns—and a painting of the Immaculate Conception presides over it.  The altar is surrounded by paintings by [[José de Ibarra]] relating to the [[Passion of Christ]] and various saints.  The chapel also contains a canvas of [[Saint Christopher]] painted by Simon Pereyns in 1588, and the ''[[Flagellation]]'' by [[Baltasar de Echave Orio]], painted in 1618.  The altarpiece on the right side&lt;ref&gt;In the chapels, the terms "left-hand" and "right-hand" are used with reference to the main altar of each chapel.&lt;/ref&gt; is also dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and was donated by the [[Nacional Monte de Piedad|College of Saints Peter and Paul]].  This chapel holds the remains of [[Franciscan]] friar [[Antonio Margil|Antonio Margil de Jesús]] who was evangelized in what is now the north of Mexico.

====Chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe====
The Chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe ({{lang-es|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe|links=no}}) was built in 1660.  It was the first baptistery of the cathedral and for a long time was the site for the Brotherhood of the Most Holy Sacrament, which had many powerful benefactors.  It is decorated in a 19th&amp;nbsp;century neo-classic style by the architect Antonio Gonzalez Vazquez, director of the Academy of San Carlos.  The main altarpiece is dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and the sides altars are dedicated to [[John the Baptist]] and San Luis Gonzaga respectively.

====Chapel of Our Lady of Antigua====
[[File:Nuestra Señora la Antigua.JPG|thumb|upright|Our Lady of Antigua]] 
The Chapel of Our Lady of Antigua ({{lang-es|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de La Antigua|links=no}}) was sponsored and built between 1653 and 1660 by a brotherhood of musicians and organists, which promoted devotion to this Virgin.  Its altarpiece contains a painting of the Virgin, a copy of one found in the [[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral of Seville]].  This copy was brought to New Spain by a merchant.  Two other paintings show the birth of the Virgin and her presentation.  Both were painted by Nicolás Rodriguez Juárez.

=====Chapel of Saint Peter=====
The Chapel of Saint Peter ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Pedro|links=no}}) was built between 1615 and 1620, and contains three highly decorated Baroque altarpieces from the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. The altar at the back is dedicated to Saint Peter, whose sculpture presides over the altar.  It is surrounded by early 17th&amp;nbsp;century paintings relating to his life, painted by Baltasar de Echave Orio.  To the right is an altarpiece dedicated to the [[Holy Family]], with two paintings by [[Juan de Aguilera]] of [[Florence]] called ''The Holy Family in the workshop of Saint Joseph'' and ''Birth of the Savior''.  The altarpiece to the left of the main altarpiece is dedicated to [[Thérèse of Lisieux|Saint Theresa of Jesus]] whose image also appears in the chapel's window. It includes four paintings on sheets of metal that depict scenes from the [[birth of Jesus]].  Five oil paintings illustrate scenes from the life of Saint Theresa, and above this is a semi-circular painting of the [[coronation of Mary]]. All these works were created in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century by Baltasar de Echave y Rioja.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

This chapel is home to the '''Niño Cautivo''' (Captive Child) a [[Niño Dios of Mexico|Child Jesus]] figure that was brought to Mexico from Spain. It was sculpted in the 16th century by Juan Martínez Montañez in Spain and purchased by the cathedral. However, on its way to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], pirates attacked the ship it was on and sacked it. To get the image back, a large ransom was paid. Today, the image is in the Chapel of San Pedro or De las Reliquias.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4072&amp;Itemid=441 |title=Niños Jesus que obran milagros |first=Carmen |last=Mondragón Jaramillo |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nino Jesus that performs miracles |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the image has been petitioned by those seeking release from restrictions or traps, especially financial problems or drug addiction or alcoholism.&lt;ref name="secuestrados"&gt;{{cite news |title= Santo Niño Cautivo, patrono de los secuestrados |author=El Sol de México |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/oem/notas/n924646.htm |newspaper=[[Organizacion Editorial Mexicana|El Sol de México]] |location=Mexico City |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Niño Cautivo, patron of the kidnapped}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cult to the Niño Cautivo is considered to be "inactive" by INAH.&lt;ref name="arraigo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiene arraigo en México la veneración al Niño Dios |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/404275.html |agency=Notimex  |newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico City |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Veneration of the Niño Dios has deep roots in Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this particular image has made a comeback since 2000 as one to petition when a family member is abducted and held for ransom.&lt;ref name="secuestrados"/&gt;

====Chapel of Christ and of the Reliquaries====
[[File:ChapelChristConquistadorsDF.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Chapel of Christ of the Reliquaries]]
The Chapel of Christ and of the Reliquaries ({{lang-es|Capilla del Santo Cristo y de las Reliquias|links=no}}) was built in 1615 and designed with ultra-Baroque details which are often difficult to see in the poorly lit interior.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  It was originally known as the ''Christ of the Conquistadors''. That name came from an image of Christ that was supposedly donated to the cathedral by [[Emperor Charles V]].  Over time, so many [[reliquary|reliquaries]] were left on its main altar that its name was eventually changed. Of 17th&amp;nbsp;century ornamentation, the main altarpiece alternates between carvings of rich [[foliage]] and small heads on its columns in the main portion and small sculptures of angels on its [[telamon]]s in the secondary portion. Its niches hold sculptures of saints framing the main body. Its crucifix is from the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. The [[predella]] is finished with sculptures of angels, and also contains small 17th&amp;nbsp;paintings of martyred saints by Juan de Herrera. Behind these paintings, hidden compartments contain some of the numerous reliquaries left here. Its main painting was done by Jose de Ibarra and dated 1737. Surrounding the altar is a series of paintings on canvas, depicting the ''Passion of Christ'' by Jose Villegas, painted in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. On the right-hand wall, an altar dedicated to the Virgin of the Confidence is decorated with numerous churrigueresque figurines tucked away in niches, columns and top pieces.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of the Holy Angels and Archangels====
The Chapel of the Holy Angels and Archangels ({{lang-es|Capilla de los Ángeles|links=no}}) was finished in 1665 with Baroque altarpieces decorated with [[Solomonic column]]s. It is dedicated to the [[Archangel Michael]], who is depicted as a medieval [[knight]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  It contains a large main altarpiece with two smaller altarpieces both decorated by Juan Correa.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; The main altarpiece is dedicated to the seven archangels, who are represented by sculptures, in niches surrounding images of Saint Joseph, Mary and Christ. Above this scene are the Holy Spirit and [[God the Father]].  The left-hand altarpiece is of similar design and is dedicated to the Guardian Angel, whose sculpture is surrounded with pictures arranged to show the angelic hierarchy. To the left of this, a scene shows Saint Peter being released from prison, and to the right, Saul, later Saint Paul, being knocked from his horse, painted by Juan Correa in 1714. The right-hand altarpiece is dedicated to the Guardian Angel of Mexico.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of Saints Cosme and Damian====
The Chapel of Saints Cosme and Damian ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Cosme y San Damián|links=no}}) was built because these two saints were commonly invoked during a time when New Spain suffered from the many diseases brought by the Conquistadors. The main altarpiece is Baroque, probably built in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.  Oil paintings on wood contain scenes from physician saints, and are attributed to painter Sebastian Lopez Davalos, during the second half of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.  The chapel contains one small altarpiece which came from the Franciscan church in [[Zinacantepec]], to the west of Mexico City, and is dedicated to the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of Saint Joseph====
[[File:2013-12-22 El Señor del cacao anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|Lord of the cacao beans]]
The Chapel of Saint Joseph ({{lang-es|Capilla de San José|links=no}}), built between 1653 and 1660, contains an image of ''Our Lord of [[Cacao bean|Cacao]]'', an image of Christ most likely from the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. Its name was inspired from a time when many indigenous worshipers would give their [[alms]] in the form of cocoa beans. Churrigueresque in style and containing an [[Graffito (drawing technique)|graffito]] statue of [[Saint Joseph]], patron saint of [[New Spain]],&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; the main altarpiece is Baroque and is from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  This once belonged to the Church of Our Lady of Monserrat. This altar contains statues and cubicles containing busts of the Apostles, but contains no paintings.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of Our Lady of Solitude====
The Chapel of Our Lady of Solitude ({{lang-es|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de la Soledad|links=no}}) was originally built in honor of the workers who built the cathedral.  It contains three Baroque altarpieces.  The main altarpiece is supported by [[caryatid]]s and small angels as [[telamon]]s, to uphold the base of the main body. It is dedicated to the Virgin of Solitude of [[Oaxaca]], whose image appears in the center.  The surrounding 16th&amp;nbsp;century paintings are by Pedro Ramírez, and depict scenes from the life of Christ.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of Saint Eligius====
The Chapel of Saint Eligius ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Eligio|links=no}}), also known as the Chapel of the Lord of Safe Expeditions ({{lang-es|Capilla del Señor del Buen Despacho|links=no}}), was built by the first [[silversmith]] guild, who donated the images of the Conception and [[Saint Eligius]] to whom the chapel was formerly dedicated.  The chapel was redecorated in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, and the image of ''Our Lord of Good Sending'' was placed here, named thus, since many supplicants reported having their prayers answered quickly.  The image is thought to be from the 16th&amp;nbsp;century and sent as a gift from [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Charles V of Spain]].&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows====
[[File:CloseUpSeñoraSoledadDF.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Image of Our Lady of Solitude]]
The Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows ({{lang-es|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores|links=no}}), formerly known as the Chapel of the Lord's Supper ({{lang-es|Capilla de la Santa Cena|links=no}}), was built in 1615. It was originally dedicated to the [[Last Supper]] since a painting of this event was once kept here.  It was later remodeled in a Neo-classical style, with three altarpieces added by Antonio Gonzalez Velazquez.  The main altarpiece contains an image of the ''Virgin of Sorrows'' sculpted in wood and painted by Francisco Terrazas, at the request of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]. On the left-hand wall a ladder leads to a series of crypts which hold most of the remains of past archbishops of Mexico.  The largest and grandest of these crypts contains the remains of Juan de Zumarraga, the first archbishop of Mexico.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;

====Chapel of the Lord of Good dispatch====
[[File:Señor del buen despacho.JPG|thumb|upright|right|]]
The Chapel of the Lord of good dispatch({{lang-es|Capilla del Señor del Buen Despacho|links=no}}) was premiered on December 8, 1648 and was dedicated to the silversmiths' guild, who placed two images of solid silver, one of the most pure conception and another of San Eligio or Eloy.

The decoration of the entire chapel is neoclassical style belongs to the first half of the nineteenth century.

====Chapel of Saint Philip of Jesus====
[[File:EXPRestos Agustin de Iturbide 27Sep2010 CatMetMex.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Exhibition of the skeleton of Emperor and General Agustín de Iturbide in the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City, on the occasion of the celebrations of the bicentennial of the beginning of the War of Independence from Mexico. Picture taken after the liturgical celebration held in his honor on September 27, 2010]]

The Chapel of Saint Philip of Jesus ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Felipe de Jesús|links=no}}) was completed during one of the earliest stages of the construction of the cathedral. It is dedicated to [[Philip of Jesus]], a [[friar]] and the only [[martyr]] from New Spain, who was crucified in Japan. The chapel is topped with a Gothic-style dome and has a Baroque altarpiece from the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. A statue of the saint is located in a large niche in the altarpiece. The altar to the left is dedicated to Saint [[Rose of Lima]], considered a protector of Mexico City. To the right is an urn which holds the remains of [[Agustín de Iturbide]], who briefly ruled Mexico from 1822 to 1823.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;  Next to this chapel is a [[baptismal font]], in which it is believed Philip of Jesus was baptised.&lt;ref name="forasteros"/&gt;The heart of Anastasio Bustamante is preserved here. In this chapel is a sculpture alluding to the first Mexican saint: San Felipe de Jesús. This work, as seen by many art critics, is the best elaborated, carved and polychrome sculptured sculpture from Latin America.

===Organs===
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, México D.F., México, 2013-10-16, DD 99.JPG|thumb|right|upright|View of an organ case from outside the choir area.]]
The cathedral has had perhaps a dozen organs over the course of its history.&lt;ref name=pepe1&gt;{{cite journal| first=Edward| last=Pepe| title=From Spain to the New World: the hiring of the Madrid organist Fabián Pérez Ximeno by Mexico City Cathedral| journal=Keyboard Perspectives| volume=IV| year=2011| pages=27–48| editor-first=Annette| editor-last=Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest is mentioned in a report written to the king of Spain in 1530.

They are the largest 18th&amp;nbsp;century organs in the Americas; they are situated above the walls of the choir, on the epistle side (east) and the gospel side (west).&lt;ref name="Organs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flentrop |first=Dirk Andries |authorlink=Dirk Andries Flentrop |author2=[[John Fesperman]] |year=1986 |title=The Organs of Mexico City Cathedral |journal=Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology |volume=47 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both organs, damaged by fire in 1967, were restored in 1978. Because both organs had fallen into disrepair again, the gospel organ was re-restored from 2008-2009 by Gerhard Grenzing; the restoration of the epistle organ, also by Grenzing, was completed in 2014, and both organs are now playable.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite news| title=Mexico City's Metropolitan Cathedral completes organ restoration| url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/agencia-efe/140305/mexico-citys-metropolitan-cathedral-completes-organ-restoration| agency=[[EFE]]| work=[[Global Post]]| date=14 May 2014| accessdate=2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choir===
The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is where the priest and/or a choral group sings the [[psalms]]. It is located in the central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by [[Juan de Rojas]] between 1696 and 1697.&lt;ref name="arsvirtual-choir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsvirtual.com/visitas/visitas/catedral_mexico/alta/mexico/mexico.htm |title=Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City- The choir |accessdate=2008-09-18 |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828094118/http://www.arsvirtual.com/visitas/visitas/catedral_mexico/alta/mexico/mexico.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sides contain 59&amp;nbsp;reliefs of various saints done in [[mahogany]], [[walnut]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]] and a native wood called tepehuaje. The railing that surrounds the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in [[Macao]], China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.&lt;ref name="Epoca"/&gt;

===Crypt===
[[File:Criptacatedralmexico.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The crypt]]
The Crypt of the Archbishops is located below the floor of the cathedral beneath the Altar of the Kings. The entrance to the crypt from the cathedral is guarded by a large wooden door behind which descends a winding yellow staircase. Just past the inner entrance is a [[Mexica]]-style stone skull. It was incorporated as an offering into the base of a [[cenotaph]] to [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first archbishop of Mexico. Zumárraga was considered to be a benefactor of the Indians, protecting them against the abuses of their Spanish overlords. There is also a natural-sized sculpture of the archbishop atop the cenotaph.

On its walls are dozens of bronze plaques that indicate the locations of the remains of most of Mexico City's former archbishops, including Cardinal [[Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada]]. The floor is covered with small marble slabs covering niches containing the remains of other people.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fox.presidencia.gob.mx/buenasnoticias/?contenido=19666&amp;pagina=223 |title=La Cripta de los Arzobispos, una joya escondida en la Catedral |accessdate=2008-11-20 |author=Ricardo Pacheco Colín |language=Spanish

The cathedral contains other crypts and niches where other religious figures are buried, including in the chapels.

==Restoration==
The sinking ground and seismic activity of the area have had an effect on the cathedral's construction and current appearance.  Forty-two years were required simply to lay its foundation when it was first built, because even then the Spaniards recognized the danger of constructing such a huge monument in soft soil.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; However, for political reasons, much, but not all, of the cathedral was built over the remains of pre-Hispanic structures, leading to uneven foundation from the beginning.&lt;ref name="WalkingTour"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gomexico.about.com/od/sights/ss/df_walking_4.htm |title=A Walking Tour of Mexico City |accessdate=2008-09-18 |publisher=Suzanne Barbezat |date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire of 1967===
On 17&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1967 at 9&amp;nbsp;pm, a fire caused by an electrical [[short circuit]] caused extensive damage to the cathedral. On the Altar of Forgiveness, much of the structure and decoration were damaged including the loss of three paintings; ''The Holy Face'' by [[Alonso López de Herrera]], ''The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'' by [[Francisco de Zumaya]] and ''The Virgin of Forgiveness'' by [[Simon Pereyns]]. The choir section lost 75&amp;nbsp;of its 99&amp;nbsp;seats as well a painting by Juan Correa along with many stored books. The two cathedral organs were severely damaged with the partial melting of their pipes. Paintings by Rafael Jimeno y Planas, Juan Correa and Juan Rodriguez Juarez were damaged in other parts of the cathedral. After the fire, authorities recorded the damage but did nothing to try to restore what was damaged.  Heated discussions ensued among historians, architects and investigations centering on the moving of the Altar of Forgiveness, as well as eliminating the choir area and some of the railings. In 1972, ecclesiastical authorities initiated demolition of the choir area without authorization from the Federal government, but were stopped. The government inventoried what could be saved and named Jaime Ortiz Lajous as director of the project to restore the cathedral to its original condition. Restoration work focused not only on repairing the damage (using archived records and photographs), but also included work on a deteriorating foundation (due to uneven sinking into the ground) and problems with the towers.

The Altars of Forgiveness and of the Kings were subject to extensive cleaning and restorative work. To replace the lost portions on the Altar of Forgiveness, several paintings were added; ''Escape from Egypt'' by Pereyns, ''The Divine Countenance'' and ''The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian''. The organs were dismantled with the pipes and inner workings sent to the [[Netherlands]] for repair, while the cases were restored by Mexican craftsmen with work lasting until 1977. Reconstruction of the choir area began in 1979 using the same materials as existed before the fire.  In addition, any statues in the towers that received more than 50%&amp;nbsp;damage from city pollution were taken out, with replicas created to replace them.  Those with less damage were repaired.

Some interesting discoveries were made as restoration work occurred during the 1970s and early 1980s. 51&amp;nbsp;paintings were found and rescued from behind the Altar of Forgiveness, including works by Juan and Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, [[Miguel Cabrera]] and [[José de Ibarra]]. Inside one of the organs, a copy of the nomination of [[Hernán Cortés]] as Governor General of New Spain (1529) was found.  Lastly, in the wall of the central arch of the cathedral was found the burial place of [[Miguel Barrigan]], the first governor of [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

===Late 20th-century work===
[[File:ArtifactsCathdralDF.JPG|thumb|right|Bases and other artifacts from the foundation excavation on display in front of the Cathedral]]
The cathedral, along with [[Mexico City#Geography|the rest of the city]], has been sinking into the lakebed from the day it was built. However, the fact that the city is a [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] with over 18&amp;nbsp;million people drawing water from underground sources has caused water tables to drop, and the sinking to accelerate during the latter half of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Greste |title=World: Americas Saving Mexico's sinking cathedral

Major restoration and foundation work began in the 1990s to stabilize the building.&lt;ref name="WalkingTour"/&gt;  Engineers excavated under the cathedral between 1993 and 1998.&lt;ref name="Earthquake"/&gt; They dug shafts under the cathedral and placed shafts of concrete into the soft ground to give the edifice a more solid base to rest on.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; These efforts have not stopped the sinking of the complex, but they have corrected the tilting towers and ensured that the cathedral will sink uniformly.&lt;ref name="WalkingTour"/&gt;

==Cultural value==
The cathedral has been a focus of Mexican cultural identity, and is a testament to its colonial history.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"/&gt; Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; [[Hernán Cortés]] supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"/&gt;

It once was an important religious center, used exclusively by the prominent families of New Spain. In 1864, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] and Empress [[Charlotte of Belgium]] (later known as Maximiliano and Carlota of Mexico) were crowned at the cathedral after the magnificent arrival to the head city of their reign.

Located on the Zocalo it has, over time, been the focus of social and cultural activities, most of which have occurred in the 20th&amp;nbsp;and 21st&amp;nbsp;centuries. The cathedral was closed for four years while President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] attempted to enforce [[Cristero War#Aftermath of the war and the toll on the Church|Mexico's anti-religious laws]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] closed the church, ordering priests to cease their public religious duties in all Mexican churches. After the Mexican government and the papacy came to terms and major renovations were performed on the cathedral, it reopened in 1930.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal
|date=25 August 1930 |title= Mexico City Cathedral |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740151,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2008-09-18 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cathedral has been the scene of several protests both from the church and to the church, including a protest by women over the Church's exhortation for women not to wear mini-skirts and other provocative clothing to avoid rape,&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;{{cite news|title=Protestan mujeres in minifalda frente a catedral Cd. de México |url=http://www.spanish.xinhuanet.com/spanish/2008-08/18/content_697429.htm|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=2008-08-17 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |quotation=Women in miniskirts protest in front of Mexico City Cathedral |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a candlelight vigil to protest against kidnappings in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Topix"&gt;{{cite news |title=150,000 Mexicans take to the streets to protest a spate of murders and kidnappings |work=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1051101/Mexicans-streets-protest-spate-murders-kidnappings.html |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cathedral itself has been used to protest against social issues. Its bells rang to express the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|archdiocese's]] opposition to the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court]] [[Abortion in Mexico|upholding of Mexico City's legalization of abortion]].&lt;ref name="Campanas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Campanas de la Catedral de México repicaron en señal de duelo por ley del aborto |trans-title=Cathedral bells tolled in Mexico in mourning for abortion law |url=http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=22497 |publisher=ACI Prensa |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most serious recent event occurred on 18&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2007, when sympathizers of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] attacked the cathedral.&lt;ref name="CNA-forgive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Message of forgiveness at Mexico City Cathedral |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=26033 |publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]] |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522105251/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=26033 |archive-date=22 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 150&amp;nbsp;protesters stormed into Sunday Mass chanting slogans and knocking over [[pew]]s.  This caused church officials to close and lock the cathedral for a number of days.&lt;ref name="Grillo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ioan |last=Grillo |title=Mexico City's Cathedral closes after anti-Catholic protesters storm building during Mass |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=25974 |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122111637/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=25974 |archive-date=22 January 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral reopened with new security measures, such as bag searches, in place.&lt;ref name="CNA-forgive"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}

Music has had a long history in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], from the days in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and the settlement of the West, to the present day.  In the early days of the Church, stripped-down Mormon folk music, which could be sung without accompaniment due to the lack of instruments in Utah, was popular.  In the 19th century, the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] was created and began touring, while musicians began writing devotional and praise music with a Mormon influence, paralleling the success of Christian Contemporary Music. Several organizations have existed and do exist to promote these artists, such as Deseret Book and the now-defunct Faith-centered Music Association.  Starting in the late 20th century and to the present day, Mormons have been increasingly involved in modern popular music in America and elsewhere in the World.

== Mormon folk music ==
{{Main|Mormon folk music}}
Mormon folk music constituted some of the earliest [[Caucasian race|white/euroamerican]] music in the boundaries of modern Utah. These songs, simple and easy to remember, were usually sung without accompaniment because of the scarcity of [[musical instrument]]s in [[Utah Territory|territorial Utah]]. Although they often employed the same tunes as [[folk music]] elsewhere, Mormon folk is distinctively Utahn. The songs often include unique [[settler|pioneer]]-era Mormon culture references such as crossing the plains, Mormon ecclesiastical leaders, and LDS religious convictions. Hymns and other folk music were used to lift the spirits of all the saints along their treacherous journey known as the Mormon Trail. They are still used as praises or prayers to their Heavenly Father as well as a way to welcome comfort, peace and guidance from the Holy Ghost whom they try to keep as a constant companion.

== Mormon Tabernacle Choir ==
Since 1847, the Latter-day Saint influence in Utah music is manifest in the state’s most famous musical institution: The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]. Named after the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], the 300+ member choir is world-famous. The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] supports the choir both for prestige and as a [[proselytizing]] tool for spreading familiarity of the church. The choir performs at least weekly at the Tabernacle for a [[Radio programming|radio program]] called "[[Music and the Spoken Word]]" which is the longest-running national radio program in the US. The Mormon Tabernacle choir has released innumerable albums since it first recorded in 1910.

== LDS-themed popular music ==

Beginning in the 1960s, [[gospel music]] gained some success, and Mormons played an integral role in the development of [[Christian Contemporary Music]] (CCM) into the 1970s. The Mormon concept album ''[[The Plan (The Osmonds album)|The Plan]]'', by [[The Osmonds]], was arguably the first explicitly Mormon music recording to break into mainstream popularity in the rock era, with two tracks from the album reaching the U.S. top 40. Since then, [[Michael McLean (composer)|Michael McLean]] from [[Heber, Utah]] and [[Kenneth Cope (musician)|Kenneth Cope]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] have become relatively popular among mostly-older [[Latter-day Saint]]s for their religiously-charged [[easy listening]] music.  Music for [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS worship services]] is generally traditional with minimal accompaniment with piano or organ, so these musicians perform in venues other than in LDS worship services. In the 2010 and 2011, respectively, [[Jenny Oaks Baker]] and [[Hillary Weeks]] became popular contemporary Mormon-themed inspirational recording artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/465298/hilary-weeks-first-mormon-to-reach-christian-albums-top-10|date = November 4, 2011|title = Hilary Weeks First Mormon to Reach Christian Albums Top 10|first = Wade|last = Jessen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the [[Nashville Tribute Band]] has produced [[country music]] with an LDS theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705385585/Nashville-Tribute-Band-salutes-missionaries.html |title= Nashville Tribute Band salutes missionaries |first= Hikari|last=Loftus |date= 16 August 2010 |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Especially For Youth albums==
Each year various artist from LDS Music are featured on an annual album called [[Especially for Youth]] (EFY), that is produced for a summer youth camp sponsored by [[Brigham Young University]] but are held at many universities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ce.byu.edu |title=BYU Division of Continuing Education |publisher=Ce.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several producers bid for the album on a 2-year cycle. The producer for the album is usually decided by EFY executive J.D. Hucks, a senior administrator for the [[Church Educational System]]'s Youth &amp; Family Programs.

From 1998–Present the EFY album producer roll has been bouncing back and forth between the production duo [[Tyler Castleton]] &amp; [[Staci Peters]] and their competitor [[Jim Funk]] &amp; [[Barry Gibbons]], making it difficult for independent artist and producers to participate with the album production.

The [[EFY]] album has received criticism over the last decade for being "out of touch" with its targeted audience of youth ages 14–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mormonmatters.org/2008/12/19/orson-scott-card-and-lds-music/ |title=Orson Scott Card and LDS Music |publisher=Mormon Matters |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of this idea find that though the albums might be youth-orientated and were created to be given to youth at EFY camp, they were also intended to be wonderful and uplifting - appropriate for any age. Many Saints enjoy the peaceful music with a modern twist in their homes daily as a way of inviting the Holy Ghost and making the day feel more reverent. Also, Deseret Book has written on their website that "Perhaps no other collection of albums has sold better to the youth over the last decade than the EFY albums released every summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Various |url=http://deseretbook.com/Best-EFY-Various/i/4582076 |title=The Best of EFY |publisher=DeseretBook.com |date=2010-07-17 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EFY albums in the last 18 years are:

==Faith-centered Music Association==
For a time, the Faith-centered Music Association rewarded excellence in music with the Pearl Awards given in a number of different categories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearlawards.org/overview.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214005605/http://www.pearlawards.org/overview.htm |date=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over its final few years the FCMA, which was run by senior management at [[Deseret Book]], had been viewed as a way to "pat themselves on the back."&lt;ref name=line /&gt; Many if not all projects that were nominated and receive awards, are published by Deseret Book.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 2010, the FCMA decided to take an indefinite hiatus from workshops and the Pearl Awards. In a letter to the general public, the FCMA stated that it had grown too large of an organization and tried to accommodate too many recommendations and criticisms to continue.&lt;ref name=line&gt;{{cite web |title=FCMA calls it quits |url=http://www.linescratchers.com/?p=667 |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In mainstream popular music ==

There are numerous artists active in the secular music world who are LDS, but do not write devotional or praise-style music. Prominent examples include [[Donny Osmond]], [[Neon Trees]], [[Dan Reynolds (musician)|Dan Reynolds]] and Wayne Sermon of [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Lindsey Stirling]], [[Alan Sparhawk]] and [[Mimi Parker]] of [[Low (band)|Low]], [[Brandon Flowers]] of [[The Killers]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[David Archuleta]], [[Dallon Weekes]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Dan Truman]] of [[Diamond Rio]], [[Fictionist]], [[SheDaisy]], [[Kaskade|KASKADE]], [[The Piano Guys]], The Vibrant Sound, [[Amy Whitcomb]], [[Jennifer Thomas (pianist)]] and many past and present members of [[The Aquabats]].  There have been efforts to expand the umbrella of "Mormon Music" to encompass all Latter-day Saints who write or perform music, reflecting an increasing frustration with institutions like Deseret Book that confine their musical offerings to a very narrow view of what Mormon Music is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motleyvision.org/2009/qa-arthur-linescratchers/ |title=Q&amp;A with Arthur from Linescratchers &amp;#124; A Motley Vision |publisher=Motleyvision.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the blog Linescratchers has interviewed and compiled a list of many artists who fit this description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linescratchers.com/?page_id=23 |title=Staff @ Linescratchers |publisher=Linescratchers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pasquino 02.jpg|thumb|Modern pasquinades in Italian on the base of the statue]]
'''Pasquino''' or '''Pasquin''' ([[Latin]]: ''Pasquillus'') is the name used by [[Rome|Romans]] since the [[early modern period]] to describe a battered [[Hellenistic]]-style statue dating to the third century BC, which was unearthed in the [[Parione]] district of [[Rome]] in the fifteenth century. It is located in a piazza of the same name on the southwest corner of the [[Palazzo Braschi]] (Museo di Roma); near the site where it was unearthed.  The statue is known as the first of the [[talking statues of Rome]], because of the tradition of attaching anonymous criticisms to its base.

==History==
[[File:1-pasquino.jpg|thumb|Pasquino statue 2017. Postering on the statue is prohibited.  "Pasquinades" must be placed on a side board.]]
The statue's fame dates to the early sixteenth century, when Cardinal [[Oliviero Carafa]] draped the [[marble]] torso of the statue in a toga and decorated it with Latin [[epigram]]s on the occasion of [[Saint Mark]]'s Day.

The Cardinal's actions led to a custom of criticizing the pope or his government by the writing of [[Satire|satirical poems]] in broad [[Romanesco dialect|Roman dialect]]—called "pasquinades" from the Italian "pasquinate"—and attaching them to the statue "Pasquino".

Thus Pasquino became the first "talking statue" of Rome. He spoke out about the people's dissatisfaction, denounced injustice, and assaulted misgovernment by members of the Church. From this tradition are derived the English-language terms '''pasquinade''' and '''pasquil''', which refer to an anonymous [[parody|lampoon]] in verse or prose.&lt;ref&gt;In verse, the pasquinade finds a classical source in the [[epigram]]s of [[Martial]]: John W. Spaeth, Jr., "Martial and the Pasquinade" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''70''' (1939:242-255).&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual subject of the sculpture is ''[[Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus]]'', and the subject, or the composition applied to other figures as in the [[Sperlonga sculptures]], occurs a number of times in classical sculpture, where it is now known as a "[[Pasquino group]]".  The actual identification of the sculptural subject was made in the eighteenth century by the [[antiquarian]] [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]], who identified it as the torso of [[Menelaus]] supporting the dying [[Patroclus]]; the more famous of two Medici versions of this is in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy.  The ''Pasquino'' is more recently characterized as a [[Hellenistic]] sculpture of the third century BC, or a Roman copy.&lt;ref&gt;Early discussion was summarised in B. Schweitzer and F. Hackenbeil, ''Das Original der sogennanten Pasquino-Gruppe'' (Leipzig: Hirtzl) 1936; the modern opinion is from [[Wolfgang Helbig]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological origins==
[[File:Statue of Pasquin in the House of Cardinal Ursino MET DP870228.jpg|thumb|Pasquino in 1550 by [[Nicolas Béatrizet]]]]
The origin of the name, "Pasquino", remains obscure. By the mid-sixteenth century it was reported that the name "Pasquino" derived from a nearby tailor who was renowned for his wit and intellect;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt; speculation had it that his legacy was carried on through the statue, in "the honor and everlasting remembrance of the poor tailor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition of wit==
Before long, other statues appeared on the scene, forming a kind of public [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] or academy, the  "Congress of the Wits" (''Congresso degli Arguti''), with Pasquino always the leader, and the sculptures that Romans called [[Marphurius]], [[Abbot Luigi]], [[Il Facchino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], and [[Il Babbuino]] as his outspoken colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Ponti 1927; ''Enciclopedia Italiana'', ''s.v.'' "Pasquino e Pasquinate".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cartelli'' (translated as posters, placards, boards; probably the equivalent of pamphlet) on which the epigrams were written were quickly passed around, and copies were made, too numerous to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Copies in private daybooks have preserved some that were too scurrilous to print.&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were collected and published annually by the Roman printer [[Giacomo Mazzocchi]] as early as 1509, as ''Carmina apposita Pasquino'', and became well known all over [[Europe]]. As they became more pointed, the place of publication of ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo'' (1544) was shifted to [[Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;("Two volumes of Pasquinades"). ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo. Quorum primo uersibus ac rhythmis, altero soluta oratione conscripta quamplurima continentur, ad exhilarandum, confirmandumque hoc perturbatissimo rerum statu pij lectoris animum'' (Johann Oporino, Eleutheropoli (sc. Basel) 1544) ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=contents#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false digitized])&lt;/ref&gt; less squarely under papal control, disguised on the titlepage as ''Eleutheropolis'', "freedom city".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth 1939:245, identifies the editor as the humanist-turned-Protestant [[Caelius Secundus Curio]], an exile and professor of oratory at Basel, whose satirical dialogue ''Pasquillus Extaticus et [[Marforio|Marphorius]]'' appeared for the first time (in Latin) in this work (Part 2, pp. 426-529) and rapidly gained an independent life in translations into Italian, French, German, Dutch and, a little later, English.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parody|lampoon]]ing tradition was ancient among Romans. For a first-century versified lampoon, see [[Domus Aurea]].

''Pasquinade'' is sometimes misidentified, appearing among synonyms of ''[[parody]]'' at [[WordNet]]. Compare also the equally unrelated ''[[pastiche]]''.

==Cultural legacy==
In 1589 one of the contributors to the [[Marprelate Controversy]], a pamphlet war between the [[Established Church]] of England and its [[puritan]] opponents, adopted the pseudonym [[Pasquill (the Cavaliero)|Pasquill]]. At the end of his second pamphlet ''The Return of Pasquill'' (published in October 1589), Pasquill invites critics of his opponent [[Martin Marprelate]] to write out their complaints and post them up on [[London Stone]].

''Pasquin'' is the name of a play by [[Henry Fielding]] from 1736. It was a ''pasquinade'' in that it was an explicit and personalized attack on [[Robert Walpole]] and his supporters. It is one of the plays that triggered the [[Licensing Act of 1737|Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737]].

''The Pasquinade'' is a small, grassroots [[magazine]] of [[parody]] and [[satire]] started in the mid-1990s by Dallas Shelby, a college journalism student with a bent for satire and a love of [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In 2003, the organization developed its own film production company, Pasquinade Films.

''Anthony Pasquin'' is the pseudonym of [[John Williams (satirist)|John Williams]] (1761–1818) and his satirical writing of royalties, academicians, and actors.

''Pasquino'' was a pen name of [[J. Fairfax McLaughlin]] (1939–1903), American lawyer and author.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F. Clarke|publisher=BCA|date=1977|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''[[Pashkevil]]'' is the generic name of the posters put up on the walls of [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews]]ish enclaves in [[Israel]]. These posters define legitimate behavior, such as prohibitions on owning [[smart phones]], as well as often being the mouthpiece for radical anti-Zionist groups, such as the ''[[Neturei Karta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics, E. Sprinzak, 1999, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pashkevillim'' take the place of conventional media in communities where they are shunned.

'''A. Peter McGraw''' (born 1970) is an associate professor of Marketing and Psychology at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; His research spans the fields of [[judgment]] and [[decision making]], [[emotion]], [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref10" /&gt;

McGraw is known for his early research on expectations and emotions. In studying the emotional reactions of Olympic athletes, he finds that bronze medalists often appear happier with their accomplishment than silver medalists because silver medalists are more likely to have higher (gold medal) aspirations, whereas bronze medalists are more likely to be the dark horse and exceed their expectations.&lt;ref name="ref11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref12" /&gt;

McGraw and Jonathan Levav have published work based on their theory of Emotional Accounting, which is a complement to prior research on [[Mental accounting|Mental Accounting]]. Emotional accounting posits that people use their feelings about money to guide how they spend it. For example, if people have negative feelings about a windfall of money, they tend to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures in lieu of hedonic expenditures.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;

McGraw also investigates what makes things funny. His [[humor]] research was inspired in part by his research on moral violations with [[Philip Tetlock]] and mixed emotions with Jeff Larsen. McGraw, along with Caleb Warren, developed the Benign Violation Theory (BVT), a general theory of humor based on evolutionary accounts of laughter and amusement. The BVT predicts that humor occurs when a person simultaneously appraises a situation as wrong or unsettling some way (i.e., a violation) and yet appraises the situation to be okay or acceptable in some way (i.e., benign).&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; His research is quickly moving the study of humor from the niche to mainstream psychology.

In 2014, McGraw co-authored ''The Humor Code'', a book about the science of humor and his travels around the world with journalist [[Joel Warner]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Humor-Code-Global-Search/dp/1451665415|title=The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|date=1 April 2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|accessdate=18 October 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw and his work often appears in major media outlets, such as BBC, the Wall Street Journal and Wired magazine. He also gives talks to businesses and the general public.

==Academic career==
McGraw received his Ph.D. from [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] in 2002, at which time he pursued a post-doc at Princeton University with Nobel Laureate  [[Daniel Kahneman]]. In 2004, he joined the faculty at the [[Leeds School of Business]], University of Colorado Boulder. In 2008, he received an appointment (courtesy) in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.

At the University of Colorado, McGraw teaches courses in consumer behavior and decision making. He directs the Humor Research Lab (HuRL) and co-directs a virtual research lab, the Moral Research Lab (MoRL) with Daniel Bartels. His research has been published in the [[Journal of Consumer Research]], Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]], and [[Psychological Science]]. McGraw was named a [[Marketing Science Institute]] Young Scholar in 2007.&lt;ref name = "ref15" /&gt;

Outside academic pursuits, McGraw, from 2004 to 2010, served as academic coordinator, assistant coach, and associate head coach of the men’s [[lacrosse]] team at the University of Colorado.&lt;ref name="ref13" /&gt; He was the head coach of the men’s lacrosse club at Princeton University from 2002 to 2004.&lt;ref name="ref14" /&gt;

==The Humor Code==
In 2010, McGraw met journalist [[Joel Warner]], who was fascinated by McGraw's humor research and unified theory of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2014/the_humor_code/what_makes_something_funny_a_bold_new_attempt_at_a_unified_theory_of_comedy.html|title=The Humor Code|first1=Peter|last1=McGraw|first2=Joel|last2=Warner|date=23 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2011, the two created "The Humor Code Project," a two-year, 91,000-mile global search for what makes things funny. Their travels took them to Tanzania, Scandinavia, Japan, Israel, Peru, and several other destinations in North America. McGraw and Warner authored [[The Humor Code]], a book about their travels and the experiments they conducted along the way.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_25435131/humor-code-takes-unlikely-colorado-pair-around-world|title=“The Humor Code” takes unlikely Colorado pair around the world|date=27 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two maintained multiple blogs about their adventures on [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], [[Huffington Post]], and [[Psychology Today]].&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref18" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref19" /&gt; McGraw's research and the book have been widely covered by the media, including the Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, The Boston Globe, Scientific American, The Atlantic, Denver Post, and others.&lt;ref name="ref20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/the-dark-psychology-of-being-a-good-comedian/284104/|title=The Dark Psychology of Being a Good Comedian|first=Olga|last=Khazan|date=27 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"/&gt;

==Research Labs==
'''Humor Research Laboratory (HuRL)''' &lt;br /&gt;
HuRL is dedicated to the scientific study of humor and its antecedents and consequences. The lab’s theoretical and methodological base is in the interdisciplinary fields of consumer behavior, emotion, and judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology.

'''Moral Research Laboratory (MoRL)''' &lt;br /&gt;
MoRL is a (virtual) research laboratory that investigates the mental processes underlying morally motivated judgment and choice, with a focus on consumer behavior and implications for public policy.  The lab’s theoretical base is in the interdisciplinary field of judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology.

'''Phillip Harold Lewis''' (July 31, 1922 – December 10, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropologist]], [[museologist]], and amateur photographer and artist. His work in [[Anthropology]] centered on [[Melanesia]], a subregion in [[Oceania]], and he was the [[Curator]] of Anthropology at the [[Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] from 1957 until 1992. His work in Oceania has helped build both the collections and research capabilities in the Field Museum and has paved the way for further anthropological work on this area by the museum.

== Biography and education ==

Lewis was born in Chicago  on July 31, 1922, the son of   [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] immigrants. He grew up speaking [[Yiddish]] at home and English at school. He was raised in Chicago's North Side and graduated   from [[Lane Technical High School]] in 1940. In high school, Lewis became interested in various art forms, and crafted a violin which was later used by his children (two of whom became professional musicians). He was also a skilled photographer and cartoonist for the school newspaper.&lt;ref name="Drews"&gt;Drews 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, he entered the [[United States Army Air Corps]] and was stationed in Alaska ([[Aleutian Islands]]) as a weather forecaster from 1942-1945. When he returned from service, he attended school at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], from which he received a degree. After attaining this degree, Lewis pursued and received a PhD. in Anthropology from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Drews" /&gt;

Phillip Lewis died on December 10, 2011 at the age of 89 at Mathar Pavilion, a nursing facility in Evanston.&lt;ref name="Drews" /&gt;

== Professional life ==

=== The Field Museum ===

Lewis was hired by the [[Field Museum]] in 1957 as the curator of what was then called "[[primitive art]]"; he later became  Curator of Anthropology. His initial assignment was to develop the material on  Oceanic culture in the Department of Oceanic Anthropology, particularly that of the island of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;The Field Museum 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His research done on New Ireland resulted in a book on the island's culture. Lewis helped to install Pacific Hall, a permanent exhibit on [[Polynesia]]n, [[Micronesia]]n and Melanesian cultures.&lt;ref name="Kates"&gt;Kates 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His exhibit on Melanesian culture is on the upper level of the museum and is still very successful because of his intimate research and knowledge of the Melanesian region. He kept his post at the Field Museum until he retired in 1992, marking an almost 40-year period as one of the longest-serving curators at the museum.&lt;ref name="Drews" /&gt;

Lewis chaired the Anthropology department at the Field   from 1975 until 1979.&lt;ref name="Kates" /&gt; He is remembered today as the first and only curator at the museum to focus on how art and society relate to one another. He can be said to have helped bridge the gap between what natural history and anthropology museums do and what art museums do, and how their methods can be combined.&lt;ref name="Drews" /&gt;

=== Research areas ===

Lewis's area of study in anthropology was in Melanesian culture and art, focusing on funerary customs and other ritualistic ceremonies. In his lifetime, he traveled to [[Papua New Guinea]] in the village of [[Lesu]] for three extended, months-long periods to study their culture.&lt;ref name="Drews" /&gt; His first trip was in the 1950s by propeller plane (the other two being in the 1970s and 1980s). In the process of his travels, he collected hundreds of items for use in the Field Museum, including masks, woven baskets, musical instruments, and other various pieces of art (over 100 of these artifacts come from New Ireland&lt;ref&gt;The Field Museum 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). Many of these items are still on exhibit today at the Field Museum&lt;ref name="Kates" /&gt;

'''''Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion''''' is a 1958 book about human [[pregnancy]] by the anthropologist [[Paul Gebhard]], the sexologist [[Wardell Pomeroy]], the sexologist [[Clyde Martin]], and Cornelia Christenson. It was a publication of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]]. The work was prepared and written with careful attention to sampling, methodology and date interpretation, to demonstrate the Institute for Sex Research's scientific competence despite the death of [[Alfred Kinsey]] and to answer the criticism that the Institute was interested only in popular, moneymaking books. Though it did not receive the public acceptance of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', the work was well received in scientific circles, and demonstrated that the Institute could survive as a productive research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pom82|Pomeroy 1982. p. 450.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical feminism''' is a perspective within [[feminism]] that calls for a radical reordering of society in which [[androcentrism|male supremacy]] is eliminated in all social and economic contexts.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=117}}&lt;!--sources need to be updated--&gt;

Radical feminists view society as fundamentally a [[patriarchy]] in which [[Man|men]] dominate and oppress [[Woman|women]].  Radical feminists seek to abolish the patriarchy in order to "liberate everyone from an unjust society by challenging existing social norms and institutions." This includes opposing the [[sexual objectification]] of women, raising public awareness about such issues as [[rape]] and [[violence against women]], and challenging the concept of [[gender role]]s. [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'' (1970): "[T]he end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male ''privilege'' but of the sex ''distinction'' itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally."{{sfn|Firestone|1970|p=11}}

Early radical feminism, arising within [[second-wave feminism]] in the 1960s,{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=118}} typically viewed patriarchy as a "transhistorical phenomenon"{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=122}} prior to or deeper than other sources of [[oppression]], "not only the oldest and most universal form of domination but the primary form" and the model for all others.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=123}} Later politics derived from radical feminism ranged from [[cultural feminism]] to more [[syncretism|syncretic]] politics that placed issues of [[social class|class]], [[economics]], etc. on a par with patriarchy as sources of oppression.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=117, 141}}

Radical feminists locate the root cause of women's oppression in patriarchal gender relations, as opposed to [[legal system]]s (as in [[liberal feminism]]) or [[class conflict]] (as in [[anarchist feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[Marxist feminism]]). 

== Theory and ideology ==
Radical feminists assert that society is a [[patriarchy]] in which the class of men are the oppressors of the class of women.{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=139}} They propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that has existed since the inception of humanity.{{sfn|Shelley|2000}} As radical feminist [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] wrote in her foundational piece "Radical Feminism" (1969):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first dichotomous division of this mass [mankind] is said to have been on the grounds of sex: male and female&amp;nbsp;... it was because half the human race bears the burden of the reproductive process and because man, the ‘rational’ animal, had the wit to take advantage of that, that the childbearers, or the 'beasts of burden,' were corralled into a political class: equivocating the biologically contingent burden into a political (or necessary) penalty, thereby modifying these individuals’ definition from the human to the functional, or animal.{{sfn|Atkinson|2000|p=85}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Radical feminists claim that, because of patriarchy, women have come to be viewed as the "other" to the male norm, and as such have been systematically oppressed and marginalized. They further assert that men as a class benefit from the oppression of women. Patriarchal theory is not generally defined as a belief that all men always benefit from the oppression of all women. Rather, it maintains that the primary element of patriarchy is a relationship of dominance, where one party is dominant and exploits the other for the benefit of the former. Radical feminists believe that men (as a class) use social systems and other methods of control to keep women (and non-dominant men) suppressed. Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy by challenging existing social norms and institutions, and believe that eliminating patriarchy will liberate everyone from an unjust society. Ti-Grace Atkinson maintained that the need for power fuels the male class to continue oppressing the female class, arguing that "the ''need'' men have for the role of oppressor is the source and foundation of all human oppression".{{sfn|Atkinson|2000|p=86}}

The influence of radical-feminist politics on the [[women's liberation movement]] was considerable. [[Redstockings]] co-founder [[Ellen Willis]] wrote in 1984 that radical feminists "got sexual politics recognized as a public issue", created [[second-wave feminism]]'s vocabulary, helped to legalize abortion in the USA, "were the first to demand total equality in the so-called private sphere" ("housework and child care&amp;nbsp;... emotional and sexual needs"), and "created the atmosphere of urgency" that almost led to the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=118}} The influence of radical feminism can be seen in the adoption of these issues by the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), a feminist group that had previously been focused almost entirely on economic issues.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=138}}

== Movement ==
=== Roots ===
The ideology of radical feminism in the [[United States]] developed as a component of the [[women's liberation movement]]. It grew largely due to the influence of the [[civil rights movement]], that had gained momentum in the 1960s, and many of the women who took up the cause of radical feminism had previous experience with radical protest in the struggle against [[racism]]. Chronologically, it can be seen within the context of [[second wave feminism]] that started in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The primary players and the pioneers of this second wave of feminism included [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Kathie Sarachild]], [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[Carol Hanisch]], and [[Judith C. Brown|Judith Brown]]. Many local women's groups in the late sixties, such as the UCLA Women's Liberation Front (WLF), offered diplomatic statements of radical feminism's ideologies. UCLA's WLF co-founder Devra Weber recalls, "the radical feminists were opposed to patriarchy, but not necessarily capitalism. In our group at least, they opposed so-called male dominated national liberation struggles".{{sfn|Linden-Ward|Green|1993|p=418}}

These women helped secure the bridge that translated radical protest for racial equality over to the struggle for [[women's rights]]; by witnessing the discrimination and oppression to which the black population was subjected, they were able to gain strength and motivation to do the same for their fellow women. They took up the cause and advocated for a variety of women's issues, including [[abortion]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], access to credit, and equal pay.{{sfn|Evans|2002}} Most women of color (who were predominantly working-class) did not participate in the formation of the radical feminist movement because it did not address many issues that were relevant to those from a working-class background.{{sfn|Linden-Ward|Green|1993|p=434}} But for those who felt compelled to stand up for the cause, radical action was needed, so they took to the streets and formed [[consciousness raising]] groups to rally support for the cause and recruit people willing to fight for it. Later, second-wave radical feminism saw greater numbers of black feminists and other women of color participating.

In the 1960s, radical feminism emerged simultaneously within liberal feminist and working-class feminist discussions, first in the United States, then in the United Kingdom and [[Australia]]. Those involved had gradually come to believe that it was not only the [[middle-class]] [[nuclear family]] that oppressed women, but that it was also social movements and organizations that claimed to stand for human liberation, notably the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the [[New Left]], and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political parties, all of which were male-dominated and male-oriented. In the United States, radical feminism developed as a response to some of the perceived failings of both [[New Left]] organizations such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and feminist organizations such as NOW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Initially concentrated in big cities like [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], Washington, DC, and on the West Coast,{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=118}}{{efn|Willis (1984) doesn't mention Chicago, but as early as 1967 Chicago was a major site for consciousness-raising and home of the ''Voice of Women's Liberation Movement''; see Kate Bedford and Ara Wilson [http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/wilson935/chrono1.htm Lesbian Feminist Chronology: 1963-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717042308/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/wilson935/chrono1.htm |date=17 July 2007}}.}} radical feminist groups spread across the country rapidly from 1968 to 1972.

Radical feminists introduced the use of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) groups. These groups brought together intellectuals, workers, and middle class women in developed Western countries to discuss their experiences. During these discussions, women noted a shared and repressive system regardless of their political affiliation or [[social class]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Based on these discussions, the women drew the conclusion that ending of patriarchy was the most necessary step towards a truly free society.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These consciousness-raising sessions allowed early radical feminists to develop a political [[ideology]] based on common experiences women faced with male supremacy. Consciousness raising was extensively used in chapter sub-units of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The feminism that emerged from these discussions stood first and foremost for the liberation of women, as women, from the oppression of men in their own lives, as well as men in power. Radical feminism claimed that a totalizing ideology and social formation – ''patriarchy'' (government or rule by fathers) – dominated women in the interests of men.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Groups===
[[File:Redstockings.png|thumb|Logo of the [[Redstockings]]]]
Within groups such as [[New York Radical Women]] (1967–1969 (no relation to the present-day socialist feminist organization [[Radical Women]]), which Ellen Willis characterized as "the first women's liberation group in New York City",{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=119}} a radical feminist ideology began to emerge that declared that "the personal is political" and "sisterhood is powerful",{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=118}} formulations that arose from these consciousness-raising sessions. This call to women's activism was coined by Kathie Sarachild in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminisms Matter: Debates, Theories, Activism|last=Bromley|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Radical Women fell apart in early 1969 in what came to be known as the "politico-feminist split" with the "politicos" seeing capitalism as the source of women's oppression, while the "feminists" saw male supremacy as "a set of material, institutionalized relations, not just bad attitudes". The feminist side of the split, which soon began referring to itself as "radical feminists",{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=119}} soon constituted the basis of a new organization, [[Redstockings]]. At the same time, Ti-Grace Atkinson led "a radical split-off from NOW", which became known as [[The Feminists]].{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=124}} A third major stance would be articulated by the [[New York Radical Feminists]], founded later in 1969 by [[Shulamith Firestone]] (who broke from the Redstockings) and [[Anne Koedt]].{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=133}}

During this period, the movement produced "a prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews".{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=118}} Many important feminist works, such as Koedt's essay ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]'' (1970) and [[Kate Millet]]'s book ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1970), emerged during this time and in this [[Social environment|milieu]].

=== Ideology emerges and diverges ===
At the beginning of this period, "[[heterosexuality]] was more or less an unchallenged assumption". Among radical feminists, the view became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, in particular, the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=121}} This assumption of heterosexuality would soon be challenged by the rise of [[political lesbianism]], closely associated with Atkinson and The Feminists.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=131}}

Redstockings and The Feminists were both radical feminist organizations, but held rather distinct views. Most members of Redstockings held to a [[materialism|materialist]] and anti-[[psychologism|psychologistic]] view. They viewed men's oppression of women as ongoing and deliberate, holding individual men responsible for this oppression, viewing institutions and systems (including the family) as mere vehicles of conscious male intent, and rejecting psychologistic explanations of female submissiveness as blaming women for collaboration in their own oppression. They held to a view—which Willis would later describe as "neo-[[Maoism|Maoist]]"—that it would be possible to unite all or virtually all women, as a class, to confront this oppression by personally confronting men.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=124—128}}

[[File:Ellen willis.png|thumb|[[Ellen Willis]]]]
The Feminists held a more [[idealism|idealistic]], psychologistic, and [[utopianism|utopian]] philosophy, with a greater emphasis on "[[sex role]]s", seeing [[sexism]] as rooted in "complementary patterns of male and female behavior". They placed more emphasis on institutions, seeing marriage, family, prostitution, and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the "sex-role system". They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed. Within the group, there were further disagreements, such as Koedt's viewing the institution of "normal" sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure, while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction. In contrast to the Redstockings, The Feminists generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male. [[Ellen Willis]], the Redstockings co-founder, would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity, they saw it as a "bitter price" they "might have to pay for [their] militance", whereas The Feminists embraced [[separatist feminism]] as a strategy.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=130–132}}

The New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) took a more psychologistic (and even [[biological determinism|biologically determinist]]) line. They argued that men dominated women not so much for material benefits as for the ego satisfaction intrinsic in domination. Similarly, they rejected the Redstockings view that women submitted only out of necessity or The Feminists' implicit view that they submitted out of cowardice, but instead argued that [[social conditioning]] simply led most women to accept a submissive role as "right and natural".{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=133–134}}

=== Action ===
Radical feminism was not and is not only a movement of ideology and theory. Radical feminists also take [[direct action]]. In 1968, they protested against the [[Miss America]] pageant in order to bring "sexist beauty ideas and social expectations" to the forefront of women's social issues. Even though there weren't any bras burned on that day, this protest is famous for the phrase "bra-burner". "Feminists threw their bras—along with "woman-garbage" such as girdles, false eyelashes, steno pads, wigs, women's magazines, and dishcloths—into a "Freedom Trash Can", but they did not set it on fire".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kreydatus, Beth. "Confronting The Bra-Burners" Teaching Radical Feminism With A Case Study"|journal=History Teacher Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, more than one hundred feminists staged an 11-hour sit-in at the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. These women demanded that the editor "be removed and replaced by a woman editor". The Ladies Home journal, "with their emphasis on food, family, fashion, and femininity, played an important role in maintaining the status quo and thus were instruments of women's oppression". One member explains the motivation of the protest noting that they "were there to destroy a publication which feeds off of women's anger and frustration, a magazine which destroys women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hunter, Jean|title=A Daring New Concept: The Ladies Home Journal And Modern Feminism|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they "used a variety of tactics-demonstrations and speakouts" about topics such as rape. Through "tireless[ly] organizing among friends and coworkers, on street corners, in supermarkets and ladies' rooms" these radical feminists were able gain an amazing amount of exposure". The movement gained momentum, while a "prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews" were produced.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=117}}

=== Radical egalitarianism ===
Radical egalitarianism, "an approach to the distribution of economic resources", aimed to "diminish differences among people" based on "culture or a way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Wildavsky, Aaron. "The Rise Of Radical Egalitarianism and The Fall Of Academic Standards"|journal=Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their commitment to [[radical egalitarianism]], most early radical feminist groups operated initially without any formal internal structure. When informal leadership developed, it was often resented. Some of the feminist leaders reacted with defiance, some quit the movement", and "others tried to respond to the criticism by echoing it and withdrawing from [their] leadership roles, in classic guilty liberal fashion".{{sfn|Willis|1984}} Many groups ended up expending more effort debating their own internal operations than dealing with external matters, seeking to "perfect a perfect society in microcosm" rather than focus on the larger world. Resentment of leadership was compounded by the view that all "class striving" was "male-identified". In the extreme, exemplified by The Feminists, the upshot, according to Ellen Willis, was "unworkable, mechanistic demands for an absolutely random division of labor, taking no account of differences in skill, experience, or even inclination". "The result," writes Willis, "was not democracy but paralysis." Willis believed that part of the reason the problems weren't dealt with was because "of the unconscious fear that feminists' demands for freedom and power would provoke devastating retribution". When The Feminists began to select randomly who could talk to the press, Ti-Grace Atkinson quit the organization she had founded.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=138–140}}

=== Social organization and aims  ===
Radical feminists have generally formed small activist or community associations around either consciousness raising or concrete aims. Many radical feminists in Australia participated in a series of [[squatting|squats]] to establish various women's centers, and this form of action was common in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s many of the original consciousness raising groups had dissolved, and radical feminism was more and more associated with loosely organized university collectives. Radical feminism can still be seen, particularly within student activism and among working class women. In Australia, many feminist social organizations accepted government funding during the 1980s, and the election of a conservative government in 1996 crippled these organizations. The movement also arose in Israel among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Misra, Kalpana, &amp; Melanie S. Rich, ''Jewish Feminism in Israel: Some Contemporary Perspectives''. Hanover, N.H.: Univ. Press of New England (Brandeis Univ. Press), 1st ed. 2003. {{ISBN|1-58465-325-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While radical feminists aim to dismantle patriarchal society, their immediate aims are generally concrete. Common demands include:

* Expanding [[reproductive rights]]: "Defined by feminists in the 1970s as a basic human right, it includes the right to abortion and birth control, but implies much more. To be realised, reproductive freedom must include not only woman's right to choose childbirth, abortion, sterilisation or birth control, but also her right to make those choices freely, without pressure from individual men, doctors, governmental or religious authorities. It is a key issue for women, since without it the other freedoms we appear to have, such as the right to education, jobs and equal pay, may prove illusory. Provisions of childcare, medical treatment, and society's attitude towards children are also involved."&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Encyclopedia of Feminism'' (1986) Lisa Tuttle&lt;/ref&gt;
* Changing the organizational sexual culture, e.g., breaking down traditional gender roles and reevaluating societal concepts of femininity and masculinity (a common demand in US universities during the 1980s). In this, they often form tactical alliances with other currents of feminism.

==Views on the sex industry==
Radical feminists have written about a wide range of issues regarding the sex industry – which they tend to oppose – including but not limited to: [[Feminist views of pornography#Harm to women during production|harm to women]] during the production of pornography, [[Feminist views on pornography#Social harm from exposure to pornography|the social harm]] from consumption of pornography, [[Feminist views on prostitution#Coercion and poverty|the coercion and poverty]] that leads women to become prostitutes, [[Feminist views on prostitution#Long-term effects on the prostitutes|the long-term effects]] of prostitution, [[Feminist views on prostitution#The raced and classed nature of prostitution|the raced and classed nature]] of prostitution, and [[Feminist views on prostitution#Male dominance over women|male dominance over women]] in prostitution and pornography.

===Prostitution===
{{main|Feminist views on prostitution}} 
Radical feminists argue that most women who become prostitutes are forced into it by a pimp, [[human trafficking]], poverty, [[Addiction|drug addiction]], or trauma such as child sexual abuse. Women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are over-represented in prostitution all over the world. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] asked: "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/fempsy3.html |title=Prostitution in Five Countries |publisher=Feminism &amp; Psychology |year=1998 |authors=Melissa Farley, Isin Baral, Merab Kiremire and Ufuk Sezgin |pages=405–426 |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306002439/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/fempsy3.html |archivedate=2011-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives, and most wanted to leave the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Melissa.

Prostitution Research &amp; Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKinnon argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |author= |date=5 August 2009 |work= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230257/http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |archivedate=25 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no-one should have the right to consent to the oppression of others. In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a "good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression".&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, Kathleen (1995). ''The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women''. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Dworkin]] wrote in 1992:

{{quote|Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. ...

She argued that "prostitution and equality for women cannot exist simultaneously" and to eradicate prostitution "we must seek ways to use words and law to end the abusive selling and buying of girls' and women's bodies for men's sexual pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hoffer, Kaethe Morris.

Radical feminist thinking has analyzed prostitution as a cornerstone of patriarchal domination and sexual subjugation of women that impacts negatively not only on the women and girls in prostitution but on all women as a group, because prostitution continually affirms and reinforces patriarchal definitions of women as having a primary function to serve men sexually. They say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality—e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc.—with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view—acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man's sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man, and that the woman's response and satisfaction are irrelevant.  Radical feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved so long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catw-ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201023435/http://www.catw-ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-01 |title=SEX: From human intimacy to "sexual labor" or Is prostitution a human right? |author=Cecilia Hofmann |publisher=CATW-Asia Pacific |date=August 1997 |accessdate=2010-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist consciousness raising remains the foundation for collective struggle and the eventual liberation of women".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polis, Carol A.

Radical feminists strongly object to the [[patriarchal]] ideology that has been one of the justifications for the existence of prostitution, namely that prostitution is a "necessary evil", because men cannot control themselves; therefore it is "necessary" that a small number of women be "sacrificed" to be used and abused by men, to protect "chaste" women from rape and harassment. These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp ''increase'' in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. [[Melissa Farley]] argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution. Nevada is the only US state that allows legal brothels, and it is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |title=Sexual Assault Prevention Program at ISPAN |publisher=Inner-star.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404030047/http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |archivedate=2011-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |title=Panel: Brothels aid sex trafficking |author=MARK WAITE |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174035/http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |archivedate=December 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous women are particularly targeted for prostitution. In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price. It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population. This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.&lt;ref name="Lynne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farley |first=M. |last2=Lynne |first2=J. |last3=Cotton |first3=A. |title=Prostitution in Vancouver: Violence and the Colonization of First Nations Women |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=242–271 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/1363461505052667 |pmid=16114585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pornography===
{{main|Feminist views of pornography}}
[[File:MacKinnon.8May.CambridgeMA.png|thumb|[[Catharine MacKinnon]]]]
Radical feminists, notably [[Catharine MacKinnon]], charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are presented as enjoying themselves.{{efn|MacKinnon (1989): "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography."{{sfn|MacKinnon|1989|p=196}}}}&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catherine A. (1984). "Not a moral issue". ''Yale Law and Policy Review'' 2:321-345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| year = 1995| url = https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie (13 July 2007). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"]. In ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.{{efn|Dines (2008): "The porn that makes most of the money for the industry is actually the gonzo, body-punishing variety that shows women's bodies being physically stretched to the limit, humiliated and degraded. Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can't stand the brutal acts on the body for very long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Dines| first = Gail| title = Penn, Porn and Me| work = [[CounterPunch]]| date = 23 June 2008| url = http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090330143944/http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html| archivedate = 30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail.

Wheelock College, Boston, 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as [[Traci Lords]] and [[Linda Boreman]], and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of ''Ordeal'', in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of "Linda Lovelace" had starred in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') stated that she had been beaten, raped, and [[pimp]]ed by her husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in ''Deep Throat'', as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to sexism, arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles – objects – for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner. On-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;Bindel, Julie (July 2, 2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/02/gail-dines-pornography "The Truth About the Porn Industry"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name=mackinnon-fu&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 0-674-29874-8| last = MacKinnon| first = Catharine A.| title = Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law| chapter = Francis Biddle's sister: pornography, civil rights, and speech| year=1984|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rxE8FQzjpYMC&amp;pg=PA176 176]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of [[rape]] and other forms of [[violence against women]]. [[Robin Morgan]] summarizes this idea with her oft-quoted statement, "Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-48227-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and [[sexual harassment]]. In her book ''[[Only Words (book)|Only Words]]'' (1993), MacKinnon argues that pornography "deprives women of the right to express verbal refusal of an intercourse".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Schussler, Aura. "The Relation Between Feminism And Pornography"|journal=Scientific Journal of Humanistic Studies, Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering [[rape myth]]s. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. It is disputed that "rape myths perpetuate sexual violence indirectly by creating distorted beliefs and attitudes about sexual assault and shift elements of blame onto the victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Maxwell, Louise, and Scott. "A Review Of The Role Of Radical Feminist Theories In The Understanding Of Rape Myth Acceptance."|journal=Journal of Sexual Aggression, Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.&lt;ref name="mackinnon-guardian"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jeffries| first = Stuart| title = Are women human?

German radical feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one proponent of the view that pornography offers a distorted sense of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, engaging in fetishes that are presented as popular and normal.

==Radical lesbian feminism==
{{Main|Radical lesbians}}
[[File:Julie Bindel, 26 October 2015 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Julie Bindel]]]]
[[Radical lesbians]] are distinguished from other radical feminists through their ideological roots in political lesbianism. Radical lesbians see [[lesbian]]ism as an act of resistance against the political institution of heterosexuality, which they view as violent and oppressive towards women. [[Julie Bindel]] has written that her lesbianism is "intrinsically bound up" with her feminism.&lt;ref name=Bindel30Jan2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bindel|first1=Julie|title=My sexual revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/30/women-gayrights|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s, straight women within the movement were challenged on the basis of their heterosexual identities perpetuating the very patriarchal systems that they were working to undo. A large fraction of the movement sought to reform sexist institutions while "leaving intact the staple nuclear unit of oppression: heterosexual sex".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Johnston, Jill. "The Making of the Lesbian Chauvinist (1973)" ''Radical Feminism'': ''A Documentary Reader''. New York: New York University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Others saw the logic of lesbianism as a strong political act to end male dominance and as central to the women's movement.

Radical lesbians criticized the women's liberation movement for its failure to criticize the "psychological oppression" of [[heteronormativity]], which they believe to be "the sexual foundation of the social institutions".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They argued that heterosexual love relationships perpetuate patriarchal power relations through "personal domination" and therefore directly contradicted the values and goals of the movement.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Abbott, Sidney and Barbara Love, "Is Women's Liberation a Lesbian Plot? (1971)" ''Radical Feminism: A Documentary Reader''. New York: New York University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As one radical lesbian wrote, "no matter what the feminist does, the physical act [of heterosexuality] throws both women and man back into role playing... all of her politics are instantly shattered".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They argued that the women's liberation movement would not be successful without challenging heteronormativity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Radicalesbians. "The Woman-Identified Woman." Know, Incorporated. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical lesbians believe lesbianism actively threatens patriarchal systems of power.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They defined lesbians not only by their sexual preference, but by their liberation and independence from men. Lesbian activists Sydney Abbot and Barbara Love argued that "the lesbian ''has'' freed herself from male domination" through disconnecting from them not only sexually, but also "financially and emotionally".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They argue that lesbianism fosters the utmost independence from gendered systems of power, and from the "psychological oppression" of heteronormativity.{{sfn|Shelley|2000}}

Rejecting norms of gender, sex and sexuality is central to radical lesbian feminism. Lesbianism as a political act represents an ability to create identity from all aspects of the human condition, both masculine and feminine, while rejecting societal identities that are imposed onto bodies by a culture. Radical lesbians believed that "lesbian identity was a 'woman-identified' identity'", meaning it should be defined by and with reference to women, rather than in relation to men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Poirot, Kristan. Domesticating The Liberated Women: Containment Rhetorics Of Second Wave Radical/lesbian Feminism|journal=Women's Studies in Communication (263-264)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their manifesto "The Woman-Identified Woman", the lesbian radical feminist group Radicalesbians underline the necessity of creating a "new consciousness" that rejects normative definitions of womanhood and femininity, which center on the powerlessness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This redefinition of womanhood and femininity means freeing lesbian identities from harmful and divisive stereotypes. As Abbot and Love argued in "Is Women's Liberation a Lesbian Plot?" (1971):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As long at the word 'dyke' can be used to frighten women into a less militant stand, keep women separate from their sisters, and keep them from giving primacy to anything other than men and family—then to that extent they are dominated by male culture.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Radical lesbians reiterate this thought, writing, "in this sexist society, for a woman to be independent means she can't be a woman, she must be a dyke".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The rhetoric of a woman-identified-woman has been criticized for its exclusion of heterosexual women. According to some critics, "[lesbian feminism's use of] woman-identifying rhetorics should be considered rhetorical failures".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other critics argue that the intensity of radical lesbian feminist politics, on top of the preexisting stigma around lesbianism, gave a bad face to the feminist movement and provided fertile ground for tropes like the man-hater or bra burner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Views on transgender topics==
{{main|Feminist views on transgender topics}}
Since the 1970s, there has been a debate among radical feminists about [[transgender]] identities.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Michelle|title=What Is a Woman?|journal=The New Yorker|date=August 4, 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] voted to become [[womyn-born womyn]] only and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A woman's voice was almost never heard as a woman's voice – it was always filtered through men's voices. So here a guy comes along saying, "I'm going to be a girl now and speak for girls." And we thought, "No you're not." A person cannot just join the oppressed by fiat.&lt;ref name="ross1995"&gt;Ross, Becki (1995). ''The House that Jill Built: A Lesbian Nation in Formation.''

Some radical feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[John Stoltenberg]] and [[Monique Wittig]], have supported trans-inclusivity,&lt;ref name="Abeni"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abeni|first1=Cleis|title=New History Project Unearths Radical Feminism's Trans-Affirming Roots|url=http://www.advocate.com/think-trans/2016/2/03/new-history-project-unearths-radical-feminisms-trans-affirming-roots|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The Advocate|date=3 February 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sex, Gender, and Sexuality: The TransAdvocate interviews Catharine A.

The argument against trans inclusion states that since [[trans women]] are born [[male]], they are accorded corresponding [[male privilege|privileges]] in society. Even if they choose to live as women, the fact that they have a choice in this sets them apart from people born female. Their insistence on 'being women' is seen as another form of entitlement stemming from their privileged position. Further, these radical feminists reject the [[feminine essence concept of transsexuality]] (the idea that there is a "female brain" or innate feminine feeling). They believe that the difference in behavior between men and women is the result of socialization; [[Lierre Keith]] describes femininity as "a set of behaviors that are, in essence, ritualized submission".{{efn|Keith (2013): "Female socialization is a process of psychologically constraining and breaking girls—otherwise known as 'grooming'—to create a class of compliant victims. Femininity is a set of behaviors that are, in essence, ritualized submission."&lt;ref name=Keith21June2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/21/55123/ | title=The Emperor's New Penis | publisher=[[CounterPunch]] | date=21–23 June 2013 | author=Keith, Lierre}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; In this view, gender is not an identity but a caste position, and [[gender identity]] politics are an obstacle to gender abolition.&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; They hold the same position with respect to race and class.&lt;ref name="Keith21June2013" /&gt; [[Julie Bindel]] argued in 2008 that Iran carries out the highest number of sex-change operations in the world because "surgery is an attempt to keep [[gender stereotypes]] intact", and that "[i]t is precisely this idea that certain distinct behaviours are appropriate for males and females that underlies feminist criticism of the phenomenon of 'transgenderism'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://idgeofreason.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/2008-statement-from-julie-bindel/ "2008 Statement from Julie Bindel"], courtesy of idgeofreason.wordpress.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSOTP"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Grew | first1 = Tony | title = Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards | date = 7 November 2008 | work=PinkNews| url = http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9523.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (According to the BBC in 2014, there are no reliable figures regarding gender-reassignment operations in Iran.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamedani|first1=Ali|title=The gay people pushed to change their gender|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29832690|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, trans-inclusive radical feminists claim that a biology-based or sex-essentialist ideology itself upholds patriarchal constructions of womanhood. Andrea Dworkin argued as early as 1974 that transgender people and gender identity research have the potential to radically undermine patriarchal sex essentialism: "Work with transsexuals, and studies of formation of gender identity in children provide basic information which challenges the notion that there are two distinct biological sexes. That information threatens to transform the traditional biology of sex difference into the radical biology of sex similarity".&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; More recently, in 2015, radical feminist Catherine MacKinnon said that "male dominant society has defined women as a discrete biological group forever. If this was going to produce liberation, we'd be free... To me, women is a political group. I never had much occasion to say that, or work with it, until the last few years when there has been a lot of discussion about whether trans women are women" - and further, "I always thought I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man; it does not matter to me. It is just part of their specificity, their uniqueness, like everyone else's. Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman, as far as I'm concerned, is a woman."&lt;ref name="Williams 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Cristan|title=Sex, gender and Sexuality: The Trans Advocate Interviews Catherine A.

In ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]'' (1979), the lesbian radical feminist [[Janice Raymond]] argued that "transsexuals ... reduce the female form to artefact, appropriating this body for themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Janice G.|title=The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male|date=1979|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|p=xx|isbn=978-0807762721}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Whole Woman'' (1999), [[Germaine Greer]] wrote that largely male governments "recognise as women men who believe that they are women&amp;nbsp;... because [those governments] see women not as another sex but as a non-sex"; she continued that if uterus-and-ovaries transplants were a mandatory part of sex-change operations, the latter "would disappear overnight".&lt;ref name="Greer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Germaine Greer|title=The Whole Woman|url=|year=1999|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-56113-8|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymJArTm2CAIC&amp;pg=PT101 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argued in 1997 that "the vast majority of transsexuals still subscribe to the traditional [[stereotype]] of women" and that by [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] they are "constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be&amp;nbsp;... an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title= Transgender Activism: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective | first= Sheila | last= Jeffreys | journal = The Journal of Lesbian Studies | year= 1997 | url= http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/sites/default/files/imce/Transgender%20Activism%20A%20Lesbian%20Feminist%20Perspective%20by%20Sheila%20Jeffreys%2C%20Journal%20of%20Lesbian%20Studies%201997%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gender Hurts'' (2014), she referred to [[sex reassignment surgery]] as "self-mutilation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffries|first1=Sheila|title=Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon and New York|isbn=978-1317695950|pages=68–71|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used pronouns that refer to biological sex; she argued that feminists need to know "the biological sex of those who claim to be women and promote prejudicial versions of what constitutes womanhood", and that "use by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste".{{sfn|Jeffries|2014|loc=9}}&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;

Radical feminists who hold these views have been called [[transphobia|transphobic]] and trans-exclusionary radical feminists ("TERFs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ditum|first1=Sarah|title=What is a Terf?

But because the term itself is politically dishonest and misrepresentative, and because its intent is to vilify, disparage, and intimidate, as well as to incite and justify violence against women, it is dangerous and indeed qualifies as a form of hate speech. While women have tried to point out that this would be the end result of “TERF” before, they were, as usual, dismissed.

== Criticism ==
&lt;!--This needs to be updated.--&gt;Early in the radical feminism movement, some radical feminists theorized that "other kinds of hierarchy grew out of and were modeled on male supremacy-were in effect specialized forms of male supremacy".{{sfn|Willis|1984}} Therefore, the fight against male domination took priority because "the liberation of women would mean the liberation of all".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology Of Second Wave Feminism|author=Thompson, Becky|journal=Feminist studies|volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=337–360 |jstor=3178747}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contested, particularly by [[intersectional feminism]] and [[black feminism]]. Critics argue that this ideology accepts the notion that identities are singular and disparate, rather than multiple and intersecting. For example, understanding women's oppression as disparate assumes that "men, in creating and maintaining these systems, are acting purely as men, in accordance with peculiarly male characteristics or specifically male supremacist objectives".{{sfn|Willis|1984}}

According to [[Ellen Willis]]' 1984 essay "Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism", within the New Left, radical feminists were accused of being "bourgeois", "antileft", or even "apolitical", whereas they saw themselves as "radicalizing the left by expanding the definition of radical". Early radical feminists were mostly white and middle-class, resulting in "a very fragile kind of solidarity". This limited the validity of generalizations based on radical feminists' experiences of gender relations, and prevented white and middle-class women from recognizing that they benefited from race and class privilege. Many early radical feminists broke ties with "male-dominated left groups", or would work with them only in ''ad hoc'' coalitions. Willis, although very much a part of early radical feminism and continuing to hold that it played a necessary role in placing feminism on the political agenda, criticized its inability "to integrate a feminist perspective with an overall radical politics", while viewing this limitation as inevitable in the context of the time.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=120–122}}

==History==

=== Existence before IIRIRA ===

Prior to the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]], reinstatement of removal only applied to people previously deported (not excluded) on grounds relating to certain criminal convictions, failing to register, falsification of documents, or security or terrorist related grounds.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;
  
===Formalization in IIRIRA (1996, active since April 1997) ===

Reinstatement of removal was introduced in legislation as part of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]], passed by the [[104th United States Congress]] and signed into law by then-[[United States]] President [[Bill Clinton]], and active as of April 1, 1997.&lt;ref name=ilw&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ilw.com/articles/2005,0526-mehta.shtm|title = Reinstatement Of Removal|last = Mehta|first = Cyrus|last2 = Walker|first2 = Lin|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent changes and refinements ===

The practice of reinstatement of removal has refined and evolved through a mix of legislation, guidelines by immigration enforcement agencies, and court decisions. These include:

* The [[Legal Immigration Family Equity Act]] of 2000 established that those who had a pending application for adjustment of status in various categories could not be subject to reinstatement of removal.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;
* In three decisions between 2003 and 2005, various courts of appeals held that those who had affirmatively applied for adjustment of status prior to April 1, 1997, could not be subject to reinstatement of removal.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;
* In ''Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales'' (2006), the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that reinstatement of removal applied even for people who had re-entered the United States prior to April 1, 1997, if they had made no effort to adjust status prior to that date.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;&lt;ref name=nilc-gonzales&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nilc.org/removpsds153.html|title = Supreme Court finds reinstatement of removal applies to pre-IIRIRA entries|publisher = [[National Immigration Law Center]]|date = August 23, 2006|accessdate = July 23, 2015|last = Joaquin|first = Linton|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150724122344/http://www.nilc.org/removpsds153.html|archivedate = July 24, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the general belief in the immigration law community at the time, that reinstatement of removal applied only if the most recent re-entry was on or after April 1, 1997.&lt;ref name=ilw/&gt;

== Procedure and conditions ==

=== Applicability ===

Reinstatement of removal may apply to aliens (people who not United States citizens or permanent residents) who satisfy all these conditions:&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;

# The alien received a prior order of removal (or deportation or exclusion). This may have been [[expedited removal]], [[stipulated removal]], or removal or deportation through regular court proceedings.
# The alien departed the United States after receiving the order. This includes both [[voluntary departure]] and forcible removal. The key requirement is that the alien received an order of removal, deportation, or exclusion (Note that if the alien did not depart, then the reinstatement of removal does not apply. However, the earlier removal can still be executed).
# The alien subsequently re-entered the United States without authorization.
# The alien is not currently in authorized status.
# None of the exceptions discussed in the Exceptions section apply to the alien.

Although the language of the statute refers only to prior orders of removal, section 309(d)(2) of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] clarifies that any reference in law to an order of removal should be interpreted to include orders of exclusion and deportation. Thus, reinstatement of removal applies to orders of removal, deportation, and exclusion.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;

=== Notice and opportunity to contest ===

An immigration officer who establishes that the alien meets all these requirements may decide to pursue a reinstatement of removal. This involves the following steps:&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;

* The officer provides the alien with a written notice of his or her determination (on Form I-871).&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;
* The officer advises the alien that he or she may make a written or oral statement contesting the determination.
* If the alien wishes to make such a statement, the officer allows the alien to do so and considers whether the alien's statement warrants reconsideration of the determination.

After the officer has determined that the alien meets the conditions for deportation, the officer reinstates the previous order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;

=== Appealing the reinstatement order ===

The immigration officer's decision is considered final and there is no scope for appeal ''within'' the immigration enforcement bureaucracy. However, [[United States courts of appeals|courts of appeals]] in all jurisdictions in the United States have ruled that a noncitizen may appeal a reinstatement order to the court of appeals in the jurisdiction within 30 days of the reinstatement being issued. Filing an appeal does not automatically grant a stay of deportation, and the person must file a stay of removal. Conversely, being deported does not preclude a person from filing, or proceeding with, an appeal challenging the reinstatement.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;

If the DHS reinstatement order was issued in a different jurisdiction from that where the original order of removal being reinstated was issued, the person appealing may have a choice of which court of appeal to appeal the case in.&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;

=== Exceptions ===

There are two main kinds of exceptions:&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;

# Reasonable Fear:  If the alien expresses a fear of persecution or torture in his or her home country, the alien is referred to a reasonable fear interview with a [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] officer. If the fear determination is unfavorable, the alien is subject to reinstatement of removal. If the determination is favorable, the alien is scheduled for a hearing before an immigration judge.
# Those with pending applications for benefits or adjustment of status: The immigration officer cannot reinstate an earlier order of removal while an application of any of these types is pending. The order may be reinstated after a final decision to deny the application for adjustment has been made.&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;&lt;ref name=nip/&gt; The eligible types of applications include:&lt;ref name=nip/&gt;
#* Some types of adjustment of status under INA 245A, covered by class action lawsuits, as described in the [[Legal Immigration Family Equity Act]] (LIFE act), Section 1104(g).
#* Section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the [[Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act]], applies to people from [[Nicaragua]] and [[Cuba]], as described in the LIFE Act, section 1505(a)(1).
#* Section 203 of NACARA (applies to people from [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Eastern Europe]]), as described in the LIFE Act, Section 1505(c).
#* Section 902 of the [[Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act]], as described in the LIFE Act, Section 1505(b)(1).

Prior to the passage of LIFE Act, exceptions were carved out only for HRIFA and NACARA Section 202 applicants.&lt;ref name=lii/&gt;

==Related procedures==

A "Just Facts" summary by the [[Immigration Policy Center]] identified a few other summary removal practices similar to reinstatement of removal:&lt;ref name=ipc-just-facts&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/removal-without-recourse-growth-summary-deportations-united-states|title = Removal Without Recourse: The Growth of Summary Deportations from the United States|publisher = [[Immigration Policy Center]]|date = April 28, 2014|accessdate = July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Expedited removal]]: This applies to noncitizens who arrive at a designated port of entry, or those who have recently entered without authorization.
* [[Stipulated removal]]: Here, the person is formally charged and placed in immigration court proceedings before an immigration judge. However, the person does not actually appear before the judge, but rather agrees (or “stipulates”) to deportation and gives up his or her right to a hearing. The immigration judge may enter the order of removal without seeing the person and asking him or her whether the stipulation was entered into knowingly and voluntarily.

The '''Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 신천박물관) is a museum dedicated to the [[Sinchon Massacre]], a mass-murder of North Korean civilians allegedly carried out by South Korean and US troops during the [[Korean War]]. The museum is located in [[Sinchon County]] of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="50Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2008/200803/news03/28.htm#8 | title=50th Anniversary of Sinchon Museum Observed | accessdate=13 March 2011 | work=[http://www.kcna.co.jp/ Korean News] | publisher=Japan | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609183435/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2008/200803/news03/28.htm#8 | archivedate=9 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the museum was rebuilt and moved to a new location in the country.

==History==
{{Main|Sinchon Massacre}}

The Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities commemorates the deaths of over 35,000 people from 17 October to 7 December in 1950, at the same period of time when the major cities of North Korea, such as Pyongyang (the capital city) and Hamhung, were under a wartime occupation by [[South Korea|South Korean]], [[United States of America|American]] and [[United Nations]] military forces.&lt;ref name="50Anniversary"/&gt;

[[File:DPRK Museum painting 1.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings on the walls of the museum]]
The Institute for Korean Historical Studies concluded that both Communists and anti-Communist vigilantes engaged in wholesale slaughter throughout the area, and that the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] took the city and failed to prevent the secret police that came with them from perpetuating the civilian murders; however, the regiment did not participate themselves. Furthermore, when Communists retook the city, the population was again purged.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ko:역사문제연구소|Institute for Korean Historical Studies]]. 《사진과 그림으로보는 북한현대사》 p91~p93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;[http://www.korean-war.com/Archives/2002/04/msg00177.html The Truth About the Sinchun Massacre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619185700/http://www.korean-war.com/Archives/2002/04/msg00177.html |date=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have concluded that the "massacre" was caused by a local rivalry that used the fog of war as a pretense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=191&amp;issue=110 Review:  Hwang Sok-yong, The Guest (Seven Stories Press, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable visitors==

[[Kim Il-sung]] visited the museum in 1953 and 1958, as did his son, [[Kim Jong-il]], who paid a visit there in 1962 and 1998. 

North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] (the son of Kim Jong-il and the grandson of Kim Il-sung) visited the museum along with his sister in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.vice.com/article/they-are-cannibals-kim-jong-un-visits-north-koreas-us-war-atrocities-museum 'They Are Cannibals': Kim Jong-un Visits North Korea's US War Atrocities Museum]".

The '''Solutrean hypothesis''' on the [[Settlement of the Americas|peopling of the Americas]] claims that the earliest human migration to the [[Americas]] took place from [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]], during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=Bruce |last2=Stanford |first2=Dennis |date=December 2004 |title=The North Atlantic ice-edge corridor: A possible Palaeolithic route to the New World |url=http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Conservation%20Biology/Karen%20PDF/Clovis/Bradley%20&amp;%20Stanford%202004.pdf |journal=[[World Archaeology]] |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=459–478 |doi=10.1080/0043824042000303656 |accessdate=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=19 February 2006 |url=http://www.livescience.com/history/060219_first_americans.html |title=First Americans may have been European |work=Live Science |accessdate=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/new-evidence-suggests-stone-age-hunters-from-europe-discovered-america-7447152.html|title=New evidence suggests Stone Age hunters from Europe discovered America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis contrasts with the mainstream view that the North American continent was first reached after the Last Glacial Maximum, by people from [[North Asia]], either by the [[Bering land bridge]] (i.e. [[Beringia]]),&lt;ref name=Mann2013&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |date=November 2013 |title=The Clovis Point and the Discovery of America's First Culture |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-clovis-point-and-the-discovery-of-americas-first-culture-3825828/ |journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by maritime travel [[coastal migration (Americas)|along the Pacific coast]], or by both.

According to the Solutrean hypothesis, people of the [[Solutrean]] culture, 21,000 to 17,000 years ago migrated to [[North America]] by boat along the [[pack ice]] of the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jochim |first=Michael |year=2012 |chapter=Chapter 4: The Upper Paleolithic |editor-last=Milesaukas |editor-first=Suranas |title=European Prehistory: A Survey |page=84 |location=Berlin |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They brought their [[lithic technology|methods of making stone tools]] with them and provided the basis for the later (c. 13,000 years ago) [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] technology that spread throughout North America. The hypothesis is based on similarities between European Solutrean and Clovis lithic technologies. Supporters of the Solutrean hypothesis refer to recent archaeological finds such as those at [[Cactus Hill]] in Virginia, [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in Pennsylvania, and Miles Point in Maryland as evidence of a transitional phase between Solutrean lithic technology and what later became Clovis technology.

Originally proposed in the 1970s, the theory has received some support in the 2010s, notably by [[Dennis Stanford]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and Bruce Bradley of the [[University of Exeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Vastag |date=1 March 2012 |title=Theory jolts familiar view of first Americans |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/radical-theory-of-first-americans-places-stone-age-europeans-in-delmarva-20000-years-ago/2012/02/28/gIQA4mriiR_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |pages=A1, A9 |accessdate=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Meltzler (2009), "Few if any archaeologists—or, for that matter, geneticists, linguists, or physical anthropologists—take seriously the idea of a Solutrean colonization of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=David J. |year=2009 |title=First Peoples in the New World |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for the hypothesis is considered more consistent with other scenarios. In addition to an interval of thousands of years between the Clovis and Solutrean eras, the two technologies show only incidental similarities. There is no evidence for any Solutrean seafaring, far less for any technology that could take humans across the Atlantic in an ice age. Recent genetic evidence supports the idea of Asian, not European, origins for the peopling of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raff |first1=Jennifer A. |last2=Bolnick |first2=Deborah A. |title=Does Mitochondrial Haplogroup X Indicate Ancient Trans-Atlantic Migration to the Americas?

==Characteristics==
Solutrean culture was based in present-day [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], from roughly 21,000 to 17,000 years ago. The manufacture of stone tools from this period is distinguished by [[biface|bifacial]], percussion and pressure-flaked points. The Solutrean toolmaking industry disappeared from Europe around 17,000 years ago, replaced by the lithic technology of the [[Magdalenian]] culture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Clovis tools are characterized by a distinctive type of [[spear]] point, known as the [[Clovis point]]. Solutrean and Clovis points do have common traits: the points are thin and bifacial, and both use the "outrepassé", or overshot flaking technique, that quickly reduces the thickness of a biface without reducing its width.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Clovis point differs from the Solutrean in that some of the former have bifacial fluting, referring to the long groove carved into the bottom edge of a point to help attach it to the head of a spear. Bifacial fluting describes blades on which this feature appears on both its sides.

Clovis toolmaking technology appears in the archaeological record in much of North America between 12,800 and 13,500 years ago. Older blades with this attribute have yet to be discovered from sites in either Asia or Alaska.&lt;ref name=Mann2013/&gt;

==Atlantic crossing==
The Solutrean hypothesis posits that a population derived from the [[Solutrean culture]] of Western Europe may have crossed the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] along the edge of [[sea ice|pack ice]] that extended from the Atlantic coast of France to [[North America]] during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], before 17 kya. The model postulates early inhabitants may have made the crossing in small [[boats]], using skills similar to those of the modern [[Inuit]] people: hauling out on [[Drift ice|ice floes]] at night; collecting fresh water from melting [[icebergs]] or the first-frozen parts of [[sea ice]]; hunting seals and fish for food; and using [[pinniped|seal]] [[blubber]] as heating fuel. Among other evidence, they cite the discovery in the Solutrean toolkit of [[bone tool|bone needles]] used for sewing [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] clothing from [[Hide (skin)|animal hides]] similar to those still in use among modern [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fortune |first1=Jack |last2=Bradley |first2=Bruce |last3=Martin |first3=Paul |last4=Stanford |first4=Dennis |last5=Adovasio |first5=Jim |last6=Collins |first6=Michael |last7=Wallace |first7=Douglas |last8=Straus |first8=Lawrence Guy |last9=Archambault |first9=Joallyn |last10=Brower |first10=Ronald |date=21 November 2002 |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Stone Age Columbus - transcript |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/columbustrans.shtml |work=[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] |accessdate=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic issues==
Supporters of the Solutrean hypothesis had pointed to the presence of [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|haplogroup X]]2, the global distribution of which is strongest in Anatolia and the northeast of America, a pattern they argue is consistent with their position. Michael Brown in a 1998 article identified this as evidence of a possible Caucasian founder population of early Americans spreading from the northeast coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Michael D. |last2=Hosseini |first2=Seyed H. |last3=Torroni |first3=Antonio |last4=Bandelt |first4=Hans-Jürgen |last5=Allen |first5=Jon C. |last6=Schurr |first6=Theodore G. |last7=Scozzari |first7=Rosaria |last8=Cruciani |first8=Fulvio |last9=Wallace |first9=Douglas C. |display-authors=1 |title=mtDNA Haplogroup X: An Ancient Link between Europe/Western Asia and North America? |journal=[[The American Journal of Human Genetics]] |date=December 1998 |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1852–1861 |doi=10.1086/302155 |pmc=1377656 |pmid=9837837}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2008 article in the ''[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]'' by researchers in [[Brazil]] took up the argument against the Solutrean hypothesis. "Our results strongly support the hypothesis that haplogroup X, together with the other four main mtDNA haplogroups, was part of the gene pool of a single Native American founding population; therefore they do not support models that propose haplogroup-independent migrations, such as the migration from Europe posed by the Solutrean hypothesis."&lt;ref name="Kashani"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fagundes |first1=Nelson J.R. |last2=Kanitz |first2=Ricardo |last3=Eckert |first3=Roberta |last4=Valls |first4=Ana C.S. |last5=Bogo |first5=Mauricio R. |last6=Salzano |first6=Francisco M. |last7=Smith |first7=David Glenn |last8=Silva |first8=Wilson A. |last9=Zago |first9=Marco A. |last10=Ribeiro-dos-Santos |first10=Andrea K. |last11=Santos |first11=Sidney E.B. |last12=Petzl-Erler |first12=Maria Luiza |last13=Bonatto |first13=Sandro L. |display-authors=1 |title=Mitochondrial Population Genomics Supports a Single Pre-Clovis Origin with a Coastal Route for the Peopling of the Americas |journal=[[The American Journal of Human Genetics]] |date=March 2008 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.013 |pmc=2427228 |pmid=18313026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the January 2012 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'' tends to argue against the Solutrean theory on genetic grounds. Researchers in [[Italy]] argued that the distinctively Asian C4c and the disputed X2a had "parallel genetic histories". The abstract of that article also states that "[t]he similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kashani |first1=Baharak Hooshiar |last2=Perego |first2=Ugo A. |last3=Olivieri |first3=Anna |last4=Angerhofer |first4=Norman |last5=Gandini |first5=Francesca |last6=Carossa |first6=Valeria |last7=Lancioni |first7=Hovirag |last8=Semino |first8=Ornella |last9=Woodward |first9=Scott R. |last10=Achilli |first10=Alessandro |last11=Torroni |first11=Antonio |display-authors=1 |title=Mitochondrial haplogroup C4c: A rare lineage entering America through the ice-free corridor? |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |date=January 2012 |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=35–39 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21614|pmid=22024980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 genetic analysis published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] reported that the DNA from a 24,000-year-old skeleton excavated in Eastern [[Siberia]] provided mitochondrial, Y chromosomal, and autosomal genetic evidence that suggests 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry originates from an ancient Western Eurasian population. The [[Mal'ta-Buret' culture|Mal'ta boy]] skeleton's mitochondrial genome belonged to mtDNA haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequencies among Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers. The authors state that their findings have four implications, the third being that "such an easterly presence in Asia of a population related to contemporary western Eurasians provides a possibility that non-east Asian cranial characteristics of the First Americans derived from the Old World via migration through Beringia, rather than by a trans-Atlantic voyage from Iberia as proposed by the Solutrean hypothesis".&lt;ref name="raghavanetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raghavan |first1=Maanasa |last2=Skoglund |first2=Pontus |last3=Graf |first3=Kelly E. |last4=Metspalu |first4=Mait |last5=Albrechtsen |first5=Anders |last6=Moltke |first6=Ida |last7=Rasmussen |first7=Simon |last8=Stafford Jr |first8=Thomas W. |last9=Orlando |first9=Ludovic |last10=Metspalu |first10=Ene |last11=Karmin |first11=Monika |last12=Tambets |first12=Kristiina |last13=Rootsi |first13=Siiri |last14=Mägi |first14=Reedik |last15=Campos |first15=Paula F. |last16=Balanovska |first16=Elena |last17=Balanovsky |first17=Oleg |last18=Khusnutdinova |first18=Elza |last19=Litvinov |first19=Sergey |last20=Osipova |first20=Ludmila P. |last21=Fedorova |first21=Sardana A. |last22=Voevoda |first22=Mikhail I. |last23=DeGiorgio |first23=Michael |last24=Sicheritz-Ponten |first24=Thomas |last25=Brunak |first25=Søren |last26=Demeshchenko |first26=Svetlana |last27=Kivisild |first27=Toomas |last28=Villems |first28=Richard |last29=Nielsen |first29=Rasmus |last30=Jakobsson |first30=Mattias |last31=Willerslev |first31=Eske |display-authors=1 |title=Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=20 November 2013 |volume=505 |issue=7481 |pages=87–91 |doi=10.1038/nature12736 |pmc=4105016 |pmid=24256729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, analysis of the complete genome of [[Kennewick Man]], who belongs to the most basal lineage of X2a yet identified, gives no indication of recent European ancestry and moves the location of the deepest branch of X2a to the West Coast, consistent with X2a belonging to the same ancestral population as the other founder mitochondrial haplogroups.

==Other issues==
The Solutrean hypothesis is challenged by large gaps in time between the Clovis and Solutrean eras, a lack of evidence of Solutrean seafaring, lack of specific Solutrean features and tools in Clovis technology, the difficulties of the route and other issues.&lt;ref name="Straus 219–226"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Lawrence Guy |title=Solutrean Settlement of North America? A Review of Reality |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |date=20 January 2017 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=219–226 |doi=10.2307/2694056|jstor=2694056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westley, Kieran and Justin Dix 2008 85–98"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westley |first1=Kieran |last2=Dix |first2=Justin |title=The Solutrean Atlantic Hypothesis: A View from the Ocean |journal=[[Journal of the North Atlantic]] |date=July 2008 |volume=1 |pages=85–98 |doi=10.3721/J080527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur J. Jelinek, an anthropologist who took note of similarities between Solutrean and Clovis styles in a 1971 study, observed that the great geographical and temporal separation of the two cultures made a direct connection unlikely, since the dates of the proposed transitional sites and the Solutrean period in Europe only overlap at the extremes. He also argued that crossing the Atlantic with the means available at the time would have been difficult, if not impossible. The opinion is shared by Lawrence G. Straus, who wrote that "there are no representations of boats and no evidence whatsoever either of seafaring or of the ability to make a living mainly or solely from the ocean during the Solutrean."&lt;ref name="Straus 219–226"/&gt; Straus excavated Solutrean artifacts along what is now a coastline in [[Cantabria]], which was some ways inland during the Solutrean epoch. He found [[seashell]]s and [[estuarine fish]] at the sites, but no evidence that deep sea resources had been exploited. Advocates state that the historic coastlines of western Europe and eastern North America during the Last Glacial Maximum are now under water and thus, evidence of Solutrean-era seafaring may have been obliterated or submerged.

Another challenge to the hypothesis involves the paucity of non-technological evidence of a kind we would expect to find transmitted from east to west; cave paintings of a kind associated with the [[Cave of Altamira]] in Spain, for instance, are without close parallel in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Lawrence Guy |last2=Meltzer |first2=David J. |last3=Goebel |first3=Ted |title=Ice Age Atlantis?

A 2008 study of relevant [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] data from the time period in question, co-authored by Kieran Westley and Justin Dix, concluded, however, that "it is clear from the paleoceanographic and paleo-environmental data that the Last Glacial Maximum in the North Atlantic does not fit the descriptions provided by the proponents of the Solutrean Atlantic Hypothesis. Although ice use and sea mammal hunting may have been important in other contexts, in this instance, the conditions militate against an ice-edge-following, maritime-adapted European population reaching the Americas."&lt;ref name="Westley, Kieran and Justin Dix 2008 85–98"/&gt; Relying on the location of the ice shelf at the time of the putative Atlantic crossing, they are skeptical that a transoceanic voyage to North America, even allowing for the judicious use of glaciers and ice floes as temporary stopping points and sources of fresh water, would have been feasible for people from the Solutrean era.

Stanford and Bradley's 2012 book ''Across Atlantic Ice: The Origin of America's Clovis Culture'' expands upon and revises earlier formulations of the Solutrean Hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stanford |first1=Dennis J. |last2=Bradley |first2=Bruce |year=2012 |title=Across Atlantic Ice: The Origin of America's Clovis Culture |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received significant media attention, but evaluations of the evidence by professional archaeologists find the book unconvincing. The radiocarbon dates from purported pre-Clovis archaeological sites presented by Stanford and Bradley are consistently earlier in North America, pre-dating Solutrean culture in Europe by 5–10 thousand years.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Brien |first1=Michael J. |last2=Boulanger |first2=Matthew T. |last3=Collard |first3=Mark |last4=Buchanan |first4=Briggs |last5=Tarle |first5=Lia |last6=Straus |first6=Lawrence G. |last7=Eren |first7=Metin I. |display-authors=1 |title=On thin ice: problems with Stanford and Bradley's proposed Solutrean colonisation of North America |url=https://www.academia.edu/5119515/On_thin_ice_Problems_with_Stanford_and_Bradley_s_Solutrean-Clovis_hypothesis |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=2 January 2015 |volume=88 |issue=340 |pages=606–613 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X0010122X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 a stone tool, a biface [[hand axe]], which was later suggested by Stanford and Bailey to resemble Solutrean stone tools was dredged up by the trawler ''Cinmar'' off the east coast of [[Virginia]] in an area that would have been dry land prior to the rising sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch. The tool was allegedly found in the same dredge load that contained a [[mastodon]]'s remains. The mastodon tusks were later dated at 22,000 years old.&lt;ref name=Ghose2014&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghose |first=Tia |date=11 August 2014 |title=Fisherman Pulls Up Beastly Evidence of Early Americans |url=http://www.livescience.com/47289-mastodon-found-under-chesapeake-bay.html |website=Livescience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition several archaeological sites on the [[Delmarva]] peninsula with suggestive, but not definitive, dating between 16,000 and 18,000 years have been discovered by Darrin Lowery of the [[University of Delaware]]. These factors led Stanford and Bradley to reiterate in 2014 their academic advocacy of pre-Clovis peoples in North America and their possible link to paleolithic Europeans.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ghose2014/&gt;

There are two basic points of contention concerning the Cinmar biface. One is whether its association with the mastodon remains is meaningful, and the other relates to the statement by Stanford and Bradley that the biface is pre-[[Late Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) and could not be Late Prehistoric, stating that they rejected that possibility "through an extensive evaluation of collections from the eastern seaboard in which no similar bifaces were identified from any post-LGM context."&lt;ref name="Boulanger&amp; Metin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boulanger |first1=Matthew T. |last2=Eren |first2=Metin I. |title=On the Inferred Age and Origin of Lithic Bi-Points from the Eastern Seaboard and their Relevance to the Pleistocene Peopling of North America |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |date=20 January 2017 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=134–145 |doi=10.7183/0002-7316.79.4.134134 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Boulanger/publication/263808760_On_the_inferred_age_and_origin_of_lithic_bi-points_from_the_Eastern_Seaboard_and_their_relevance_to_the_Pleistocene_peopling_of_North_America/links/54ce4dba0cf298d65660d74c.pdf |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in the January 2015 issue of [[American Antiquity]] reviewed the literature and concluded "that the dual claims that such point forms are both rare and do not date to post-LGM contexts cannot be sustained".&lt;ref name="Boulanger&amp; Metin"/&gt; The same report also examined the 13 artifacts claimed to be older than 22,000 BP, finding they were "indistinguishable from visually identical bipoints from Holocene contexts across the eastern seaboard," and concluding, "The widespread distribution of these points, their well-established chronological and culture-historical associations, and the reported association with marine/deep-sea exploitation leads us to conclude that there is no reason to consider bi-points from the Delmarva Peninsula, New England, the Continental Shelf—or indeed anywhere in eastern North America—as necessarily derived from Solutrean culture or as necessarily being 'older than Clovis' much less a distinct pre-Clovis 'cultural pattern.'"&lt;ref name="Boulanger&amp; Metin"/&gt;

==Political controversy==
Similar to the controversy surrounding [[Kennewick Man]], the Solutrean hypothesis also became politicized in the 2010s. Reports claimed that it had attracted the support of [[white supremacy]] groups, interpreting the theory to the effect that the "original inhabitants of the Americas" were "white Europeans," "the Solutreans," and that the present-day [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]] (Indians) are the descendants of "later immigrants" from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gnecco |first1=Cristobal | last2=Lippert | first2=Dorothy |date=2015 | title=Ethics and Archaeological Praxis |pages=185–186 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Becky Wragg |first=Sykes |date=21 December 2016 |title=Why archaeology needs to come out of the cave and into the digital age |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/dec/21/why-archaeology-needs-to-come-out-of-the-cave-and-into-the-digital-age |website=The Guardian}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]] documentary in January 2018 was widely criticized by scientists and Native Americans for its uncritical presentation of the Solutrean hypothesis.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |title=Director defends documentary that claims Europeans could have been lst humans in North America |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4484878/director-defends-documentary-that-claims-europeans-could-have-been-1st-humans-in-north-america-1.4484883 |publisher=[[CBC Radio]] |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Tail of the Sun'''''|太陽のしっぽ|Taiyou no Shippo: Wild, Pure, Simple Life}} is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[action game|action]] and [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Artdink]] and released on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

The player's ultimate objective is to build a tower of [[mammoth]] [[tusk]]s that reaches the sun. To this end, a large map full of various creatures and oddities must be traversed in an effort to locate and gather sufficient food for the tribe to thrive and multiply.

The game was re-released in Japan on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] as a [[List of PSone Classics (Japan)|PSone Classic]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=太陽のしっぽ　WILD・PURE・SIMPLE LIFE |url=http://store.playstation.com/game/product.vm?id=JP0011-NPJJ00014_00-COMBINE000000001 |work=PLAYSTATION Store|publisher=Sony|date=2006-12-21 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[PlayStation Network]] the same year.

==Gameplay==
When the game begins, the player is situated at the home village with no goals, objectives, or guidance. The protagonist is free, from the outset, to go nearly anywhere and do basically anything. The landscape the player character inhabits is not only shared by a variety of polygonal [[fauna]], but by flora rendered in the form of [[Mochi (food)|Mochi]] of various shapes and colors, which have varying effects on one's health and various stats.

While exploring the landscape, the player's character will need to sleep, and will often choose to do so while in the middle of hunting or swimming. The North American release allows the player to wake the caveman up when this occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IGN staff |date=April 4, 1997 | title=Tail Of The Sun's Gameplay Boost | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/062/062431p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has been called a spiritual successor to [[Artdink]]'s earlier '[[non-game]]' ''[[Aquanaut's Holiday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Tail of the Sun: Wild, Pure Simple Life |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=22 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=October 1996|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''Aquanaut's Holiday'', its relaxed gameplay style polarized reviewers. On one end, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' said that ''Tail of the Sun'' "doesn't fit neatly into any one genre but still gives gamers most everything they want - challenge, tension, humor, and fun - in a way that hasn't been done before." The reviewer also praised the combination of ludicrous and serious concepts and the graphical style.&lt;ref name=NGen31/&gt; On the other end, the four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' judged the game to be innovative but impenetrable and dull. They were irritated by the player character's falling asleep, and found the game world "surprisingly barren", the graphics primitive, and the premise excessively high concept.&lt;ref name=EGM95/&gt;

Like ''EGM'', ''[[GameSpot]]'' contested the idea that the minimalist graphics are stylistically appropriate rather than simply crude ("''Tail of the Sun''{{'}}s prehistoric schtick ... seems like an excuse for its often lackluster presentation"), and found both the static camera and the player character's passing out when sleep-deprived irritating. They did praise the way the graphics reflect the passage of time and seasons, but concluded that "there just isn't enough variety here to keep the attention of the upright-walking."&lt;ref name=GSrev/&gt; Gary Eng Walk of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' had a more mixed response: "Slower than a woolly mammoth, ''Tail of the Sun'' won’t likely leave you hollering '[[Yabba-dabba-doo]],' but it will provide a tranquil alternative to the usual hyperactive videogame fare."&lt;ref name=EWrev/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Toxic Tommy similarly commented that while the slow pace (particularly the player character's slow walking speed and tendency to fall asleep) would not be for everyone, the sheer weirdness, crude yet appealing graphics, and "simple but engrossing strategy" of gameplay mechanics such as eating specific foods to increase stats make it enjoyable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Tail of the Sun|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=106|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1997|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1885), subtitled '''''A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments''''', is an English language translation of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (the “Arabian Nights”) – a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th−13th centuries) – by the British explorer and [[Arabist]] [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821–1890). It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) of the "Arabian Nights" until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008.

Burton's translation was one of two unabridged and unexpurgated English translations done in the 1880s; the first was by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882–84, nine volumes). Burton's ten volume version was published almost immediately afterward with a slightly different title. This, along with the fact that Burton closely advised Payne and partially based his books on Payne's, led later to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sallis, Eva (1999), ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge),  pg 4 and ''[[passim]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. ''The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, pp 506–508.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton made a special study of, adding extensive footnotes and appendices on "Oriental" sexual mores)&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; and to the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than being published in the usual manner. Burton's original ten volumes were followed by a further six entitled '''''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1886–88). Burton's 16 volumes, while boasting many prominent admirers, have been criticised for their "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on sexuality"; they have even been called an "eccentric ego-trip" and a "highly personal reworking of the text".&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; His voluminous and obscurely detailed notes and appendices have been characterised as “obtrusive, kinky and highly personal”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Irwin, Robert]] (1994), "The Arabian Nights: A Companion", Allen Lane: The Penguin Press, pg 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) began naming features on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] after characters and places in Burton's translation&lt;ref name="NameCategories"&gt;Blue, J.; (2006) [http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append6.html ''Categories for Naming Planetary Features'']. Retrieved 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because “its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the ''Arabian Nights'' as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB104.pdf |title=Data |website=www.iau.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[List of geological features on Enceladus]].)

==Background==
Burton – an accomplished [[geographer]], explorer, [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[ethnologist]], diplomat, [[linguistics|polylinguist]] and author – was best known in his lifetime for travelling in disguise to [[Mecca]] (1853) and for journeying (with [[John Hanning Speke]]) as the first European to visit the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] of Africa in search of the source of the [[Nile river|Nile]] (1857–58). One of the great Arabists of his day, he had long wanted to publish an unexpurgated version of the "Arabian Nights" stories. The first translations into English, notably that by [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were highly abridged and heavily [[bowdlerised]], which irritated Burton.

In 1863 Burton co-founded the ''[[Anthropological Society of London]]'' with Dr. [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]]. In Burton's own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical ''Anthropologia'') was "to supply travelers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters". Burton had written numerous travel books which invariably included sexual curiosa in extensive footnotes and appendices. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the "Kama Shastra Society", a fictitious organisation created by Burton and [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] as a legal device to avoid the consequences of [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|current obscenity laws]]. (Burton and Arbuthnot were the only members of the "Society".) These works included ''The [[Kama Sutra]] of Vatsyayana'' (1883), published just before his ''Nights'', and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi]]'' (1886), published just after it.

[[File:Frontispiece of Burton's Arabian Nights, volume 1.png|thumb|220px|right|The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to Volume I of Burton's ''Nights'' ([[Adolphe Lalauze]] (1838–1905), French illustrator)]]
The volumes were printed by the Kama Shastra Society in a subscribers-only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form. To confound possible litigation, the title pages claimed the printing had been done in "[[Benares]]", but this was a subterfuge. In reality, it was done by Miller &amp; Richard (a Scottish firm) at Stoke Newington.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stories===
{{Main|List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights}}

===Sexology===
The stories collected in the ''Nights'' are often sexual in content and were considered pornography at the time of Burton's publication. The ''Terminal Essay'' in volume 10 of Burton's ''Nights'' contains a 14,000-word section entitled "Pederasty" (Volume 10, section IV, D). Here Burton postulated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the "[[Sotadic zone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Richard Francis Burton Explorer of the Sotadic Zone|url=http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/BURTON.HTM|work=Pagan Press|publisher=Pagan Press|accessdate=16 June 2012|author=Pagan Press|year=1982–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rumors about Burton's own sexuality and experiences were already circulating and were further incited by this work.)

==Plagiarism controversy==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
John Payne and Burton collaborated on their respective translations of the ''Nights'' for more than half a decade, and each respected the other's scholarship, but Payne believed that Burton had plagiarised his manuscripts when he sent them to Trieste to be checked.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Mary S. (1998), ''A Rage to Live: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton'', New York/London: [[W.W. Norton]], pg 795.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, a biographer of Burton, [[Thomas Wright (biographer)|Thomas Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Thomas|title=The Life of Sir Richard Burton|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=New York|year=1906|volume=Vols. 1 and 2|url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|isbn=1-4264-1455-2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013141137/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|archivedate=13 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the claim that Burton had plagiarised most of his translation from Payne. Burton's most recent biographer summarises the situation as follows.&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Wright] made a comparison of the respective versions of the ''Nights'' by Burton and Payne. We know, not only from Richard's and Isabel's writings but from the statements of people who met him through the years, that Burton had been collecting manuscripts of the ''Nights'' stories and translating them, on and off, for over twenty-five years before he met Payne. So Wright's claim that Burton had not done his own translation, but had "taken from Payne at least three-quarters of his entire work", is extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, ''Op. cit'', pp 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Norman Mosley Penzer]], in his 1923 ''Annotated Bibliography'' of Burton's works, takes great umbrage at "Wright's futile efforts to glorify Payne and scoff at Burton",&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Mosley Penzer|Penzer, Norman Mosley]] (1923), ''An Annotated Bibliography of Sir Richard Francis Burton'', London: A. M. Philpot, pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting several of his examples point by point. In Burton's defence, Penzer asserts that it is usual for translators to study and follow in the footsteps of earlier translators and cites examples of similarities in the stories Payne translated {{em|after}} Burton had published his version.

The "plagiarism" allegation is also examined in detail in an appendix to [[Fawn Brodie]]’s 1967 biography of Burton, ''The Devil Drives''.

==Style==
In translating the ''Nights'', Burton attempted to invent an English equivalent of medieval Arabic. In doing so, he drew upon [[Middle English|Chaucerian English]], [[Elizabethan English]], and the 1653 English translation by Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] of the first three books of [[Rabelais]]'s ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532-46).&lt;ref&gt;[[A.S. Byatt|Byatt, A.S.]] (1999), "Narrate or Die: Why Scheherazade Keeps on Talking", ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (18 April issue).&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to British historian and Arabist [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton shared [John] Payne's enthusiasm for archaic and forgotten words. The style Burton achieved can be described as a sort of composite mock-Gothic, combining elements from [[Middle English]], the [[Authorized Version of the Bible]] and [[Jacobean drama]]. Most modern readers will also find Burton's Victorian vulgarisms jarring, for example ‘regular [[:wikt:Joe Miller|Joe Millers]]’, ‘[[:wikt:Charley|Charleys]]’, and ‘[[:wikt:red cent|red cent]]’. Burton's translation of the ''Nights'' can certainly be recommended to anyone wishing to increase their word-power:  ‘[[:wikt:chevisance|chevisance]]’, ‘[[:wikt:fortalice|fortalice]]’, ‘[[:wikt:kemper|kemperly]]’, ‘[[:wikt:cark|cark]]’, ‘[[:wikt:foison|foison]]’, ‘[[:wikt:soothfast|soothfast]]’, ‘[[:wikt:perlection|perlection]]’, ‘[[:wikt:wittol|wittol]]’, ‘[[:wikt:parergon|parergon]]’, ‘[[:wikt:brewis|brewis]]’, ‘bles’, ‘[[:wikt:fadaise|fadaise]]’, ‘[[:wikt:coelebs|coelebs]]’, ‘[[:wikt:vivisepulture|vivisepulture]]’, and so on. ‘[[:wikt:whilome|Whilome]]’ and ‘[[:wikt:anent|anent]]’ are standard in Burton's vocabulary. The range of vocabulary is wider and stranger than Payne's, lurching between the erudite and the plain earthy, so that [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Sinbad]] walk and talk in a linguistic [[Never Never Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, ''[[Op. cit.]]'' pg 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Many early commentators on Burton's ''Nights'' criticised his eccentric "mixture of obsolete words, mediaeval phrases, modern slang, Americanisms, and foreign words and expressions".&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], however, wrote a celebrated essay on “The Translators of ''The Thousand and One Nights''”&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Borges, Jorge Luis (1999), ''Selected Non-Fictions'', Editor: [[Eliot Weinberger]]; Translators: [[Esther Allen]], [[Suzanne Jill Levine]], and Eliot Weinberger; New York: [[Viking Press|Viking]], pp 92–109. (This essay was originally published in 1936 as "Los traductores de las 1001 Noches" in ''Eternidad''.)&lt;/ref&gt; in which – while he chastises Burton for his distortions and "indulgent loitering" — he allows that “the problems that Burton resolved are innumerable”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; and delights in his careful use of an extravagantly exotic vocabulary in which each word "is indubitably the ''[[Wikt:mot juste#English|mot juste]]''." In summarising his use of language, Borges concluded that “In some way, the almost inexhaustible process of English is adumbrated in Burton – [[John Donne]]’s hard obscenity, the gigantic vocabularies of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cyril Tourneur]], [[Swinburne]]’s affinity for the archaic, the crass erudition of the authors of 17th century chapbooks, the energy and imprecision, the love of tempests and magic.”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Op. cit.'', pg 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

:This edition is ostensibly the “family” version of Burton's translation. (In her "Preface", [[Lady Burton]] guarantees that "no mother shall regret her girl's reading this Arabian Nights".) It is a much bowdlerized version of the original edition and was not a commercial success. It excises 215 of the original 3,215 pages, including Burton's defense of ''[[turpiquilum]]'' in his "Foreword", all sexually explicit commentary, and the two final essays on "Pornography" and "Pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;Colligan, Collette (2002), [https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/endsandbeginnings/28.2.colligan.pdf  “Esoteric Pornography”: Sir Richard Burton’s Arabian Nights and the Origins of Pornography”]; ''[[Victorian Review]]'', Vol. 28, No. 2, pp 31-64. Published by [[Victorian Studies Association of Western Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Burton merely lent her name to this expurgated edition. As she stated before his death, "I have never read, nor do I intend to read, at his own request, and to be true to my promise to him, my husband's 'Arabian Nights' ".

===Nichols/Smithers reprints===
*1894 [[H.S. Nichols &amp; Co]], London, edition by [[Leonard C. Smithers]], 12 Volumes; this reprint "omits given passages in dreadful taste, whose elimination will be mourned by no one".
*1897 H.S. Nichols &amp; Co, London, "Illustrated Library Edition", 12 Volumes (142 original illustrations, including a portrait of Burton, reproduced from the original pictures in oils specially painted by [[Albert Letchford]] with one set of the original 71 illustrations presented as included by the publisher and another set individually hand-coloured.)

:Nichols' second printing is a scarce and handsome edition, the first to include the illustrations by Letchford. In 1896, two years after their first edition of Burton's ''Nights'', the Nichols-Smithers duo commissioned Burton's close friend, Albert Letchford, to paint 65 illustrations for another edition as well as a portrait of Burton, and soon after commissioned for five more. Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in [[Florence]] beginning his art education. They discussed the possibility of illustrating the ''Nights''. Burton's suggestion of illustrating the ''Nights'' had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination. Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings, though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton's lifetime.

===American editions===
'''“Burton Society” edition:'''
*''Alf Laylah Wa Laylah, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night'', by Richard F. Burton; Press of the Carson-Harper Company, Denver, Colo., 1900–01. “For private subscribers only.” Includes 100 illustrations by [[Stanley L. Wood]]. (This was the first reprint of the original unexpurgated edition and the best reprint for many decades. This edition is the one used by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] for naming features on [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/References “Sources of Planetary Names”] @ the IAU website; the webpage has "Larsen" for "Carson", but this is an error.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the last three volumes (4, 5, and 6 of the ''Supplemental Nights'') are dated 1901. The edition was a commercial failure.)

'''“Burton Club” editions:'''
:The [[Electrotyping|electro]]s from the "Burton Society" edition were acquired by the "Burton Club" — “the ''nom de plume'' of a certain Boston publisher”, according to N.C. Penzer.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 126.&lt;/ref&gt; This very successful series of editions probably began in 1903 (none of the volumes bear dates) and continued for many decades. There are 114 illustrations by various (at least 13) English and French artists. Many of these are uncredited and many are from other (some pre-Burton) editions of the ''Nights'', some even having nothing to do with the ''Nights'' or even the Middle East. (All of Letchford's works from the Nichols/Smithers edition are there, except the portrait of Burton.).&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Penzer's bibliography lists nine different Burton Club editions; after about 1905 each was named after a city (Benares, Mecca, Medinah, Aden, Baghdad, Samara, Bassorah, Shammar, and Luristan), a new one appearing about every two years. Penzer called these the "Catch Word" editions and there are known to be at least 6 others (Teheran, Baroda, etc). These editions were made semi-surreptitiously up through the 1920s and many may have been printed in the US, but bound in the UK. There exists no definitive list of all "Burton Club" editions or their sequence. According to Penzer, the "Illustrated Benares" edition was the first.

'''''The Sacred Art of Stealing''''' is a satirical [[crime novel]] by the Scottish writer [[Christopher Brookmyre]]. It is the author's seventh book and is a stand-alone sequel to ''[[A Big Boy did it and Ran Away]]''.

The book is a tale of the unusual romance between likable thief, half Scottish half Mexican, Zal Innez and D.I. Angelique de Xavia, the police officer whose job it is to catch him. Martial arts expert de Xavia is recovering from her recent experiences as told in ''[[A Big Boy did it and Ran Away]]''.

The book uses a blend of [[black humour]], strong language, violence and references to literary and artistic works such as ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by [[Samuel Beckett]].

== Plot summary ==
The plot of ''The Sacred Art of Stealing'' tells the story of American Zal Innez, a witty and intellectual art-loving thief, who is being blackmailed by crime boss Alessandro Estabol to do one last major job for him.

As a warm up to their main heist, Zal and his team of fellow failed artists rob a [[Glasgow]] bank of approaching a million pounds. During the raid they use unorthodox methods such as firing itching powder at armed police, carrying fake guns, staging plays and drawing works of art for their hostages to keep casualties to a minimum.

During this robbery Zal meets and falls for a woman police officer, Angelique de Xavia, heroine of Brookmyre's previous novel, who is under-appreciated by her bosses.

Both police officer and thief become painfully aware of the strong attraction between them and a relationship is formed, despite the fact that they are both fully aware that they are on opposite sides. Zal knows Angelique is after him, and even counts on this knowledge to complete his final job, while Angelique is aware that Zal is playing her, even though she does not want to contemplate what that might imply about his real feelings for her.

==Characters==
; Detective Inspector Angelique de Xavia : Glaswegian [[police officer]] and loyal [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] supporter (despite the fact she is Catholic and her brother is a [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] fan) who feels isolated as a female [[Asian people|Asian]] police officer. Angelique is justifiably annoyed with the attitudes of her senior colleagues who have publicly stated that her previous heroics were unjustified, despite secretly knowing that she really saved their skins. When she is held hostage by Zal, a strong connection is created between them and throughout the rest of the book she faces the difficulties of pursuing him while at the same time sympathising with his plight. Also appears in Brookmyre's other novels, ''[[A Big Boy did it and Ran Away]]'' and ''[[A Snowball in Hell]]''.

; Zal Innez : [[Machiavellian]] former artist and thief who, having deliberately been caught during a robbery he was committing for Alessandro Estobal, finds himself out of jail and working for Estobal's again. Estobal is blackmailing him by threatening to kill Zal's friend, and guardian in prison, Parnell. Zal is a likeable American, who is drawn to Glasgow because his father was Glaswegian. He combines wit with a vast literary and artistic knowledge and appreciation. Later returns in Brookmyre's novel, ''[[A Snowball in Hell]]''.

; Alessandro Estobal : Heir to the venerable Estobal crime family. Alsessandro is a young hothead, whose rash methods are frowned on by the rest of the organisation. Alessandro holds a grudge against Zal and his friends who rejected him when he tried to join their crowd, he then had them steal several paintings under the threat of killing Zal's father. Zal intentionally messed the job up to land in jail and as a result Alessandro killed his father. Upon Zal's release from prison Alessandro attempts to coerce him into another robbery, this time by threatening to kill Parnell, a prisoner who helped Zal toughen up both mentally and physically while behind bars.

; "American" Harry Arthur : Real name Javier Arturo, big-time American [[gangster]] and [[assassination|assassin]] who works for the Estobal family. Harry is very cynical about Alessandro, and believes that he is not up to the job of being the head of the family. As a result, he questions many of Alessandro's plans, including his use of Innez, who Harry (correctly) believes cannot be trusted by them. His nickname is derived from his Mexican origins which Harry appears to be ashamed of, and his desire to put himself across as being 100% American.

'''Tievebulliagh''' ({{Irish derived place name|Taobh Builleach}}) is a 554-metre high mountain in the [[Glens of Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It forms part of the [[Water divide|watershed]] between [[Glenaan]] to the north and [[Glenballyemon]] to the south. It is situated about 4.4&amp;nbsp;km from [[Cushendall]].&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland.

==Geology==
[[File:Dolerite-porcellanite Contact - geograph.org.uk - 472788.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porcellanite]] layer is the black rock above the hammer, and below the brown layer higher up the slope at Tievebulliagh]]
Tievebulliagh is formed from a [[volcanic plug]], the intense heat generated by molten basalt has given rise to the formation of a durable flint, [[porcellanite]], which is found at the foot of the eastern scree slope of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habitas.org.uk/escr/summary.asp?item=14 Habitas Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Three small outcrops of porcellanite can be seen on the higher south-east slope.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;

Evidence has been discovered of  a [[Neolithic]] axe quarry at the foot of Tievebulliagh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=6333459 The Megalithic Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; Flint axe heads fashioned from [[porcellanite]] that originate from this quarry have been found across the [[British Isles]], from  the [[Outer Hebrides]] to the south coast of [[England]] and across the rest of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Viney, M. (2003) ''Ireland''. Blackstaff Press. Belfast. {{ISBN|0-85640-744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site compares with the [[Langdale axe industry]] based in the [[English Lake District]] and the quarries at [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]], where large numbers of [[stone axe]]s were manufactured.

Flakes, rejects and part-finished axes have been found round the hill and peak. It was here that the axes were roughed out before being finished at the sea shore. They were then exported as far afield as south-west Ireland, south-east [[England]] and north-east [[Scotland]]. No finished axes have been found at the site itself.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt; 

The "Malone Hoard", consisting of 19 polished [[stone axe]]s from [[porcellanite]] Tievebulliagh or similar material from Brockley on [[Rathlin Island]], was found at Danesfort house, on the Malone Road, [[Belfast]]. Some of the axes were inserted upright in the ground. The axes may be too big and heavy for practical use, so perhaps were meant to be used for ceremonial purposes. They are currently held in the [[Ulster Museum]] in Belfast.

There is a [[Bronze Age]] cairn on the mountain top. The round cairn and [[Neolithic]] axe factory on Tievebulliagh are Scheduled Historic Monuments sited in the [[townland]] of [[Cloghs]], in [[Moyle District Council]] area, at grid ref: area of

There are numerous [[neolithic]] and [[bronze age]] monuments in the vicinity in [[County Antrim]], and include [[stone circle]]s, [[long barrow]]s and [[stone row]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1593">'''Titus Quinctius Atta''' (died 77 BC) was a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] [[comedy]] writer, and, like [[Titinius]] and [[Lucius Afranius (poet)|Afranius]], was distinguished as a writer of ''[[fabulae togatae]]'', national comedies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
==Works==
He had the reputation of being a vivid delineator of character, especially female. He also seems to have published a collection of [[epigram]]s. 
The scanty fragments contain many archaisms, but are lively in style. According to [[Horace]] (''Epistles'', ii 1. 79), the plays of Atta were still put on the stage in his lifetime. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Surviving Titles and Fragments==
We only have the titles (and associated fragments) of twelve of Atta's plays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018. Changing Our Worlds: Arts as Transformative Practice (Vol. 12). AFRICAN SUN MeDIA.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Christianity''' or '''global Christianity''' is a term that attempts to convey the global nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion. However, the term often focuses on “non-[[Western Christianity]]” which “comprises (usually the exotic) instances of Christian faith in ‘the [[global South]]’, in Asia, Africa and Latin America.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=2|title=Christianity as a World Religion|author-last1=Kim|author-first1=Sebastian|author-last2=Kim|author-first2=Kirsteen|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or [[diaspora|diasporic]] forms in Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Hanciles2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jehu Hanciles|title=Beyond Christendom: Globalization, African Migration, and the Transformation of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmCDAwAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=978-1-60833-103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==
The term ''world Christianity'' can first be found in the writings of [[Francis John McConnell]] in 1929 and [[Henry P. Van Dusen]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/human-needs-and-world-christianity/oclc/893126|title=Human needs and world Christianity|last=McConnell|first=Francis John|date=1929|publisher=Friendship Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-christianity-yesterday-today-tomorrow/oclc/823535&amp;referer=brief_results|title=World Christianity: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow|last=Van Dusen|first=Henry P.|date=1947|publisher=Abingdon-Cokesbury Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term would likewise be used by the mission historian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] to speak of the "World Christian Fellowship" and "World Christian Community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/toward-a-world-christian-fellowship/oclc/1149344|title=Toward a world Christian fellowship|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1938|publisher=Association Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/emergence-of-a-world-christian-community/oclc/396146|title=The Emergence of a World Christian Community|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1949|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these individuals, world Christianity was meant to promote the idea of [[Christian mission]]s and [[Ecumenism|ecumenical unity]]. However, after the end of World War II, as Christian missions ended in many countries such as [[North Korea]] and [[China]] and parts of Asia and Africa shifted due to [[decolonization]] and [[Self-determination|national independence]], these aspects of world Christianity were largely lost.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Peter C.|author-link=Peter C. Phan|date=2012|title=World Christianity: Its Implications for History, Religious Studies, and Theology|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/horizons/article/world-christianity-its-implications-for-history-religious-studies-and-theology/DC26D946FC1FA4452741E7E28B921072|journal=Horizons|volume=39|issue=2|pages=171–188|doi=10.1017/S0360966900010665|issn=2050-8557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current usage of the term puts much less emphasis in [[Christian mission|missions]] and [[ecumenism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A number of historians have noted a twentieth-century "global shift" in Christianity, from a religion largely found in Europe and the Americas to one which is found in the [[Global South|global south]].&lt;ref name="Walls2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNq6BwAAQBAJ|title=Missionary Movement in Christian History: Studies in the Transmission of Faith|first=|date=1996|publisher=Orbis Books|year=|isbn=978-1-60833-106-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Andrew F. Walls}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=Dana L.|date=April 2000|title=Shifting Southward: Global Christianity Since 1945|url=http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/2000-02/2000-02-050-robert.pdf|journal=International Bulletin of Missionary Research|volume=24|issue=2|pages=50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-hUWm88QGkC|title=The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199767465|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, "world Christianity" has more recently been used to describe the diversity and the multiplicity of Christianity across its two thousand year history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another term that is often used as analogous to "world Christianity" is the term "global Christianity." However, scholars such as [[Lamin Sanneh]] have argued that "global Christianity" refers to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] understanding of Christianity that emphasizes the replication of Christian forms and patterns in Europe, whereas "world Christianity" refers to the multiplicity of indigenous responses to the Christian gospel.&lt;ref name="Sanneh2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gbz-xMP1zYC|title=Whose Religion Is Christianity?: The Gospel Beyond the West|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2164-5|pages=22–23|author=Lamin Sanneh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable figures in the academic study of world Christianity include [[Andrew Walls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding World Christianity: The Vision and Work of Andrew F.

In contrast to these historians, there is a growing number of [[Christian theology|theologians]] who have been engaging the field of world Christianity from the discipline of [[systematic theology]]. Some examples of this include the Pentecostal [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]]&amp;nbsp;and the Catholic [[Peter C. Phan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8_wCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|title=The Dialogical Spirit: Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium|last=Yong|first=Amos|publisher=James Clark and Co.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=121–148|chapter=Whither Evangelical Theology?
