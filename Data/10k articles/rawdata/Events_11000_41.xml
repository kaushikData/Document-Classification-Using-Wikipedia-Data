== Background ==
Following the [[Libyan civil war]], many ethnic [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] who had fought for the [[Gaddafi]] government and the rebels took their weapons and left for [[Azawad]] (a region in Northern Mali that the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] (MNLA) wants to be an independent state). Following several previously failed [[Tuareg rebellion (disambiguation)|Tuareg rebellion]]s,&lt;!--intentional link to disambiguation page--&gt; the MNLA managed to take over the area and [[Azawadi declaration of independence|declare independence]]. However, the secular movement was soon overrun by [[Islamist]]-oriented groups such as [[MOJWA]] and [[Ansar Dine]]. The French launched [[Operation Serval|a military operation]] that ousted the rebels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/usa/322948-us-africom-mali-terrorism/ |title=Behind the scenes: US involved in Mali since 9/11 |publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional [[African-led International Support Mission to Mali|military support from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]].&lt;ref name=BBCNov20 /&gt; However, [[Northern Mali conflict|simmering tensions]] and irregular incidents continued to occur. The [[Macina Liberation Front]] is a new jihadist group operating in central and southern Mali led by the radical Muslim cleric [[Amadou Kouffa]], a strong proponent of strict Islamic law in Mali. The group draws most of its support from the [[Fulani people|Fulani]] ethnic group, who are found across the [[Sahel region]]. Kouffa is a close ally of Ansar Dine leader [[Iyad ag Ghali]]. A Human Rights Watch report said the Macina Liberation Front militants had carried out serious abuses in parts of central Mali since January and killed at least five people they accused of being aligned to the government. The group has attacked police and military particularly in the Mopti region, most recently killing three soldiers in Tenenkou in August. The Malian military recently arrested Alaye Bocari, a man they say was a key MLF financier and Kouffa's right-hand man.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34897745|title=Mali hotel attack: Police seek info on hotel attack gunmen|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radisson Blu]] hotel in [[Bamako]] is in a business district that is close to the embassies, and is frequented by foreign businesspeople and government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why the Radisson Hotel in Mali was a prime target |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/mali/12007918/Why-the-Radisson-Hotel-in-Mali-was-a-prime-target.html |website=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=20 November 2015 |date=20 November 2015 |last=Blair |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a chain of up-market hotels that is operated by the [[Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group]], which has headquarters in the United States and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where is Bamako and why has the Radisson hotel been targeted by terrorists? |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mali-hotel-siege-bamako-radisson-6866044 |website=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror plc |accessdate=20 November 2015 |date=20 November 2015 |last=Dubuis |first=Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UN peacekeepers]] supported the [[Malian Armed Forces]] by reinforcing security around the hotel.&lt;ref name="BBCNov20" /&gt; 25 U.S. Special Forces were in Bamako at the time of the attack and assisted Malian forces in evacuating civilians to secure locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An official from the [[U.S. Defense Department]] said that 22 military and civilian department personnel were in the city, including five people who were at the hotel. However, he added that everyone was accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. One member, who was outside, entered the hotel to help [[first responder]]s move civilians to secure locations while the Malian operation was ongoing. Another member helped at the Joint Operations Center, which was set up to respond to the incident. The official also said that the forces did not directly participate in the operation. A further 12 U.S. citizens were rescued by security forces, according to [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A dozen US citizens rescued after Mali hotel attack|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3327189/US-special-forces-assist-Mali-hotel-hostage-recovery-Pentagon.html|work=dailymail.co.uk|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were earlier reports of more gunmen involved in the hotel attack, the investigation determined that in fact there were only two attackers.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt;

== Responsibility ==
While the attack was under way, [[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoun]] claimed responsibility for it via [[Twitter]], although its claim has not been verified.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ilsley"&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalie Ilsley|url=http://www.newsweek.com/islamist-group-claims-responsibility-mali-attack-396659|title=Al-Mourabitoun Group Claims Responsibility for Mali Attack|work=Newsweek|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an audio recording provided to Al Jazeera, the group also claimed responsibility and said that it had undertaken the attack jointly with [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM).&lt;ref name="Boshnaq"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mona Boshnaq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/mali-hotel-attack-latest-updates/al-mourabitoun-takes-responsibility-for-siege-al-jazeera-reports/|title=Al Mourabitoun Claims Responsibility for Mali Siege, Al Jazeera|work=The New York Times|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mourabitoun is made up of [[Tuaregs]] and [[Arabs]] from northern Mali and is affiliated with AQIM.&lt;ref name="Ilsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boshnaq" /&gt; The group, led by [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]], formed in 2013 and is based in the [[Sahara Desert]].&lt;ref name="ReutersMourabitounClaim"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/20/us-mali-hotel-claim-idUSKCN0T91YM20151120|title=Al Qaeda-affiliated group claims Mali hotel attack|agency=Reuters|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macina Liberation Front]] also claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[President of Mali|Malian President]] [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta]] cut short his visit to [[Chad]] in order to return to Bamako and coordinate the response.&lt;ref name="BBCNov20" /&gt; Mali also declared a 10-day state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://post.jagran.com/Mali-declares-10day-state-of-emergency-following-hotel-attack-1448080713|title=Mali declares 10-day state of emergency following hotel attack|date=21 November 2015|publisher=jagran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference, French Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] stated that France will take "all steps necessary" to fight the attackers in Bamako. A crisis unit was set up in the [[Embassy of France in Bamako|embassy]].&lt;ref name="BBCNov20" /&gt; Forty officers from the [[National Gendarmerie]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] [[special forces]] unit, along with ten forensic and criminal officers, were sent to "advise and support" Malian security forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title = World News liveblog|url = http://live.reuters.com/Event/World_News?ShowComments=0|agency = Reuters|accessdate = 20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/20/mali-hotel-attack-gunmen-take-hostages-in-bamako-live-updates|title=Mali hotel attack: gunmen take hostages in Bamako – live updates|date=20 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air France]] flights to and from Bamako were suspended for the day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Russian city of [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]], home of five of the victims, declared 23 November a mourning day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.com/news/2015/11/22/bodies-of-rusian-hostages-killed-in-mali-to-be-transported-home-in-a-week_542967 Russia Beyond the Headlines: Bodies of Russian hostages killed in Mali to be transported home in a week]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita later declared three days of national mourning in Mali. Ahead of the three days of national mourning, the chairman of the West African regional bloc Ecowas, Senegal's President [[Macky Sall]], visited Bamako to show support. He said on Sunday: "Mali will never be alone in this fight, we are all committed because we are all involved." [[Senegal]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Guinea]] are also observing the mourning.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

==Investigation==
Three days after the attack, the Malian government released photographs of the corpses of the two attackers.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt; The men were clean-shaven and appeared to be in their 20s.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt; One "had visible bullet wounds to his upper body."&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt; The authorities have not been able to identify the men and urged members of the public with information to come forward.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt; Al Mourabitoun, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said that the men were Abdul Hakim al-Ansari and Mu'adh al-Ansari, but this claim has not been verified.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt;

On November 22, 2015, two separate police sources speaking to [[Agence-France Presse]] on condition of [[Anonymous source|anonymity]] said that "two foreigners" along with "three or four accomplice" were responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/investigation-into-mali-attack-points-to-two-foreigners/a-18868048 Investigation into Mali attack points to 'two foreigners'], [[Deutsche Welle]] (November 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 2015, Malian special forces arrested two Malian men in their early 30s on the outskirts if Bamako in connection with the attack.&lt;ref name="Arrests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNArrests"&gt;Faith Karimi &amp; Brent Swails, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/27/africa/mali-hotel-attack-arrest/ Mali arrests 2 suspects in hotel terror attack], CNN (November 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The men were linked to the attack by a mobile phone found at the scene of the attack.&lt;ref name="CNNArrests"/&gt;

The '''48 Hour Film Project''' is an annual [[film]] competition in which teams of filmmakers are assigned a [[genre]], a [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[Theatrical property|prop]], and a [[Dialogue|line of dialogue]], and have 48 hours to create a [[short film]] containing those elements. The competition has been active since 2001.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt; 

In the weeks after the 48 hours of filmmaking are complete, screenings are held in each city and a winner is chosen to represent that city at [[Filmapalooza]]—a festival that features "best of" screenings of the winners from each city.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt; Filmapalooza is hosted by a different city each year.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.48hourfilm.com/about/history.php |publisher=48 Hour Film Project |title=The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About |date=April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325133858/http://www.48hourfilm.com/about/history.php |archivedate=25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent Filmapalooza was held in [[Paris|Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.48hourfilm.com/filmapalooza/2018|title=Filmapalooza 2018 @ 48 Hour Film Project|website=www.48hourfilm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Background ==
The competition began in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 2001.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt;  It was created by Mark Ruppert and is produced by Ruppert and Liz Langston.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt; In 2009, nearly 40,000 filmmakers made around 3,000 films in 76 cities across the globe.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt;

After the 48 hours of filmmaking are complete, each city screens all the competing films, and a jury subsequently vote on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd best films. Most cities also give out awards to their films in several categories, including directing, writing, and acting; an Audience Choice award is sometimes voted on as well, by the audience of the screenings in each city.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt;

The film that wins 1st place goes on to represent their city at [[Filmapalooza]]—a festival that features "best of" screenings of the winners from each city.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt; Filmapalooza is hosted by a different city each year.&lt;ref name="The 48 Hour Film Project: What We're About" /&gt; The most recent Filmapalooza was held in [[Paris|Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Related competitions==

In 2003, the creators of the 48 Hour Film Project created the National Film Challenge, which is an annual three-day film competition with roughly the same structure as the 48 Hour Film Project, except that the films are mailed in when completed and then screened on-line, rather than being shown in movie theater in the local city.&lt;ref name="National Film Challenge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmchallenge.org|title=National Film Challenge|date=April 2010|publisher=National Film Challenge|accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, this competition was opened to filmmakers from around the world and although the name was not officially changed, the runner-up hailed from Utrecht, Netherlands.&lt;ref name="National Film Challenge" /&gt; 

The organizers of the [[Auckland]] competition split off from the 48 Hour Film Project after the 2003 competition and formed [[48HOURS]], which is now a wholly separate organization that runs a similar competition in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.48hours.co.nz/about/|title=About HP48Hours {{!}} 48HOURS 2018|website=www.48hours.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the producers of the National Film Challenge began the International Documentary Challenge (also known as the "Doc Challenge") in which participating filmmakers produce a documentary in under five days.&lt;ref name="Doc Challenge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docchallenge.org/|title=Doc Challenge|date=April 2010|publisher=Doc Challenge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402070547/http://www.docchallenge.org/|archivedate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, 48 Go Green split off from 48 Hour Film Project to become a separate, independent organization. 48 Go Green had a similar style of competition. The primary differences were an ecological theme, and an entirely online competition to allow worldwide participation. 48 Go Green and 48 Hour Film Project parted ways following a disagreement between 48 Hour Film Project and co-producers Francesco Vitali and Christos Siametis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.48gogreendisclaimer.com/|title=48 Go Green Disclaimer|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.48gogreen.com/page/1|title=48 Go Green: The Creation|publisher=Creamyw Ltd|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48 Go Green soon became [[48FILM Project]].&lt;ref name="sandiego"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegored.com/noticias/49385/The-48-Film-Project-Officially-Announced/|title=The 48 Film Project Officially Announced|author=Jorge Guevara|date=20 February 2014|publisher=San Diego Red}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The assassination took place after a long period of highly polarized and incited political atmosphere in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/turkey-isis-russia-pkk/408988/|title=Turkey Is in Serious Trouble|author=Soner Cagaptay|date=5 October 2015|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/12/20/turkeys-permanent-state-of-crisis/|title=Turkey’s permanent state of crisis|author=Soner Cagaptay|date=20 December 2016|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after several days of protests by Turks against [[Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War]] and in particular the [[Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)|battle over Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/russia-get-out-syria-thousands-join-protest-turkey-border-1298309781|title='Russia, get out of Syria': Thousands join protest on Turkey border|date=17 December 2016|publisher=MiddleEastEye|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and Turkish officials held talks on brokering a ceasefire in Syria during the [[Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)#Ceasefires and evacuation|evacuation of Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/turkey-russia-meet-wednesday-syrias-aleppo-turkish-official-091517656.html|title=Turkey talking to Russia on ceasefire, evacuation from Syria's Aleppo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, Turkey and Iran planned to meet to negotiate a settlement over the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-russia-idUSKBN1480ZO|title=Russia, Iran and Turkey to hold Syria talks in Moscow on Tuesday|date=19 December 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/syria-talks-between-iran-turkey-and-russia-will-still-go-on-in-moscow-despite-ambassadors-assassination-2016-12|title=Syria talks between Iran, Turkey, and Russia will still go on in Moscow despite ambassador's assassination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination ==
Karlov, the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, had been invited to deliver a speech at the opening of an exhibition of Turkish photography of the Russian countryside. The exhibition, "Russia through Turks' eyes", was being held at the Cagdas Sanat Merkezi centre for modern arts in [[Ankara]]'s [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya district]].&lt;ref name="SoichetThompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/index.html|title=Russia's ambassador to Turkey assassinated in Ankara|website=CNN|last1=CNN|first1=Catherine E. Shoichet and Nick Thompson|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mevlüt Altıntaş entered the hall using police identification, leading gallery attendees to believe he was one of Karlov's personal bodyguards.&lt;ref name="ABCNews20Dec" /&gt; Karlov had begun his speech when Altıntaş fired several shots at the Russian ambassador from the back, fatally wounding him and injuring several other people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/index.html|title=Gunman shouted 'Do not forget Aleppo!' as he shot ambassador|last=Shoichet|first=Catherine E.|last2=Thompson|first2=Nick|date=|website=CNN|publisher=|access-date=20 December 2016|last3=Grinberg|first3=Emanuella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After shooting Karlov, Altıntaş circled the room, smashing pictures that were on display and shouting in Arabic and Turkish: "[[Takbir|''Allahu Akbar'']] (God is the greatest). We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.

=== Motivation ===

Although seemingly an act of revenge against Russian [[Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)|military involvement in Aleppo]] as part of the ongoing Syrian Civil War, some have suspected [[Islamic extremism]] or [[anti-Russian sentiment]] to be the cause of the attack.

Born in Moscow in 1954, Andrei Gennadyevich Karlov was educated at the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] and the Diplomatic Academy. He began his career with the government at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR]] in 1976. Karlov went on to hold various diplomatic positions at the Russian embassy to [[North Korea]]. He had been Russian ambassador to Turkey since July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who was Andrey Karlov?

The assassin was identified as '''Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈmevlyt ˈmæɾt ˈɑɫtɯntɑʃ|lang}}; 24 June 1994 – 19 December 2016), an off-duty Turkish [[Cevik Kuvvet|riot police]] officer.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

Altıntaş grew up in a [[secular]] family from the town [[Söke]] of [[Aydın Province]] in the Aegean region of western Turkey.

A Turkish newspaper reported that Altıntaş had been suspended in early October 2016 for suspected involvement in the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], but returned to duty in mid-November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karlov's assassin stayed in hotel close to scene, took 11 shots|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/karlovs-assassin-stayed-in-hotel-close-to-scene-took-11-shots.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=107528&amp;NewsCatID=509|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=Hürriyet Daily News|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altıntaş' body was rejected by his family; his parents stated that "We are ashamed of him because of the murder and we will not claim the body of a traitor." His body was buried in a cemetery for unidentified and unclaimed corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family rejects body of Russian envoy's killer|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2017/01/05/family-rejects-body-of-russian-envoys-killer|accessdate=16 January 2017|publisher=Daily Sabah Turkey|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
&lt;!--Please read the talk page discussion before adding reactions to this section--&gt;
Many governments and [[heads of state]] condemned the attack and offered condolences to the family of Karlov and other victims of the shooting, as well as to the Russian people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/issues_and_press/mfa_statements/x2016_12_19_mfa_of_the_czech_republic_condemns_the.html|title=Statement of the MFA of the Czech Republic on the Assassination of Russian Ambassador to Turkey|date=19 December 2016|website=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]]|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/12/265774.htm|title=The Assassination of Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkish reaction ===
In Turkey, President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] said in a video message that "Turkey-Russia relations are vital for the region and those who aimed to harm ties were not going to achieve their goals", after having spoken to Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], adding that they "both agreed the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Ankara by a gunman was an act of provocation by those looking to harm relations of our countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pamuk|first1=Humeyra|last2=Toksabay|first2=Ece|last3=Dolan|first3=David|title=Turkey's Erdogan says Putin agrees shooting of ambassador was provocation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-russia-diplomat-idUSKBN14829U|website=Reuters|accessdate=19 December 2016|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Foreign Ministry]] pledged to spare no effort to not let "this attack cast a shadow on the Turkish-Russian friendship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkish MFA says won't allow killing of ambassador 'cast shadow' over Turkish-Russian friendship|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2016/12/19/turkish-mfa-says-wont-allow-killing-of-ambassador-cast-shadow-over-turkish-russian-friendship|work=DailySabah}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Turkish Foreign Minister]] [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] announced that the street in which the Russian embassy is located would be named after the ambassador.&lt;ref name="221a" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17336">[[File:BMBallHarpers.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Bradley-Martin Ball by Harry Whitney McVickar]]
The '''Bradley-Martin Ball''' was a lavish [[Costume party|costume ball]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Hotel]] in [[New York City]] on the night of February 10, 1897. Cornelia Bradley-Martin, wife of [[Bradley Martin]], organized the ball, with the intention of making it "the greatest party in the history of the city". Eight hundred [[socialite]]s spent about $400,000 imitating kings and queens.&lt;ref name="FTMartin"&gt;{{cite book |title= Things I Remember (1913) |last= Martin |first= Frederick Townsend |authorlink=Frederick Townsend Martin |coauthors= |year= 1913 |publisher= John Lane Company |location= New York |isbn= 0-548-83545-4 |pages= 280–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley-Martin's stated intention was to create an economic stimulus for New York City, which was at the end of the [[Long Depression]] which began in 1873 and included the [[Panic of 1893]]. The Bradley-Martins spent approximately $9.7 million in today's money to throw the ball. Across the country, preachers and editorial writers argued over the propriety of a party that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the end, the ball was a social triumph but created negative publicity.&lt;ref name="McGerr"&gt;McGerr, Michael. ''A Fierce Discontent''. [[Oxford University Press]], Inc. NY, pages 4-6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before the Ball ==
In the three weeks leading up to it, New York society made the ball its one topic of discussion. The ''Commercial Advertiser'' exclaimed: "There is a great stir today in fashionable circles and even in public circles. The cause of it all is the Bradley Martin ball, beside which the [[Olney–Pauncefote Treaty|arbitration treaty]], [[Cuban War of Independence|the Cuban question]], and the [[Lexow Committee|Lexow investigation]] seem to have become secondary matters of public interest."&lt;ref name="yodelout"&gt;{{cite web |title=Waldorf-Astoria – Famous Dinners, Balls, And Guests |url=https://new-york-city.yodelout.com/waldorf-astoria-famous-dinners-balls-and-guests/ |website=new-york-city.yodelout.com |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guests included: [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor]], known simply as Mrs. Astor, costumed as [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], her son [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]] as [[Henry IV of France]] and his wife as [[Marie Antoinette]],&lt;ref name="RHutto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutto |first=Richard Jay |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 1997 |title=The Party of the Century |journal=Quest |volume= |issue= |pages=52–57 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James L. Breese]] as the [[Duke of Guise]], [[John Pierpont Morgan]], Charles Childs as [[Lady Teazle]], [[Hermann Oelrichs]] as a Dutch Bergomaster, [[Charles Post]] as [[Madame de Maintenon]], [[Stanford White]] in a Court costume of black velvet and white satin, the artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] as a Spanish toreador, [[Pierpont Morgan]] as [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], and Hamilton Fish Webster as [[Maria Theresa of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Febseventh"/&gt;

==The Ball==
[[File:JamesLBreese BMBall.jpg|thumb|right |James L. Breese dressed as the Duke of Guise in white corded silk with embroidery of pearls and silver lace.]]
=== Concept ===
Cornelia Bradley-Martin’s idea was to give a costume ball at so short notice that her guests would not have time to get their dresses from [[Paris]], and instead support local businesses.&lt;ref name="FTMartin"/&gt; This overlapped with the idea that it was much better for the laboring people if the wealthy spent their money locally instead of taking it to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Febfourth"&gt;{{cite news |title=TALKED ON THE COMING BALL. Mr. Gunton Thinks the Rich Should Spend Their Money Here. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/04/102398950.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 4, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Dr. Rainsford believed in the rich giving money to be distributed as charity, whereas others, including the members of the [[Musical Mutual Protective Union]] (MMPU), disagreed. They believed in the wealthy spending their wealth in enjoying themselves, and thus giving hundreds and thousands of working people an opportunity to earn money and maintain their self-respect instead of having to accept charity. The MMPU became indignant when they heard that the Marine Band was to be at the ball instead of musicians from their union. The members of the Marine Band did not urgently need the money that they were going to receive from the ball.&lt;ref name="Janthirtieth"&gt;{{cite news |title=MUSICIANS ARE INDIGNANT.

[[Florist]] Small was in charge of the decorations for the Bradley-Martin ball. Decorating the Waldorf began on the morning of February 9 by A.W. Merritt, Small’s colleague. In the days leading up to the event, dealers’ stocks and household stores were ransacked to supply the demand for ornaments and historical accuracy. All the jewelers who dealt in antiques were cleaned out of all they had on hand. Jewels held as [[heirloom]]s by the old families of New York were taken from safety vaults. Laces that had been locked away in family chests or in safe deposit vaults for long years had been retrieved.&lt;ref name="Febninth"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE BRADLEY MARTIN BALL {{!}} A Wealth of Heirlooms in Antique Jewels and Rare Old Laces, to be Shown. {{!}} PRICELESS FAMILY TREASURES. {{!}} Dealers' Stocks and Household Stores Ransacked and Exhausted to Supply the Demand for Ornaments and Historical Accuracy. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/09/102399244.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 9, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve hundred invitations were issued for the event, and more than half of those invited were in attendance. Some who did come also left early, seeming to have made an appearance out of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"&gt;{{cite news |title=BRADLEY MARTIN BALL {{!}} Not so Many Guests Attended the Function at The Waldorf as Had Been Expected. {{!}} THE SCENE IN THE HANDSOMELY DECKED DANCING ROOM. {{!}} Those Who Took Part in the Exhibition Dances — Some of the Guests and Their Costumes — The Supper and Decorations. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/11/100419295.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Waldorf ===
"The interior of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was transformed into a replica of Versailles, and rare tapestries, beautiful flowers and countless lights made an effective background for the wonderful gowns and their wearers."&lt;ref name = "FTMartin"/&gt;

Police officers stood guard at the entrance to the Waldorf. The Bradley-Martins arrived first at 10:15 pm. At half past 10 a group of carriages arrived and before 11 the stream of guests had become continuous. The guests were ushered into the Waldorf, whereupon they ascended to the corridors on the second floor where 15 dressing rooms were available for the use and comfort of the guests.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Febtenth"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE BRADLEY MARTIN FETE The Waldorf Yesterday Given up to the Decorators and to Rehearsals of the Dances.

This wasn’t done through any feeling of fear, but merely as a wise precaution.&lt;ref name="Febninth"/&gt; Wigmakers and make-up artists were available in these rooms. When leaving the dressing rooms the guests headed to the smaller ballroom. It was here where Cornelia Bradley-Martin received her guests. A lackey announced the guests’ names and the characters they impersonated to her. This stream of guests poured by her for nearly 90 minutes and it was after midnight before she was able to enter the main ballroom to take her place in the opening ''quadrille d’honneur''.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt;[[File:MrsBradleyMartincameo.jpg|thumb | right | A Cameo of Cornelia Bradley-Martin dressed as Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, for the Ball.]]

=== Costumes ===
Cornelia Bradley-Martin requested her guests to pick something from the 16th, 17th, or 18th centuries, and some came dressed as [[George Washington]], a Japanese nobleman, an Egyptian princess and [[Pocahontas]]. A list was compiled and published in the ''New York Times'' three days prior to the event, listing guests and the historical characters they were going to impersonate and what costumes they were going to wear.&lt;ref name="Febseventh"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE BRADLEY MARTIN BALL; Preparations Nearly Completed for an Entertainment in Society Which Promises to be Historic.

[[Otho Cushing]], a young artist from Boston, created quite  a stir when he appeared as an Italian falconer's costume which consisted of full body tights, a short jacket and a cap with a stuffed falcon on one arm. "The costume left little to the imagination as far as the figure was concerned, and, although historically correct in every detail, was so decidedly pronounced that he made a sensation wherever he moved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Echoes of the Big Ball {{!}} Society People Still Gossipping Over Beautiful Surroundings and Pleasant Hours While Guests of the Bradley Martins.

=== Decorations ===
The smaller ballroom was set throughout with furniture of the [[Louis XV]] period, and the walls were hung with tapestry draperies. [[Rose]]s were hurled en masse against the draperies and let remain where they landed. The side of the room, where the Hungarian band was placed, was concealed by long-stemmed roses and garlands were dropped from the center to each side and over the mirrors.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt; The Hungarian Band, under the leadership of Carl Berlinger, played 12 concert selections, chosen by Mrs. Bradley-Martin, throughout the evening.&lt;ref name="Febseventh"/&gt;

Upon entering the grand ballroom the guests faced a wall in which 15 mirrors were imbedded. The far side of the room, the musicians’ balcony, was concealed by pink roses, with garlands also hanging from above. There were over 5,000 roses and 3,000 [[orchids]] in these various groupings.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt;

The café and the court were also decorated, with a desired homelike effect.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt; 125 tables were set up, each to accommodate six guests, with a centerpiece of Beauty roses.&lt;ref name="Febseventh"/&gt;

=== Music ===
The ''danse d’honneur'', arranged by Caroline Astor, opened the ball. The company was led by Cornelia Bradley-Martin, in the role of the Queen, escorted by John Jacob Astor as the King. For this danse d’honneur, the orchestra played music composed by Beethoven. Following this, the orchestra started playing one of [[Chopin|Chopin’s]] [[polonaises]] announcing the approach of the wife of Edmund L. Baylies and her associates for the [[minuet]]. When they formed for the minuet the orchestra struck into [[Mozart|Mozart’s]] dance music out of "[[Don Giovanni]]". The dance of the debutantes was next, and it was livelier than the others and the most difficult of all. The members of this set, organized by the wife of Frederic Bronson, danced a Hungarian Court quadrille, the Kormagyar, in music arranged by Allen Dodworth.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt; This quadrille ended the exhibition dances. General dancing followed the three quadrilles until supper time.&lt;ref name="Febseventh"/&gt;

=== Supper ===
[[File:RECEPTION AND BALL (held by) MRS. BRADLEY MARTIN (at) "22 WEST 20TH ST. NEW YORK, NY" (PRIVATE HOME) (NYPL Hades-270063-474713).tiff|thumb|right]]
"Between the grand ballroom and the cafe, used on this occasion for the supper room, is a barricade of windows, which were thrown open about 1 o'clock in the morning, and the guests were then at liberty to enjoy the delights of the cuisine. The menu was as follows:

=== Entertainment and Favors ===
The [[cotillion]] commenced at three, and spectators found amusement as the gentlemen danced it with swords at their sides. Swords got tangled in gowns and laces, and courtiers tripped over them, to the delight of the spectators. [[Elisha Dyer, Jr.]] led the cotillion.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt;

Cornelia Bradley-Martin selected small silver figures and a staff as “favors” for each of the guests of the ball. The “favors” were awarded by Elisha Dyer, Jr. as leader of the cotillion.&lt;ref name="Febeleventh"/&gt;

== Reaction and Controversy ==
Before the Ball took place, the [[Bradley-Martins]] drew fire from all directions, as newspapers criticized its extravagance and clergymen urged their congregations not to attend. One clergyman denounced the ball by saying: "You rich people put next to nothing in the collection plate, and yet you’ll spend thousands of dollars on Mrs. Bradley-Martin’s ball”.&lt;ref name="FTMartin"/&gt;

After the ball many ministers preached against its excessive consumption and the authorities promptly raised Bradley-Martin’s taxes (as well as those of their friends and fellow-attendees the Astors) quite out of proportion to those paid by anyone else. The Bradley-Martins returned to England, where they had owned a home for several years, and Scotland, where they leased a {{convert|65000|acre|km2|sing=on}} estate, Balmacaan.&lt;ref name="RHutto"/&gt;

Although historians have repeated oft-told half-truths without conducting primary research, the Bradley-Martin ball is perhaps best-remembered as the end of the excesses of the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref name="Beard2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Patricia |title=After the Ball |date=2009 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |isbn=9781524526375 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icxgDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conlin2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conlin |first1=Joseph R. |title=The American Past: A Survey of American History, Enhanced Edition |date=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495566225 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Mm6r3lOY5gC&amp;pg=PR82 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burning of Colón''', or the '''Panama Incident''', was a major event of the [[Colombian Civil War of 1885|Colombian Civil War in 1885]]. [[Panama]]nian rebels loyal to [[Pedro Prestan]] destroyed the city by committing [[arson]] before retreating after a battle with federal [[Colombia]]n troops. The episode also included a landing by [[United States]] [[US Navy|Navy]] sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] from two warships after the rebels seized American citizens.&lt;ref name="bruceruiz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bruceruiz.net/PanamaHistory/burning_of_colon_by_pedro_presta.htm|title=Burning of Colon by Pedro Prestan|website=bruceruiz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appletons', pg.44-46"&gt;Appletons', pg.44–46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
In the late 1800s Colombia's political situation was in turmoil as revolution and riots plagued the country. In 1885 another revolution began which spilled into the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. On or about March 16 the rebel leader Pedro Prestan occupied the small port of [[Colón, Panama|Colón]] on the [[Gulf Coast]] where he was waiting for a shipment of weapons by the American merchant ship ''Colon'' of the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]]. On March 26, [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[John M. Dow]], representing the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in Colon, received a letter from the Panamanian sub-[[Secretary of State]] informing him that the offloading of any weapons intended for rebels was strictly prohibited. On the following day, Captain Dow received another letter from [[Secretary General]] Gomina which advised that he had assumed the position of commander-in-chief of civil and military affairs and should any of the weapons be removed from the ''Colon'' then the agent responsible for their delivery might attempt  to seek asylum from the American or [[France|French]] naval forces present. Dow then informed the United States [[consul (representative)|consul]] Mr. Wright who relayed orders from the consul-general Mr. Adamson not to allow any weapons to be offloaded without the permission of the consulate or Captain [[Theodore Kane]] of the [[Steamboat|steamer]] [[USS Galena (1880)|USS ''Galena'']], which happened to be in port at the time. So on March 29, when the ''Colon'' arrived at Colon with fifty-two packages marked "M", Captain Dow assumed command and ordered that nothing be taken off the ship. This angered Pedro Prestan when he came to pick up his delivery and Dow and three others were then taken under arrest by [[militia]]men, one of the captives was a United States Navy [[lieutenant]] named Judd.&lt;ref name="Appletons', pg.44-46"/&gt;

When Captain Kane learned of the arrests, negotiations began between the two parties. Prestan wanted his guns and the Kane wanted the American citizens to be released but the captain could not use force as it meant risking the lives of the prisoners. Rebel forces included at least 100 men, around twenty of whom accompanied Prestan at all times and fortified a small position within the city streets. The remaining men were based outside of town at [[Monkey Hill]]. The rebels had an old [[cannon]] as well and threatened to open fire on the ''Galena'' if she came in towards the shore. Prestan also declared that if he was forced to retreat, he would destroy the city with [[dynamite]]. For several hours, until the next day, the negotiations proceeded and the Americans refused to give Prestan the cargo of weapons. Meanwhile, Captain Dow and the other prisoners were taken to the Panamanian base to be executed by a [[firing squad]]. Soon after Mr. Right ordered that the weapons be given up as it was the only means of releasing the hostages. Unknowingly, Captain Kane was distracting the rebels while the [[Colombian Army]] approached Colon. Eventually Prestan became alarmed and supposedly ordered his men to begin burning the city but it was later determined that he never gave such order; each party blamed the other for starting the fire, for which Prestán was hanged and later absolved by "resolución No. 101-30-48 de 24 de Septiembre").&lt;ref name="absolved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/opinion/columnistas/125-anos-ahorcamiento-pedro-prestan/23715372|title=A 125 años del ahorcamiento de Pedro Prestán|date=19 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the Colombians launched their attack. For a few hours the Panamanians held their position while the city burned around them until they were finally routed during the last Colombian charge. A detachment of about 100 marines and sailors from the ''Galena'' then landed at the request of the Colombian government and 600 more men and two cannons from the [[USS Tennessee (1865)|USS ''Tennessee'']] arrived within the next few days. [[Admiral]] [[James Edward Jouett]] assumed command of American forces which was tasked with protecting American property. This was hard because the fire quickly spread throughout Colon, causing great damage. Several of the destroyed buildings were American or [[Europe]]an owned and damages amounted to the millions though compensation was never paid.&lt;ref name="Appletons', pg.44-46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appletons', pg.44-46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1885/04/22/archives/affairs-on-the-isthmus-graphic-account-of-outrages-by-panama.html | work=The New York Times | title=Affairs On The Isthmus; Graphic Account Of Outrages By Panama Insurgents | date=April 22, 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colon burned for days and the American [[garrison]] withdrew without doing much to save the city. United States citizens were also evacuated along with other foreign nationals. The American government responded to the incident by sending men to [[United States occupation of Panama (1885)|occupy]] both Colon, for a second time, and the city of [[Panama City|Panama]]. There were no American casualties but between the Panamanians and the Colombians, eighteen people were killed and many more were wounded in action or hurt by the fire.&lt;ref name="bruceruiz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appletons', pg.44-46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

'''Castle Mill''' is a graduate housing complex of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]].

==Overview==
Castle Mill is located north of [[Oxford railway station]] along [[Roger Dudman Way]], just to the west of the railway tracks on what was formerly [[Cripley Meadow]], south of [[Port Meadow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wikimapia.org/4873082/Castle-Mill | title=Castle Mill (Oxford) | work=[[Wikimapia]] | accessdate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial buildings at the southern end of the site were completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/accommodation/graduate/properties-c/cmc/ | title=Castle Mill | publisher=[[University of Oxford]] | location=UK | accessdate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accommodation is available for single people, couples, and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxford-architects.com/Web_pages/Projects/universities/castle_mill.html | title=Castle Mill, University of Oxford | publisher=Oxford Architects | accessdate=28 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021020121/http://www.oxford-architects.com/Web_pages/Projects/universities/castle_mill.html | archivedate=21 October 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate students with children benefit from priority access to lower-cost accommodation, alleviating the over-stretched housing market in Central Oxford.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Facilities at Castle Mill include a common room, launderettes, bicycle racks and an outside barbecue area. The complex is supported by caretakers who live on site. The proximity of the railway causes a noise issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://castlemillpeople.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/welcome-to-castle-mill-oxford_28.html | title=Welcome to Castle Mill Oxford | work=Castle Mill People | location=UK | publisher=[[BlogSpot]] | date=29 November 2009 | accessdate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Castle Mill Stream]], a branch of the [[River Thames]], runs to the east of the site beyond the railway tracks, hence the name. From Castle Mill there are views of the railway lines to the East, and allotments and Port Meadow to the West.

In 2010, Oxford City Council capped the number of students that [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and Oxford Brookes University were permitted to have in private rented housing to 3,000 each. The Council was encouraged by local lobbies such as the East Oxford Residents Forum to use planning permission as an enforcement mechanism. If either University breached the cap, the Council threatened to prevent new buildings from being occupied. As a consequence of these restrictions, the Universities looked to develop sites for student accommodation in partnership with commercial providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/9837647.City_council_policy__a_total_sham_/| title=City Council policy a total sham|publisher=oxfordmail.co.uk |accessdate=21 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Oxford University Estates Directorate, with the help of [[Longcross (company)|Longcross]], have been developing the one [[hectare]] Castle Mill brown field site (400m × 25m), north of the existing accommodation, between the [[Cripley Meadow]] Allotments and the railway tracks, close to the southern end of [[Port Meadow]], to meet the need for graduate places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longcross.co.uk/our-projects/current-projects/castle-mill |title=Longcross at the University of Oxford, Castle Mill Phase 2 ∙ Innovation in action |publisher=Longcross |accessdate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224021145/http://www.longcross.co.uk/our-projects/current-projects/castle-mill |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.longcross.co.uk/newsroom/latest/oxford-residential | title=Longcross Secures Student Accommodation Project at Oxford University | date=July 2012 | publisher=Longcross | accessdate=23 October 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310041909/http://www.longcross.co.uk/newsroom/latest/oxford-residential | archivedate=10 March 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development has been controversial, since the four to five storey blocks overlook [[Port Meadow]], an historic open area to the north with views of some of Oxford's skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=City 'has to pay a price' to preserve Green Belt| newspaper=[[The Oxford Times]] | pages=1, 3 | date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners warned of damage to views of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/10022285._Save_our_famous_views_for_hideous_developments_/|title=Save our famous views for hideous developments | first=Reg | last=Little |newspaper=The Oxford Times | date=2 November 2012 | accessdate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10022285._Save_our_famous_views_for_hideous_developments_/|title=Save our famous views for hideous developments | first=Reg |last=Little|newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an online petition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=thepetitionsite.com |url=www.thepetitionsite.com/850/008/830/port-meadow-oxford-damaged-views/ | title=Port Meadow, Oxford.

In February 2013, a local newspaper reported that Oxford City Council had entered negotiations with Oxford University to reduce the height of the buildings by two storeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=U-turn over meadow flats | first=Pete | last=Hughes | newspaper=The Oxford Times |page=3 | date=14 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a protest and picket of [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], the University's formal assembly of senior members, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in central Oxford.&lt;ref name="little-21feb-13"&gt;{{cite news|title=More meadow protests | first=Reg | last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Times |page=3 | date=21 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cherwell.org/cherwelltv/video/2013/02/21/protests-to-save-port-meadow | title=Protests to save Port Meadow | first=Alexander |last=Woolley | newspaper=Cherwell.org | date=21 February 2013 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters including members of the University, such as [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], Professor of the History of the Church and TV historian. Oxford University donors, such as [[Michael Moritz]], and the University's [[Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University|Vice-Chancellor]], Prof. [[Andrew D.

In particular, views of the [[Grade I listed]] Italianate [[St Barnabas Church, Oxford|St Barnabas Church]] in [[Jericho, Oxford|Jericho]] have been affected. An internal report of 24 January 2012 at Oxford City Council&lt;ref name="internal-report"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/files/28845 | title=Internal heritage advice, made on 24 January 2012 on the scheme as originally submitted | date=24 January 2012 | first=Nick | last=Worlledge | publisher=Oxford City Council, via Oxford Mail | accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "[[Photomontage]]s show that from some parts of the meadow the view of the St Barnabas campanile will be obscured with the long unrelieved roof line cutting across in front of it." (See photograph to the right.)

In March 2013, it was revealed that Oxford City Council was warned about the threat to the views from Port Meadow.&lt;ref name="little-21mar-13"&gt;{{cite news|title=Council 'was warned' about meadow threat | first=Reg |last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Times |pages=1, 5 | date=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Head of Heritage at the Council reported on "the harmful impact", concluding that "There is no justification for this harm".&lt;ref name="internal-report" /&gt; The University submitted revised plans reducing the height of the blocks by 1.2m on 9 February 2012, yet the planning officer's report recommending approval of the revised scheme was dated 3 February 2012.&lt;ref name="little-21mar-13" /&gt; The height change is seen by some as having a negligible effect in practice.&lt;ref name="fantato-25mar-13"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10310583.print/ | title=Spot the difference — images of Castle Mill scheme show variation between unacceptable and acceptable heights | first=Damian | last=Fantato | newspaper=Oxford Mail | date=25 March 2013 | accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vice-Chairman of the West Area Planning Committee said "I was told there had been no objections to the original scheme and as the revised scheme was designed to make it even less controversial there was no need to consult."&lt;ref name="oxfordtimes-28mar-13"&gt;{{cite news| title=Pressure mounting over flats: Two councillors on committee that passed scheme question the validity of Castle Mill decision | newspaper=The Oxford Times | page=4 | date=28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, it was reported that Oxford University had removed the topmost apex of the roof in its revised plans, rather than removing a storey.&lt;ref name="oxfordtimes-4apr-13"&gt;{{cite news| title=University removed tip of Port Meadow flats to get approval: Removing roof section was only change to Castle Mill scheme | newspaper=The Oxford Times | first=Damian | last=Fantato | page=14 | date=4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University stated that it would not reduce the height of the buildings voluntarily and had estimated the cost of doing so as £10–20 million.&lt;ref name="oxfordtimes-11apr-13"&gt;{{cite news| title=Bill to lower student flats could be as high as £20m | newspaper=The Oxford Times | first=Damian | last=Fantato |page=10 | date=11 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11apr-13"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/10346511.Is_this_the_solution_to_student_homes_fight_/ | title=Is this the solution to student homes fight? | newspaper=The Oxford Times | first=Damian| last=Fantato | date=11 April 2013 | accessdate=18 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April, masked protesters attended an Oxford City Council meeting, where it was decided that a high-level meeting between the University's [[Andrew D. Hamilton|Vice-Chancellor]] and the Council leader was needed.&lt;ref name="18apr-13"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/10362159.CASTLE_MILL___Masked__opponents_take_protest_into_council_chamber/?ref=mr | title=Mask protest at Castle Mill flats meeting | newspaper=The Oxford Times | date=18 April 2013 | page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18apr-13b"&gt;{{cite news| title=Castle Mill: 'Masked' opponents take protest into council chamber | first=Freddie| last=Whittaker | newspaper=The Oxford Times | date=18 April 2013 | accessdate=18 April 2013|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/10362159.CASTLE_MILL___Masked__opponents_take_protest_into_council_chamber/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The City Council warned the University that compulsory measures could be taken to reduce the impact of Castle Mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Council could force student flats action: City considering 'compulsory remedial steps' over Castle Mill | first=Reg | last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Time | page=5 | date=25 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners set up a fund to oppose the development in the [[High Court]]. The Director of the Oxford Preservation Trust has said, "I don't think we have the guidelines in place which allow for a development like the one near Port Meadow to be properly assessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Protecting visual heritage | first=Damian | last=Fantato | newspaper=The Oxford Time | page=10 | date=25 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During May 2013, it emerged that pollution at Castle Mill had not been checked before work began, as was required in the planning permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=University facing fight over failure to test site | first=Reg |last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Times |pages=1, 3 | date=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] stated that a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] revealed that the University did not provide the necessary information before work started in September 2012. When the University did eventually undertake the assessment, it was deemed adequate by the City Council officers, but a judgement of the matter by the Council itself was postponed. Later in May, a University alumnus said that he had been lobbied by the [[Provost (college)|Provost]] of [[Worcester College]], Professor [[Jonathan Bate]], because the College was objecting to a modest planning proposal by [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=University needs to get its priorities sorted out | first=Richard |last=Lawrence-Wilson | newspaper=The Oxford Times |page=31 | date=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Castle Mill was one of six buildings nominated for the 2013 [[Carbuncle Cup]], an annual award by ''[[Building Design]]'' for "the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months. It is described as "a deeply unimaginative and impoverished design which would lower the spirits whatever its setting, but on the edge of one of central England's most important and ancient landscapes, it is an outrage."

In July 2013, an independent inquiry into the student blocks and how the University was allowed to obscure historic views of Oxford was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student block inquiry: Campaigners welcome independent probe into Castle Mill development | first1=Reg |last1=Little | first2=Damian | last2=Fantato | newspaper=The Oxford Times | pages=1, 3 | date=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of consultation and the relationship between Oxford city planners and Oxford University have been questioned. There have been claims that city councillors were misled about the impact of the scheme.

Two years on, the controversy continued, with several Oxford academics still in public opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbf5834c-4eee-11e4-b205-00144feab7de.html | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | title=A cherished Oxford vista replaced by eight graduate housing units | first1=Jane | last1=Caplan | authorlink1=Jane Caplan | first2=Diarmaid | last2=MacCulloch | authorlink2=Diarmaid MacCulloch | date=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; October 2014 was the second anniversary of the issue, still raising anger from local campaigners, with a retrospective [[environmental impact assessment]] in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Still angry, after all this time | first=Reg |last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Times |page=33 | date=16 October 2014 | url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/11539929.Still_angry_over_Port_Meadow__after_all_this_time/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, almost exactly three years after Oxford City Council approved the scheme, academics and staff who are members of the university's Congregation – effectively its parliament –  debated a binding motion to reduce the height of six of Castle Mill's eight blocks to reduce the development's visual impact. The proposal was defeated by 536 votes to 210. The University's Student Union campaigned against the motion on the grounds that it would have an adverse impact on graduate student housing and finance. A subsequent postal vote, triggered by critics of Castle Mill, rejected the proposal to reduce the height of six blocks by 1,698 to 460. In response to the two votes, Oxford University said it would now pursue its favoured option, screening the student flats with trees and new cladding at an approximate cost of £6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/dons-defeated-in-oxford-carbuncle-battle/5074257.article | newspaper=[[bdonlineuk]] | title=A cherished Oxford vista replaced by eight graduate housing units |first1=David | last1=Rogers | authorlink1=David Rogers (journalist) | date=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ball Henri III.jpg|thumb| ''Ball at the Court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]] '' (detail), [[Franco-Flemish school]], c. 1582.]]

'''Catherine de' Medici's court festivals''' were a series of lavish and spectacular entertainments, sometimes called '''magnificences''', laid on by [[Catherine de' Medici]], the [[queen consort]] of France from 1547 to 1559 and queen mother from 1559 until her death in 1589. As queen consort of [[Henry II of France]], Catherine showed interest in the arts and theatre, but it was not until she attained real political and financial power as queen mother that she began the series of [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and entertainments that dazzled her contemporaries and continue to fascinate scholars. Biographer [[Leonie Frieda]] suggests that "Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned".&lt;ref name =FF&gt;Frieda, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Catherine, these entertainments served a political purpose that made them worth their colossal expense. She presided over the royal government at a time when the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by [[French Wars of Religion|religious civil war]], Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and her husband Henry II.&lt;ref name =St&gt;Strong, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.&lt;ref name="Yates, 51–52"&gt;Yates, 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear, however, that Catherine regarded these festivals as more than political and pragmatic exercises: she revelled in them as a vehicle for her creative gifts. A highly talented and artistic woman, Catherine took the lead in devising and planning her own musical-mythological shows. Though they were [[ephemeral]], her "magnificences"—as the contemporary commentator [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme]], called them—are studied by modern scholars as works of art.&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt; Historian [[Frances Yates]] has called Catherine "a great creative artist in festivals".&lt;ref name = "Yates-p68"&gt;Yates, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; She employed the leading artists and architects of the day to create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, which were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes.

It is difficult for scholars to piece together the exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and [[tapestries]] that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.

==Entertainments==

Catherine de' Medici's investment in magnificent entertainments was part of a conscious political programme.&lt;ref name="Yates, 51–52"/&gt; She recalled the belief of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]], that the court needed to be physically active and constantly entertained.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 235.&lt;br /&gt;• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: "I heard it said to your grandfather the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for the French are accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [ends]". Quoted in Jollet, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; She also declared her intention to imitate the [[Roman emperors]], who kept their subjects from mischief by occupying them with [[Bread and circuses|games and amusements]].&lt;ref name="St"/&gt; She therefore adopted a policy of distracting her nobles from fighting among themselves by laying on irresistible entertainments and sports for them at court.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, ''The Valois Tapestries'', 68. She intended to prevent them from having, in Brantôme's words "loysir á mal faire" (free time in which to make mischief).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fountain chariot from the Ballet Comique de la Reine, 1581.jpg| left| thumb| In the [[Ballet Comique de la Reine]], 1581, a fountain chariot carried Queen Louise and her ladies and musicians. Engraving by [[Jacques Patin]].]]
Catherine also maintained about eighty alluring ladies-in-waiting at court, whom she allegedly used as tools to seduce courtiers for political ends. These women became known as her "flying squadron".&lt;ref name = "Knecht-p235"&gt;Knecht, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine did not hesitate to use the charms of her ladies as an attraction of the court. In 1577, for example, she threw a banquet at which the food was served by topless women.&lt;ref name = "Knecht-p236"&gt;Knecht, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1572, the Huguenot [[Jeanne III of Navarre|Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre]], wrote from the court to warn her son [[Henry IV of France|Henry]] that Catherine presided over a "vicious and corrupt" atmosphere, in which the women made the sexual advances and not the men.&lt;ref&gt;"Although I knew it was bad, I find it even worse than I feared. Here women make advances to men rather than the other way around." Quoted in Knecht, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Charlotte de Sauve]], one of the most notorious members of the "flying squadron", first seduced and then became a mistress of Henry of Navarre on Catherine's orders. On the other hand, [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantôme]], in his ''Memoirs'', praised Catherine’s court as "a school of all honesty and virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 235–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or members of the royal family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy [[jousting|tilting]] of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ''[[ballets de cour]]'', a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51; Strong, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fontainebleau===
[[File:Valois tapestry, entertainments at Fontainebleau.jpg|thumb| One of the [[Valois Tapestries]], depicting entertainments at [[Fontainebleau]] in 1564, including the mock rescue of captive damsels from an enchanted island.]]

In January 1564, Catherine and the young [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] embarked on a [[royal progress]] that was to last nearly two and a half years. They were accompanied by what has been described as a city on the move,&lt;ref name = F&gt;Frieda, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; including the King’s Council and foreign ambassadors who Catherine hoped would report to their governments on the splendour of the train, offsetting any idea that the French monarchy was on the verge of bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; The royal household included Catherine’s courtiers and "flying squadron", as well as her musicians and nine essential dwarves who travelled in their own miniature coaches. The party carried with it all the equipment and [[paraphernalia]] required for the festivals, feasts, [[masques]], and ''[[Royal entry|joyeuses entrées]]'' planned to take place along the route. These included portable [[triumphal arches]] and the royal barges.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

Catherine had ordered that at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], each important noble should host a ball. She herself held a banquet in a meadow at the château's [[dairy]], where her courtiers dressed as shepherds and shepherdesses.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 211. Frieda suggests that this ''[[fête champêtre]]'' was a precursor of the [[Petit Trianon]] parties thrown by [[Marie Antoinette]] two centuries later.&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, the court watched a comedy in the great ballroom, which was followed by a ball where 300 "beauties dressed in gold and silver cloth" performed a choreographed dance.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Fontainebleau, Catherine arranged entertainments that lasted for several days, including fancy-dress [[jousting]] and [[chivalry|chivalrous]] events in [[allegory|allegorical]] settings. On [[Mardi Gras]], the day after the banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and [[Troy|Trojans]] fought over scantily clad [[damsel in distress|damsels]] trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 637.&lt;/ref&gt; In another spectacle, singing [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s swam past the king, and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] floated by in a chariot drawn by [[seahorses]].&lt;ref name = "Knecht-p236"/&gt;

===Bayonne===

As the high point of the royal progress, Catherine scheduled a meeting with her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]], the third wife of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Catherine was so determined to make a magnificent impression on the Spanish court that she indulged in a spending spree that was extravagant even by her own standards. To help pay for the planned pageantry and entertainments, she borrowed 700,000 écus from the [[Gondi bank]]. Catherine had assumed she would also be meeting King Philip himself, but early in the tour, he sent word that he would not be attending. He was outraged that Catherine, whom he called "Madame La Serpente",&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt; had received an embassy from the [[Sultan of Turkey]]. He also objected to her [[Edict of Amboise]] (1563), which had offered concessions to the [[Huguenots]]. In short, French religious policy disgusted him.  In his place he sent "the severe and ferocious" [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], with orders to convince Catherine that persecuting, imprisoning, and torturing Huguenots was the way to deal with [[heretics]], not making treaties with them. In the event, Catherine left Alba befuddled by her darting mind. He found her far more interested in discussing marriage alliances and in showing him what the French court could lay on in the way of fabulous entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 224–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine Caron, Water Festival at Bayonne, drawing.jpg|thumb| left| ''Water Festival at Bayonne'', a tapestry design by [[Antoine Caron]], records entertainments laid on by Catherine de' Medici for the Franco-Spanish summit meeting of 1565.]]
Elisabeth and her Spanish entourage had arrived at the [[Bidasoa]] river on the Spanish border with a huge escort of French Catholic nobles on 14 June 1565.&lt;ref&gt;The French Huguenot nobles were excluded on the wishes of King Philip.&lt;/ref&gt; She then rode into [[Saint-Jean de Luz]], where Catherine greeted her tearfully with embraces and kisses. During the reception ceremonies, ten of Catherine’s soldiers dropped dead from standing too long in the heat in their armour. The next day, Elisabeth made a dazzling entry into [[Bayonne]] on a horse whose harness was studded with gems worth 400,000 ducats.

The encounter between the two courts was marked by ritual exchanges of costly gifts and a sustained display of ballets, jousts, mock battles, and decorative arts. Several accounts of the Bayonne entertainments survive. One spectacle, mounted on the Bidasoa river, is a particularly famous example of Catherine’s entertainments as [[ephemeral]] works of art.&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt; The entertainments began with a banquet on the Île d’Aguineau. As guests were ferried on decorated boats to the island, they passed, among other spectacles, [[Arion]] riding two dolphins, harpoonists spearing an artificial whale that spouted red wine, and six [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]] sitting on a giant turtle, blowing [[conch]] shells.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles IX was transported on a barge dressed to look like a floating fortress. The banquet was followed by a ballet of [[nymphs]] and [[satyrs]]. Brantôme reported that the "magnificence was such in everything that the Spaniards who are very contemptuous of all others save their own swore that they had never seen anything finer".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 237; Strong, 105–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valois tapestry, Water Festival at Bayonne.jpg|thumb| ''Water Festival at Bayonne'', the finished tapestry version of 1580–81]]

The next day, [[Charles IX of France|King Charles]] and his brother [[Henry III of France|Henry]] took part in a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]], leading teams dressed as British and Irish knights. The theme of the tournament, "virtue and love", was represented by two [[chariots]], one containing ladies dressed as the [[Five Virtues|five virtues]], the other carrying [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Cupid]] and many mini-cupids. In the tournament itself, little balls of fire were lobbed among the horses as they crossed. The royal grandstand was hung with gold-and-silk [[tapestry|tapestries]] illustrating the [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] of [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Scipio]], which [[Giulio Romano]] had designed for Francis I. [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantôme]] recalled in his memoirs that "the Spanish lords and ladies greatly admired it, never having seen anything like it in the possession of their king".&lt;ref&gt;Jardine and Brotton, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French spectator recorded, "Strangers of all nations were now forced to recognise that in these things France had surpassed, with these parades, bravado, glories and magnificences, all other nations and even herself".&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt;

Catherine believed she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, far from being financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious force to be reckoned with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court.&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt; The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal wedding===

The celebrations following the marriage of Catherine’s daughter [[Marguerite de Valois|Marguerite]] to the Protestant [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]] in Paris on 18 August 1572, were based on [[Huguenot]] themes. The match was controversial because Marguerite was marrying a Huguenot. The pope refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage, and the different faiths of the bridal couple made for an unusual wedding service.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 153. For example, Henry did not attend the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]], where his place was taken by Marguerite's brother [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]].&lt;/ref&gt; After a nuptial lunch, four days of balls, masques and banquets ensued.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|left| thumb|A painting by [[François Dubois]], depicts Catherine de' Medici (rear left) standing over a heap of corpses during the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. The body of [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] is being thrown from a window.]]

Despite the tension between Catholic and Huguenot forces in the city, the festivities proceeded in a good-natured fashion, though the themes of the entertainments may seem "very near to the bone", in retrospect.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The night after the wedding, a magnificent masked ball was held at the [[Petit-Bourbon]], which included the performance of a ''pantomime tournoi'', called the "paradise of love". King Charles and his two brothers defended twelve angelic [[nymphs]] against the Huguenots. They despatched the Huguenots, led by Henry of Navarre, into a [[hell]] where, according to an observer, "a great number of devils and imps were making infinite follery and noise".&lt;ref name = FFF&gt;Frieda, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The nymphs then danced a ballet. There followed combat between knights, accompanied by explosions of gunpowder. The king and his brothers climaxed proceedings by rescuing the Huguenots from hell, which was separated from paradise by a river on which floated the ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] in his boat.&lt;ref name="FFF"/&gt;

The remaining festivities were called off after an [[assassination]] attempt on the Huguenot leader [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]], who was shot from a house by an [[arquebus]]ier on 22 August and wounded in the elbow and hand. The day before, the king and his brothers had dressed as [[Amazons]] to fight Navarre and his friends, who wore [[turbans]] and golden robes in the role of Turks. Fighting broke out for real between the Catholics and Huguenots in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began on 24 August when Charles IX ordered the slaughter of all the Huguenot leaders in Paris, provoking massacres of Huguenots throughout France. Henry of Navarre was given the choice of death, life imprisonment, or conversion to Catholicism. He chose Catholicism and was spared.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 111–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuileries===

[[File:Valois Tapestry 2.jpg|thumb| [[Valois Tapestries|Valois tapestry]] depicting the ball held by Catherine de' Medici in 1573 at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in honour of Polish envoys visiting to present the throne of Poland to [[Henry III of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]]]]

A year after the massacre, in August 1573, Catherine hosted another lavish set of entertainments, this time for the Polish ambassadors who had arrived to offer the [[List of Polish monarchs|throne of Poland]] to her son, [[Henry III of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]]. Sports were laid on, including tournaments, mock combats, tilting at the [[Hastilude|quintain]], and running at the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, 15, 60. Running at the ring involved galloping towards a ring hanging from an upright, with the aim of carrying the ring off on the lance, which was shorter than a jousting lance.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine held a grand ball or "''festin''" at the Tuileries palace, which [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]] described in his illustrated ''Magnificentissimi spectaculi''. Sixteen nymphs, representing each of the French provinces, danced an intricate ballet, distributing devices to the spectators in the process. [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantôme]] called this performance "the finest ballet that was ever given in this world" and praised Catherine for bringing France so much prestige with "all these inventions".&lt;ref name = "Knecht-p239"&gt;Knecht, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Agrippa d'Aubigné]] recorded that the Poles marvelled at the ballet.&lt;ref name = "Knecht-p239"/&gt; [[Frances Yates]] has pointed out that the Italian influence on the French [[ballets de cour|''ballet de cour'']] owed much to Catherine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was invented in the context of the chivalrous pastimes of the court, by an Italian, and a Medici, the Queen Mother. Many poets, artists, musicians, choreographers, contributed to the result, but it was she who was the inventor, one might perhaps say, the producer; she who had the ladies of her court trained to perform these ballets in settings of her devising.&lt;ref name = "Yates-p68"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Joyeuse magnificences===
[[File:Wedding ball of the Duc de Joyeuse, 1581.JPG|thumb| Wedding ball of the [[Anne de Joyeuse|Duke of Joyeuse]] and [[Marguerite of Lorraine]], 24 September 1581. Attributed to Hermann van der Mast, c. 1581–84.]]
[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|left| The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', from an engraving of 1582 by Jacques Patin]]

A spectacular ''[[fête]]'' was held during the reign of Catherine’s son [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] to celebrate the marriage of his sister-in-law, [[Marguerite of Lorraine]], to his favourite, [[Anne de Joyeuse|Anne, Duke of Joyeuse]], on 24 September 1581. Entertainments were laid on almost every day for two weeks after the wedding, in what art historian [[Roy Strong]] has called "the climax of Valois festival art".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief artist employed to design the magnificences was [[Antoine Caron]], who was aided by the sculptor [[Germain Pilon]]. Among the writers were Dorat, Ronsard, and [[Philippe Desportes]]; and the music was written by [[Claude Le Jeune]] and the Sieur de Beaulieu, among others. A programme for an entertainment with a sun–moon theme announced that "twelve torch bearers will be men and women disguised as trees&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the golden fruits of which will carry lamps and torches".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The visual decorations included two [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], one shining as a sun, to represent the king, the other as a moon, to represent the newlyweds. The arcades were linked to an [[amphitheatre]] overhung with artificial heavens of planets and [[constellations]], and allusions to Catherine’s personal emblem, the rainbow. Into this amphitheatre, the king was to enter in a chariot, dressed as the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 116–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the Joyeuse magnificences was the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', devised and presented by [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont|Queen Louise]], who directed her own team of writers and musicians. The text was by Nicolas de La Chesnaye, the music by the Sieur de Beaulieu, the sets by [[Jacques Patin]], and the overall director was [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the entertainment was an [[invocation]] of cosmic forces to come to the aid of the monarchy, which at that time was threatened by the rebellion not only of Huguenots but of many Catholic nobles. Men were shown as reduced to beasts by [[Circe]], who held court in a garden at one end of the hall. Louise and her ladies danced ballets, and the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] appealed to the gods to descend to earth and defeat the powers of Circe. With a thunderclap, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] descended sitting on an eagle, accompanied by "the most learned and excellent music that had ever been sung or heard". Jupiter transferred Circe’s power to the royal family, protected France from the horrors of civil war, and blessed King Henry with the wisdom to govern. At the end of the show, Catherine de' Medici made Queen Louise give Henry a gold medal depicting a dolphin. The gesture expressed Catherine's desire that the couple would have a male heir (a ''dauphin'') to continue the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 241; Strong, 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corn roaster''' is a large [[Grill (cooking)|grill]] for cooking large batches of ears of [[Maize|corn]] at the same time. The term "corn roaster" can also refer to a person who roasts corn.&lt;ref&gt;Lempert, Phil (2002).

The '''EMD G16''' is a [[diesel locomotive]] built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors]] in the USA and under licence by [[Clyde Engineering]] in Australia and [[MACOSA]] in Spain. It has been used in [[Rail transport in Australia|Australia]], [[Vale (mining company)#Logistics|Brazil]], [[Egyptian National Railways|Egyptian Railways]], [[Kowloon-Canton Railway|Hong Kong]], [[Israel Railways]], [[Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México|Mexico]], [[RENFE|Spain]], [[Yugoslav Railways]] and on the successor [[Hrvatske Željeznice|Croatian Railways]], [[Slovenske železnice|Slovenian Railways]], [[Serbian Railways]], [[Makedonski Železnici|Macedonian Railways]], [[Rail transport in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Railways of Republika Srpska]], [[Kosovo Railways]] and [[Rail transport in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina Federation]].

==Australia==
{{main|Victorian Railways X class (diesel)|l1=Victorian Railways X class}}
The [[Victorian Railways]] bought six G16C locomotives locally built by [[Clyde Engineering]], known as the [[Victorian Railways X class (diesel)|X class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://locopage.railpage.org.au/vline/x.html |title=V/Line: X/XR/XRB Class |publisher=locopage.railpage.org.au |accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now operated by [[Pacific National]].

==Brazil==
In Brazil 41 locomotives were imported. The first eleven were introduced in 1962 and numbered 601–612, and the remaining thirty locomotives were imported in 1964–66. Thirty-seven locomotives still operating trains of the [[Vale (mining company)#Logistics|Vitória a Minas Railroad]].

==Egypt==
EMD supplied [[Egyptian National Railways#History|Egyptian Railways]] with 61 G16s in 1960–61 (ER numbers 3301–16) and 17 G16Ws in 1964–65 (ER numbers 3317–61).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Hugh |isbn=0-9503469-7-7 |year=1981 |title=Middle East Railways |place=Harrow |publisher=Continental Railway Circle|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==

== Israel ==
During the [[Six-Day War]] Israel captured Egyptian Railways 3304, 3329 and 3361 which were appropriated into [[Israel Railways]] stock as numbers 161–163.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotterell |first=Paul |isbn=0-905878-04-3 |year=1984 |title=The Railways of Palestine and Israel |place=Abingdon |publisher=[http://www.tourretpublishing.com Tourret Publishing] |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; All have now been withdrawn from service but 163 (formerly ER 3361) is preserved at the [[Israel Railway Museum]].

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong there are four locomotives imported for the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]]. It would later be used by [[MTR Corporation]] upon the merger. The first three were built by EMD in the USA, introduced in 1961 and numbered 56–58. The fourth was built by Clyde Engineering in Australia, introduced in 1966 and numbered 59. All were equipped with 16-567C engines and Co-Co wheel arrangements. 59 suffered a collision and was rebuilt with a 16-645E engine. The No.57 retired in 2009 and others still in use as of 2012.

==Mexico==
In order to replace steam on the numerous light rail branches operated by the Nacionales de Mexico (NdeM), EMD export models G12 and G16 were obtained. A total of 24 G16 units were built by EMD for the NdeM, all equipped with dynamic brakes and introduced between 08/1958 and 07/1960, their running numbers being 7300 to 7323. The first 13 units (Nr. 7300 to 7312) had close clearance cabs, the last 11 units (Nr. 7313 to 7323) were delivered in 1960 and received a standard cab. Nr.7323 was pictured in 1963 with a standard cab, but appeared in 1974 with a close clearance cab, indicating that this unit was either rebuilt or more probably renumbered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=NdeM in color| first=Matthews J.| last=Herson| isbn=1-58248-046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

==Spain==
{{Main|RENFE Class 1900}}
The RENFE Class 1900, later known as RENFE Class 319 were to the G16 design; 10 of the units were built at General Motors factory in USA and were single cabin machines, identical to a standard G16 with the exception of having [[Iberian gauge]] {{track gauge|1668mm}} wheelsets. A further 93 locomotives were built under license using the same components but as twin-cab machines with a different external appearance and internal arrangement of components.

==Yugoslav Railways==
The EMD G16 ('''JŽ series 661''') was one of the most used diesel locomotives in Yugoslavia. The type is colloquially nicknamed ''"Kenedi"'' after the US President [[John F. Kennedy]]. After the breakup in 1991, the locomotives were passed on to successor states:

===Croatia===
In Croatia the locomotive is classified '''HŽ series 2061'''. As of 2007, the series has been withdrawn from service. Six modified units of the series 2061 is the series [[HŽ series 2043|2043]].

===Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia===
In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia have all kept the JŽ-era designation series 661.

Today there are around 15 operational series 661 with Serbian Railways. Those locomotives are used mostly on non-electrified railways, primarily to haul freight trains, but also the passenger trains.

===Kosovo===
[[Kosovo Railways]] operates three former JŽ series 661. A fourth locomotive (001) was renumbered but is out of service. They no longer carry a type designation, instead they were just numbered 001 to 004. They are used to haul coal and clay trains.

Locomotives 661-203 began a rebuilding program in 2008, undertaken by [[TŽV Gredelj]] (Croatia) in association with [[Electro-Motive Diesel]]; the bogies and traction motors were retained, but with a new frame and engine ([[EMD 710|EMD 8-710G3A]]). The locomotives were also converted to twin cab designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tzv-gredelj.biz.hr/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=131&amp;Itemid=1|title=Contract with Kosovo Railways|date=17 November 2008|work=tzv-gredelj.biz.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting new loco has EMD model code JT38CW-DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bacic|first1=Toma|date=September 2010|title=Major rebuild for Kosovo diesel|journal=Today's Railways Europe|issue=177|page=12|publisher=Platform 5 publishing Ltd.|issn=1354-2753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eta Aquariids''' are a [[meteor shower]] associated with [[Halley%27s Comet]].

The shower is visible from about April 19 to about May 28 each year with peak activity on or around May 5. Unlike most major annual meteor showers, there is no sharp peak for this shower, but rather a broad maximum with good rates that last approximately one week centered on May 5. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley’s Comet hundreds of years ago. The current orbit of Halley’s Comet does not pass close enough to the Earth to be a source of meteoric activity.&lt;ref name="AMS2013"/&gt;

Although this shower is not as spectacular as the [[Leonids]] may be and well below the rates of the [[Perseids]] or the [[Geminids]], it is not an ordinary event. The Eta Aquariids get their name because their [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] appears to lie in the [[constellation]] [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], near one of the constellation's brightest stars, [[Eta Aquarii]]. The shower peaks at about a rate of around a meteor per minute, although such rates are rarely seen from northern latitudes due to the low altitude of the radiant.

The Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the pre-dawn hours away from the glow of city lights. For northern observers, the radiant of the shower is only above the horizon for the few hours before dawn, and early-rising observers are often rewarded with rates that climb as the radiant rises before sunrise. The shower is best viewed from the [[equator]] to 30 degrees south latitude.&lt;ref name="AMS2013"/&gt;

The activity is fairly constant from one return to the next. However, in 2013, the maximum ZHR exceeded the average level significantly for about two days. An explanation was presented by Mikiya Sato
(Sato &amp; Watanabe, 2013) &lt;ref name="Sato"/&gt;, showing that the meteoroids are from very old ejection from the parent 1P/Halley and are trapped probably in resonances to Jupiter’s orbit (similar to the Orionids observed between 2007 and 2010). The peak ZHR reached 135 ± 16 &lt;ref name="Rendtel"/&gt;. Updated information on the expected time and rates of the shower is provided through the annual IMO Meteor Shower Calendar &lt;ref name="Calendar"/&gt;.

The '''FFSA GT Championship''' (''Championnat de France FFSA GT'') is a [[France|French]] [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring]]-style [[sports car racing]] series that began in 1997. It is the main event of the ''Championnat de France des Circuits'' (formerly called ''Super Série FFSA'' and ''GT Tour'').

It is controlled by the [[Fédération Française du Sport Automobile]] (FFSA) and organized by racing company [[Oreca]]. Since the demise of the [[French Supertouring Championship]] after the 2005 season, the French GT has become France's major circuit racing championship.

==History==
Founded by Patrick Peter in 1997 as an offshoot of the international [[BPR Global GT Series]], this national version featured a wide variety of Grand Touring-style cars in multiple classes competing at the same time on mostly French courses.  In 1998 saw the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO Group]] took over the series as the classes were reorganized to reflect the changes made in the new [[FIA GT Championship]], continuing in a similar formula today.  In 2011, the series was handed over from SRO to [[Oreca]], a French racing team, constructor, and organiser of the Sportscar Winter Series and the former [[Le Mans Prototype Challenge|Formula Le Mans Cup]].

The main class has used GTS car regulations from 1997 to 2004, GT1 from 2005 to 2009, and [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3]] from 2010 to 2016. The championship featured classes for both professionals and amateurs. GT3 rules included extensive performance balancing and handicap weights to make cars artificially more equal.

In 2016, grids depleted and Oreca cancelled the championship was cancelled. For the [[2017 GT4 European Series Southern Cup|2017 season]], the SRO Group became again the promoter and the GT4 regulations were adopted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Sellers, F. S. (2005), ‘Gift-wrapped guilt?’, Washington Post, 18 December.;
&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

The [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortress of [[Krak des Chevaliers]] fell to the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] in 1271. 
Baibars went north to deal with Krak des Chevaliers after the death of [[Louis IX of France]] on 29 November 1270.

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}

== Siege and surrender ==

Before marching on the castle Baibars captured the smaller castles in the area, including [[Chastel Blanc]]. On 3&amp;nbsp;March 1271, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the Sultan arrived the castle may already have been blockaded by [[Mamluk]] forces for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three Arabic accounts of the siege; only one, that of [[Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad|Ibn Shaddad]], was by a contemporary although he was not present. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he began erecting [[mangonel]]s, powerful siege weapons which he would turn on the castle. According to Ibn Shaddad, two days later the first line of defences was captured by the besiegers; he was probably referring to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance.&lt;ref name=King88-92&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|pp=88–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain interrupted the siege, but on 21&amp;nbsp;March a triangular [[outwork]] immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, possibly defended by a timber [[palisade]], was captured. On 29&amp;nbsp;March, the tower in the south-west corner was [[Mining (military)|undermined]] and collapsed. Baibars' army attacked through the breach and on entering the outer ward where they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle.

Though the outer ward had fallen, and in the process a handful of the garrison killed, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli which granted permission for them to surrender. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives.&lt;ref name=King88-92/&gt; The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a [[mosque]] and two [[mihrab]]s were added to the interior.&lt;ref name=FFC179&gt;{{harvnb|Folda|French|Coupel|1982|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fyre Festival''' was a [[music festival]] scheduled to take place on the [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] island of [[Great Exuma]] over two weekends in April and May 2017.

Organized by Fyre Media founder [[Billy McFarland (entrepreneur)|Billy McFarland]] and rapper [[Ja Rule]] as a luxury music festival to promote the Fyre music booking app,&lt;ref name=VICE/&gt; the event was promoted on Instagram by "social media influencers" including socialite and model [[Kendall Jenner]], model [[Bella Hadid]], model and actress [[Emily Ratajkowski]], and other media personalities, many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so, in violation of federal law.&lt;ref name=VICE/&gt; During the Fyre Festival's inaugural weekend, the event experienced problems related to security, food, accommodations and artist relations. Eventually, the festival was indefinitely postponed after some attendees had arrived, finding tents and prepackaged sandwiches, instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals they had been promised when they paid thousands of dollars for admission.&lt;ref name=nyt20170428/&gt;

As a result, the organizers are the subject of eight lawsuits, one seeking more than $100 million in damages. The cases accuse the organizers of defrauding ticket buyers. On June 30, 2017, the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] charged McFarland with one count of [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-individual-defrauding-investors-digital|title=Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Charges Against Individual For Defrauding Investors In Digital Media Company|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, he pled guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and a second count to defraud a ticket vendor. On October 11, 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit US$26 million, for wire fraud.

==History==
The festival was organized by [[Billy McFarland (entrepreneur)|Billy McFarland]] and Jeffrey Atkins, a rapper who goes by the stage name [[Ja Rule]]&lt;ref name="nyt20170428" /&gt; to promote the Fyre music booking app.&lt;ref name=VICE/&gt; During a flight with McFarland, whom Atkins had come to know through regular visits to events McFarland hosted at his previous venture, Magnises, Atkins's private plane stopped on [[Great Exuma]] island in the [[Bahamas]] to refuel, and the two conceived the idea of the festival after taking the island in. After several small islands that seemed like likely venues were turned down, the Bahamian government gave McFarland a permit to use a site set aside for development at Roker Point.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burrough|first=Bryan|authorlink=Bryan Burrough|title=Fyre Festival: Anatomy of a Millennial Marketing Fiasco Waiting To Happen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-millennial-marketing-fiasco|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 2017|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2016, [[Kendall Jenner]], [[Emily Ratajkowski]] and other influencers whom Fyre had paid to do so simultaneously posted to their [[Instagram]] feeds an image of an orange square with a stylized logo of flames. When viewers clicked on it they opened a promotional video showing [[Bella Hadid]] and other models represented by her agency running around a tropical beach. Text with the video promised "an immersive music festival ... two transformative weekends ... on the boundaries of the impossible". This was the beginning of the Fyre Festival's promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

"It's one of the greatest social-media campaigns I've ever seen," a financial manager for a popular rapper commented later. "They got the most beautiful women in the world, with the largest social following." However, when he called McFarland later to find out more, and found out that his partner was Ja Rule, he declined McFarland's invitation to invest, believing that the promises of the festival could only be fulfilled if a star as prominent as [[Jay-Z]] or [[Kanye West]] was involved. "I was surprised at all the artists who committed," he recalled later, because "we didn't take this seriously at all."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

One of those who did invest, fashion executive Carola Jain, reportedly arranged for Fyre to receive a $4 million loan. The company used most of it to rent luxurious offices in Manhattan's [[TriBeCa]] neighborhood. With no experience staging an event of the proposed festival's scale, McFarland began reaching out to companies that did. However, he was reportedly taken aback when they told him the event would cost at least $5 million, perhaps even $12 million to stage in the time available as he had promised; he and his associates at Fyre believed it would cost far less and continued with their plans under that assumption, which one executive at a company he contacted calls "a complete detachment from reality". They tried to do things themselves where possible; McFarland supposedly learned how to rent the stage by doing a [[Google]] search.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

Scheduled for two weekends in April and May 2017, the event sold day tickets for $1,500, and VIP packages including airfare and luxury tent accommodations for {{usd|12,000}}. Customers were promised accommodations in "modern, eco-friendly, [[geodesic dome]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/28/526019457/paradise-lost-luxury-music-festival-turns-out-to-be-half-built-scene-of-chaos |title=Paradise Lost: Luxury Music Festival Turns Out To Be Half-Built Scene Of Chaos|newspaper= [[NPR]]|date= April 28, 2017|first=Laurel |last=Wamsley|accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meals from celebrity chefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://people.com/food/fyre-festival-food-ja-rule-bahamas-fest/ | title = ‘Literally Bread, Cheese, and Salad’: How Fyre Festival-Goers Were Duped After Promise of Celeb Chef Meals | publisher = [[People.com]] | date = April 28, 2017 | first =  Shay | last = Spence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the festival's promotional material, "Fyre Cay", the festival site, a remote private island it falsely claimed once belonged to drug trafficker [[Pablo Escobar]], did not exist. Instead, workers in the Bahamas were busy preparing Roker Point for the festival, scattering sand over its rocks and improving a road to a nearby beach, where they built some [[cabana (structure)|cabana]]s and installed [[swing set]]s. On the mainland, five thousand tickets had been sold and an air service hired to charter festivalgoers from Miami. A medical-services company and caterer were hired, although the latter withdrew a few weeks before the festival.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

In March 2017, Fyre also hired a veteran event producer, Yaron Lavi, who saw that it was possible to hold the sort of event McFarland and Atkins envisioned, at the site. He assumed, however, that they would reschedule the event to November as they had been discussing since they were not ready. But after they told him they would stage the event in the spring anyway, he said they would have to abandon the plans for temporary villas and instead erect tents, the only accommodations that could be delivered in the time remaining. Lavi advised Fyre to make this clear to those who had already bought tickets as otherwise it would be damaging to their brand; he says the company assured him that an email was being prepared, but he is not sure if it was sent.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

[[Comcast Ventures]] considered investing $25 million in the app, which McFarland apparently hoped would allow him to finance the festival, but declined days beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/comcast-rejected-funding-days-before-fyre-festival|title=Comcast Rejected Funding Days Before Doomed Fyre Festival|first=Polly|last=Mosendz|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly McFarland had valued Fyre Media at $90 million, and was unable to provide sufficient proof of that when Comcast requested it.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, one of the event organizers would later note that since at least mid-March, there were significant problems with the planning, and at one point it was agreed to outright cancel the 2017 festival in favor of working to perfect a 2018 one. These plans however were revoked at the last minute with the decision to go on with the event as planned. "Let's just do it and be legends, man", one of the organizers is reported to have said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Chloe|title=I Worked at Fyre Festival. It Was Always Going to Be a Disaster.|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/fyre-festival-exumas-bahamas-disaster.html|website=NYMag|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, ''[[Page Six]]'' began reporting rumors that the festival organizers were too disorganized and "in over their heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pagesix.com/2017/04/17/are-fyre-festival-organizers-in-over-their-heads/|title=Are Fyre Festival organizers in over their heads?|date=April 17, 2017|author=Mara Siegler|newspaper=[[Page Six]]|accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business journalist [[Bryan Burrough]] later reported in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that after the Comcast deal fell through, McFarland had obtained some temporary financing for Fyre through investor Ezra Birnbaum that required the company repay at least half a million dollars of the loan within 16 days. The only place where the company could get that kind of money within that time was from the festival receipts. Burrough speculates that this may have been McFarland's primary motivation for proceeding with the festival despite the many difficulties.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;

Around this same time, Fyre informed ticketholders that the event would be "cashless (and cardless)," and encouraged attendees to put up to $1,500 in advance on a digital Fyre Band to cover incidentals, according to one lawsuit. McFarland, who signed the email, suggested that they upload $300–500 for every day they planned to attend. According to a lawsuit later filed by Birnbaum, 40% of this money was to be used to pay off the short-term loan.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/arts/music/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-ja-rule-criminal-investigation.html | title = Criminal investigation of Frye | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | first = Joe | last = Coscarelli | first2 = Melena | last2 = Ryzik | first3 = Ben | last3 = Sisario | date = May 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the venue ===

On April 27, attendees began arriving on chartered flights from [[Miami International Airport]] to [[Exuma International Airport]] operated by [[Swift Air]] and [[Xtra Airways]]. Initial arrivals were brought to an "impromptu beach party" rather than the festival grounds while later arrivals were brought directly to the grounds where the true state of the festival's site became apparent.

Around nightfall, one musical act, a group of local musicians, took to the stage and played for a few hours. They were the only act to perform. In the early morning, it was announced that the festival would be postponed and that the attendees would be returned to Miami as soon as possible. Reports from the festival emerged of mishandling of guests' baggage, scattered disaster relief tents with dirt floors, mattresses that were soaking wet, no place to sleep as there were no housing assignments, an unfinished gravel lot, lack of staff, no cell phone or internet service, [[portable toilet]]s,&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.eonline.com/news/846871/no-food-no-water-no-luxury-tents-the-12-000-per-ticket-disaster-that-was-the-short-lived-fyre-festival | title = No Food, No Water, No Luxury Tents: The $12,000-Per-Ticket Disaster That Was the Short-Lived Fyre Festival | publisher = [[eonline.com]] | first = Seija | last = Rankin | date = April 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; no water, inadequate and poor quality food including cheese sandwiches&lt;ref name="wapo20170428"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/04/28/the-complete-and-utter-disaster-that-was-fyre-festival-played-out-on-social-media-for-all-to-see/ | title = The complete disaster of Fyre Festival played out on social media for all to see; ‘NOT MY FAULT’ says organizer Ja Rule | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | first =  Abby | last = Ohlheiser | date = April 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; made with slices of [[processed cheese]] on wheat bread with a salad served in [[foam food container|foam containers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/2017/04/fyre-festival-fiasco-seen-coming/ | title = The Fyre Festival: The Fiasco We All Should Have Seen Coming | newspaper = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | first = Issie | last = Lapowsky | date = April 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theft, lack of medical personnel, and heavy-handed security. Many attendees were reportedly stranded as flights to and from the island were cancelled following a government order that was not allowing any more planes to land.&lt;ref name="iqm201704"&gt;{{cite news |title='Like a refugee camp': Chaos at Fyre Festival |url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/04/like-refugee-camp-chaos-fyre-festival/#.WQM4ilMrLJ8 |accessdate=28 April 2017 |work=IQ Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20170428"&gt;{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Coscarelli | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/fyre-festival-ja-rule-bahamas.html | title = Fyre Festival, a Luxury Music Weekend, Crumbles in the Bahamas | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = April 28, 2017 | first2 = Melena | last2 = Ryzik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight back to Miami boarded at 1:30{{nbsp}}AM April 28 but was delayed for hours due to issues with the flight's manifest. It was cancelled after sunrise and passengers were locked in the Exuma Airport terminal without access to food or water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/fyre-festiva-photos-videos-twitter-attendees-locked-in-airport-with-no-food-or-water-a7707541.html|title=Fyre Festival: Attendees 'locked in airport with no food or water'|date=28 April 2017|first=Christopher |last=Hooton|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no air conditioning; one passenger recalls that at least one person passed out from the heat.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair article" /&gt; The flight eventually left Exuma that morning. More charter flights to Miami departed Exuma throughout the day.

===Organizers===
With $3.1 million in venture capital to date and 25 employees, [[Billy McFarland (entrepreneur)|Billy McFarland]] also founded a card company called "Magnises", which promised members paying an annual $250 fee that they could "unlock their cities and take their lives to the next level," including "private members-only concerts, tastings with notable chefs, and exclusive art previews at top galleries." The ''Washington Post'' reported that "some of those benefits never materialized or were far from what was advertised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/04/29/the-founder-of-the-disastrous-fyre-festival-has-a-history-of-overpromising-elite-access | title = The founder of the disastrous Fyre Festival has a history of overpromising ‘elite’ access | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | first = Amy B. | last = Wang | date = April 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "They send the same email for every problem, but it's like fill-in-the-blanks for what the problem is," a member reported to ''[[Business Insider]]''.&lt;ref name=BI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/magnises-complaints-from-members-2017-1|title=Members of a private club for 'elite' millennials want their money back|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|first=Madeline | last = Stone|date=January 24, 2017|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnises reportedly became profitable in 2015.&lt;ref name=BI/&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that McFarland "has a history of overpromising" in his previous business ventures, and cited multiple examples. For example, after McFarland sold tickets to the musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' for $430, the tickets were cancelled at the last minute. In a complaint to the [[Better Business Bureau]], one customer seeking a refund reported getting no response to multiple queries over a month and a half.&lt;ref name=WPPost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/04/29/the-founder-of-the-disastrous-fyre-festival-has-a-history-of-overpromising-elite-access/|title=The founder of the disastrous Fyre Festival has a history of overpromising ‘elite’ access|publisher= [[Washington Post]]|date= April 29, 2017|author=Amy B.

===Celebrity promoters===
The event was promoted on Instagram by [[Kardashian]] family socialite [[Kendall Jenner]] (who was paid $250,000 and has since deleted the post), [[Bella Hadid]], [[Emily Ratajkowski]], [[Hailey Baldwin]], [[Elsa Hosk]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Lais Ribeiro]], [[Alessandra Ambrosio]], [[Shanina Shaik]], [[Nadine Leopold]], [[Rose Bertram]], [[Gizele Oliveira]], [[Hannah Ferguson]], and other niche-actresses and media personalities.&lt;ref name=VICE/&gt; Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the [[hashtag]] #ad,&lt;ref name=Vice-2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/story/rich-millennials-paid-thousands-for-ja-rules-fyre-fest-and-are-now-stranded-on-an-island-in-disaster-relief-tents|title= A complete "s--t show" | quote = Rich millennials paid thousands for Ja Rule's Fyre Fest and are now stranded on an island in disaster-relief tents|work= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date= April 28, 2017|author=Megan Cerullo|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also since deleted the post.&lt;ref name=Verge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15471112/fyre-fest-instagram-hailey-baldwin-bella-hadid-sponsored-posts|title=Ja Rule's music festival disaster is a good reminder not to trust Instagram sponcon|publisher= [[The Verge]]|date= April 28, 2017|first=Lizzie |last=Plaugic|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only later was it reported that Jenner and the others had been paid to make the posts, something they were required under federal law to disclose. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] said #ad only worked if at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer.&lt;ref name=Verge/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-05/ftc-to-crack-down-on-paid-celebrity-posts-that-aren-t-clear-ads|title=FTC to Crack Down on Paid Celebrity Posts That Aren’t Clear Ads|publisher= [[Businessweek]]|date= August 5, 2016|first=Sarah |last=Frier|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Ja Rule posted a note on [[Twitter]] that said "it was NOT A SCAM" and "this is NOT MY FAULT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/entertainment/fyre-festival-disaster-trnd/ | title = Fyre Festival: When a $12,000 luxury festival in paradise turns into chaos | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = April 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fyre Festival posted a statement on their website:
{{block quote|Fyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the Islands of the Exumas. Due to circumstances out of our control, the physical infrastructure was not in place on time and we are unable to fulfill on that vision safely and enjoyably for our guests. At this time, we are working tirelessly to get flights scheduled and get everyone off of Great Exuma and home safely as quickly as we can. We ask that guests currently on-island do not make their own arrangements to get to the airport as we are coordinating those plans. We are working to place everyone on complimentary charters back to Miami today; this process has commenced and the safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority. The festival is being postponed until we can further assess if and when we are able to create the high-quality experience we envisioned. We ask for everyone's patience and cooperation during this difficult time as we work as quickly and safely as we can to remedy this unforeseeable situation.

===Lawsuits ===
As a result of the festival, McFarland and Ja Rule are the subject of a $100 million lawsuit in the state of California. It was filed on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung by entertainment lawyer [[Mark Geragos]], who is seeking class action status for the lawsuit with over 150 plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73199-fyre-festival-hit-with-100-million-lawsuit/|title=Fyre Festival Hit With $100 Million Lawsuit|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|first1=Sheldon|last1=Pearce|first2=Jazz|last2=Monroe|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the filing, Jung's lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract (part of this was the decision from organizers to go cashless so no one had money for taxis), breach of covenant of good faith (part of this was due to the "cheese sandwich" meme and the airport incident) and negligent misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/fyre-festival-mark-geragos-lawsuit-1202404487/|title=Mark Geragos Files $100 Million Suit Against Fyre Festival|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Paula |last=Parisi|date=1 May 2017|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Meiselas of Geragos's firm pledged to hold "all those who recklessly and blindly promoted the festival" accountable, which was interpreted as being directed at Jenner, Hadid, and other social media "influencers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyers seeking big wins over Fyre Festival woes|url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/05/lawyers-only-winners-fyre-festival-fallout|first=Jon |last=Chapple|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=IQ Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Geragos lawyer stated Fyre Festival sent cease and desist letters to whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=meiselasb |number=859471951437324288 |date=2 May 2017 |title= On April 28, 2017 as #Fyre attendees tried to warn others, #Fyre lawyers were sending cease and desist letters to whistleblowers! #fyrefraud|first=Ben |last=Meiselas|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters identified as "[[Jane Doe|Does]] 1-100" was filed in Los Angeles by personal injury lawyer, John Girardi on behalf of 3 attendees.&lt;ref name=polly&gt;{{cite tweet |user=polly |number= 859600981146968064|date= 2 May 2017|title= Interesting: The second Fyre Festival lawsuit zings influencers who were paid to hype the event but didn't disclose it, per FTC standards.|first=Polly |last=Mosendz|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fyre-festival-sparks-class-action-lawsuit-999793|title=Fyre Festival Debacle Sparks Another Class Action Lawsuit|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Ashley|last=Cullins|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bloomberg reporter filed a FOIA to the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] regarding their Instagram knowledge, after the second class action lawsuit zinged the event promoters.&lt;ref name=polly/&gt;

A third lawsuit was filed in New York federal court against Ja Rule, McFarland, Fyre Media, and chief marketing officer Grant Margolin. Plaintiffs Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello accused the festival organizers of "false representations, material omissions... negligence, fraud, and violations of consumer protection statutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73234-fyre-festival-hit-with-third-lawsuit/|title=Fyre Festival Hit With Third Lawsuit|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|first=Marc|last=Hogan|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Upon the arrival of guests to the island of Great Exuma for the first weekend, the island was lacking basic amenities, was covered in dirt, and guests had to sleep in tents with wet blankets," the suit claims. "There were no communal showers or bathrooms as promised; instead there were porta potties (only about one for every 200 yards) that were knocked down and only three showers although there were hundreds of people arriving."

In May, two more lawsuits were filed against Fyre; bringing the total to five. On May 4; National Event Services, which provided medical services for the festival, filed a lawsuit, claiming to have suffered $250,000 in damages and alleging breach of contract, fraud, and negligence on the organizers' behalves. Fyre "failed and/or refused" to buy cancellation insurance and "failed to secure a contract with a medical evacuation helicopter or plane." NES employees reported that the medical clinic was closed and the accommodations were "uninhabitable", with "bug infestation, bloodstained mattresses, and no air conditioning." In New Jersey federal court, festival attendee Andrew Petrozziello filed a lawsuit alleging that the organizers' violated state consumer fraud act and committed breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fyre-festival-organizers-hit-with-two-more-lawsuits-w480992|title=Fyre Festival Organizers Hit With Two More Lawsuits|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|date=May 5, 2017|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sixth lawsuit, filed in Florida federal court as a class action suit, alleges violations that include fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. The plaintiffs Kenneth and Emily Reel accused the organizers of sending [[cease and desist]] letters to people who criticized the festival on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73332-fyre-threatened-to-sue-twitter-critics-for-potentially-inciting-riots-sixth-lawsuit-claims/|title=Fyre Threatened to Sue Twitter Critics for Potentially Inciting Riots, Sixth Lawsuit Claims|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|first=Marc|last=Hogan|date=May 8, 2017|accessdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seventh lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court as a class action suit on behalf of Sean Daly and Edward Ivey. In addition to the infractions mentioned in the other lawsuits, this suit alleges unjust enrichment and violation of New York state business law, claiming that the organizers continued to offer VIP upgrades and opportunities to deposit money into the "Fyre Band" payment system after the festival had been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73422-fyre-sold-vip-passes-after-festival-was-cancelled-seventh-lawsuit-claims/|title=Fyre Sold VIP Passes After Festival Was Canceled, Seventh Lawsuit Claims|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|first=Marc|last=Hogan|date=May 10, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eighth lawsuit was filed in Suffolk County Superior Court on behalf of ticketing vendor Tablelist. The company is alleging that the festival organizers and financial backers committed breach of contract and fraudulently deceived Tablelist and ticket purchasers. Tablelist is seeking $3.5 million to refund customers, as well as damages resulting from loss of business after being forced to lay off 40% of their workforce to focus on the litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ticket-vendor-tablelist-sues-fyre-fest-for-35-million-w482615|title=Ticket Vendor Tablelist Sues Fyre Festival Organizers for $3.5 Million|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Jon|last=Blistein|date=May 16, 2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2018, two North Carolina attendees were granted $5 million in damages. One of them, a blogger whose live-tweeting of the festival got much media coverage, has declared he has purchased the Fyre Festival trademark following its abandonment by the original organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/two-fyre-festival-attendees-awarded-5-million-in-damages-1202864929/|title=Two Fyre Festival Attendees Awarded $5 Million in Damages|author=Aswad, Jem|work=Variety|date=July 3, 2018|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal investigation===

On May 21, 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported McFarland and his associates are under an active federal criminal investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud, wire fraud]], and [[securities fraud]]. The case is being overseen by the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/arts/music/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-ja-rule-criminal-investigation.html|title=In Wreckage of the Fyre Festival, Fury, Lawsuits and an Inquiry|last1=Ryzik|first1=Melena|first2=Joe|last2=Coscarelli|last3=Sisario|first3=Ben|date=May 21, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 22, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2017, McFarland was arrested and charged with one count of [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On March 6, 2018, McFarland pled guilty to one count wire fraud in what the U.S. Justice Department called a scheme to defraud investors, as well as a second count of wire fraud related to a scheme to defraud a ticket vendor. McFarland was ordered to repay $26 million to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/william-mcfarland-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-defrauding-investors-and-ticket|title=William McFarland Pleads Guilty In Manhattan Federal Court To Defrauding Investors And A Ticket Vendor Of Over $26 Million|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}

On July 24, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that McFarland, two companies he founded, a former senior executive, and a former contractor agreed to settle charges arising out of an extensive, multi-year offering fraud that raised at least $27.4 million from over 100 investors. McFarland admitted to the SEC's allegations against him, agreed to a permanent officer-and-director bar, and agreed to disgorgement of $27.4 million. Grant H. Margolin, Daniel Simon, Fyre Media, and Magnises, Inc. agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the charges. Margolin has agreed to a 7-year director-and-officer bar and must pay a $35,000 penalty, and Simon has agreed to a 3-year director-and-officer bar and must pay over $15,000 in disgorgement and penalty. The settlements are subject to court approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-141|title=SEC.gov {{!}} SEC Charges Failed Fyre Festival Founder and Others With $27.4 Million Offering Fraud|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">[[Image:Times rogue compositor.png|right|400px|thumb|Part of column 4, page 7 of ''The Times'' for 23 January 1882: First edition (left), replacement edition (right).]]
The '''Harcourt interpolation''' was a scandal of Victorian [[London]] in which a rogue compositor inserted an obscene remark into a page proof for ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, in the middle of a speech by a leading politician of the day. The addition was not noticed until after the first edition had been printed and efforts to recall the copies were not entirely successful.

==Article==

In January 1882, as Parliament was not sitting, ''The Times'' included lengthy verbatim reports from speeches given by politicians outside Parliament. On Sunday 22 January, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Henry James]] and [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] went to [[Burton upon Trent]] to open the St Paul's Institute, afterwards addressing speeches towards a crowd of between 7,000 and 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;"The Home Secretary and the Attorney-General at Burton", ''The Times'', 23 January 1882, Second edition, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Harcourt made reference to a by-election campaign then being fought in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Riding of Yorkshire]] (polling day was Thursday 26 January), in which the Liberal candidate, Samuel Rowlandson, was a tenant farmer. ''The Times'' decided to print a verbatim report of both speeches in the edition to be published on the next morning, Monday 23 January 1882.

''The Times''' compositors were in dispute with the newspaper management&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Peter Brown, "Who will the journalists blame now?", ''The Times'', 29 September 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and the report of Harcourt's speech printed in the first edition read (the '/' represent end-of-line in the original):

{{quote|''I saw in a Tory journal the other day a note of alarm, in / which they said “Why, if a tenant-farmer is elected / for the North Riding of Yorkshire the farmers will / be a political power who will have to be reckoned with”. / '''The speaker then said he felt inclined for a bit of fucking.''' / I think that is very likely. (Laughter). But I think / it is rather an extraordinary thing that the Tory party / have not found that out before.''|''The Times'', 23 January 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = | newspaper = [[The Times]] | pages = 7, col. 4 | year = | date = 23 January 1882 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The interpolation was not noticed until after the first edition had been printed and distributed. ''The Times'' sent out urgent telegraph messages to recall all unsold copies.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Bob Clarke, "From Grub Street to Fleet Street: an illustrated history of English Newspapers to 1899", Ashgate Publishing, 2004, p. 240-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal==
According to the collector of erotic literature [[Henry Spencer Ashbee]], when spotted the line was replaced by stars in subsequent editions.&lt;ref&gt;'Pisanus Fraxi', "Catena librorum tacendorum, being Notes Bio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books", London, 1885, p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William Harcourt's son [[Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt|Lewis]] noted in his diary that the "disgraceful interpolation of an obscene line" had been "discovered before the second edition was published and so it only appears in the first".&lt;ref&gt;"Loulou: selected extracts from the journals of Lewis Harcourt (1880–1895)", edited by Patrick Jackson, Farleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Talk about the misprint became widespread and many curious people sought to see it; this demand combined with the restricted supply (due to ''The Times'' efforts to recall all copies containing it) to raise the market price of editions containing it. A newspaper with a cover price of 3[[Penny|d.]] was changing hands for 12[[Shilling|s.]] 6[[Penny|d.]] by the middle of the morning.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt; Sir [[Edward Walter Hamilton]] noted in his diary on 26 January that copies were selling "at all sorts of fancy prices" and reported that [[George Glyn, 2nd Baron Wolverton|Lord Wolverton]] had told him they were fetching 20[[Shilling|s.]] at Brighton on 25 January.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;"The Diary of Sir Edward Walter Hamilton 1880–1885", Oxford University Press, 1972, vol I, p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' reported that £5 was being offered for copies.&lt;ref&gt;"London Correspondence", ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'', 24 January 1882, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apology==
A revised copy was printed for subscribers and for libraries which kept bound copies, but ''The Times'' wrote nothing more about the incident immediately. Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted on 26 January that Sir William Harcourt had not received an apology, and wrote that "Harcourt will never hear the end of it" (although Hamilton regarded the story primarily as amusing).&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt; However an apology appeared in the issue for Friday 27 January 1882:

{{quote|''No pains have been spared by the management of this journal to discover the author of a gross outrage committed by the interpolation of a line in the speech of Sir William Harcourt … and it is hoped that the perpetrator of this outrage will be brought to punishment.''|''The Times'', 27 January 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = No pains have been spared... | newspaper = [[The Times]] | pages = 9, col. 6 | year = | date = 27 January 1882 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted that the effect of this paragraph was to draw "more attention than ever to the compositor's obscene line".&lt;ref&gt;"The Diary of Sir Edward Walter Hamilton 1880–1885", Oxford University Press, 1972, vol I, p 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was reported by the Portuguese writer, journalist and diplomat [[Eça de Queiroz]] in an article which now forms part of his book ''[[Cartas de Inglaterra]]''. Samuel Palmer, in compiling a quarterly index to ''The Times'', included a reference:&lt;ref&gt;"Palmer's Index to The Times", Winter Quarter January 1 to March 31, 1882, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Brown, production editor of ''The Times'' in 1992, the compositor responsible was identified after an inquiry as G. Price;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; fellow ''Times'' journalist Philip Howard described him as "a disgruntled compositor who had been given his cards".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Howard, "'It is a paradox that the F-word, the most frequently used word in English, is unprintable. Serious publications can print it only after sober reflection'", ''The Times'', 8 October 1999, p 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later a similar addition was made to an advertisement for the book ''Everyday Life in Our Public Schools'' in the issue of ''The Times'' for 12 June 1882. This book was said to include "a glossary of some words used by Henry Irving in his disquisitions upon fucking, which is in common use in these schools". The ''Times'' maintained a dignified silence about it, but for many years after it was a rule on the paper that any compositor who was sacked left immediately with a payoff and did not work out a period of notice.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Spiegl, ''Keep Taking The Tabloids'', Pan, 1983, p. 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The copy of the edition containing the misprint delivered to the Library of the British Museum was removed from the general collection and suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scissors-and-paste.net/SS_Collection.html |title=The SS (Suppressed Safe) collection of the British Library |last=Kearney |first=Patrick J. |publisher=Scissors and Paste |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Clarke, author of 'From Grub Street to Fleet Street', reported that a copy of ''The Times'' featuring the misprint had changed hands for £100 at an auction in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8104099.stm |title=Just click for a century of news |last=Jackson |first=Peter |publisher=BBC News online |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

On July 16, 2009, [[Harvard University]] professor [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] was arrested at his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], home by local police officer Sgt. James Crowley, who was responding to a [[9-1-1]] caller's report of men breaking and entering the residence. The arrest initiated a series of events that unfolded under the spotlight of the international news media.

The arrest occurred just after Gates returned home to Cambridge after a trip to [[People's Republic of China|China]] to research the ancestry of [[Yo-Yo Ma]] for ''[[Faces of America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Genealogy for a Nation of Immigrants |first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/arts/television/10faces.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 9, 2010|page=C1|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates found the front door to his home jammed shut and, with the help of his driver, tried to force it open. A local witness reported their activity to the police as a potential [[burglary]] in progress. Accounts regarding the ensuing confrontation differ, but Gates was arrested by the responding officer, [[Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts)|Cambridge Police]] Sgt. James Crowley, and charged with [[disorderly conduct]]. On July 21, the charges against Gates were dropped. The arrest generated a national debate about whether or not it represented an example of [[racial profiling]] by police.

On July 22, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] said about the incident, "I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home, and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately." Law enforcement organizations and members objected to Obama's comments and criticized his handling of the issue. In the aftermath, Obama stated that he regretted his comments and hoped that the situation could become a "[[teachable moment]]".&lt;ref name=pressconf/&gt;

On July 24, Obama invited both parties to the White House to discuss the issue over beer, and on July 30, Obama and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] joined Crowley and Gates in a private, cordial meeting in a courtyard near the [[White House Rose Garden]]; this became known colloquially as the "Beer Summit".

An independent panel with experts from across the nation published a report on June 30, 2010, which states that "Sergeant Crowley and Professor Gates each missed opportunities to 'ratchet down' the situation and end it peacefully" and share responsibility for the controversial July 16 arrest. Crowley could have better explained how uncertain and potentially dangerous it is to respond to a serious crime-in-progress call and why this can result in a seemingly rude tone. Gates could have tried to understand Crowley's view of the situation and could have spoken respectfully to Crowley. The report cites research that shows people's feelings about a police encounter depend significantly on whether they feel the officer displays respect and courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/breaking-news/report-on-cambridge-police-sgt-crowley-professor-gates |title=Missed Opportunities |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |date=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/6/30/report-police-gates-committee/ |title=Report on Skip Gates Arrest Brushes Over Race Issue |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |author=Xi Yu |date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/01/sergeant_gates_both_to_blame_report_says/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Sergeant, Gates both to blame, report says | first=Milton J. | last=Valencia | date=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 16, 2009, Gates had just returned from an overseas trip.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite news|title=Blogtalk: Gates, Obama, Race and the Police |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/blogtalk-gates-obama-race-and-the-police/ |first=Kate |last=Phillips |work = [[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the front door of his home would not open, Gates entered through the back door. Once inside, he still could not open the front door. Gates later stated that the lock was damaged and speculated that someone had attempted to "jimmy" it. Gates went back outside and, with help from his driver, forced the door open. Since the house is university-owned, he then reported the problem to Harvard's maintenance department.&lt;ref name="root2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/skip-gates-speaks?page=0,1|title=Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. speaks out on racial profiling after his arrest by Cambridge police |work=The Root |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gates' driver left, the Cambridge police arrived, alerted by the 9-1-1 call of a neighbor, Lucia Whalen.&lt;ref name="root2" /&gt; There are multiple published accounts of the subsequent events which led to the arrest of Gates, including the police report,&lt;ref name=police-report/&gt; interviews with Sgt. Crowley&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO119812/ |title=Officer who arrested black scholar is profiling expert |publisher=WHDH |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other officers on the scene;&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=8163051&amp;page=2 |title=Obama Called Cambridge Police Officer James Crowley Who Arrested Henry Louis Gates|first1=Huma |last1=Khan |first2=Michele |last2=Mcphee |first3= Russell |last3=Goldman |publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published interviews with Gates and Whalen.

===Police report and 9-1-1 dispatcher recordings===

Another African American officer is in the foreground, below the level of the porch, with his arms akimbo and his back to the scene while he faces the general direction of the camera.

According to the police report, Crowley arrived at the scene, went up to the front door, and asked Gates to step outside. Crowley explained he was investigating the report of a break-in in progress; as he did so, Gates opened the front door and said, "Why, because I'm a black man in America?"&lt;ref name=police-report/&gt;&lt;ref name="whattheysaw"&gt;{{cite news|last =Washington | first = Jesse | url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Analysis-What-they-saw-during-the-Gates-arrest-692.php |title=Analysis: What they saw during the Gates arrest |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley's report states that he believed Gates was lawfully in the residence, but that he was surprised and confused by Gates' behavior, which included a threat that Crowley did not know who he was "messing with." Crowley then asked Gates for a photo ID so as to verify he was the resident of the house; Gates initially refused, but then did supply his Harvard University identification card. Crowley wrote that Gates repeatedly shouted requests for his identification. Crowley then told Gates that he was leaving his residence and that if Gates wanted to continue discussing the matter, he would speak to him outside. Gates replied, "Yeah, I'll speak with your mama outside." On the 9-1-1 dispatcher audio recordings, a man's loud voice is heard in the background at several points during Sgt. Crowley's transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/07/28/gates_arrest_audio_indicates_race_was_not_factor_at_start/ |title=Gates arrest audio indicates race was not factor at start |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2009 | first1=Peter | last1=Schworm | first2=John | last2=Ellement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates stepped onto his front porch and continued to yell at Crowley, accusing him of racial bias and saying he had not heard the last of him. Faced with this tumultuous behavior from Gates, even though he was still standing on his own front porch, Crowley warned Gates that he was becoming disorderly. When Gates ignored this warning and persisted in his behavior, and likewise ignored a second warning from Crowley, Crowley informed him that he was under arrest.&lt;ref name=police-report/&gt;

===Gates's accounts===
Gates's account of the events first appeared in ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'' on July 20. According to the statement, Gates saw Crowley at the door as he was speaking to the Harvard Real Estate Office to have his front door fixed. When he opened the front door, Crowley immediately asked him to step outside. Gates did not comply and asked Crowley why he was there. When told that Crowley was a police officer investigating a reported breaking and entering, Gates replied that it was his house, and he was a Harvard faculty member. Crowley asked Gates whether he could prove it; Gates told him he could, and turned to go to the kitchen to fetch his wallet. Crowley followed him into the house. Gates then handed Crowley his Harvard University ID and a current driver's license, both including his photograph, the license also giving his address.&lt;ref name="ogletree"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/lawyers-statement-arrest-henry-louis-gates-jr|title=Lawyer's Statement on the Arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. – Charles Ogletree gives Gates' side of the story in controversial arrest of The Root's editor in-chief. | last=Ogletree | first=Charles | date=2009-07-20 | accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates then asked Crowley for his name and badge number, but Crowley did not respond. Following repeated requests for Crowley's name and badge number, the officer left the kitchen; Gates followed him to the front door. As he stepped out the front door and asked the other officers for Crowley's name and badge number, Crowley said, "Thank you for accommodating my earlier request," and arrested Gates on his front porch.&lt;ref name="ogletree" /&gt;

In an interview published in ''The Root'' on July 21, Gates said that when Crowley first asked him to step outside onto the porch, "the way he said it, I knew he wasn't canvassing for the police benevolent association. All the hairs stood up on the back of my neck, and I realized that I was in danger. And I said to him no, out of instinct. I said, 'No, I will not.'" "He demanded that I step out on the porch, and I don't think he would have done that if I was a white person." Gates called the references to loud and tumultuous behavior in the police report a "joke"; he had been physically incapable of yelling at the time, due to a severe bronchial infection. As he was walked to the car in handcuffs, he asked, "Is this how you treat a black man in America?"&lt;ref name="Olopade"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/skip-gates-speaks?page=0,1|work=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|accessdate=2009-08-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122091150/http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2009/07/professor_henry_louis_gates_jr_speaks_out_on_racial_profiling_after_his_arrest_by_cambridge_police.1.html|archivedate=2017-10-01|last=Olopade|first=Dayo|title=Skip Gates speaks|date=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with columnist [[Maureen Dowd]], Gates denied he had made a reference to the mother of the arresting officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dowd| first = Maureen| authorlink = Maureen Dowd| title = Bite Your Tongue | work = [[The New York Times]]| date = 2009-07-25| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/opinion/26dowd.html| accessdate = 2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucia Whalen===
Lucia Whalen was the witness and original 9-1-1 caller reporting the incident. Sgt. Crowley stated in his official police report that when he arrived at the scene, he spoke to Whalen, who told him she had "observed what appeared to be two black males with backpacks" trying to force entry.&lt;ref name=police-report/&gt;&lt;ref name="Notsure" /&gt; Whalen subsequently denied making any such comment to Crowley.&lt;ref name="Notsure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap911callerhurtbylabel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=8207339|title=911 caller in Gates case hurt by racist label|last=Lindsay|first=Jay|agency=Associated Press|date=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whalen was hurt by widespread comments labeling her a racist, based on the "two black males with backpacks" quote in the police report.&lt;ref name="ap911callerhurtbylabel" /&gt;

A recording of her 9-1-1 call was released on July 27; in it, Whalen could be heard saying, "I don't know if they live there and they just had a hard time with their key."&lt;ref name="Notsure"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jqwi0TSVtxC458-6AKpUuaTpH5FgD99N40G00|title=Gates 911 call: Witness not sure she sees crime|date=July 28, 2009|agency=Associated Press |publisher= Google News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801002355/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jqwi0TSVtxC458-6AKpUuaTpH5FgD99N40G00 |archivedate=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked for a more detailed description by the dispatcher, her reply on the tape was, "One looked kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure.

===Charges and resolution===
Gates was held for four hours and charged with disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name=Guardian090721&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/21/henry-louis-gates-jr-arrest-harvard|title= Police arrest prominent black history scholar for breaking into own home – Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr held for hours in a cell by Cambridge, Massachusetts police|last=Pilikington|first=Ed|date=2009-07-21|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-08-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="charged"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1912777,00.html|title=The Gates Case: When Disorderly Conduct is a Cop's Judgment Call|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2009-07-25|accessdate=2009-07-25 | first=Bonnie | last=Rochman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dropped five days later, on July 21, 2009, by the [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] [[district attorney]]'s office, upon the recommendation of the city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and the Cambridge Police Department.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CPD/News/NewsDetail.cfm?story_id=2250 |title=Joint Press Release |last= |first= |date=July 21, 2009 |publisher=City of Cambridge Police Department|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe_20090721"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/07/charges_to_be_d.html |title=Gates chastises officer after authorities agree to drop criminal charge |work=The Boston Globe |date= July 21, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-22 | first=Tracy | last=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint press release by the authorities and Professor Gates said all parties had agreed that this was "a just resolution to an unfortunate set of circumstances" and that the incident "should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Professor Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department."&lt;ref name=pressrelease/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe_20090721" /&gt;

Sgt. Crowley said he would not apologize for his actions.&lt;ref name="ABC News" /&gt; He was backed up by the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, that released a statement saying his actions had been consistent with police training, policies and applicable legal standards.&lt;ref name="Noapology"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/07/officer_in_gate.html |title=Officer in Gates case says he won't apologize |last=Saltzman |first=Jonathan |date=July 23, 2009 |work = [[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The incident was first reported in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the campus newspaper, the Monday morning after the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Krissah |last=Thompson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/20/AR2009072001358.html |title=Harvard Professor Arrested At Home |work = [[The Washington Post]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a write-up by the [[Associated Press]] that afternoon, the story spread quickly. Public interest in the arrest grew when newspapers published the photograph showing a handcuffed Gates being escorted away from the front door.&lt;ref name="root1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/obama-calls-sgt-crowley |title=Obama Calls Sgt.

A number of individuals commented on the incident in the days that followed. The [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[Deval Patrick]], stated that he felt "troubled" about the situation. The Mayor of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[E. Denise Simmons]], suggested that the incident was a "teachable moment" and that she hoped there would be meaningful dialog between Mr. Gates, the police force, and the general public.&lt;ref name="WBZ"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://wbztv.com/local/Henry.Louis.Gates.2.1096348.html |title=Patrick 'Troubled' By Harvard Professor's Arrest |accessdate=2009-07-22 |date=2009-07-22 |work=[[WBZ-TV|WBZ]] / ([[CBS|CBS Broadcasting Inc.]], Boston) |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725060424/http://wbztv.com/local/Henry.Louis.Gates.2.1096348.html |archivedate=2009-07-25 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sgt. James Crowley's supporters noted he was chosen by a black police commissioner to serve as an instructor for a [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] Police Academy course entitled "[[Racial Profiling]]", which Crowley has taught since 2004. While working as a campus police officer at [[Brandeis University]] in 1993, Crowley had tried to revive African American [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Reggie Lewis]] with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after the latter suffered a fatal heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20090722cop_who_arrested_henry_gates_im_not_apologizing/srvc=home&amp;position=0 bostonherald.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley received public support from many police officers, including African Americans, who portrayed him as a good and fair officer.&lt;ref name=crowley&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/07/24/officer.gates.arrest/|title=Obama: I didn't mean to slight Cambridge police|date=July 25, 2009 |publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/07/white_cop_who_arrested_black_s.html|title=White cop who arrested black scholar Henry Louis Gates taught class on racial profiling to police |date=July 23, 2009 | agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sgt. Leon Lashley, a black officer who was present at Gates's arrest, said he supported Sgt. Crowley's actions "100 percent."&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; Lashley added that he thought it would have gone differently, with no arrest, if he had been the first officer to arrive on the scene and the initial encounter with Gates had been "black man to black man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0907/24/acd.01.html |title= Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another officer in the Cambridge police department said "racism is not part of it, and that is what is frustrating."&lt;ref name="Boston" /&gt;

Jon Shane, who spent 17 years as a police officer in [[Newark, New Jersey]], and is a professor of criminal justice at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] who specializes in police policy and practice, told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that, had he been the responding officer, he would not have arrested Gates after identifying him. He described Gates's behavior as "[[contempt of cop]]" which officers are supposed to handle as a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] right under the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] (cf.''[[Cohen v. California]]'', which affirmed a right to "offensive" speech&lt;ref name=silverglate/&gt;). [[Tom Nolan]], a criminal justice professor at [[Boston University]] who spent 27 years in uniform at the [[Boston Police Department]], was quoted in the same article supporting an officer's use of discretion in disorderly conduct cases. Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College, told the ''Time'' reporter that disorderly conduct is "probably the most abused statute in America."&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1912777,00.html |title=The Gates Case: When Disorderly Conduct is a Cop's Judgement Call | first = Bonnie | last = Rochman |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2009-07-25| accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David E. Frank, a senior news reporter for ''Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly'' and former prosecutor in Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masslawyersweekly.com/index.cfm/page/static/content/aboutUs |title=About Us |work=Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly |accessdate=2009-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226222717/http://www.masslawyersweekly.com/index.cfm/page/static/content/aboutUs |archivedate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented that, from a legal standpoint, "the decision not to prosecute certainly seems to be the correct one." In his analysis, even if the prosecution could prove all of the disputed factual allegations in Crowley's report, Massachusetts case law does not consider offensive and abusive language to be disorderly conduct per se, and they would be unlikely to prevail in court.&lt;ref name=MLW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://masslawyersweekly.com/2009/07/22/making-legal-sense-of-the-gates-arrest/ |title= Making legal sense of the Gates arrest |work = Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly |accessdate=2009-07-22 | date=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attorney [[Harvey A. Silverglate]] suggested that the charges were dropped because Gates would almost certainly have prevailed in court with a First Amendment defense, an outcome that would have severely curtailed future arrests for disorderly conduct in "contempt of cop" situations.&lt;ref name=silverglate&gt;{{Citation |last=Silverglate |first=Harvey A. |date=July 28, 2009 |title=Prof. Gates' Unconstitutional Arrest |publisher=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/28/gates-crowley-arrest-first-amendment-free-speech-harvard-opinions-contributors-harvey-a-silverglate.html |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |quote=This gets us to the heart of the matter. Under well-established First Amendment jurisprudence, what Gates said to Crowley–even assuming the worst–is fully constitutionally protected. After all, even "offensive" speech is covered by the First Amendment's very broad umbrella. Think about it: We wouldn't even need a First Amendment if everyone restricted himself or herself to soothing platitudes. I've been doing First Amendment law for a long time and I've never had to represent someone for praising a police officer or other public official. It is those who [[Flag desecration|burn the flag]], not those who wave it, who need protection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[CNN]], General [[Colin Powell]], former Secretary of State and [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Chairman offered opinions on both sides of the incident. With regard to Gates, Powell said "I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal". Powell recalled that he was taught as a child "not to argue with a police officer trying to do their job" and that Gates should have instead cooperated to avoid making the situation difficult, suggested that Gates could afterwards file a complaint or lawsuit if he disagreed with the officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/colin-powell-on-gates-you-dont-argue-with-a-police-officer/ |title=Colin Powell on Gates: "You Don't Argue With A Police Officer" | first = Steve | last = Krakauer |work= Mediaite |date=2009-07-28| accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Sgt. Crowley, Powell stated that: "Once they felt they had to bring Dr. Gates out of the house and to handcuff him, I would've thought at that point, some adult supervision would have stepped in and said 'OK look, it is his house. Let's not take this any further, take the handcuffs off, good night Dr. Gates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/07/28/powell.palin/index.html |title=Powell: Both Gates, police could have handled things better | first = Jeff | last = Simon |publisher= CNN |date=2009-07-29| accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review conducted by the "Cambridge Review Committee," which was formed by the Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy at the recommendation of Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas, concluded that the incident was avoidable, noting that "Sergeant Crowley and Professor Gates each missed opportunities to 'rachet down' the situation and end it peacefully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Krissah|title=Arrest of Harvard's Henry Louis Gates Jr. was avoidable, report says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/30/AR2010063001356.html|accessdate=July 11, 2016|work=Washington Post|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cambridge Review Committee|title=Missed Opportunities, Shared Responsibilities: Final Report of the Cambridge Review Committee|url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/Cambridge%20Review_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=July 11, 2016|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Gates and Crowley have been active participants with the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], California. Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the center, has invited both of them back to the center in order to "create the next real 'teaching moment' for our nation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2009/07/31/gates-crowley-and-tools-for-tolerance/2538?hpid=talkbox1 |title=Reenlisting Gates and Crowley |date=July 31, 2009 |first=Abraham |last=Cooper |work=OnFaith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the message, Barrett used the phrase "jungle monkey" four times, three times in reference to Gates and once in reference to Abraham's column, which he characterized as "jungle monkey gibberish."&lt;ref name="CNN_jungle_monkey_apology" /&gt;

===Press conference and briefing===
During a July 22 news conference concerning [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]], columnist [[Lynn Sweet]], Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' asked President Barack Obama "Recently, Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested at his home in Cambridge. What does that incident say to you? And what does it say about race relations in America?" Obama replied, "Now, I've &amp;ndash; I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact."&lt;ref name=sweetreport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/07/obama_tells_lynn_sweet_police.html|title=Obama tells Lynn Sweet police acted "stupidly" in arresting Gates|last=Sweet|first=Lynn|date=July 22, 2009 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper722&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/us/politics/23gates.html |title=Obama Criticizes Arrest of Harvard Professor |last=Cooper|first=Helene|date=July 22, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The President also acknowledged that Gates is a personal friend.&lt;ref name=usatreport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8148986|title=Obama: Police Acted 'Stupidly' in Gates Case|last=Sweet|first=Lynn|date=July 22, 2009 |work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama's remarks sparked a reaction from law-enforcement professionals. James Preston, president of the [[Fraternal Order of Police]] Florida State Lodge, stated: "To make such an off-handed comment about a subject without benefit of the facts, in such a public forum, hurts police/community relations and is a setback to all of the years of progress". Preston further warned that "by reducing all contact between law enforcement and the public to the color of their skin or ethnicity is, in fact, counter-productive to improving relationships".&lt;ref name="Trujillo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Melissa |last=Trujillo |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090724/ap_on_re_us/us_obama_harvard_scholar_police |title=Obama remark on black scholar's arrest angers cops |publisher=Yahoo!

One of Gates's lawyers, Harvard Law Professor [[Charles Ogletree]], a former professor of Obama, stated that "I think the president has taken the right approach by trying to make sure we move forward [...] He's always had the ability to negotiate difficult conversations, and his steps today are an important step in the right direction.

Both Crowley and Gates issued post-meeting statements. Crowley commented that he and Gates discussed the topic "like two gentlemen, instead of fighting it out either in the physical sense or in the mental sense, in the court of public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0907/30/ec.01.html |title= Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates commented that he hoped "that this experience will prove an occasion for education, not recrimination.

When asked for his impression of Crowley, Gates joked: "We hit it off right from the very beginning [...] when he's not arresting you, Sergeant Crowley is a really likable guy."&lt;ref name=gatesinterview/&gt;

==Relations with Crowley since the incident==

During an appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', Gates stated that relations between him and Crowley are amicable. He also revealed that he asked Crowley for a sample of his DNA, and that he and Crowley are distant cousins and share a common Irish ancestor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Gates, Henry Louis. Interview. "The Importance of Ancestry" ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. Television Broadcast. ABC, Chicago. March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, Gates stated that Crowley recently gave him the handcuffs used in the arrest. When asked what he would do with the handcuffs, Gates stated that he plans to donate the handcuffs to the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Gates later revealed during a [[National Press Club]] luncheon that he had met with Sgt Crowley for a beer prior to the Beer Summit at the suggestion of President [[Bill Clinton]]. Gates said that he was moved when Crowley told him "Professor, all I wanted was to go home to my wife at the end of the day."  Gates further recounted that Crowley had feared that another black man had been upstairs who could at any moment have come down and killed him. Gates said this brought tears to his eyes as he understands fear and that ever since he and Crowley have been really good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date= March 14, 2016 |time= 58:00 | title = Ken Burns &amp; Henry Louis Gates, Jr. at The National Press Club | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFtJdcfLdc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hush money''' is a [[slang]] term for a form of [[bribery]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} in which one person or party offers another an attractive sum of money or other enticement, in exchange for remaining silent about some illegal, [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigmatic]], or [[shame]]ful behavior, action, or other fact about the person or party who has made the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/2363/hush_money.html|title=What is Hush Money? definition and meaning|website=InvestorWords.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it can be money paid to placate a disgruntled adversary who may disclose embarrassing information, even if untrue. This is to save the intended person the harm and hassle of dealing with defamation.

The person or party who presents the hush money may be attempting to avoid [[prosecution|criminal prosecution]], a [[lawsuit]] (as sometimes in the case of an [[Settlement (litigation)|out-of-court settlement]]), a leak of information to the [[news media]], or silence about a stigmatic issue within one's own community. The information being covered up may include illegal activity, such as [[illegal drug trade|drug dealing]], or some personal secret, such as an [[extramarital affair]]. In some cases, a government agency may be involved in the offer of hush money in order to protect the agency's employees, politicians and their appointees, or a national government in its standing among other nations in the world. It is usually given under the table&lt;ref&gt;[https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/under+the+table The Free Dictionary by Farlex]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hush money can refer to money paid for an agreement of confidentiality, which can be breached under court order.  It can also refer to an agreement to say a thing didn't happen that did happen, even in court testimony.   The latter type of agreement can be a criminal act itself as an [[obstruction of justice]].

==Origin==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traces published use of the term to [[Richard Steele|Sir Richard Steele]] in 1709.

The Japanese reaction occurred after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. A nuclear emergency was declared by the [[government of Japan]] on 11 March. Later Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] issued instructions that people within a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} zone around the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant]] must leave, and urged that those living between 20&amp;nbsp;km and 30&amp;nbsp;km from the site to stay indoors.&lt;ref name=BBC15&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12740843 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;– Japan quake: Radiation rises at Fukushima nuclear plant |publisher=BBC News |date= 15 March 2011|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rian15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110315/163008635.html |title=Japan's PM urges people to clear 20-km zone around Fukushima NPP (Update-1) &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter groups were also urged to evacuate on 25 March.&lt;ref name=evac/&gt;

Once a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Mr. Kan said that "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy ... saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology".&lt;ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/world/asia/14japan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=July 13, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref name="Chisaki Watanabe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-26/japan-passes-renewable-energy-bill-one-precondition-of-kan-s-resignation.html |title=Japan Spurs Solar, Wind Energy With Subsidies, in Shift From Nuclear Power |author=Chisaki Watanabe  |date=August 26, 2011  |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation’s reliance on nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/nuclear-promotion-dropped-in-japan-energy-policy-after-fukushima.html |title=Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima |author=Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada  |date=Oct 28, 2011   |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAEA recommended expanding the evacuation area, based on its criteria of 10&amp;nbsp;MBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Japanese Secretary [[Yukio Edano]] stated the government would wait to see if the high radiation continued.&lt;ref&gt;Takahara, Kanako, and Kazuaki Nagata, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110401a1.html High radiation found outside no-go zone]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 April 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March the IAEA announced a new value of 7&amp;nbsp;MBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in samples taken from 19 to 29 March in Iitate.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110402x3.html&lt;/ref&gt; The material decays at 8% to 9% each day.

On 11 April, with ongoing concerns about the stability of the reactors, Japan considered extending the evacuation zone around the Fukushima I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-idUSTRE72A0SS20110411?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews |title=Japan set to extend nuclear evacuation zone |author=Shinichi Saoshiro and Chisa Fujioka |date=April 10, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, on 21 April 2011, the Japanese government declared a 20-km zone around Daiichi as a "no-go" zone, and threatened anyone who entered or remained in the zone with arrest or detention and fines.

Evacuees from the radiation zone have reported that some evacuation shelters, including ones run by the city of [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki]], have refused to allow them entrance to their facilities, claiming that the evacuees could be carrying radioactive contamination with them.  The shelters have required the evacuees to present certificates obtained by the government of Fukushima prefecture stating that the evacuees are "radiation free".&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], "Atomic evacuees getting cold shoulder at shelters", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 April 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Tsukuba asked evacuees for radiation papers", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 April 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011, more than 100,000 Fukushima Prefecture residents are still subject to a range of evacuation measures, forcing them to live outside their home cities and towns. Some locations near the crippled nuclear power plant are estimated to be contaminated with accumulated radiation doses of more than 500 millisieverts a year, diminishing residents' hopes of returning home anytime soon. Even areas away from the nuclear plant are still suffering from a sharp decline in tourism and sluggish financial conditions.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110909p2a00m0na014000c.html |title=Over 100,000 Fukushima Prefecture residents can't return to hometowns |author= |date=September 9, 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910225829/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110909p2a00m0na014000c.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ex-prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] was interviewed about the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and has said that at one point Japan faced a situation where there was a chance that people might not be able to live in the capital zone including Tokyo and would have to evacuate. He says he is haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation's existence. "If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan's very existence would have been in peril".&lt;ref name=k12/&gt; That convinced Kan to "declare the need for Japan to end its reliance on atomic power and promote renewable sources of energy such as solar that have long taken a back seat in the resource-poor country's energy mix".&lt;ref name=k12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-japan-kan-idUSTRE81G08P20120217 |title=Nuclear crisis turns Japan ex-PM Kan into energy apostle |author=Linda Sieg and Yoko Kubota |date=Feb 17, 2012 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government Officials revealed in interviews that they were grappling the possibility of a "demonic chain reaction": If Fukushima collapsed and released enough radiation, it was "possible that other nearby nuclear power plants would have to be abandoned and could also collapse, thereby necessitating the evacuation of one of the world’s largest cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2012/02/29/panel-government-told-people-to-keep-calm-while-mulling-tokyo-evacuation/#ixzz1ntRd4YIz |title=Fukushima Report: Japan Urged Calm While It Mulled Tokyo Evacuation |author=Krista Mahr |date=February 29, 2012  |work=TIME }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evacuation drills===
In Japan, during each fiscal year, a prefecture that has nuclear power stations in its territory is legally bound to hold nuclear accident disaster drills, demonstrating how to evacuate the population out of the 10-kilometer evacuation zone according to the governmental anti-disaster guidelines. The Fukishima Daiichi accidents proved this 10-kilometer zone to be an underestimation of the evacuation zones that would actually be needed to protect the population of the prefecture from escaping radiation in a proper way. On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012. Six prefectures, including Hokkaido and Fukui, had not taken a decision to hold a drill and were awaiting new governmental guidelines on how far to evacuate. Four other prefectures, including Ehime and Saga, planned to hold drills by establishing temporary guidelines and by expanding evacuation zones on their own. The Nuclear Safety Commission aimed to review the evacuation zones and other policies by the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;''JAIF'' (5 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315192330P.pdf 70% of prefectures baffled on nuclear drill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005409/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315192330P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revising the nuclear disaster response: widening evacuation zones===
On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan published its views on the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents. Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent Protective Action Planning Zones, or UPZ. This definition was in line with the emergency response requirements proposed by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate in the event of an accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more than the present figure.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (20 October 2011 ) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_25.html Nuke committee drafts disaster-response revisions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020184052/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_25.html |date=2011-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf Earthquake-report 241: Nuke committee drafts disaster-response revisions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517084407/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term effects===
Experts on the ground in Japan agree that mental health challenges are the most significant issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sugimoto, T., Umeda, M., Shinozaki, T., Naruse, T. and Miyamoto, Y. (2015), Sources of perceived social support associated with reduced psychological distress at 1 year after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Nationwide cross-sectional survey in 2012. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 69: 580–586. doi:10.1111/pcn.12235&lt;/ref&gt; Stress, such as that caused by relocation and uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried.&lt;ref&gt;Sugimoto T, Shinozaki T, Naruse T, Miyamoto Y (2014) Who Was Concerned about Radiation, Food Safety, and Natural Disasters after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Catastrophe? A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey in 2012.

People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley [[adjunct professor]] Thomas E. McKone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=japans-post-fukushima-earthquake-health-woes-beyond-radiation&amp;page=3 |title=Japan's Post-Fukushima Earthquake Health Woes Go Beyond Radiation Effects |author=Katherine Harmon |date=March 2, 2012 |work=Nature |access-date=2012-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013113835/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=japans-post-fukushima-earthquake-health-woes-beyond-radiation&amp;page=3# |archive-date=2013-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meltdowns and radiation==
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima Daiichi]] overheated, causing [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] that eventually led to hydrogen explosions, which released large amounts of [[radioactive]] gases into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |author=Martin Fackler |date=June 1, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Nuclear meltdown]]s at three of Fukushima Daiichi’s six reactors went officially unacknowledged for months:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In one of the most damning admissions, nuclear regulators said in early June that inspectors had found tellurium 132, which experts call telltale evidence of reactor meltdowns, a day after the tsunami&amp;nbsp;— but did not tell the public for nearly three months. For months after the disaster, the government flip-flopped on the level of radiation permissible on school grounds, causing continuing confusion and anguish about the safety of schoolchildren here in Fukushima.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At 12:33 JST on 13 March the Chief Cabinet Secretary, [[Yukio Edano]], was reported to have confirmed that there was a "significant chance" that radioactive fuel rods had partially melted in Unit 3 and Unit 1, or that "it was 'highly possible' a partial meltdown was underway".&lt;ref name="wp-partial"/&gt; "I am trying to be careful with words... This is not a situation where the whole core suffers a meltdown".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7feb0aaa-4d3d-11e0-85e4-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1GTlHI2Wv |title=Japan battles to stop nuclear catastrophe |work=Financial Times |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Edano denied that a meltdown was in progress. He claimed that the radioactive fuel rods had not partially melted and he emphasized that there was no danger to the health of the population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1625701.php/Government-No-meltdown-in-Japanese-nuclear-plant |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129022230/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1625701.php/Government-No-meltdown-in-Japanese-nuclear-plant |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2013 |title=Government: No meltdown in Japanese nuclear plant |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110314a1.html |title=Water injected into Fukushima reactor |publisher=The Japan Times Online |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edano later said that there were signs that the fuel rods were melting in all three reactors.

In April 2011 the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that some of the core of a stricken Japanese reactor had probably leaked from its steel pressure vessel into the bottom of the containment structure, implying that the reactor damage was worse than previously thought. If molten fuel has "left the reactor’s pressure vessel and reached the drywell in substantial quantities, it raises the possibility that the fuel could escape the larger containment structure, leading to a large-scale radioactive release".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/world/asia/07japan.html?_r=1&amp;src=me |title=Core of Stricken Reactor Probably Leaked, U.S. Says  |author=Matthew L. Wald  |date= April 6, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, "by April 27 approximately 55 percent of the fuel in reactor unit 1 had melted, along with 35 percent of the fuel in unit 2, and 30 percent of the fuel in unit 3; and overheated spent fuels in the storage pools of units 3 and 4 probably were also damaged".&lt;ref name=bas2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/five-steps-to-prevent-another-fukushima |title=Five steps to prevent another Fukushima |author= Jungmin Kang  |date=4 May 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident has surpassed the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in seriousness, and is comparable to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref name=bas2011/&gt; ''The Economist'' reports that the Fukushima disaster is "a bit like three Three Mile Islands in a row, with added damage in the spent-fuel stores",&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |author= |date=March 24, 2011 |work=The Economist |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there will be ongoing impacts:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures". Officials said also that the fallout from the Dai-ichi plant is "hindering search efforts for victims from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/report-radioactive-emissions-from-japan-plant-approach-chernobyl-levels/1 |title=Report: Emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels  |author=Michael Winter |date=March 24, 2011 |work=USA Today |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the Japanese Government to the IAEA says the "nuclear fuel in three reactors probably melted through the inner containment vessels, not just the core". The report says the "inadequate" basic reactor design&amp;nbsp;— the Mark-1 model developed by General Electric&amp;nbsp;— included "the venting system for the containment vessels and the location of spent fuel cooling pools high in the buildings, which resulted in leaks of radioactive water that hampered repair work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-report-20110608,0,7481490.story?track=rss |title=Japan says it was unprepared for post-quake nuclear disaster |author= |date=June 8, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608222345/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-report-20110608%2C0%2C7481490.story?track=rss |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2011, the Japanese government has been unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation’s food, and "Japanese agricultural officials say meat from more than 500 cattle that were likely to have been contaminated with radioactive cesium has made its way to supermarkets and restaurants across Japan". Radioactive material has also been detected in a range of other produce, including spinach, tea leaves, milk, and fish, up to 200 miles from the nuclear plant. Inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the plant, all farming has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/world/asia/26beef.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Lifts Ban on Beef From Disaster Area |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=August 25, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/asia/19beef.html?_r=1 |title=Radiation-Tainted Beef Spreads Through Japan’s Markets |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=July 18, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking low levels of radioactive material and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades due to high radiation. It could take "more than 20 years before residents could safely return to areas with current radiation readings of 200 millisieverts per year, and a decade for areas at 100 millisieverts per year".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/27/us-japan-nuclear-uninhabitable-idUSTRE77Q17U20110827 |title=Areas near Japan nuclear plant may be off limits for decades |author= |date=August 27, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the beginning of the Fukushima crisis, [[Mycle Schneider]] says the situation remains desperate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the technical situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant is everything but stable. Families and farmers in the region remain desperate. Evacuated families had to leave their pets starving and don't know if they ever can go back to their homes. Farmers had to kill their cattle and destroy their harvests. Some finished by killing themselves. A French independent radioactivity-measuring lab announced recently that it identified up to 700,000 becquerel of cesium per square meter on grass in a primary school in Fukushima City, over 60 kilometers from the Daiichi plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |title=Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift? |author=Mycle Schneider |date=9 September 2011 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106021131/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |archivedate= 6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radiation in schools===
In the non-evacuated areas, the exposure limit for schoolyards was raised to 20 millisieverts per year. This non-negligible value (less than the 50 millisieverts yearly limit for nuclear workers in many countries) led to a large public reaction, including the resignation of Toshiso Kosako, special adviser on nuclear matters to the Japanese Government. The government then had to "flip-flop" on the issue of radiation standards in schools, causing "continuing confusion and anguish about the safety of schoolchildren in Fukushima".&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

Because of radiation concerns, tens of thousands of children are being kept inside school buildings during the hot summer, where some wear masks even though the windows are kept shut. They are banned from their own school playgrounds, unable to play in local parks and kept inside by their parents. Workers are removing the surface soil from schoolyards contaminated with radioactive particles from the nuclear plant, despite often having nowhere to dump the soil, except in holes dug in the same grounds.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

The results of a scientific survey conducted in March show that about 45 percent of 1,080 children in three Fukushima communities tested positive for thyroid exposure to radiation. The government has said that the levels were too low to warrant further examination.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

As of September 2011, a total of 16 elementary and junior high schools in Fukushima communities remained closed.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/&gt;

===Hotspots===
In October 2011, radiation levels as high as those in the evacuation zone around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant have been detected in a Tokyo suburb. Japanese officials said the contamination was linked to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Contaminations levels "as high as those inside Fukushima's no-go zone have been detected, with officials speculating that the hotspot was created after radioactive caesium carried in rain water became concentrated because of a broken gutter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201110/3347154.htm?desktop |title=Radiation hotspot found in Tokyo |author=[[Mark Willacy]] |date=25 October 2011 |work=Australia Network News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423163316/http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201110/3347154.htm?desktop |archivedate=23 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 the Japanese ministry of Science launched a telephone hotline to deal with public concerns about radiation exposure in areas outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had taken up a new hobby: walking with Geiger-counters through their city or village in search for all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized by the state of Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (24 October 2011)[ NHK {{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224255/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224255/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (24 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319440559P.pdf Earthquake-report 244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162319/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319440559P.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEPCO response==
There has been considerable criticism to the way the plant operator [[TEPCO]] has handled the crisis. Kuni Yogo, a former atomic energy policy planner in Japan’s [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Science and Technology Agency]]&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;Belson, Ken, Keith Bradsher and Matthew L.

On 1 April 2011, ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]'' reported that the plant's operators were "woefully unprepared for the scale of the disaster". Water is still being poured into the damaged reactors to cool melting fuel rods. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it "might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/01/3179487.htm |title=Crews 'facing 100-year battle' at Fukushima |author=David Mark, Mark Willacy |date=April 1, 2011 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after the beginning of the disaster in Fukushima, ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' reported how "helpless and casual" TEPCO has been in its improvised efforts to cope with the accident. The company hasn't put forward a strategy to regain control over the situation in the reactors. Helmut Hirsch, a German physicist and nuclear expert, says "they are improvising with tools that were not intended for this type of situation".&lt;ref name=Hackenbroch/&gt; There are roughly 400 workers onsite risking their lives to prevent the situation from deteriorating even further, who sleep in a building on the plant grounds.

TEPCO could face 2 trillion yen ($23.6 bln) in special losses in the current business year to March 2012 to compensate communities near its crippled Fukushima I nuclear plant, according to [[JP Morgan|JPMorgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-tepco-compensation-r-idUSTRE73A8BH20110411 |title=Tepco may face $23.6 billion compensation costs: JP Morgan |author=Antoni Slodkowski |date=April 11, 2011   |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, TEPCOs stock has "slumped 91 percent, erasing 3.2 trillion yen ($40 billion) in market value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-09/police-to-send-riot-squads-to-tepco-meeting.html |title=Police to Send Riot Squads to Tepco Meeting |author=Takahiko Hyuga and Tsuyoshi Inajima  |date=June 10, 2011  |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan plans to put TEPCO under effective state control so it can meet its compensation payments to people affected by radiation from its Fukushima I plant.  Tokyo will set aside several trillion yen in public funds that TEPCO can "dip into if it runs short for payouts to people affected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/japan-to-control-tepco-to-handle-compensation-claims-after-nuclear-disaster/story-e6frf7k6-1226042278008 |title=Japan to control TEPCO to handle compensation claims after nuclear disaster |author= |date=April 20, 2011   |work=Herald Sun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting at 22 March 2011 TEPCO compiled a radiation map of the surroundings of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. At 150 spots around the buildings the radiation was monitored. This map, the governmental data provided by SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) and the data of the Japan Meteorological Agency's were shared&amp;nbsp;– the same day&amp;nbsp;– to the United States and other international institutes. On 23 March, a day later, NISA was informed. Almost every day TEPCO officials and NRC staffers continued to share updated versions of the map by e-mail. The information was kept secret for the Japanese public until 24 April 2011, only after the media reported details of the map on 23 April 2011, a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (12 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120212p2g00m0dm019000c.html TEPCO provided radiation map to U.S. before Japanese public] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212192820/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120212p2g00m0dm019000c.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an inflow of water to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an alarm went off, indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (20 February 2014)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402200051 100 tons of radioactive water spills at Fukushima plant after workers ignore alarm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170722/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402200051 |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe that none of this water had reached the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (21 February 2014) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402210062 TEPCO says worker error may have caused large radioactive water leak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170744/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402210062 |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2014 Hideka Morimoto, deputy secretary-general of the NRA, said during a news conference, that the recurring problems and the recent discovery of the 100-ton loss of highly tainted water on the Fukushima No.1 plant had raised questions at the NRA, whether TEPCO as a firm was competent enough to solve all difficulties at the plant. According to him, quote : "This will generate controversy over TEPCO's safety culture and its ability to cope as a business operator".&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (22 February 2014) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20140222p2a00m0na002000c.html NRA official says Fukushima problems raising questions over TEPCO's competence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228063427/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20140222p2a00m0na002000c.html |date=2014-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an annual food safety exhibition in Tokyo held on 26 to 28 October 2011, machines were shown that could measure radiation: on conveyor belts food and other objects could be proofed by a radiation sensor, and the outcome could be read within 12 seconds. In this way a large number of objects could be checked in a very short time. Despite the huge price: 56,000 dollars, farmers, beef processors and restaurant chains showed great interest. Smaller devices to check food for radioactivity were shown, testing food placed in beakers. These could be used by smaller firms or even in households. The lowest cost of these small machines was still around 9,000 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (26 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_24.html Food safety fair features radiation monitors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093744/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_24.html |date=2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of public concerns about radioactive contamination of food, Aeon, a Japanese supermarket chain, decided to publish the results of voluntary radiation tests performed on food of Japanese origin in their stores. The information was available on the website, and on posters in stores. Fish, vegetables, rice, beef and more were controlled by the shops since March 2011. All products with 50 becquerels per kilogram, one-tenth of the government's provisional limit, were rejected and not offered in stores. In the first week of November 2011 radioactive cesium was found in Pacific cod and rice from Fukushima, in tuna from Miyagi, and in bonito from [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]]. The customers were offered a list of all contaminated food that was found, its radioactivity levels and production areas.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_03.html Aeon releases results of radiation checks on food] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111080452/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_03.html |date=2011-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-nuclear protests==
[[File:Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at Meiji Shrine Outer Garden 03.JPG|thumb|Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at [[Meiji Shrine]] complex in Tokyo.]]

There have been many anti-nuclear protests in Japan during 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12868364 |title=Anti-nuclear protests take place in Japan |author=Rupert Wingfield |date=25 March 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March at least 1000 people attended the monthly demonstration of the Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo after advertising on social network sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/03/27/anti-nuclear-activists-march-through-tokyo/ |title=Anti-nuclear activists march through Tokyo |date=March 27, 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters have typically been polite and restrained, but the government is "acutely aware that public anger against nuclear power is growing", and that is forcing Japan's leaders to rethink the country's energy policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/31/135008910/public-anger-against-nuclear-power-mounts-in-japan |title=Public Anger Against Nuclear Power Mounts In Japan |author=Anthony Kuhn |date=March 31, 2011 |work=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26 two dozen Diet members signed a letter calling on the government to "immediately get young children and pregnant women out of the 30-km danger zone around the heavily damaged Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant". The statement also called for "extending the current 20-km mandatory evacuation zone radically to avoid further exposure and discontinuing official declarations that there is no immediate harm to human health, charging they aren't properly transmitting to the public the dangers of possible long-term radiation harm". The statement, drawn up by anti-nuclear groups, is to be delivered to Prime Minister Naoto Kan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110326b3.html |title=Get kids, pregnant women well clear of nuke zone: politicians |author=Eric Johnston |date=March 26, 2011 |work=Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 30 there was growing consensus that the severity of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] had surpassed the [[Three Mile Island accident]] to become the world's second-worst nuclear accident. The early effects on Japanese public opinion and government policy were felt. [[NGO]]s and anti-nuclear groups gained credibility, including [[Greenpeace]], which launched a study on the impact of the Fukushima crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/172364.html |title=Japan disaster boosting anti-nuclear movement |author=Michael Penn |date=March 30, 2011 |work=Press TV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31 an anti-nuclear activist attempted to drive into the radioactivity-leaking Fukushima I complex, and later crashed through a locked gate at the Fukushima II power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/gate-crasher-drives-around-2nd-fukushima-complex-after-failing-at-crippled-plant/1 |title=Activist crashes gate at 2nd Fukushima nuke facility; failed at crippled plant |author=Michael Winter |date=March 31, 2011  |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Michael Alison Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name=krista/&gt; One protester, Yohei Nakamura, said nuclear power is a serious problem and that anti-nuclear demonstrations were undercovered in the Japanese press because of the influence of the Tokyo Electric Power Co. He said that "If the mass media shows anti-nuclear-power activities like demonstrations, they risk losing TEPCO as an advertiser."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=krista&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/04/11/what-does-fukushima%E2%80%99s-new-%E2%80%9Clevel-7%E2%80%9D-status-mean/ |title=What Does Fukushima's Level 7 Status Mean? |author=Krista Mahr  |date= April 11, 2011 |work=Time }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, "venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/columns-us-japan-nuclear-protest-idUSTRE75A0QH20110615 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protesters rally after quake |author=Antoni Slodkowski |date=June 15, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission&amp;nbsp;– now required by law&amp;nbsp;– to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name=refuse2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0620/Beginning-of-the-end-for-nuclear-power-in-Japan |title=Beginning of the end for nuclear power in Japan? |author=Gavin Blair, |date=June 20, 2011  |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60,000 people in Japan marched in demonstrations in Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Fukushima on June 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/fukushima-retiree-to-lead-anti-nuclear-motion.html |title=Fukushima Retiree Leads Anti-Nuclear Shareholders at Tepco Annual Meeting |author=Tomoko Yamazaki and Shunichi Ozasa  |date=June 27, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Japanese mothers, many new to political activism, have started "taking to the streets to urge the government to protect their children from radioactive material leaking from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant". Using social networking media, such as Facebook and Twitter, they have "organized antinuclear energy rallies nationwide attended by thousands of protesters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110709f2.html |title=Moms rally around antinuke cause |author=Junko Horiuichi |date=July 9, 2011 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the Hidankyo, the group representing the 10,000 or so survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan, called for the first time for the elimination of civilian nuclear power. In its action plan for 2012, the group appealed for "halting construction of new nuclear plants and the gradual phasing out of Japan’s 54 current reactors as energy alternatives are found".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/world/asia/07hiroshima.html?_r=1 |title=Atomic Bomb Survivors Join Nuclear Opposition |author=Martin Fackler |date=August 6, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumiteru Taniguchi, director of the Nagasaki Council of A-Bomb Sufferers, has linked the Fukushima disaster to the atomic bombings of Japan:&lt;ref name=amyg/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear power and mankind cannot coexist. We survivors of the atomic bomb have said this all along. And yet, the use of nuclear power was camouflaged as 'peaceful' and continued to progress. You never know when there's going to be a natural disaster. You can never say that there will never be a nuclear accident.&lt;ref name=amyg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/10/hiroshima-fukushima-japan-atomic-tragedies |title=From Hiroshima to Fukushima: Japan's atomic tragedies |author=Amy Goodman

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011, about 2,500 people including farmers and fishermen marched in Tokyo. They are suffering heavy losses following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and called for prompt compensation from plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the government, chanting slogans such as "TEPCO must pay compensation swiftly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110813p2g00m0dm011000c.html |title=Fukushima farmers, fishermen protest over nuclear crisis |author= |date=August 13, 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902124656/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110813p2g00m0dm011000c.html |archivedate=September 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, "took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant".&lt;ref name=reut11/&gt; An estimated 2,500 people marched past TEPCO headquarters, and created a human chain around the building of the Trade Ministry that oversees the power industry. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.&lt;ref name=reut11&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/11/us-japan-quake-protests-idUSTRE78A1AB20110911 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protests mark 6 months since quake |author=Olivier Fabre |date=11 September 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting "[[Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants|Sayonara nuclear power]]" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and anti-nuclear causes addressed the crowd. Musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], who composed the score to the movie "[[The Last Emperor]]" was also among the event's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |author= |date=September 2011 |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the anniversary of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami all over Japan protesters called for the abolishment of nuclear power, and the scrapping of nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name=ms12/&gt;

==Political reaction==

On 23 March 2011, ten days after the hydrogen explosions, the recommendations of the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] of Japan to protect the people living near the exploded Fukushima reactors were put aside by the Japanese government. The proposed measures were based on the results provided by a computer program named SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). This program was specially designed to predict the spread of radioactive materials after a nuclear accident. The proposed measurements included evacuations and administering iodine tablets to people to minimize their intake of radioactive iodine. However, the office of the Prime Minister decided that ten days after the explosions it was too late, and did not act on the proposals. These facts came to light in the first weeks of December 2011, when a government panel examined the details about the delay in utilizing the data produced by SPEEDI.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (14 December 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111214p2g00m0dm030000c.html Nuclear disaster response recommendations shelved 10 days after explosion ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214191244/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111214p2g00m0dm030000c.html |date=2011-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling party suffered embarrassing losses in April local elections after the Japanese leader came under fire over the nuclear disaster, further weakening his influence and bolstering rivals who want him to quit once the crisis ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-politics-idUSTRE73A0HR20110411 |title=Japan PM weakened by local election losses, nuclear woes |author=Linda Sieg and Chisa Fujioka |date= April 10, 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukushima Governor [[Yūhei Satō]] refused to meet former TEPCO president Masataka Shimizu on two occasions due to his anger at the utility's handling of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-11/tepco-chief-rebuffed-in-fukushima-as-crisis-enters-second-month.html Tepco Chief Rebuffed by Fukushima Leader for Second Time on Nuclear Anger]&lt;/ref&gt; Shimizu later resigned.

Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have hardened attitudes to [[nuclear power]]. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on [[radiation]]".&lt;ref name=refuse2011/&gt; The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission&amp;nbsp;– now required by law&amp;nbsp;– to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name="refuse2011"/&gt;

Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Kan said that "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy in what would be a radical shift in the country’s energy policy, saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology".&lt;ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"/&gt; Kan said Japan should abandon plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030. He wants to "pass a bill to promote renewable energy and questioned whether private companies should be running atomic plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/kan-takes-on-japan-s-nuclear-village-in-renewable-energy-drive.html |title=‘Nuclear Village’ Protester Turns Hero as Fukushima Drives Atomic Backlash |author=Stuart Biggs and Kanoko Matsuyama  |date =Jul 14, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin K. Sovacool has said that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Fukushima disaster was entirely avoidable in that Japan could have chosen to exploit the country's extensive renewable energy base.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest positive result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed public support for the [[Renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of renewable energy technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0503/Japan-s-nuclear-energy-debate-some-see-spur-for-a-renewable-revolution |title=Japan's nuclear energy debate: some see spur for a renewable revolution |author=Justin McCurry |date=May 3, 2011 |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources. The legislation will become effective on July 1, 2012, and require utilities to buy electricity generated by renewable sources including [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and [[geothermal energy]] at above-market rates.&lt;ref name="Chisaki Watanabe"/&gt;

In March 2012, Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] acknowledged that the government shared the blame for the Fukushima disaster, saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the country’s "technological infallibility", and were all too steeped in a "safety myth". Mr. Noda said "Everybody must share the pain of responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/asia/japans-premier-says-government-shares-blame-for-fukushima-disaster.html |title=Japanese Prime Minister Says Government Shares Blame for Nuclear Disaster |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=March 3, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations of the Japanese Lower House===
The special committee of the Japanese Lower House investigating the Fukushima disaster had requested to TEPCO to submit its procedural manuals for accidents by the end of the whole first week of September. But when the accident manuals were submitted to the Diet committee most of the contents was blacked out and heavily redacted. On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a cover sheet, containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was restricted information with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The special committee did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to resubmit the manuals in their original form, as required by law. NISA said it would consider what actions to take.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (13 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315904987P.pdf Earthquake report 203: TEPCO submits blacked-out manual to Diet committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103100615/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315904987P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011, there is a complex power struggle underway over the future of nuclear energy in Japan involving political, governmental, industry, and union groups. Despite the seriousness of the Fukushima crisis, Japan’s "historical commitment to nuclear power – and a fuel cycle that includes reprocessing and breeder reactors – still has powerful supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/19 |title=Nuclear or not?

In February 2012, an independent investigation into the accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation said that "In the darkest moments of last year’s nuclear accident, Japanese leaders did not know the actual extent of damage at the plant and secretly considered the possibility of evacuating Tokyo, even as they tried to play down the risks in public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/world/asia/japan-considered-tokyo-evacuation-during-the-nuclear-crisis-report-says.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Weighed Evacuating Tokyo in Nuclear Crisis |author=Martin Fackler |date=February 27, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New legal restrictions for exposure to radiation proposed===
On 6 October 2011 a government panel proposed to ease the legal restrictions for exposure to radiation in the contaminated areas with radioactive fallout, because in their opinion it would be extremely difficult to limit exposure below the legal limit of 1 millisievert per year. Instead the target should be set between 1 and 20 millisieverts in line with the recommendations by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should have a voice in setting the targets.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (6 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317956641P.pdf Earthquake-report 227: Government panel mulls interim goals on radiation dose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028152528/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317956641P.pdf |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for decommissioning the Tokai Daini Power plant===
On 11 October 2011 Tatsuya Murakami, the mayor of the village [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]], said in a meeting with minister [[Goshi Hosono]], that the [[Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant|Tokai Daini reactor]], situated 110 kilometer from [[Tokyo|Tokio]], should be decommissioned, because the plant was more than 30 years old and the people had lost confidence in the nuclear safety commission of the government.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (12 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318403487P.pdf Tokai mayor wants nuclear reactor decommissioned ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517074905/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318403487P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fukushima wants all 10 nuclear reactors scrapped===
The assembly of Fukushima Prefecture has adopted a motion that asks for the scrapping of all 10 nuclear reactors in the prefecture. The majority vote was on Thursday 20 October 2011, after the petition was submitted by a civic group in June. The petition urged the decommissioning of all reactors run by TEPCO in the prefecture—six at the Daiichi plant and four at the Daini plant. This was the first time in Japan that a prefecture hosting nuclear plants has voted to adopt such a petition. Although TEPCO was planning to decommission four reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, TEPCO still had detailed plans to exploit the remaining six reactors.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (20 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_33.html Fukushima assembly OKs reactor decommission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029041653/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_33.html |date=2011-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf Earthquake-report 241: Fukushima assembly OKs reactor decommission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517084407/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEPCO request for government compensation===
In his answer to TEPCO, after its request of 120 billion yen in government compensation, the minister of Industry Yukio Edano told TEPCO on 24 October 2011 to cut "at least" 2.5 trillion yen in its costs over the coming 10 years before TEPCO would receive any funds to help it to pay the compensations over the nuclear crisis at its Fukushima Daiichi power plant. This target was the outcome of a report from an independent commission that the Japanese government received on 3 October, in it their thoughts about how TEPCO's special business plan should be compiled as a precondition to receive financial aid from a state-backed body set up to help it meet its massive compensation obligations. Next to cost-cutting this special business plan would also include restructuring measurements. First plan would be an "emergency" plan, and the second plan should have a "comprehensive" character. This last plan should be completed in spring 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (24 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111024p2g00m0dm105000c.html Edano tells TEPCO to cut 'at least' 2.5 tril. yen in costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024190829/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111024p2g00m0dm105000c.html |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At least 1 trillion yen needed for decontamination===
In October 2011, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the government will spend at least 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) to clean up vast areas contaminated by radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan "faces the prospect of removing and disposing 29 million cubic meters of soil from a sprawling area in Fukushima, located 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Tokyo, and four nearby prefectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/20/us-japan-nuclear-noda-idUSTRE79J3W020111020?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |title=Japan to spend at least $13 billion for decontamination |author=Rie Ishiguro |date=20 October 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese nuclear reactors taken offline===
On 28 October 2011, of the 55 nuclear reactors in Japan, 44 were taken off the grid, in most instances to undergo safety inspections. Stress-tests demanded by the Japanese government were performed at 18 reactors. Of the reactors still in operation, four more would be closed down before the end of 2011, and the rest would follow in the first months of 2012. Because the disaster had raised serious safety concerns among local authorities, and they were reluctant to give permission to restart,&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (28 October 2011)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_28.html Over 80% of Japan's reactors offline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101070256/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_28.html |date=2011-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf Earthquake-report 249: Over 80% of Japan's reactors offline ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517073954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only two reactors were eventually restarted, both at the Ohi facility. On September 14, 2013, those reactors were shut down, leaving all 50 Japanese commercial nuclear reactors closed.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg News (15 September 2013) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-16/shutdown-of-japan-s-last-nuclear-reactor-raises-power-concerns.html Shutdown of Japan’s Last Nuclear Reactor Raises Power Concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation’s reliance on nuclear power. It also omits a section on nuclear power expansion that was in last year's policy review.&lt;ref name="Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada"/&gt;

===Extra staff members for Kiev embassy===
On 30 October 2011 the Japanese government took up the plan to increase the 30 members of the staff at the Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies. The extra costs of the additional embassy staff was estimated at 200 million yen.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2g00m0dm005000c.html Japan to boost embassy staff in Ukraine with nuclear experts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184810/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2g00m0dm005000c.html |date=2011-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy debate changed in Japan===
Long one of the world’s most committed promoters of civilian nuclear power, the trauma of the Fukushima disaster has changed attitudes in Japan. Political and energy experts describe "nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japan's once-vaunted nuclear technology but also in the government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/world/asia/japan-shutting-down-its-nuclear-power-industry.html?ref=energyandpower |title=Japan’s Nuclear Energy Industry Nears Shutdown, at Least for Now |author=Martin Fackler |date=March 8, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', the Fukushima nuclear disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. "By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong anti-nuclear sentiment". A June 2011 Asahi Shimbun poll of 1,980 respondents found that 74 percent answered "yes" to whether Japan should gradually decommission all 54 reactors and become nuclear free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120103f1.html |title=Fukushima meltdowns set nuclear energy debate on its ear |author=Kazuaki Nagata |date=Jan 3, 2012 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40 year limit for lifespan of nuclear reactors===
On 6 January 2012 the Japanese government proposed a maximum lifespan for nuclear reactors of 40 years. This was one of many proposals that nuclear crisis minister Goshi Hosono announced to review the nuclear safety regulations for nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel material. This was the first time that the Japanese government had tried to regulate the lifespan of nuclear power plants. When safety and maintenance of the plant meet regulatory guidelines, the operator could request for an extension. Safety standards against earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters would be revised with the new knowledge and technology in protective measures. Power companies were to comply with the new standards. Approval of the new law by the parliament was scheduled not before the end of January 2012, but ahead of the installation of the new nuclear safety agency in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (7 January 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325907598P.pdf JAIF: earthquake report 310: Govt to limit life of nuclear reactors to 40 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121041240/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325907598P.pdf |date=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with two ministers boycotted by mayors===
On 26 February 2012 a meeting with Goshi Hosono, minister of Environment, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction, and the mayors of eight cities and villages near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was cancelled. Three mayors boycotted the meeting in a protest, because the government had already informed the media about the meeting's agenda prior to informing them. Katsutaka Idogawa, the mayor of [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]], told a press conference, "I strongly mistrust the government... So I have made a momentous decision not to attend the meeting"  The mayors of the towns of [[Hirono, Fukushima|Hirono]] and [[Namie, Fukushima|Namie]] also refused to go. This meeting was intended to discuss how to get rid of the radioactive material emitted by the plant and find a place for temporary facilities to store contaminated soil. The meeting was cancelled, instead Hosono and Hirano had an informal discussion with the five remaining municipal leaders.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (27 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm046000c.html 3 Fukushima mayors boycott meeting with gov't ministers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185233/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm046000c.html |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food aid used to lower fears for contaminated food abroad===
To overcome public fears over contaminated food, Japan planned to supply food aid to the U.N. World Food Program. On 16 March 2011 the agreement was signed. Food products from disaster-hit eastern Japan would be used as overseas aid, in an attempt to lower the fears of radioactive contamination. For this a supplementary budget of 1 billion yen for the year 2011 was made available. Canned fish products produced in the prefectures Aomori, Iwate, Ibaraki and Chiba, certified and controlled for radioactive contamination&amp;nbsp;– would be sent to Cambodia and developing countries, to be used to feed schoolchildren. With this Japan planned to subsidize the fishing industry in the disaster-hit region, and hoped to revive the export of their products.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (17 March 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120317p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan using overseas food aid to help dispel contamination fears] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722045847/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120317p2g00m0dm003000c.html |date=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okuma asked to be declared as no-go zone===
On 28 March 2012 mayor Toshitsuna Watanabe of the town [[Okuma, Fukushima|Okuma]] said during a meeting of the municipal assembly held at its temporary town office in [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Aizuwakamatsu]] that he will ask the whole town to be designated as no-go area, where it is unlikely that residents will be able to return in any foreseeable future, because he did not want the community of the town divided. Likewise the town [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]] considered refusing any re-designation of the evacuation zones in the town.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na016000c.html Fukushima town seeks long-term designation as no-go zone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330122156/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na016000c.html |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postponement of analog television shutdown in Fukushima===
The five television stations licensed to the cities of Fukushima and Koriyama (NHK Fukushima, [[Fukushima Central Television|FCT]], [[Fukushima Broadcasting|KFB]], TV-U Fukushima, and Fukushima Television) were originally scheduled to shut down their [[analog television|analog signals]] on 24 July 2011. However, a month prior to the scheduled date, the Japanese senate postponed the [[analog shutdown]] in Fukushima and the prefectures of [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] to the north. Television stations in all three prefectures shut off their analog signals at noon on 31 March 2012.

===No-return zone===
At a meeting on 3 April 2012 in [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]] with Mayor Katsutaka Idogawa and Governor Yuhei Sato of Fukushima, minister Tatsuo Hirano of Reconstruction made a few personal remarks about the possibility that some places around the Fukushima nuclear power plant could be designated a no-return zone. One of the reasons he gave was the large number of storage tanks holding highly contaminated water that was used to cool the damaged reactors.&lt;ref&gt;NHK=world ( 4 April 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120404_09.html Reconstruction minister suggests no-return zone]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 30, 2013, "a wide area around" the Fukushima nuclear plant continues to show radiation contamination above 50 millisieverts, and that includes 96% of the town of Futaba where all of its 6,520 residents were evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;http://fukushimaupdate.com/last-no-go-zone-designation-in-fukushima-lifted/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evacuation zone partially lifted===
On 1 April 2012 the evacuation orders for the villages [[Kawauchi, Fukushima|Kawauchi]] and [[Tamura, Fukushima|Tamura]] were lifted, on 15 April the people of [[Minamisoma, Fukushima|Minamisoma]] were able to return to their homes. A ceremony was held for police and volunteers, who were to patrol the borders of the no-go areas. The checkpoints 20 kilometers from the reactors were moved to about 10 kilometers. Three new evacuation zones were planned by the government in areas within 11 villages and towns according to radiation levels.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-World (16 April 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Govt. lifts evacuation order for Minamisoma City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The small city of Minamisoma was divided into 3 zones, in the first people were free to go in and out, in the second access is limited, the third area all visiting is forbidden. Still scattered with ruins, and with no electricity and running water, the city was a rather uninhabitable place for a population formed by mostly elderly people. Schools and hospitals remained closed.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (Tuesday, April 17, 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120417a2.html Evacuation order lifted for parts of Minamisoma]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2012 a meeting was organised by the Japanese government to inform the people of [[Naraha, Fukushima]] about the wish to lift the evacuation order for the city of Naraha. Almost all territory of Naraha was situated within the 20 kilometer zone, and the people would be able to return to their former homes, because local maximum radiation doses would be 20 millisieverts per year. Deputy head of the Cabinet's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters Kensuke Tomita, who represented the government at the meeting, was overwhelmed by all the questions and angry remarks of the local people attending the meeting. At the end he promised that: "TEPCO and the government will take responsibility for restoring local infrastructure, decontamination and (nuclear disaster) compensation." But at this moment the city government had given up the possibility for re-designation before March. On 16 April the governor of Fukushima Yuhei Sato said at the Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters, that the people of Fukushima were frightened by all the problems with the nuclear plant, and persisted that the government would take control.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (18 April 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120418p2a00m0na014000c.html Official 'decommissioning' of Fukushima reactors brings locals no peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420230050/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120418p2a00m0na014000c.html |date=2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decontamination==
On 23 June 2013 during a meeting with evacuees from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents would be allowed to return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.
Although billions of yen were spent in an effort to decontaminate some areas around the troubled nuclear plant, the effort was described as futile, and radioactive waste was not collected properly and disposed of, and sometimes dumped into rivers.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (23 March 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303230057 Fukushima cleanup contractors told workers to lie about pay in 'surprise' inspections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125234952/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303230057 |date=2014-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainich Shimbun (08 June 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130608p2a00m0na012000c.html Data reveals that 75 percent of decontamination work in housing areas remains unfinished] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130701085851/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130608p2a00m0na012000c.html |date=2013-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (27 May 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130527p2a00m0na009000c.html Subcontractor chided for sacking Fukushima decontamination work whistle-blowers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130701085854/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130527p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=2013-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tomohiko Hideta, an official of the Reconstruction Agency, said that it would be impossible to reach the official targets, and confirmed the offer of the dosimeters. However, spokesmen for the Japanese Ministry of Environment denied all, even when they were confronted with the existence of audio recordings of the meeting that proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (29 June 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306290074 Government offers dosimeters—not decontamination—for Fukushima evacuees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105103945/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306290074 |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring the impact of radiation-exposure on the health of residents==
On 4 November 2011 in the city of [[Hamamatsu]], Goshi Hosono, minister in charge of the nuclear crisis, made a remark about plans to set up a study regarding the health consequences of radiation levels of about 20 millisieverts per year. Studies done after nuclear accidents in the past suggested that radiation levels of more than 100 millisieverts at once would have negative effects on human health, but negative effects from lower levels were never found. The Japanese government hoped to be able to accept 20 millisieverts per year as below the limit harmful to human health. This exposure limit is recommended by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Concerning the government project of disposing of debris in areas outside northeastern Japan, Hosono said that rubble from [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] was not radioactive, burning the rubble was harmless, and the ashes would be disposed of safely. Local governments would be asked for cooperation, with the national government ensuring safety and taking overall responsibility .&lt;ref&gt;NHK-World (5 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/05_26.html Govt to study low-level radiation impact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108235348/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/05_26.html |date=2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (6 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320550190P.pdf Earthquake-report 257: Govt to study low-level radiation impact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517063935/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320550190P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December the Ministry of Environment announced an extra program to monitor the impact of radiation exposure on children born to mothers in Fukushima Prefecture, to find links between the mothers' radiation exposure and congenital abnormalities, asthma, allergies or other diseases of their children. The checks would stop when the children reach the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (21 December 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324452150P.pdf Earthquake-report 297: NHK-world: Radiation impact on Fukushima kids to be monitored] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113253/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324452150P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No health effects of this nature are expected to rise as a result of the incident.

On 15 April 2012 the city of [[Namie, Fukushima]] asked the Japanese government for free healthcare for its residents. To monitor long-term health, the city would provide to all inhabitants health handbooks, in order to keep a thorough record of all health checks and thyroid examinations. The health books followed the structure of those used to monitor the health of the atomic bomb survivors in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. These "[[hibakusha]]" health books were free from medical fees, and Namie asked the government to set up a similar program for the people in Namie. Of the seven other cities around the nuclear plant, Futaba was also willing to take part in this program.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (15 April 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120415a3.html Namie to seek medical fee exemption for all residents]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 the government of the evacuated city of Namie bought a whole-body dosimeter. The device was installed in a temporary housing in [[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima]], in order to monitor the internal radiation exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished at the end of the fiscal year 2012. In this way the government of Namie wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from SPEEDI were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (26 April 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120426p2a00m0na011000c.html Evacuated Fukushima town sets up whole-body dosimeter at temporary housing complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428172025/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120426p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2013 12 children were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and 15 others were suspected of having the disease. Four members of the panel that accompanied the screening stepped down that day. Among the new members were Shuji Shimizu, professor at Fukushima University (involved with nuclear-related payouts) and Shinji Tokonami, professor at Hirosaki University, who had done the health screening in the town of Namie. In an attempt to regain public trust, after it became known that secret meetings were held to "harmonize the opinions of the panel-members". In addition the panel said that its goal had been changed from "alleviating the anxiety of the residents" to "maintaining and promoting the health of prefectural residents into the future." Because this was the first large-scale survey in this field, comparisons could not made. The government of Fukushima Prefecture provided the results of the testing and a list of the patients to the panel, which it had previously refused to do in order to protect the privacy of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (06 June 2013)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130606p2a00m0na013000c.html 4 members leave Fukushima panel overseeing prefectural health survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010711/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130606p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=2013-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (06 June 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306060092 Experts: More data needed to assess radiation's role in cancer among Fukushima kids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612230326/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306060092 |date=2013-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing school lunches==
On the end of March 2012 a survey of [[Kyodo News]] revealed that fears for contamination with radioactive fallout 44 of 74 major towns in Japan were testing school lunches or food-components for radioactive cesium. In eastern Japan a majority of 34 out of 42 towns had started with these tests, after the government had ordered testing in 17 prefectures around the Fukushima-plant.

In other parts of Japan, testing was left free to decide whether to test school lunches. But
already 10 out of 32 towns had implemented similar tests, while at this date [[Morioka]], [[Akita, Akita|Akita]] and four other towns had plans to start testing. Some cities did not test themselves, they relied on the safety of the food because pre-shipment tests conducted by producers.

Although after 1 April 2012 the Japanese government lowered the legal standard for radioactive cesium-levels down to 100 becquerels/kg, some cities decided to lower the standard even further:

* no detection : [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]
* 4 becquerels/kg: [[Sapporo]]
* 10 becquerels/kg:[[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]]
* 40 becquerels/kg: [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]], [[Sumida, Tokyo|Sumida]]
* 50 becquerels/kg: [[Kyoto]]

Other towns like [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]], [[Matsuyama]] and the Bunkyo Ward school in Tokyo planned to demand for lower than legal levels.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2g00m0dm006000c.html 44 Japanese municipalities test school lunches for cesium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330122005/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2g00m0dm006000c.html |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress-tests==
On 8 November the Japanese government published the first results of nuclear safety tests at the website of [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]]. This was done to boost transparency before laid-off reactors were restarted. The minister of industry Yukio Edano asked the public to respond with remarks and questions about the tests, and promised to respond to this all. He hoped, that this would lead to a better understanding of the nuclear safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (8 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/08_18.html Govt releases nuclear safety test results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903050208/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/08_18.html |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris disposal==
Nine months after the disaster of 11 March it proved increasingly difficult to dispose all the debris and rubble. In April 572 municipalities were willing to accept the debris, but in the latest survey done by the Ministry of Environment on 7 October only 54 municipalities in 11 prefectures were willing to consider acceptance, and only six places had already taken in parts of the debris. Fear for radioactive contamination was thought to be the cause for this. The ministry declined to identify the municipalities that have agreed, or refused, to accept the debris. Some 4.88 million tons of rubble were needed to be disposed of a year after the quake. Around 20.5 million tons was collected in Iwate and Miyagi, all was stored at multiple temporary storage sites. The debris from Fukushima would be stored within this prefecture. On 2 November 30 tons of debris was loaded on train, and sent to Tokyo by rail from the city of Miyako, Iwate. The first train carrying the debris would arrive in Tokyo on 4 November. This made Tokyo the first local government outside Japan's northeast to accept debris.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (3 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2011/11/03/20111103p2g00m0dm016000c.html Municipalities increasingly unwilling to accept quake debris] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711012217/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2011/11/03/20111103p2g00m0dm016000c.html |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (3 November 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf Earthquake-report 255] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103124954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim Storage facility===
On 28 December at a meeting in the city of Fukushima minister Goshi Hosono asked the local leaders of prefecture Fukushima for permission to build an interim storage facility somewhere in the county of [[Futaba District, Fukushima|Futaba]] near the two villages hosting the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Local residents, however, were seriously divided. Those who would like to return to their houses, were afraid, that an interim-storage might prove to be a very permanent storage, and would make any return impossible. But others had already accepted the fact, that the radiation-levels around their former houses would be too high, and would make living there impractical for a long time. Some local residents realized that without the interim storage facility, there would no place to dispose radioactive waste at all, and the construction of the facility would create also new jobs.

Local leaders were willing to accept the new waste-storage, but in the mean time they were reluctant, because the anger of some of their citizens and the fact that the presence of it, could hamper all efforts to decontaminate the area and would make repopulation impossible. Therefor they requested an insurance from the government, that the storage would be closed after 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (29 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111229p2a00m0na004000c.html Gov't request for nuclear storage facility site sends shockwaves through Fukushima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229185933/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111229p2a00m0na004000c.html |date=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 December 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325129913P.pdf earthquake report 303: Govt requests sites for waste soil storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103155038/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325129913P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers including farmers and consumers. Everywhere in Japan banners and stickers were found with: "Hang in there, Fukushima!", numerous harmful rumors on Fukushima products could be found online. Many rumors that were discriminatory to Fukushima and other messages slandering Fukushima people could be found on the Internet. The source of cesium was found to be rice straw that had been feed to the animal. But a notice of the Japanese government that was sent to cattle-farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention to the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News( 25 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20111025p2a00m0na005000c.html Nuclear plant accidents threaten relations between food producers and consumers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026193240/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20111025p2a00m0na005000c.html |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of the event has been described as taking an "irrational approach which generated the worst of humanity" because many anti-nuclear groups tried to make political points out of the issue. In addition, the main story should have been on the 19,000 people killed by the tsunami and the thousands of missing individuals. However, public attention was drawn ''away'' from the needs of major restructuring, housing, developing the transportation system, and helping people who suffered because of the tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moderntokyotimes.com/2012/03/02/fukushima-nuclear-accident-the-media-and-international-responses/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313194222/http://moderntokyotimes.com/2012/03/02/fukushima-nuclear-accident-the-media-and-international-responses/ |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Spiegelhalter]] of Cambridge University explained that the psychological effects of the media coverage include increased feelings of risk and vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencewise-erc.org.uk/cms/risk-and-public-dialogue-in-the-fukushima-story/ Risk and public dialogue in the Fukushima story].

==Judicial actions against restarting nuclear powerplants==
In August 2011 citizens of the prefecture [[Shiga]], at the banks of Lake [[Biwa]], started a lawsuit at the Otsu District Court, and asked a court order to prevent the restart of seven reactors operated by [[Kansai Electric Power Company]], in the prefecture [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]].

On 8 November 2011 a group of 40 citizens of [[Ōtsu, Shiga|Otsu]] prefecture [[Kyodo]] started a similar lawsuit at the Otsu District Court against [[Japan Atomic Power Company]]. They asked for a provisional court order to delay the restart of the two reactors at the [[Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant]] in the city of [[Tsuruga]]. The plaintiffs argued that:

* Lake [[Biwa]] could be contaminated when a nuclear accident would occur at the plant
* The whole region of Kansai is dependent on this, the biggest lake of Japan, because it is the source of drinking water for the whole region
* an accident would endanger the health of all residents
* the Tsuruga plant is built on a site with a fault below it and a severe accident could occur during an earthquake
* the No. 1 reactor had been more than 40 years in service since it was first operational in 1970, and the Tsuruga plant was insufficiently protected against tsunamis.
* the ongoing regular checks were done under the government's safety and technological standards, and the nuclear crisis in Fukushima had proven that those regulations were insufficient.
* the reactors should remain shut down until the cause of the disaster in Fukushima would be fully investigated
* the regular checks should be performed under the new safety standards.

The operator of the plant did not want to make any comment to the press. At that time the two reactors of the plant were shut down for regular checkups. But the four-month inspection of the No. 2 reactor could be completed in December, and the checkup of reactor 1 could be completed in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (9 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111109p2g00m0dm007000c.html Residents seek court order not to restart Tsuruga reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112080134/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111109p2g00m0dm007000c.html |date=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2011 a lawsuit was started against [[Kyūshū Electric Power Company]] by 290 local residents. Most of them living in the prefectures [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]] and [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]]. They said that the disaster in Fukushima had made it clear, that an accident at the Genkai-plant caused by a possible earthquake or tsunami could damage the lives and health of the people living nearby. They questioned in particular the safety of the 36-year-old nr. 1 reactor near the sea. Kyushu Electric commented, that it would examine the suit and would act "appropriately." This was already the third time that locals tried to stop this plant. Because in July 2011 90 people asked the local court for an injunction order to stop the nr. 2 and nr. 3 Genkai-reactors from going back online, like was done in August 2010 when about 130 local residents and others demanded from the district court to halt to the use of plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, at the No. 3 Genkai-reactor.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (28 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111228p2g00m0dm015000c.html Residents sue to seek complete suspension of Genkai reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104032224/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111228p2g00m0dm015000c.html |date=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 a lawsuit was filed against the Japanese government and Kyushu Electric Power Co. at the Saga District Court by about 1,700 people from all over Japan. The complaint mentioned that after the Fukushima disaster the safety myth regarding nuclear reactors was proven to be false, and under the Japanese Constitution everybody in Japan should live without fear. On 12 March 2012 the total of people complaining was already more than 3000, when 1370 people joined the plaintiffs. Another group was planning to file another suit to seek suspension of yet another nuclear power plant run by the same company. According to Akira Hasegawa, the leader of the plaintiffs and former president of Saga University it looked possible to him raising the number of plaintiffs to 10.000.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (13 March 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120313p2g00m0dm027000c.html Lawsuit seeking to halt Genkai atomic plant draws record plaintiffs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711103128/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120313p2g00m0dm027000c.html |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal charges against NISA, NSA and TEPCO===
On 14 March 2012 two groups of citizens had taken up the plan to file criminal complaints against officials of TEPCO and governmental agencies for professional negligence in the Fukushima nuclear disaster. On 9 March in the town of Iwaki they had held a demonstration to mobilize at least 1000 people in the area of Fukushima to join in, because round 15 May the complaint would be filed at the office of the Fukushima District Public Prosecutors. In this complaint officials of the governmental Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and TEPCO would be accused of criminal conduct and neglect resulting in the failure to prevent the nuclear crisis.

As a result, many people were exposed to radiation, patients dies because they needed to flee from their hospital, The group considered to accuse the officials of imposing health hazards through the spread of massive amounts of radioactive substances.

The 58-year-old member of the Iwaki municipal assembly and leader of the group, Kazuyoshi Sato said, he believed it was "nonsense that nobody has been held criminally responsible for causing a major nuclear accident. I'd like to call on as many Fukushima people as possible, including those who are taking shelter in areas outside of the prefecture, to join our action."

According to lawyer Yukuo Yasuda in the complaint TEPCO would be charged for not taking all necessary precautions against a possible tsunami, although studies had pointed out that there had been this kind of tsunamis in this region in the past. NISA and NSA were accused of neglect because they did not instruct TEPCO to implement the necessary measures.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (15 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120315p2g00m0dm010000c.html Fukushima citizens to accuse TEPCO, state of negligence over crisis]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal investigations==
On 22 May 2012 the 33-year-old Makoto Owada, a high-ranking gang-member of the Sumiyoshi-kai yakuza group was arrested. Workers supplied by a network of companies and subcontractors were forced to pay substantial portions of their earnings to the subcontracting companies and Owada. Investigators learned that already in 2007 Owada was dispatching workers at the nuclear power plant construction sites in various areas. According to the police, it was needed to cut off all gang-funding, to prevent the flow of tax-money to yakuza-gangs.&lt;ref&gt;the Mainichi Shimbun (23 May 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120523p2a00m0na017000c.html Portion of wages paid to some Fukushima plant workers may have gone to gang: police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526113631/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120523p2a00m0na017000c.html |date=2012-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific reaction==
On 25 October 2011 the university of [[Hiroshima]] disclosed a plan to train the staff of the Japan Red Cross staff in how to respond to nuclear disasters like the one in Fukushima. The papers were to be signed on 26 October 2011. The president Toshimasa Asahara of the University said, he hoped that the university staff would also learn from the experience of the Red Cross in the care for disaster-disasters, including those in other countries. The University of Hiroshima University did establish a leading research center into the effects of radiation on the human body and health: the [[Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima|Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine]], due to decades lasting studies after the effects on local population, that survived the atomic-explosion of Hiroshima in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (26 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111026p2g00m0dm011000c.html Hiroshima Univ., Red Cross to cooperate in radiation, disaster fields] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030024453/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111026p2g00m0dm011000c.html |date=2011-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fukushima accident exposed some troubling nuclear safety issues:&lt;ref name=Sci11/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the resources poured into analyzing crustal movements and having expert committees determine earthquake risk, for instance, researchers never considered the possibility of a magnitude-9 earthquake followed by a massive tsunami. The failure of multiple safety features on nuclear power plants has raised questions about the nation's engineering prowess. Government flip-flopping on acceptable levels of radiation exposure confused the public, and health professionals provided little guidance. Facing a dearth of reliable information on radiation levels, citizens armed themselves with dosimeters, pooled data, and together produced radiological contamination maps far more detailed than anything the government or official scientific sources ever provided.&lt;ref name=Sci11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/in-wake-of-fukushima-disaster.html |title=In Wake of Fukushima Disaster, Japan's Scientists Ponder How to Regain Public Trust |author=Dennis Normile |date=28 November 2011 |work=Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128195939/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/in-wake-of-fukushima-disaster.html |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
On 9 November 2011 the ministry of Finance reported that since the disaster in March 2011, due to rising energy costs, high oil-prices, and the need to replace the loss of nuclear power the current account surplus had fallen 21.4 percent to 20.4 billion dollars compared with the year 2010. A decline of seven months in-a-row. The trade balance had also fallen by 59 percent year-on-year to a surplus of about 4.8 billion dollars. The strong yen made the export of electronic components difficult. Through higher returns on overseas investments, however, the income account surplus rose 12.9 percent to nearly 18 billion dollars. Compared with 2010 the balance of international payments had shrunk 46.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_20.html Japan's current account surplus continue to shrink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104060131/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_20.html |date=2011-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Japan saw a fall in manufacturing output for 2011, there was an increased use of fossil fuels for power generation, and this was the main driving force behind a rise in Japanese greenhouse gas emissions. Ministry of the Environment figures for 2011 show total greenhouse gas emissions of 1300 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent – 49 million tonnes more than in 2010 (a 3.9% increase).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/EE-Japan_sees_emissions_rise-1012127.html Japan sees emissions rise].

==Technical developments==
On 29 March 2012 a prototype of a new camera was presented by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) and the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA) for the detection of gamma radiation. Images were made with a wide angle lens, the amount of contamination was presented in six different colors, the highest concentrations were red, after this yellow, green and purple. The camera was tested in February on different locations in Fukushima, the very accurate images of the contamination had already proven it effectiveness in the decontamination effort.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na006000c.html JAXA develops camera that can 'see' radioactive contamination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331172541/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na006000c.html |date=2012-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation payments==

===The Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund===
On 21 October the president of TEPCO Toshio Nishizawa said that his company hoped to avoid capital injections from the [[Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund]], a foundation of the Japanese government. TEPCO would need financial aid from this fund to be able to pay the huge compensation payments due to the nuclear disaster at its Fukushima nuclear power plants.  At a press-conference in Tokyo Nishizawa made the following remarks:

"We would like to properly conduct compensation by receiving financial assistance, while also taking rationalization measures to turn around management and keep on going as a private company, I think it's the best option for all to avoid capital injection as much as possible."

TEPCO might claim in October 2011 the sum of 120 billion yen of government compensation for the nuclear accident, this is the maximum amount set by a contract between the government and TEPCO. Compensation payments to people and companies that suffered damages through the crisis at that date already exceeded 150 billion yen. These compensation payments could rise up to 4.54 trillion yen (4,500,000,000,000 yen or around 59 billion US dollar) by March 2013, as was revealed by a report made by a commission of the Japanese government According to an estimate by a report compiled by a government panel, compensation payments could reach 4.54 trillion yen by March 2013. Special Government bonds, that carry no interest but could be cashed when necessary, would raise the money needed.  The fund has also the right to make capital injections to TEPCO by subscribing shares. In close cooperation with this fund Tepco tried to seek financial backup for the future.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (22 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111022p2g00m0dm012000c.html TEPCO to make efforts to avoid capital injection: Nishizawa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022184308/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111022p2g00m0dm012000c.html |date=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At January 2013 TEPCO announced, that it needed more money to be able to pay compensations to the victims. At that moment the cost were estimated at Y3.24 trillion ($38 billion), up Y697 billion since March 2012, when the last calculation was made. In October 2011, seven months after the disaster the first assumption had been Y1.1 trillion. Since then, TEPCO already received Y1.5 billion financial aid, but the cost tripled. Besides the compensation costs, TEPCO would need some Y10 trillion to dismantle the reactors and clean up the radioactive polluted areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Tokyo Times (04 January 2013) [http://www.tokyotimes.com/2013/fukushima-operator-needs-more-money-to-compensate-victims/ Fukushima operator needs more money to compensate victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation criteria for former residents of the evacuation zones===
In February 2012 new restitution standards were set by the Japanese government center for settling disputes over compensation for nuclear accidents for the ongoing Fukushima nuclear crisis:

TEPCO was ordered to pay:

* to every person that was told to leave their home in accordance with official evacuation advisories.
** 100,000 yen per month
** after 7 months this amount should not be halved, as initially was planned.
* to all people that evacuated on their own initiative:
** the costs of transportation
** the costs of accommodation expenses in excess of the amounts listed by the interim guidelines set by the government's Dispute Reconciliation Committee for Nuclear Damage
*** 400,000 yen for children and expecting mothers
*** 80,000 yen for all others.

TEPCO is also required to pay compensation for any damage caused by the nuclear disaster to properties in evacuation zones, even without on-site checks to confirm the properties' conditions.

The government of prefecture Fukushima was notified that in some areas the former residents would not be permitted to return, because there was no prospect that decontamination could be completed in any foreseeable future.

Settling the claims filed by evacuees about compensation, proved to be very difficult. Because TEPCO did refuse to respond to victims' claims, that their residences and other properties were worthless after the crisis. From 900 claims filed less than 10 claims were settled at the end of February 2012, despite all efforts of more than 150 lawyers, mediators and inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (25 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20120225p2a00m0na001000c.html TEPCO must be proactive in nuke crisis compensation negotiations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225172019/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20120225p2a00m0na001000c.html |date=2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation criteria for the tourist industry===
On 26 October 2011 TEPCO revised its criteria in calculating the damage suffered by tourist businesses after the crisis. Initial calculations by TEPCO included a deduction of 20 percent of the calculated losses. In the first announcement on 21 September 2011 TEPCO said that this 20 percent was thought to be caused not by radiation fears, but through the impact of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed. The new criteria offered two options:
* 10 percent reduction, no limit to the period.
* 20 percent reduction, but the period is shortened to 31 May 2011, between the first of June and 31 August the rate would be zero. The first criteria were based on data on the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake that hit Kobe and surrounding area, this provoked much opposition.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (27 October 2011 )[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111027p2g00m0dm006000c.html TEPCO revises compensation criteria for tourism businesses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030024504/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111027p2g00m0dm006000c.html |date=2011-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Tetsunari Iida]] launched the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, which is backed by ¥1 billion (US$13 million) from Japan's richest man, [[Masayoshi Son]]. The foundation will bring together some 100 experts from around the world to analyse obstacles to [[Renewable energy commercialization|implementing renewable energy]], and offer policy recommendations to the new Japanese government.&lt;ref name=renew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110830/full/477013a.html |title=Japan's new leader faces energy gap  |author=David Cyranoski |date=Vol. 477, No. 13-14 (2011)  |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2011|09}}, Japan plans to build a pilot [[Floating wind turbine|floating wind farm]], with six 2-megawatt turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]].&lt;ref name=bb20110916&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Plans Floating Wind Power Plant |url=http://www.breakbulk.com/wind-renewables/japan-plans-floating-wind-power-plant |accessdate=12 October 2011 |newspaper=Breakbulk |date=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521071742/http://www.breakbulk.com/wind-renewables/japan-plans-floating-wind-power-plant |archivedate=21 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the evaluation phase is complete in 2016, "Japan plans to build as many as 80 floating wind turbines off Fukushima by 2020."&lt;ref name=bb20110916/&gt;

=== Coal ===
The drop in energy capacity as a result of the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants has prompted the [[Shinzō Abe]]-led government to revisit the use of coal for energy generation, primarily through the increased adoption of high energy, low emissions (HELE) power plants that employ [[coal pollution mitigation]] techniques. By 2015, the share of coal in Japan's power sector had risen to 31% from 23% prior to the Fukushima disaster, but is projected by the government to fall to 26% by 2030 as Japan's energy mix stabilizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan plans to build 45 new coal power plants in next decade: EIA |url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/sydney/japan-plans-to-build-45-new-coal-power-plants-27762428 |accessdate=23 February 2017 |newspaper=S&amp;P Global Platts |date=3 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kunicon''' was a series of [[anime convention]]s organized by Subarashii Nation (formerly D20, Inc.) and held throughout the [[United States]] from December 2004 through June 2005. Originally named "Otakucon", the convention was renamed to "Kunicon" after controversy erupted over the name being similar to [[Otakon]], an anime convention held in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. While Kunicon's original goal was to hold a convention in twelve major cities across the United States, these plans were cut short after 4 conventions as Kunicon continued to be plagued with controversy and cost overruns.&lt;ref name="AC-canceled"&gt;{{cite web | first = Patrick | last = Delahanty| url = https://animecons.com/news/post/193/kunicon-cancelled-former-chairman-posts-attendance-numbers | title = Kunicon canceled; former chairman posts attendance numbers | date = 2005-11-02 | publisher = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Kunicon held several events over the course of a convention, including gaming competitions, [[cosplay]] contests, panels, live music concerts, anime screenings, and special performances.&lt;ref name="AC-PR96"&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://animecons.com/press/post/96/otakucon-schedule-announced | title = Otakucon schedule announced | date = 2004-12-10 | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally announced as "Otakucon", the convention started going by "OtakuCon Miami Beach" several months before the first convention in Miami, Florida.&lt;ref name="AC-PR96" /&gt; [[Otakon]] staff has reported that they had ordered a cease-and-desist,&lt;ref name="ANN-2004Review"&gt;{{cite web | last = Koulikov | first = Mikhail | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2005-01-26/9 | title = 2004 Year in Review: Anime Con Highlights | date = 2005-01-26 | publisher = Anime News Network | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the convention chairman, Manny Camacho, had been reported as saying that the name was simply changed to avoid confusion.&lt;ref name="FV-OtakuCon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lillard |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fansview.com/2004/otakucon/121704a.htm |title=OtakuCon - Kunicon Plans - 2004 |publisher=A Fan's View |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022003954/http://www.fansview.com/2004/otakucon/121704a.htm |archivedate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the St. Louis event was announced as the second convention, it was announced under the name "Kunicon".&lt;ref name="AC-PR96" /&gt;

Following the first convention in Miami, the staff cited an attendance of 5,000 people,&lt;ref name="AC-canceled" /&gt; which precisely matched their pre-con estimate.&lt;ref name="AC-PR96" /&gt; However, pictures taken by a fan photographer was used as evidence that numbers claimed by Kunicon were inflated.&lt;ref name="AC-canceled" /&gt;

Kunicon continued to plan events for [[San Diego]], [[St. Louis]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Denver]]. However, San Diego was quickly canceled&lt;ref name="AC-KuniSD"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/events/info/9223/kunicon-san-diego-2005 | title = Kunicon San Diego 2005 Information | publisher = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next convention was held in St. Louis in March 2005.&lt;ref name="AC-KuniSTL" /&gt; The fourth and final Kunicon was held in Denver in June 2005&lt;ref name="AC-KuniDEN" /&gt;, but went $30,000 over budget.&lt;ref name="AC-canceled" /&gt;

The controversy came to an end when Emanuel "Manny" Camacho, the Kunicon chairman, announced on his [[LiveJournal]] that he was unable to contact Subarashii Nation and he could not see how the next convention, Kunicon Miami in December 2005, could take place. He also stated that the staff and employees of the convention have not been paid for their work.&lt;ref name="AC-canceled" /&gt;

[[The Public Theater]] has produced over 100 plays and musicals at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York City's [[Central Park]] since the theater's opening in 1962. Currently the series is produced under the brand [[Free Shakespeare in the Park]], and all productions are staged at the Delacorte. In past decades, the series was branded the New York Shakespeare Festival and encompassed productions at both the Delacorte and the Public's downtown location near [[Astor Place]].

Officially ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', staged in 1997, was celebrated as the final work of the [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean canon]] to be performed as part of the series. However, {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, the three parts of ''Henry VI'' have not been performed at the Delacorte except as the heavily adapted ''[[Wars of the Roses]]'' in 1970.

''[[Measure for Measure]]'' is the most-performed work, having been produced once during each of the six decades the Delacorte has been operating.

'''Live Earth''' is an event developed to increase [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]] through entertainment.

==Background==
Founded by Emmy-winning producer [[Kevin Wall]], in partnership with former U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]], ''Live Earth'' was built upon the belief that entertainment has the power to transcend social and cultural barriers to move the world community to action. Live Earth seeks to leverage the power of entertainment through integrated events, media, and the live experience to ignite a global movement aimed at solving the most critical [[environmental issues]] of our time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liveearth.org/en/liveearth/ About Live Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220005119/http://liveearth.org/en/liveearth |date=2010-02-20 }} accessed February 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Live Earth'' would have been broadcast by [[STAR TV (Asia)]], which works in conjunction with the ''[[STAR Plus]]'' channel (United Kingdom, Middle East) and the Star World Channel.

The concert was cancelled shortly after the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] on November 26, 2008.

==Dow Live Earth Run for Water==
The [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]] Live Earth Run for Water took place April 18, 2010 and consisted of a series of 6&amp;nbsp;km run/walks (the average distance many women and children walk every day to secure water) taking place over the course of 24 hours in countries around the world, featuring concerts and water education activities aimed at igniting a tipping point to help solve the [[water crisis]]. [[Jessica Biel]], [[Alexandra Cousteau]], [[Pete Wentz]], [[Angélique Kidjo]] and Jenny Fletcher were due to lend their names and their time in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wateronline.com/article.mvc/Dow-Launches-The-Dow-Live-Earth-Run-For-Water-0001|title=Dow Launches The Dow Live Earth Run For Water - The Largest Global Water Initiative In History To Help Solve The World Water Crisis|work=wateronline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Before and after the event there was concern over the sponsorship of the Run For Water by [[Dow Chemical]], whose sponsorship of this event has been described as "the ultimate in [[greenwashing]]", given Dow's ownership of [[Union Carbide]], their refusal to clean up the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal site]], plus their direct responsibility for groundwater poisoning incidents in [[Morrisonville, Louisiana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFD1BB7hU9sC&amp;pg=PA145 |title=History and Health Policy in the United States|work=google.com|isbn=9780813538389|last1=Stevens|first1=Rosemary|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Charles E.|last3=Burns|first3=Lawton R.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tittabawassee River]] in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonbowermaster.com/blog/2009/11/dow-live-earth-the-ultimate-in-greenwashing/ Dow + “Live Earth” = the Ultimate in Greenwashing?

In 1975, he worked with [[Franco Modigliani]] on the [[NAIRU]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modigliani |first=Franco |first2=Lucas |last2=Papademos |year=1975 |title=Targets for Monetary Policy in the Coming Year |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |volume=1975 |issue=1 |pages=141–165 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |jstor=2534063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He engaged in a career in [[academia]], teaching economics at [[Columbia University]] from 1975 until 1984, before moving to the [[University of Athens]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/lucas-papademos |title=Harvard Kennedy School |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School |date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work as an economist began in 1980, when he was appointed Senior Economist at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]]. He joined the [[Bank of Greece]] in 1985 as its [[Chief Economist]], rising to the rank of Deputy Governor in 1993, and finally [[Governor]] in 1994. During his time as Governor of the central bank, Papademos was involved in Greece's transition from the drachma to the [[euro]] as its national currency.

After leaving the Bank of Greece in 2002, Papademos became the Vice President to [[Wim Duisenberg]], and then [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], at the [[European Central Bank]] from 2002 to 2010. In 2010 he served as an economic advisor to [[Prime Minister of Greece|Greek Prime Minister]] [[George Papandreou]].&lt;ref name="telegraph8867331"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8867331/Lucas-Papademos-profile.html |title=Lucas Papademos: profile |publisher=The Telegraph |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published numerous articles in the fields of macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, theory of chaos as well as on subjects concerning the economic performance, financial stability, financial instability and economic policy in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofi.net/Speakers/index.php?idspeak=34 |title=Lucas Papademas |publisher=Eurofi (www.eurofi.net) |date= |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also delivered addresses on the [[Greek debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/multimedia/video-european-economic-crisis-seminar-series-case-greece-keynote |title=Video: The European Economic Crisis Seminar Series: The Case of Greece – Keynote |publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108233714/http://csis.org/multimedia/video-european-economic-crisis-seminar-series-case-greece-keynote |archivedate=8 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister of Greece==

{{see also|Greek government debt crisis|European sovereign debt crisis#Greece|Sixth austerity package (Greece)}}
Papademos was first proposed as a potential caretaker [[Prime Minister of Greece]] in early November 2011, after Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] offered to resign and allow a [[national unity government|provisional coalition government]] to deal with the major political turmoil caused by the country's [[Greek debt crisis|debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15671354 |title=Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister |publisher=BBC |date= 10 November 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/lucas-papademos-greece-interim-coalition|title=Lucas Papademos to lead Greece's interim coalition government|date=10 November 2011|work=Guardian (UK)|accessdate=10 November 2011|location=London|first=Helena|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas Papademos set two conditions upon which he would accept the offer of being Prime Minister of this provisional government. The first, was that the new government would not have a very restricted life span as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] had demanded, and the second was that political figures from both New Democracy and the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) would participate in the government. Both of these were initially vetoed by New Democracy, but after several days of negotiations they relented and accepted Papademos' demands. This enabled Papademos to form a government made up of PASOK and New Democracy, with the support of the far-right [[Popular Orthodox Rally]].

After a week of political turmoil and negotiations between parties triggered by Papandreou's resignation, Papademos was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece on 11 November 2011, unveiling his [[Coalition Cabinet of Lucas Papademos|provisional Cabinet]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/11/us-greece-f-idUSTRE7AA2H720111111 |title=Papademos sworn in, heads Greek cabinet of stalwarts |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111164259/https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/11/us-greece-f-idUSTRE7AA2H720111111 |archivedate=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two parliamentary parties, the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] and the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA), had refused Papandreou's invitation to participate in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political opposition divided over unity government|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/11/2011_413717|publisher=e.kathemerini.com|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The provisional government also marks the first time that the far-right has played a part in any Greek government since the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military junta]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Papademos sworn in to lead party-packed Greek cabinet|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/11/uk-greece-f-idUKTRE7AA2R420111111|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papademos stated that his government's primary task would be to facilitate the [[Greek financial crisis|financial bailout]] from the European Union - which was provided on the condition that severe budget austerity be implemented - and to lead the country until elections could be held. Papademos also stated that his sole priority as Prime Minister would be to try to keep Greece within the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15691697 |title=Greece swears in unity cabinet and PM Lucas Papademos |publisher=BBC |date= 11 November 2011|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Papademos warned that workers would have to accept substantial cuts in their income in order for a default to be avoided. He also told business and union leaders that the "troika" — the European Union, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the ECB — was looking for Greece to take steps to open up so-called closed professions, as well as adjustments to the minimum wage, abolition of Christmas and summer vacation bonuses and automatic wage increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-04/papademos-warns-fellow-greeks-economic-collapse-looms-without-sacrifice.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Maria | last1=Petrakis | first2=Natalie | last2=Weeks | title=Papademos Warns Fellow Greeks Economic Collapse Looms Without Sacrifice | date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papademos also declared in January that his provisional government would last until at least April, instead of February as was originally planned, so that further austerity measures could be implemented before an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2011/december/greek-elections-delayed-until-april/73071.aspx|title=Greek elections delayed until April|date=28 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2012, Papademos announced that he would ask [[President of Greece|President]] [[Karolos Papoulias]] to dissolve the [[Hellenic Parliament]], paving the way for [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|a general election]] to be held on 6 May 2012. Papademos had intended to stand down shortly after this election, but it resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. Subsequently New Democracy, PASOK, and the anti-austerity SYRIZA - which had jumped into second place - [[2012 Greek government formation|attempted to form a government]], but all were unsuccessful. Emergency negotiations to attempt to avoid a return to the polls took place on 13 May, but were inconclusive. On the same day, Papademos wrote to President Papoulias to inform him that the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Finance]] could only afford to pay salaries until the end of June, and that the need for Greece to recapitalise her liquid assets was "urgent".&lt;ref name="technocrat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g3t4bsRXZd9h5nfOtmPEE6QaRoqQ?docId=CNG.ba931eaf00377ee5bd435da4bb4fc82f.671|title=Greek president calls for technocrat government|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations in the aftermath of the election were unable to produce a government leading to a [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|snap general election]], which took place on 17 June 2012.&lt;ref name="technocrat"/&gt; In the wake of the announcement of the election Papademos stepped down, proposing [[Panagiotis Pikrammenos]] - a judge and the [[Council of State (Greece)|President of the Council of State]] - to replace him as caretaker Prime Minister until a permanent government could be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18082552 | work=BBC News | title=Greece to hold new election on 17 June | date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
As of 2011, Papademos has been married to Shanna Ingram for more than 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2668/Buitenland/article/detail/3028354/2011/11/11/Vrouw-van-nieuwe-premier-Griekenland-is-Nederlandse.dhtml|title=Vrouw van nieuwe premier Griekenland is Nederlandse|date=11 November 2011|publisher=Volkskrant|language=Dutch|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grreporter.info/en/sana_ingram_%E2%80%93_dutch_artist_behind_success_lucas_papademos/5430 Sana Ingram – the Dutch artist behind the success of Lucas Papademos], 11 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Of Dutch descent, as of 2012 she was the President of the charity group Association of Friends of Children with Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpida.org/en/news/papadimou.html#.WFrDs32gvVI|title=Visit by Mrs. Shanna Ingram-Papademos to the Children's Oncology Unit|website=www.elpida.org|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
In Athens on 25 May 2017, a suspected [[letter bomb]] exploded within his car, causing non-life-threatening arm, leg and stomach injuries to Papademos. His driver sustained leg injuries in the attack and another passenger, a banking official, was also injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/617394/Athens-Terror-Bomb-Greece-Lucas-Papademos-Prime-Minister-Explosion-Terrorists-Security|title=Bomb explodes as ex-PM injured|publisher=Daily Star|date=25 May 2017|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40052213|title=Blast in car injures Greek ex-PM|publisher=BBC|date=25 May 2017|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revelle Sabine Balmain''' (11 July 1972-c. 5 November 1994) was an [[Australia]]n [[Model (person)|model]], [[dancer]] and [[escort agency|escort]] who mysteriously disappeared from the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] in early November 1994. Her body has never been found.

==Background to disappearance==
Balmain was planning on visiting [[Japan]] for her fourth cabaret tour. She had been working as an escort to establish herself, and she was planning on finishing escort work so that she could fully concentrate on her showbusiness career.&lt;ref name="pinkney"&gt;John Pinkney, ''Great Australian Mysteries'', Five Mile Press, Rowville, Victoria, 2004 {{ISBN|1-74124-024-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 5 November, Balmain, who worked as an escort under the name of "Mischa", visited a client in the south-eastern Sydney suburb of [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]]. After the two-hour appointment was over she had planned to meet friend Kate Brentnell for a drink. After that she would be seeing her new boyfriend, a 27-year old writer involved in the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Sarah|title=Is 'Cinderella girl' killer hiding in Tasmania? Her boyfriend breaks his silence to reveal police believe they know who killed the model and secret escort 20 years ago |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2821338/Twenty-years-model-Revelle-Balmain-disappeared-former-boyfriend-breaks-silence-reveal-heartbreak-believes-really-happened-her.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 7.15 pm Revelle rang Kate Brentnell to say that she was about to leave her client and suggested that they meet at the Royal Hotel, [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. She did not keep that appointment.&lt;ref name="pinkney" /&gt;

==Disappearance==
On the following day, 5 November, Balmain's bag, make-up, diary, credit cards and keys to her [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]] flat were found scattered around several Kingsford streets. One of her shell-studded platform shoes was retrieved from one street; the other shoe was found in another street.&lt;ref name="pinkney" /&gt;
Police interviewed Balmain's client, who said that he had driven her to the nearby Red Tomato Inn at about 7.00 pm on the evening of 5 November. [[Police officers]] also questioned the escort agency's owners, but the enquiries resulted in no charges being laid.&lt;ref name="pinkney" /&gt;

==Search and reward==
After a couple of fruitless weeks of searching, the [[New South Wales]] government offered a reward of $100,000 for anyone who could provide information that would lead to the arrest of Balmain's killer.&lt;ref name="pinkney" /&gt; The reward for information is now up to $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold cases: Millions of dollars in rewards on offer for help solving NSW’s most notorious murders|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/05/09/16/20/millions-of-dollars-in-rewards-on-offer-for-help-solving-nsws-most-notorious-murders|website=9News|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1999 the Deputy State [[Coroner]], [[John Abernethy (judge)|John Abernethy]], handed down an open finding into Balmain's presumed death. He said he "could not ascertain" how she died, as her body had never been found.

==New leads==
In 2008, forensic evidence suggested that Balmain was murdered in the house of the client who she had visited, which belonged to Gavin Owen Samer. The 1999 coronial inquiry suggested Samer as a suspect, but fell short of recommending charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=Dylan|title=New lead in Revelle Balmain murder|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/new-lead-in-revelle-balmain-murder/2008/07/30/1217097331341.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Balmain's family also believe that there were major flaws in the police investigation of the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadgraft|first=Beverley|date=June 19, 2011|title=They made us feel like criminals|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/they-made-us-feel-like-criminals/story-fn6bn9st-1226077617777|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Insect Week''' is a biennial initiative in the UK. Usually held during the last week of June, the aim is to engage the general public with the importance of insects and entomology. The week is organised by the [[Royal Entomological Society]] and supported by a large number of partner organisations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalinsectweek.co.uk/about/partners.htm NIW partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082948/http://www.nationalinsectweek.co.uk/about/partners.htm |date=2013-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concerned with insect science, natural history and conservation. The week consists of hundreds of events and activities across UK, allowing the public to discover insects and meet the entomologists that study them. The popular National Insect Week Photography Competition is launched during the week and attracts entries from large numbers of amateur photographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalinsectweek.co.uk/competitions/photo_competition_results.htm NIW Photography Competition 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as promoting the importance of insect science to the wider public, National Insect Week particularly aims to encourage young people into entomology.&lt;ref name="niw"&gt;[http://nationalinsectweek.co.uk National Insect Week website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Past National Insect Week campaigns have been endorsed by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]], [[David Bellamy|Prof David Bellamy OBE]], [[Chris Packham]], [[Kate Humble]] and [[Mike Dilger]].

The next National Insect Week will be 18-24 June, 2018.&lt;ref name="niw"/&gt;

'''Oliver Pocher''' (born 18 February 1978) is a German [[actor]], [[stand-up comedian]] and [[television host]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and professional training ===
Pocher is the son of Gerhard and Jutta Pocher; he was born and grew up in [[Hanover]], [[West Germany]]. His parents are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and he too was raised as one. In 2007, Pocher stated that, unlike his parents, he had no contact with the organization anymore as he claimed "not to have agreed with their rules“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/BTO/leute/2007/04/11/pocher-oliver-kirche/comedian-fernsehen-glauben.html Sex vor der Ehe ist verwerflich... muss aber leider manchmal sein] Bild.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports that Pocher had attended a [[Waldorf school]] were denied by his management.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|access-date=23 June 2015|url=http://www.waldorfbazar.de/blog/oliver-pocher-ist-kein-waldorfschueler/|title=Oliver Pocher ist kein Waldorfschüler}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pocher successfully completed his training as an insurance broker at Signal Iduna Bauspar AG.

During the time of his apprenticeship he had some part-time jobs at various radio stations and as a DJ in clubs and during family celebrations. He also appeared in the comedian group Holla-Bolla and as an entertainer at Birte Karalus, a German chat show. After his apprenticeship he worked for the Swiss life insurance " Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs- und Rentenanstalt" (today: SwissLife) and the "HDI Lebensversicherung AG" (HDI life insurance).

=== Career ===
Pocher's first television appearance was on 28 October 1998 at the afternoon chat show of Bärbel Schäfer. Pocher was given 5 minutes to make the audience laugh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb8fWxNsGRY YouTube Video vom Acting by Bärbel Schäfer]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 1999 he presented the show ''Chart Surfer Trash Top 100'', ''Was geht ab'', ''Planet Viva'' and finally 2002 his own show ''Alles Pocher, ... oder was?''.

Between January 2003 to 14 April 2006 he presents the show ''Rent a Pocher'' on ProSieben.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/156625/february-12-2008/who-s-riding-my-coattails-now----oliver-pocher February 12, 2008: Who's Riding My Coattails Now? - Oliver Pocher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he recorded the single "Schwarz und Weiss," a song dedicated to the 2006 world cup. A music video was made, featuring Oliver as several pressbox speakers, as well as him performing the song in front of fans dressed in Team Germany attire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/tid-9318/medien-jeder-kann-bloed-sein_aid_263630.html „Jeder kann blöd sein“]&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2007 to April 2009, Pocher joined established late night host [[Harald Schmidt]]'s show on the [[Das Erste]] television channel, with the show being called ''Schmidt und Pocher''.

In 2008 his third single "Bringt ihn heim“ (engl.: bring him home) was released. It is a song for the European Football Championship  of 2008. The original version is Baschi's number one hit (Switzerland) “Bring en hei“ {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} He acted as a co-trainer of the European Team during the DEL All Star Game in 2009. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Pocher's contract was not renewed after April 2009, so he was hired by [[Sat.1]] instead to present his own late night show, ''Die Oliver Pocher Show''. The show's ratings were always below the station's average and even slipping over the course of the run until it was cancelled in March 2011.

===Criticism and scandals===
Oliver Pocher is widely criticised for his jokes at the expense of others. After he recommended plastic surgery to a woman of the audience of the ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'' ("Wanna Bet..?") episode on 22 January 2005, he was sued for damages of 25,000 Euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/0,1518,539956,00.html Spiegel.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Although he apologized to her on the phone and repeated this apology in public during one of his shows, he was not able to solve this conflict out of court. On the 11th of January Pocher was sentenced by the district court of Hanover to pay a fine of 6,000 euros. The judge in charge called Pocher’s statement (“You look quite old for your age”) a “very insulting comment”. The public insulting continued in January 2008 during the TV show "Johannes B. Kerner" when Pocher once again made fun of this woman’s appearance and mocked the verdict. As a result, another suit was filed against the entertainer. The victim’s lawyer explained that the woman was insulted and that the topic is repeatedly brought up by people whom she meets during her work. Pocher did not comment on this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/0,1518,539956,00.html Spiegel.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Statements as those made by Pocher could be legal in the future, as the Council of Europe is advising to decriminalize insults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11305.htm Report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312142956/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc07%2FEDOC11305.htm |date=2011-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocher caused a scandal in July 2005 during the ZDF (German broadcasting station) – show "Gottschalk &amp; Friends"  when he first insulted Mariah Carey and later accidentally spat water onto her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpRnACRtCQE Clip from the Attack at YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; For this action he has been harshly criticised by some newspapers and by the broadcast station in charge. Gottschalk himself kept calm and commented upon the incident: "Of course I do not want to have jokes at the expense of others during my show and I do not want corpses to be carried away from the battlefield afterwards. If you invite Pocher to your show, however, you should expect a different atmosphere than with, for example, [[Alfred Biolek]]."

When Pocher mocked the personal life of singer [[Sarah Connor (singer)|Sarah Connor]] and her reality show, Connor sued Pocher. While the exact outcome of the lawsuit is not known, Pocher did apologize to Connor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga.de/features/storyarchiv/00127377-sarah-connor-vs-oliver-pocher-krieg-im-tv/ Sarah Connor vs. Oliver Pocher - Krieg im TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, during the TV show “Schmidt &amp; Pocher“, Pocher spoofed the Hitler assassin Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who is portrayed by Tom Cruise in “Operation Walküre“. He had to face negative feedback for this and thereafter the broadcasting commission examined this incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article147225/ARD-Widerstand-gegen-Oliver-Pocher-waechst.html Article in the "Hamburger Abendblatt"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, at the Vienna Ball, Oliver Pocher was interviewed by Mirjam Wechselbraun with Kim Kardashian. He joked that he was only going to dance when 'N****** in Vienna' was played.

A '''political houseparty''' is a [[party]] held in a private home for the purpose of supporting a particular candidate, political party, or ballot measure, or to share information and opinions about an upcoming election.

Such events may be arranged as a dinner party, or with light or no refreshments in a more casual setting.  In municipal politics, it is not uncommon for the candidate to appear at the event to explain his or her [[Political platform|platform]] and to answer questions.

Supporters are often encouraged to organize political house parties by the organizers of the [[political campaign]].  Advantages include a stronger persuasive power than a [[lawn sign]] or [[Campaign advertising|political ad]] because some information is coming from trusted friends, there is time to convey a substantial amount of information, and the event is interactive.  The primary disadvantage is that the house party will only "reach" a relatively small number of people, compared to the time and money required to have it.

{{About|a slowdown in economic activity}}
{{Economics sidebar}}
In economics, a '''recession''' is a [[business cycle]] contraction when there is a general slowdown in economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession|title=Recession |accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861699686 |title=Recession definition |accessdate=19 November 2008 |work=Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition] |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328205929/https://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861699686 |archivedate=28 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[macroeconomics|Macroeconomic]] indicators such as [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] (gross domestic product), investment spending, [[capacity utilization]], household income, business profits, and inflation fall, while bankruptcies and the [[unemployment rate]] rise. In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7495340.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: What is a recession? | date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKTreasury&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Treasury terms|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/junebudget_glossary.htm|publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|accessdate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102095705/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/junebudget_glossary.htm|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a [[financial crisis]], an external trade shock, an adverse [[supply shock]] or the bursting of an [[economic bubble]]. Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary [[macroeconomic policies]], such as [[monetary policy|increasing money supply]], [[fiscal policy|increasing government spending and decreasing taxation]].

==Definition==
In a 1974 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb for defining a recession, one of which was two down consecutive quarters of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Changing Business Cycle|newspaper=The New York Times|page = 222|date = 1 December 1974|first = Julius|last = Shiskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the other rules of thumb were forgotten. Some economists prefer a definition of a 1.5-2 percentage points rise in unemployment within 12 months.&lt;ref name="Eslake"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER defines an economic recession as: "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in [[real GDP]], [[real income]], employment, [[industrial production]], and [[wholesale]]-[[retail sales]]."&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nber.org/cycles/|title= Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions|accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231548/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost universally, academics, economists, policy makers, and businesses defer to the determination by the NBER for the precise dating of a recession's onset and end.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom|recessions]] are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonal adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for [[real GDP]]&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKTreasury/&gt;, with the same definition being used for all other member states of the [[European Union]].
&lt;ref&gt;google&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
A recession has many attributes that can occur simultaneously and includes declines in component measures of economic activity (GDP) such as consumption, [[investment]], government spending, and net export activity. These summary measures reflect underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies.

Economist [[Richard Koo|Richard C. Koo]] wrote that under ideal conditions, a country's economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"&gt;{{cite book

Policy responses are often designed to drive the economy back towards this ideal state of balance.

A severe (GDP down by 10%) or prolonged (three or four years) recession is referred to as an [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]], although some argue that their causes and cures can be different.&lt;ref name="Eslake"&gt;[http://clubtroppo.com.au/2008/11/23/what-is-the-difference-between-a-recession-and-a-depression/ "What is the difference between a recession and a depression?"] Saul Eslake Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  As an informal shorthand, economists sometimes refer to different [[recession shapes]], such as [[V-shaped recession|V-shaped]], [[U-shaped recession|U-shaped]], [[L-shaped recession|L-shaped]] and [[W-shaped recession|W-shaped]] recessions.

===Type of recession or shape===
{{Main|Recession shapes}}
The type and shape of recessions are distinctive. In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990–91; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974–75, and W-shaped, or [[double-dip recession]]s in 1949 and 1980–82. Japan’s 1993–94 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–99 can be described as L-shaped. [[Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997–98, although [[Thailand]]’s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |title=Key Indicators 2001: Growth and Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=ADB.org |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155544/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological aspects===
Recessions have psychological and confidence aspects. For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save [[money]] rather than invest. Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Samuelson, Robert J. |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/13/AR2010061303330.html |title=Our economy's crisis of confidence |work=The Washington Post |date= 14 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conference-board.org/economics/consumerconfidence.cfm |title=The Conference Board – Consumer Confidence Survey Press Release – May 2010 |publisher=Conference-board.org |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Animal spirits (Keynes)|animal spirits]] has been used to describe the [[psychological]] factors underlying economic activity. Economist [[Robert J. Shiller]] wrote that the term "...refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith. When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiller |first=Robert J. |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123302080925418107 |title=WSJ – Robert Shiller – Animal Spirits Depend on Trust |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance sheet recession===
{{Main|Balance sheet recession}}
High levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a "balance sheet recession." This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that "the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt--that it was a so-called "balance sheet recession." In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's "Great Recession" that began in 1990 was a "balance sheet recession." It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koo 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo – The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo – The World In Balance Sheet Recession – Real World Economics Review – December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research How Mortgage Debt is Holding Back the Economy – Mike Konczal – Roosevelt Institute – July 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research |date=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidity trap===
A [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like "[[pushing on a string]]." Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book

| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 | publisher=W.W. Norton Company Limited

===Paradoxes of thrift and deleveraging===
Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky"&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2009/0416.html Federal Reserve – Janet Yellen – A Minsky Meltdown – April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: "Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky" /&gt;

==Government responses==
{{See also|Stabilization policy}}

Most [[mainstream economics|mainstream economists]] believe that recessions are caused by inadequate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, and favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions. Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]—tax cuts or increased government spending—works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.

For example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: "The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can’t spend the way they used to, they’re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what’s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more — and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion - Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock market==
Some recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines. In ''[[Stocks for the Long Run]]'', Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] were not followed by a recession.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeremy J. (2002). ''Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies'', 3rd, New York: McGraw-Hill, 388. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Real estate|real-estate]] market also usually weakens before a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lvrg.org.au/blog/2009/06/from-subprime-to-terrigenous-recession.html |title=From the subprime to the terrigenous: Recession begins at home |publisher=Land Values Research Group |date=2 June 2009 |quote=A downturn in the property market, especially in turnover (sales) of properties, is a ''leading'' indicator of recession, with a lead time of up to 9 quarters...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However real-estate declines can last much longer than recessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert J. Shiller |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/business/economy/07view.html |title=Why Home Prices May Keep Falling |work=New York Times, June&amp;nbsp;6, 2009 | date=7 June 2009 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the business cycle is very hard to predict, Siegel argues that it is not possible to take advantage of economic cycles for timing investments. Even the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) takes a few months to determine if a peak or trough has occurred in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121001589.html Recession Predictions and Investment Decisions] by Allan Sloan, 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During an economic decline, [[high yield stocks]] such as [[fast-moving consumer goods]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, and [[tobacco]] tend to hold up better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/05/news/economy/recession_invest.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008020603 Recession? Where to put your money now.] Shawn Tully, 6 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the economy starts to recover and the bottom of the market has passed, [[growth stock]]s tend to recover faster. There is significant disagreement about how health care and utilities tend to recover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/ibm-hpq-recession-pf-ii_jl_0128money_inl.html Rethinking Recession-Proof Stocks]
Joshua Lipton 28 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Diversifying one's portfolio into international stocks may provide some safety; however, economies that are closely correlated with that of the U.S. may also be affected by a recession in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/60656-recession-stock-picks-from-morgan-stanley-s-douglas-cohen Recession Stock Picks] Douglas Cohen, 18 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a view termed the ''halfway rule''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaffen |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122635740974515379 |title=Recession Puts Halfway Rule to the Test|work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which investors start discounting an economic recovery about halfway through a recession. In the 16 U.S. recessions since 1919, the average length has been 13 months, although the recent recessions have been shorter. Thus, if the 2008 had recession followed the average, the downturn in the stock market would have bottomed around November 2008. The actual US stock market bottom of the 2008 recession was in March 2009.

==Politics==
Generally an administration gets credit or blame for the state of economy during its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7215351.stm Economy puts Republicans at risk] 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused disagreements about on how it actually started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/press/2003/fs_bushrecession073103.pdf The Bush Recession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204065202/http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/press/2003/fs_bushrecession073103.pdf |date=2011-02-04 }} Prepared by: Democrat staff, [[Senate Budget Committee]], 31 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In an economic cycle, a downturn can be considered a consequence of an expansion reaching an unsustainable state, and is corrected by a brief decline. Thus it is not easy to isolate the causes of specific phases of the cycle.

The 1981 recession is thought to have been caused by the tight-money policy adopted by [[Paul Volcker]], chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before [[Ronald Reagan]] took office. Reagan supported that policy. Economist [[Walter Heller]], chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] in the 1960s, said that "I call it a Reagan-Volcker-Carter recession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922689-2,00.html Ready for a Real Downer] Monday, 23 November 1981 By GEORGE J. CHURCH&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting taming of [[inflation]] did, however, set the stage for a robust growth period during Reagan's administration.

Economists usually teach that to some degree recession is unavoidable, and its causes are not well understood. Consequently, modern [[government administration]]s attempt to take steps, also not agreed upon, to soften a recession.

==Consequences==

===Unemployment===
Unemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the "natural rate," in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;The Saylor Foundation. "Unemployment Rate." pp. 1 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf] Accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
[[Productivity]] tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close. The variation in [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] between firms rises sharply. Recessions have also provided opportunities for [[anti-competitive]] [[merger]]s, with a negative impact on the wider economy: the suspension of [[competition policy]] in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="ESRC"/&gt;

===Social effects===
The [[living standards]] of people dependent on wages and [[salaries]] are not more affected by recessions than those who rely on [[fixed income]]s or [[welfare benefits]]. The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being. Fixed income benefits receive small cuts which make it tougher to survive.&lt;ref name="ESRC"/&gt;

Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual [[real GDP]] growth of 3.0 percent or less in their view was "...equivalent to a global recession."&lt;ref name="economist-12381879"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381879 |title=The world economy Bad, or worse |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2009, IMF had changed their Global recession definition to: 
* ''A decline in annual per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP (purchasing power parity weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per{{nbhyph}}capita investment, and per{{nbhyph}}capita consumption.''&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What’s a Global Recession?|publisher=The Walstreet Journal|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013|first=Bob|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf|title=World Economic Outlook - April 2009: Crisis and Recovery|format=PDF|work=Box 1.1 (page 11-14)|publisher=IMF|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By this new definition, a total of four global recessions took place since [[World War II]]: 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009. All of them only lasted one year, although the third would have lasted three years (1991–93) if IMF as criteria had used the normal exchange rate weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP rather than the purchase power parity weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"/&gt;

===Australia===
The worst recession Australia has ever suffered happened in the beginning of the 1930s. As a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931-1932 saw Australia’s biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations, that underwent [[depression (economics)|depressions]], but their poor economic states influenced Australia’s as well, that depended on them for export, as well as [[foreign investments]]. The nation also benefited from bigger productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with feeling the effects less.
 
Due to a credit squeeze, the economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961
Australia was facing a rising level of [[inflation]] in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Australian Economic Indicators | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | date=27 February 1998 | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recession – the most recent one to date – came in the 1990s, at the beginning of the decade. It was the result of a major stock collapse in 1987, in October,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Reasons for 1990s Recession | publisher = The Age | date=2 December 2006 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/the-real-reasons-why-it-was-the-1990s-recession-we-had-to-have/2006/12/01/1164777791623.html?page=3 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to now as [[Black Monday]]. Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn’t limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.

===United Kingdom===

The most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the [[late-2000s recession]].

===United States===

According to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion.&lt;ref name="nber.org" /&gt; However, since 1980 there have been only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title=Percent change from preceding period - U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four periods considered recessions:

Official economic data shows that a substantial number of nations were in recession as of early 2009.

====United States====
The [[United States housing market correction]] (a possible consequence of [[United States housing bubble]]) and [[subprime mortgage crisis]] significantly contributed to a recession.

The [[Great Recession in the United States|2007–2009 recession]] saw private consumption fall for the first time in nearly 20 years. This indicates the depth and severity of the current recession. With consumer confidence so low, recovery takes a long time. Consumers in the U.S. have been hard hit by the current recession, with the value of their houses dropping and their pension savings decimated on the stock market. Not only have consumers watched their wealth being eroded – they are now fearing for their jobs as [[unemployment]] rises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/recession2009/ Economic Crisis: When will it End?

====Other countries====
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}

Many other countries, particularly in Europe, have undergone negative GDP growth. Some countries have been able to avoid a recession but have still experienced slower economic activity, such as China. India and Australia were able to maintain positive growth throughout the late-2000s recession.

[[China]] had their [[2015 Chinese stock market crash|stock market crash]], which began with the popping of the [[stock market bubble]] on 12 July 2015.

In December 2000, an [[al-Qaeda]] plot to bomb the [[Christkindelsmärik, Strasbourg|Strasbourg Christmas market]], at the feet of the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] on [[New Year's Eve]] was discovered. The plot was foiled by French and German police after a terrorist network based in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, the "'''Frankfurt group'''", was unravelled. A total of fourteen people were convicted as part of the plot; four in Germany and ten in France, including the operational leader, [[Mohammed Bensakhria]] ({{aka}} "Meliani"), thought to be a European deputy to [[Osama bin Laden]]. The alleged mastermind of the plot was thought to have been [[Abu Doha]], who was detained in the [[United Kingdom]].

After being tipped off by British intelligence, German police on 26 December 2000 discovered bomb-making equipment during a raid of an apartment in Frankfurt. Four men were arrested.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chronology: The Plots|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/special/cron.html|work=PBS Frontline|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Five Linked to Al Qaeda Face Trial in Germany|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/04/15/five-linked-to-al-qaeda-face-trial-in-germany/4b7c7dee-6dfd-4ed3-abba-bf474b58db74/|work=Washington Post|date=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the findings were several [[pressure cooker bomb|pressure cookers]], 30&amp;nbsp;kg of chemicals that could be used to make explosives, and a notebook describing how to mix homemade bombs.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Four convicted of Strasbourg bomb plot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/10/germany.france|work=The Guardian|date=10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video was also discovered, showing a crowded Christmas market in Strasbourg, with a voiceover in [[Arabic]] calling the people in the video "enemies of Allah."&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jail for Strasbourg bomb plotters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4102023.stm|work=BBC News|date=16 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voiceover, attributed to one of the suspects, further said "This cathedral is Allah's enemy," and "You will go to hell, Allah willing."&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; The call that had alerted British intelligence had been made by one in the group asking Abu Doha, the alleged mastermind of the plot, for more cash; Doha was already wanted by the [[United States]] for his connection to the [[2000 millennium attack plots#LAX bombing plot|Los Angeles International Airport millennium bombing plot]].&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt;

Members of the Frankfurt group were found to have trained in al-Qaeda camps in [[Afghanistan]], to have connections to Islamist networks in [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and the United Kingdom, and to the [[Algeria]]n terrorist group [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (GSPC).&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The discovery of the plot in Frankfurt led to further arrests in the United Kingdom, where another plot of killing members of the [[European Parliament]] was discovered, in which [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] were to be killed with [[sarin]] [[Nerve agent|nerve gas]] during session in Strasbourg in February 2001.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bin Laden British cell planned gas attack on EU Parliament|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1340692/Bin-Laden-British-cell-planned-gas-attack-on-EU-Parliament.html|work=The Telegraph|date=16 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; British police arrested twelve people including Doha in February 2001 as a result of the Frankfurt operation.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; All British suspects were quickly released due to "lack of evidence," although Doha was subsequently re-arrested.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; According to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], the charges against six main suspects were dropped for "security reasons," which was linked by others to an [[MI5]] bid to "monitor" the group.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

The '''Summer Jam at Watkins Glen''' was a 1973 [[rock festival]] which once received the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] entry for "Largest audience at a pop festival."  An estimated 600,000 rock fans came to the [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen Grand Prix Raceway]] outside [[Watkins Glen, New York]] on July 28, 1973, to see the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[The Band]] perform.

==History==
The concert was produced by [[Shelly Finkel]] and [[Jim Koplik]], two promoters who previously organized a successful Grateful Dead concert at [[Dillon Stadium]], [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], in 1972.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3S0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=grateful+dead+shelly+finkel+dillon+stadium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1-wqtI6Ep&amp;sig=LhuH9_6QFAG3NLZoT_3L8RDjWSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih-5CWhujQAhXG7SYKHYbBATkQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=grateful%20dead%20shelly%20finkel%20dillon%20stadium&amp;f=false|title=This Is All a Dream We Dreamed: An Oral History of the Grateful Dead|last=Jackson|first=Blair|last2=Gans|first2=David|date=2015-11-10|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781250058560|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Dillon Stadium concert, the Grateful Dead were joined on-stage by Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, and Jai Johanny Johanson, members of The Allman Brothers Band.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This impromptu jam planted the seeds that would eventually spawn the "Summer Jam" concert in Watkins Glen, NY.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similar to the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], an enormous [[traffic jam]] created chaos for those who attempted to make it to the concert site. Long and narrow country roads forced fans to abandon their vehicles and walk 5–8 miles on that hot summer day. 150,000 tickets were sold for [[United States dollar|$]]10 each, but for all the other people it was a free concert. The crowd was so huge that most of the audience was not able to see the stage. However the sound from the stage speakers was doubled 200 feet from the stage by four delay towers, towers with speakers wired to the stage amps but with a 0.175 second delay built in, so that by the time the sound from the stage speakers reaches the tower area through the air, the sound from the delay towers will be synchronized with the stage sound. There were six more delay towers arranged radially 200 feet further from those towers - 400 feet from the stage - and six more towers 200 feet further out. Sixteen delay towers in all, plus the main PA. They were driven by about 24,000 watts of power.

Although the concert was scheduled to start on July 28, thousands of music fans were already at the concert site on the 27th.  [[Robbie Robertson]] of The Band requested to do a [[soundcheck]], but was perplexed that so many people were sitting in front of the stage. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] allowed the soundcheck with the crowd of people in front, and The Band ran through a few numbers to the delight of the audience. The Allman Brothers Band did their soundcheck next, playing "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]" and "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]". The Grateful Dead's legendary soundcheck turned into a two set marathon, featuring their familiar tunes such as "[[Sugaree]]", "Tennessee Jed" and "Wharf Rat". They also performed a unique jam that was eventually included on their retrospective CD box set ''[[So Many Roads (1965-1995)]]''.

On July 28, the day of the concert, 600,000 music fans had arrived in Watkins Glen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jambase.com/article/600000-people-see-grateful-dead-allmans-band-summer-jam-watkins-glen-1973|title=600,000 People See Grateful Dead, Allmans &amp; The Band At Summer Jam At Watkins Glen In 1973|date=2016-07-28|newspaper=JamBase|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grateful Dead performed first, playing two long sets. They opened with "Bertha" and played many hits such as "[[Box Of Rain]]", "[[Jack Straw (song)|Jack Straw"]], "[[Playing in the Band]]", "[[China Cat Sunflower]]" and "Eyes of the World".

The Band followed the Dead with one two-hour set. However, their set was cut in half by a drenching thunderstorm, in a scene again reminiscent of Woodstock, people were covered with mud. During the storm, keyboardist [[Garth Hudson]] performed his signature organ improvisation "The Genetic Method"; when the rain finally let up, the full Band joined Hudson on stage, and segued into their signature song "Chest Fever", in a manner similar to how the songs were presented on The Band's live album ''[[Rock of Ages (album)|Rock of Ages]]''.

Finally, the Allman Brothers Band performed for three hours. Their performance included songs from their soon-to-be-released album ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', along with their standards "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", "[[Statesboro Blues]]", "Les Brers in A Minor" and "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]".

Following the Allmans' second set, there was an hour encore jam featuring musicians from all three bands. The jam featured spirited renditions of "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]", "[[Mountain Jam]]", and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]".

Although there were no reports of violence at Watkins Glen, the day was marred by the death of Willard Smith, 35, a [[skydiver]] from [[Syracuse, New York]]. Smith dived from an airplane carrying [[flare]]s.  One of the flares ignited his body suit, and he was engulfed in flames. Smith's body was eventually found in the woods near the concert site. There is also the unsolved disappearance of two high school teenagers (Mitchel Weiser and Bonnie Bickwit) from Brooklyn who were hitchhiking to the concert.

{{quote|Many historians claimed that the Watkins Glen event was the largest gathering of people in the history of the United States. In essence, that meant that on July 28, one out of every 350 people living in America at the time was listening to the sounds of rock at the New York state racetrack. Considering that most of those who attended the event hailed from the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]], and that the average age of those present was approximately seventeen to twenty-four, close to one out of every three young people from [[Boston]] to [[New York City|New York]] was at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronos-historical.org/rockfest/articles/WG1.html|title=Excerpt from "AQUARIUS RISING" by Robert Santelli|author=|date=|website=chronos-historical.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Summer Jam was the last concert event to be held at Watkins Glen International until 2011, when the rock band [[Phish]] organized and performed at a three day festival, called Super Ball IX, at the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phish announces Super Ball IX to take place July 1-3 at Watkins Glen International |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/03/phish-annouce-super-ball-ix-to-take-place-july-1-3-at-watkins-glen-international.html |website=LA Times Blogs - Pop &amp; Hiss |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following quote is from the liner notes, "Chuck Berry's Going Back To Memphis, on the other hand, was completed and ready for inclusion on the album ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'' but ended up being shelved in favor of Promised Land. This version has been released before complete with overdubbed audience sounds as the opening track on the fraudulent ''[[Live at Watkins Glen]]'' CD. No one in The Band was connected with that particular release which had been originally mastered sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, although not released until 1995. The outtake of Endless Highway included here, which was recorded sometime between ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'' and ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'', was similarly included on the Watkins Glen CD with overdubbed audience."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5924">[[File:Wien - Volksoper.JPG|thumb|Vienna People's Opera]]
The '''Vienna Volksoper''' ('''''Volksoper Wien''''' or ''Vienna People's Opera'') is a major [[opera house]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It puts on around three hundred  performances of twenty-five German language productions during an annual season which runs from September through June.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
[[File:Kaiserjubilaeumsstadttheater leipziger illustrierte.jpg|thumb|Xylography published 19. January 1899 in "Leipziger Illustrierte"]]
It was built in 1898 as the ''Kaiser-Jubiläums-Stadttheater'' (Kaiser's Jubilee Civic Theatre), originally producing only  [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Because of the very brief construction period (10 months) the first director Adam Müller-Gutenbrunn had to start with debts of 160,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. After this inauspicious startup the ''Kaiser-Jubiläums-Stadttheater'' had to declare bankruptcy five years later in 1903.

=== Music Theater from 1903 to 1950s ===
On 1 September 1903 Rainer Simons took over the house and renamed it the ''Kaiser-Jubiläums-Stadttheater - Volksoper'' (public opera). His intention was to continue the production of plays but also establish series of opera and operetta. The first Viennese performances of ''[[Tosca]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' were given at the Volksoper in 1907 and 1910 respectively.  World famous singers such as [[Maria Jeritza]], [[Leo Slezak]] and [[Richard Tauber]] appeared there; the conductor [[Alexander Zemlinsky]] became the first bandmaster in 1906.

In the years up to and through the [[First World War]] the Volksoper attained a position as Vienna's second prestige opera house.  In 1919, [[Felix Weingartner]] became Artistic Director and Principal Conductor. He was followed as Director by [[Hugo Gruder-Guntram]]. After 1929, it focused on light opera, and under Gruder-Guntram undertook a number of summer tours to [[Abbazia]] in 1935, Cairo and Alexandria in 1937 and throughout Italy in 1938, with guest appearances from [[Richard Tauber]].  After the [[Second World War]], the Vienna Volksoper became the alternative venue to the devastated [[Vienna State Opera]].  In 1955 the Volksoper returned to its former role of presenting  opera, operetta, and musicals.

=== Recent history ===
From September 1991 to June 1996 the Vienna Volksoper was under a collective leadership with the [[Vienna State Opera]]. In 1999 the Volksoper became a 100% subsidiary of the Bundestheater-Holding.
Since 1 September 2007 Robert Meyer has headed the Volksoper as artistic director together with the business manager Christoph Ladstätter.
Each season includes about 25 productions, a total of approximately 300 performances—a performance almost every day.  In addition to opera, operetta, musicals and ballet, there are special performances and children's programs.

== Facts and figures ==
=== Seating ===

=== Technical Data ===
The orchestra pit is equipped with two electrically driven stage lifts, with a loading capacity of 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m². It is adjustable in height from 0 to 2.65 meters below stage level.

The red velvet house curtain is hydraulically drawn and liftable. The gather velocity is 0.15 to 3.0&amp;nbsp;m/s, the lift velocity can be up to 2.0&amp;nbsp;m/s.

The stage is 17.2 meters wide and 19 meters deep and has a mechanic load capacity of 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m². In the middle of the stage is a turnable and liftable circular platform, around which is a turnable ring platform with an external diameter of 15 meters. There are also 3 hand-operated person trap mechanisms.

=== Organisational structure ===
Since 1999 the Volksoper Vienna is a 100% subsidiary of the Bundestheater Holding AG (Federal theater holding AG) along with the [[Vienna State Opera]] and the [[Burgtheater]] ([[English language|en]]: (Imperial) Court Theatre). The Bundestheater Holding AG is owned by the Republic of Austria.
The Holding also holds 51.1% of the Theaterservice Gmbh, which offers services in design and administrational matters. The remaining 48.9% are shared equally among the three theater houses (16.3% each).

==In popular culture==
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
In 1987, the opera house was used for a scene set in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now part of [[Slovakia]]), for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', where [[Timothy Dalton]] made his debut as Bond near the very beginning of the film, where he first spotted the key female character [[Kara Milovy]] (played by [[Maryam d'Abo]]).

The '''Vores Compact Touring Series''' was established in late 2011 when the CRA ([[Champion Racing Association]]) decided to drop its compact division. The first race held was in late 2011, it was an exhibition race at [[Eldora Speedway]] in Rossburg, Ohio.

2012 was the inaugural year for VCTS. All but one of the races held that year were held at the [[Winchester Speedway]], the other being [[Eldora Speedway]]. Ryan Hoffman of Northwestern Indiana was the series' first champion.

2013 would be the second year of the Vores Compact Touring Series. The series would expand its venues to five tracks in 2013: [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis]], Winchester Speedway, Baer Field Speedway, Shadybowl Speedway and Gas City I-69 Speedway. Chris Jennings of Indiana would be the 2013 series champion.

2014 marks VCTS's third year of competition. VCTS would expand this year and have a Northern and Southern tour along with "Challenge Series" weekends were the North and South would meet at the same venue. VCTS would have 12 different tracks scheduled for 2014. Gary Eaton, Jr. of Ohio would claim the VCTS South championship.  Mike Richardson of Valparaiso, Indiana would be the North series champion.  And Todd Metz, Jr. won the Challenge Series title.

Steve Vore of Vores Welding &amp; Steel in Fort Recovery, Ohio is the series founder. VCTS South Series Director is Dan Redmond.

'''Winter formal''', also called '''Winterfest''', '''Winter Ball''', '''Sweethearts''', '''Christmas Ball''', '''Snow Ball''', '''Queen of Hearts Dance''', or simply '''Formal''', is a [[Dance party|dance]] held by [[high school]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It takes place between [[homecoming]] and [[prom]], usually between December and March. At some schools, this dance may supplement or replace a [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]. 

It has many of the same characteristics as a prom with a [[Musical ensemble|band]] to play music and [[catering]] service.

This dance is often provided to high school students as a school-sponsored event for the long period between Homecoming in Autumn and prom in May. The influence of Christmas or New Year's Eve formal events and [[Valentine's Day]] may pique students' interest in holding their "own" dance during this time.   

It is thought in some cases as a "pre-prom" dance, and is often not held at the school if the school can afford to hold it elsewhere. It might be held at a catering hall or ballroom facility.

Mormal is the equivalent of winter formal or [[prom]] for youth in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] or Mormon Church ("Mormal" is the Mormon formal).{{cn|date=April 2018}}  It does not necessarily replace formal at school. This event is most common in California.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''World Youth Day 1989''' was an event organized by the [[Catholic Church]] and took place on August 19-20, 1989 in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/es/speeches/1989/august/documents/hf_jp_spe_19890819_welcome-santiago.html vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Europe|European]] edition of this bi-tri-ennal event, excluding the two "zero editions" held in [[Rome]] in [[World Youth Day 1984|1984]] and [[World Youth Day 1985|1985]], and the first time the meeting did not take place on [[Palm Sunday]], but in the middle of [[Summer|summer]].

==Programming==
===Logo===
The logo chosen for the [[World Youth Day|WYD]] of Santiago consists of a blue circle surrounded by the words "I am the way, the truth and the life". The circle is crossed by a yellow stripe covered with shells that ends, at the top right, with a star. The latter is a reference to the legend concerning the discovery of the tomb of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]; the yellow trail simultaneously represents the "tail" of the shooting star, both the streets of the Camino de Santiago, while the [[Seashell|
shells]] are the symbol of the [[Pilgrimage|pilgrim]].

===The anthem===
The hymn composed for the Santiago WYD is titled "Somos los jovens of 2000".

==Procedure==
Many WYD participants reached the event venue by walking hundreds of kilometers along the [[Camino de Santiago]] - famous way of medieval pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Saint James.

For the first time in Santiago the catecheses were organized (which took place on August 19), on the themes "[[Jesus|Christ]] is the Way", " Christ is the Truth", " Christ is the Life", inspired by the verse of the [[Gospel of John]] (John 14,6) chosen as the theme for that edition. Among those responsible for catechesis, [[Chiara Lubich]] (founder of the [[Focolare Movement]]), [[Carlo Maria Martini]] (then [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]]), Massimo Camisasca and [[Antonio Lanfranchi]].

The closing vigil, with the presence of Pope John Paul II, was held at the [[Monte do Gozo]] - hill located about five kilometers from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/es/homilies/1989/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19890820_gmg.html vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt;In that place was later raised a monument in memory of both the [[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II outside Italy|papal visit]] and the arrival in the city of St. [[Francis of Assisi]], which took place in the [[13th century|thirteenth century]].

There were a public of 600,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;[Source [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]], reported in the Revolution in a Day, Pino Vicentini, [[Avvenire]], Friday 11 August 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;
