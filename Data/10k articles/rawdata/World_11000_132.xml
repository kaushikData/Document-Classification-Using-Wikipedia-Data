      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2352">The '''African Social Forum''' is an [[Africa]]n social movement opposed to [[neo-liberal]] economic policies in Africa and what they see as the exploitation of the African continent in a framework of neo-liberal [[globalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africansocialforum.org/english/charter.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the African Social Forum originated at the World Social Forum in [[Porto Alegre]] ([[Brazil]]) from 25 to January 30, 2001, upon the recognition that of the 14,000 representatives, only 50 were from Africa. The first Forum was held in 2002 in [[Bamako, Mali]], with 45 countries represented. The Bamako Declaration approved at the 2002 forum include the following:

''A strong consensus emerged at the Bamako Forum that the values, practices, structures and institutions of the currently dominant neo-liberal order are inimical to and incompatible with the realization of Africa's dignity, values, and aspirations... &lt;br&gt;
The Forum demands of its political leaders that they do not further inflict on Africa the unjust system of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions in the name of financing Africa's development''.” &lt;ref&gt;African Social Forum: The Bamako Declaration, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto of the African Social Forum, adopted from the [[World Social Forum|WSF]], is "Another Africa is possible".

==Aims==
The aims of the movement as listed on their website are as follows:
* To consolidate the capacities of analysis, proposal and mobilization of the organizations of the African social movement so that they can fully play their part in Africa and within the world social movement,
* To build an African space of concerted development of alternatives to néo-liberal globalization, starting from a diagnosis of its social, economic and political effects,
* To define strategies of social, economic and political rebuilding, including a redefinition of the role of the State, market and organizations citizens,
* To define the methods of control citizen so that political alternation supports the expression and the implementation of alternative answers, credible and viable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africansocialforum.org/english/forum.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Alltid sommer"''' ("Always Summer", English title: "'''All I Ever Wanted (Was You)'''") was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]], performed in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] by [[Lars A. Fredriksen|Lars Fredriksen]].

The song is an up-tempo number, with Fredriksen telling his lover what a change she has made in his life. He likens this change to the arrival of a perpetual summer, and tells her that "you won my life".

The song was performed twenty-second on the night, following [[Finland]]'s [[Edea (musical group)|Edea]] with "[[Aava]]" and preceding [[Estonia]]'s [[Koit Toome]] with "[[Mere lapsed]]". At the close of voting, it had received 79 points, placing 8th in a field of 25.

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]] by [[Stig Van Eijk|Van Eijk]] with "[[Living My Life Without You]]".

The '''Centre for Polar Observation &amp; Modelling''' ('''CPOM''') is a centre for research into [[polar region]] processes which may affect: polar atmosphere and [[ocean circulation]]; the Earth's [[albedo]]; and global [[sea levels]]. It is funded by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], a UK [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]].&lt;ref name=CPOM&gt;[http://www.cpom.org/ CPOM Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

CPOM comprises research groups from 3 Universities: [[University College London]], [[University of Bristol]], and [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="CPOM"/&gt;

In 2006, research carried out by CPOM resulted in the press report "Secret rivers found in Antarctic".  The survey used the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[ERS-2]] satellite radar to measure a region in [[East Antarctica]] with some of the oldest, thickest ice on the continent. The survey revealed synchronous changes in ice surface height (both rise and falls) at locations hundreds of kilometres apart. According to CPOM Director, [[Duncan Wingham]], the only conceivable mechanism for the observations was the movement of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm |author= Helen Briggs |title= Secret rivers found in Antarctic |publisher= BBC News |date= 19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil''' ({{lang-la|Archieparchia Arbilensis Chaldaeorum}}, {{lang-ar|إيبارشية أربيل الكلدانية}}) is a [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]] [[diocese]] with its seat in [[Erbil]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Erected in 1968 with territory taken from the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Kirkuk|Archeparchy of Kirkuk]], it is immediately subject to the [[Chaldean Catholic Patriarchate of Babylon|Patriarchal See of Babylon]]. The see of the archbishop is the [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Ankawa|Cathedral of St. Joseph (Mar Yousif)]] in [[Ankawa]], a suburb of Erbil.

Under Archbishop [[Bashar Warda]], the archdiocese expanded its activity by creating the [[Catholic University in Erbil]] and several youth and healthcare agencies. In particular, the Archdiocese took a leading role in the care of Christians displaced from [[Mosul]] and the [[Nineveh plains]] after the [[ISIS]] invasion of those areas in 2014.  During this period, Ankawa and Erbil became the center of [[Christianity in Iraq]].

== History ==
Christaller noted that many German Basel missionaries were not proficient in the English language and urged prospective writers to make use of English scholars for further review and proofreading before final submission to him, the editor, as he was not a native English speaker.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A few months before, in a letter to the editor from Christiansborg dated 13 October 1882, the first Basel missionary-trader Hermann Ludwig Rottman inferred that "t''he primary aim of the journal was to encourage people who were not proficient in English to write in Twi or Ga''"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A similar news publication, t''he Christian Messenger and Examiner'' had earlier been founded in 1859 by Wesleyan missionaries, [[Thomas Birch Freeman]] and Henry Wharton as a medium to translate foreign literature and classical works into native African languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Originally,  the medium of publication was English, Ga and Twi.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The newspaper temporarily changed its name to the "Christian Reporter" and published solely in Twi while the "Christian Messenger" was printed in Ga.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subscription climbed to a readership of 600 but sharply decreased over time. After Christaller's death in 1895, the printing of the newspaper ceased. Production started again in 1905 at then newly established Basel Mission Printing Office in Akropong.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The newspaper has opinion pieces, news bulletins, advertisements, [[banns of marriage]] and [[Obituary|obituaries]] and funeral announcements of notable individuals associated with the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The newspaper also publishes feature articles on topical issues like ''Fruit of the Spirit'', etc. and publishes authoritative information on the various groups in the Church such as the Women's Fellowship, the Young People's Guild (YPG) and the Young Adult Fellowship (YAF).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The administration of the church appoints an [[editor-in-chief]] for a tenure of about four years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; General oversight and management of the newspaper is carried out by an [[Editorial board|Editorial Board]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Basel Mission|Basel Missionaries]] originally established the newspaper as a way “''to inform, educate, evangelize and entertain its readers... to the north, east, west and south''” corners of the Church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Basel Mission]] under the United Trading Company (UTC) aimed to win over converts to [[Christianity]] through its readership, in addition to provision of Christian activities, general news, entertainment, travel journals as well as relevant political events and on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This was in line with the original aim of the newspaper which was ''"to encourage African scholars to write in Twi and Ga."''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The newspaper also informs readers about the developments within the church, its structure and hierarchy, Presbyterian terminologies as well as the work of the Presbyteries, Districts, Congregations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Today, the newspaper also covers socioeconomic, political trends, military history and contemporary changes in global society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Penang''' was a British [[Crown colony]] from 1946 to 1957.

'''''Dans le silence, je sens rouler la terre''''' is a 2010 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
In 1939, the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] forced thousands of men, women and children to flee [[Francoist Spain]]. The French administration in [[Algeria]] opened refugee camps to take them in. Seventy years later, a young Algerian investigates the past. Despite the absence of archives and files, the traces of these camps have survived the collective oblivion and still appear in current Algeria.

'''ECEF''' (acronym for ''earth-centered, earth-fixed''), also known as '''ECR''' (initialism for ''earth-centered rotational''), is a [[geographic coordinate system|geographic]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and is sometimes known as a "conventional terrestrial" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Leick |year=2004 |title=GPS Satellite Surveying |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents positions as X, Y, and Z coordinates. The point (0, 0, 0) is defined as the [[center of mass]] of [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earth Coordinates |first=James R. |last=Clynch |date=February 2006 |url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/clynch_pdfs/coorddef.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418092513/http://www.sage.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/clynch_pdfs/coorddef.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the term '''geocentric coordinates'''. 

Its axes are aligned with the [[international reference pole]] (IRP) and [[IERS Reference Meridian|international reference meridian]] (IRM) that are fixed with respect to Earth's surface,&lt;ref name=ReferenceFrames&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231431/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84C_3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718215214/http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84C_3D |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the descriptor ''earth-fixed''. This term can cause confusion, since Earth does not [[Earth's rotation|rotate]] about the z-axis (unlike an inertial system such as [[earth-centered inertial|ECI]]), and is therefore alternatively called ECR.

The z-axis extends through [[true north]], which does not coincide with the instantaneous Earth rotational axis.&lt;ref name=ReferenceFrames/&gt; The slight "wobbling" of the rotational axis is known as [[polar motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_10398/IERS/EN/Science/EarthRotation/PolarMotion.html?__nnn=true |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613193953/http://www.iers.org/nn_10398/IERS/EN/Science/EarthRotation/PolarMotion.html?__nnn=true |archivedate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The x-axis intersects the sphere of the earth at 0° [[latitude]] ([[the equator]]) and 0° [[longitude]] ([[prime meridian]] in Greenwich). This means that ECEF rotates with the earth, and therefore coordinates of a point fixed on the surface of the earth do not change. Conversion from a [[WGS84]] datum to ECEF can be used as an intermediate step in converting velocities to the [[north east down]] coordinate system.

Conversions between ECEF and geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are discussed at [[geographic coordinate conversion]].

==In astronomy==
Geocentric coordinates can be used for locating [[astronomical object]]s in the [[Solar System]] in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes]]. They are differentiated from [[topocentric coordinates]], which use the observer's location as the reference point for bearings in [[altitude]] and [[azimuth]]. However, neither system takes Earth's constant motion into account, which requires the addition of a [[time]] component to [[position fixing|fix]] objects.

For [[nearby stars]], astronomers use [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] coordinates, with the center of the [[Sun]] as the origin. The [[plane of reference]] can be aligned with the Earth's [[celestial equator]], the [[ecliptic]], or the [[Milky Way]]'s [[galactic equator]]. These 3D [[celestial coordinate system]]s add actual distance as the Z axis to the [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial]], [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]], and [[galactic coordinate system]]s used in [[spherical astronomy]].

The distances involved are so great compared to the relative velocities of the stars, that for most purposes, the time component can be neglected.

{{short description|A situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms}}
'''Ecological collapse''' refers to a situation where an [[ecosystem]] suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in [[carrying capacity]] for all organisms, often resulting in [[mass extinction]]. Usually, an ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale. Ecological collapse can be considered as a consequence of [[ecosystem collapse]] on the biotic elements that depended on the original ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sato |first1=Chloe F. |last2=Lindenmayer |first2=David B. |title=Meeting the Global Ecosystem Collapse Challenge |journal=Conservation Letters |date=2018 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=e12348 |doi=10.1111/conl.12348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bland |first1=L. |last2=Rowland |first2=J. |last3=Regan |first3=T. |last4=Keith |first4=D. |last5=Murray |first5=N. |last6=Lester |first6=R. |last7=Linn |first7=M. |last8=Rodríguez |first8=J.P. |last9=Nicholson |first9=E. |title=Developing a standarized definition of ecosystem collapse for risk assessment |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=2018 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=29–36 |doi=10.1002/fee.1747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors—the toxicity of the introduced element and the [[ecological resilience|resiliency of the original ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="Basic Civil Engineering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopi|title=Basic Civil Engineering|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|location=India|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through natural selection the planet's species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different biological factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors.&lt;ref name="Basic Civil Engineering"/&gt;

Scientists can predict tipping points for ecological collapse. The most frequently used model for predicting [[food web]] collapse is called R50, which is a reliable measurement model for food web robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The reliability of R50 as a measure of vulnerability of food webs to sequential species deletions|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.01588/abstract|journal = Oikos|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1600-0706|pages = 446–457|volume = 124|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/oik.01588|first = Tomas|last = Jonsson|first2 = Sofia|last2 = Berg|first3 = Alexander|last3 = Pimenov|first4 = Catherine|last4 = Palmer|first5 = Mark|last5 = Emmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and examples==
Although, there is no single cause for ecological collapse,  attributing factors include [[asteroid impact]]s, [[Large igneous province|extremely large volcanic eruptions]], and [[abrupt climate change]]. The snowball effect of these attributing factors and ecological collapse are demonstrated within the [[fossil record]]. [[Prehistoric]] examples include the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]], the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], and other [[mass extinctions]]. For example, effects of [[climate change]] as a contributing factor towards ecological collapse are demonstrated in the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC Nature|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Ordovician-Silurian_extinction_event|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible cause of the Ordovician Extinction was global cooling which affected the habitats of marine life. Consequently, sea creatures such as trilobites, brachiopods, and graptolites became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC Nature|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Ordovician%25E2%2580%2593Silurian_extinction_event|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Karabonov and colleagues conducted a study to show how during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM), alternations in the environment and climate led to ecological collapse in [[Lake Baikal]] and [[Lake Hovsgol]] which then led to species evolution in these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecological collapse of Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol ecosystems during the Last Glacial and consequences for aquatic species diversity|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099|journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date = 2004-07-06|pages = 227–243|volume = 209|series = High Latitude Eurasian Palaeoenvironments|issue = 1–4|doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.02.017|first = Eugene|last = Karabanov|first2 = Douglas|last2 = Williams|first3 = Mikhail|last3 = Kuzmin|first4 = Valentina|last4 = Sideleva|first5 = Galina|last5 = Khursevich|first6 = Alexander|last6 = Prokopenko|first7 = Emilia|last7 = Solotchina|first8 = Lilia|last8 = Tkachenko|first9 = Svetlana|last9 = Fedenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of Hovsgol's ecosystem during the LGM brought forth a new ecosystem, with limited biodiversity in species and low levels of [[endemism]], in Hovsgol during the Holocene. Karabonov's study also shows that ecological collapse during LGM in Lake Hovsgol led to higher levels of diversity and higher levels of endemism as a byproduct of evolution following the ecological collapse of the LGM. The Ordovician Extinction event and Lake Baikal and Hovsgol demonstrate two effects of ecological collapse on prehistoric environments.

Historic examples include the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of the Grand Banks cod]] in the early 1990s, attributed to [[overfishing]].

Important pressures contributing to current and future ecological collapse include [[habitat loss]], [[habitat degradation|degradation]], and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], overgrazing, [[overexploitation]] of ecosystems by humans, human industrial growth and overpopulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Overpopulation and Ecosystem Collapse {{!}} EcoInternet - Earth Blog|url = http://ecointernet.org/2014/05/17/on-overpopulation-and-ecosystem-collapse/|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]],[[ocean acidification]], [[pollution]], and [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Living Planet Report|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainforest collapse==
Rainforest collapse refers to the actual past and theoretical future ecological collapse of [[rainforest]]s. It may involve [[habitat fragmentation]] to the point where little rainforest [[biome]] is left, and rainforest species only survive in isolated refugia. Habitat fragmentation can be caused by roads. When humans start to cut down the trees for logging, secondary roads are created that will go unused after its primary use. Once abandoned, the plants of the rainforest will find it difficult to grow back in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Legacy of logging roads in the Congo Basin: How persistent are the scars in forest cover?|url = http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00488.1|journal = Ecosphere|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 2150-8925|pages = art64|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1890/ES14-00488.1|first = Fritz|last = Kleinschroth|first2 = Sylvie|last2 = Gourlet-Fleury|first3 = Plinio|last3 = Sist|first4 = Fréderic|last4 = Mortier|first5 = John R.|last5 = Healey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest fragmentation also opens the path for illegal hunting. Species have a hard time finding a new place to settle in these fragments causing ecological collapse. This leads to extinction of many animals in the rainforest.

=== Carboniferous period ===
{{Main article|Carboniferous rainforest collapse}}

In the [[Carboniferous]] period, [[coal forest]]s, great [[tropical wetland]]s, extended over much of Euramerica (Europe and America). This land supported towering [[lycopsid]]s which fragmented and collapsed abruptly.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the rainforests during the [[Carboniferous]] has been attributed to [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse#Possible causes|multiple causes]], including [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Fielding, C.R. |author2=Frank, T.D. |author3=Birgenheier, L.P. |author4=Rygel, M.C. |author5=Jones, A.T. |author6=and Roberts, J. | year=2008 | title=Stratigraphic imprint of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age in eastern Australia: A record of alternating glacial and nonglacial climate regime | journal=Geological Society of London Journal | volume =  165| pages = 129–140 | doi=10.1144/0016-76492007-036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. This sudden collapse affected several large groups including lycopsids and amphibians. Reptiles prospered in the new environment due to adaptations that let them thrive in drier conditions.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fishbone pattern of rainforest fragmentation]]

== Today ==
A classic pattern of [[forest fragmentation]] is occurring in many [[rainforest]]s including those of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]], specifically a 'fishbone' pattern formed by the development of roads into the forest. This is of great concern, not only because of the loss of a [[biome]] with many untapped resources and wholesale death of living organisms, but also because plant and animal species extinction is known to correlate with habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space &amp; time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Overgrazing]] was found to cause [[land degradation]], specifically in Southern Europe, which is another driver of ecological collapse and natural landscape loss. Proper management of pastoral landscapes can mitigate risk of desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploring the Impact of Overgrazing on Soil Erosion and Land Degradation in a Dry Mediterranean Agro-Forest Landscape (Crete, Greece)|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2014.968691|journal = Arid Land Research and Management|date = 2015-07-03|issn = 1532-4982|pages = 360–374|volume = 29|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/15324982.2014.968691|first = Orestis|last = Kairis|first2 = Christos|last2 = Karavitis|first3 = Luca|last3 = Salvati|first4 = Aikaterini|last4 = Kounalaki|first5 = Kostas|last5 = Kosmas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 roughly 170 million gallons of oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico when BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. The effects of the BP oil spill are still being felt today, more than 8,000 marine birds, sea turtles and marine mammals were found dead or injured within months of the clean up effort. The impact of this disaster has unbalanced the food web of the environment. The oil spill occurred at the height of breeding season and as result affected egg and larval animals to the worst extent wiping entire age classes. This loss of a generation down the line will prove dire for future predators of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Protect-Habitat/Gulf-Restoration/Oil-Spill/Effects-on-Wildlife.aspx|title = How Does the BP Oil Spill Impact Wildlife and Habitat?|date = 2015-10-28|accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = National Wildlife Federation|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a major concern for marine biologists is the effects of ecological collapse on the coral reefs (who based on fossil evidence are more vulnerable to extinction but also demonstrate greater resilience&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The future of coral reefs|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5419|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2001-05-08|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 33228|pmid = 11344288|pages = 5419–5425|volume = 98|issue = 10|doi = 10.1073/pnas.091092998|first = Nancy|last = Knowlton}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An effect of global climate change is the rising sea levels which can lead to reef drowing or [[coral bleaching]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Human activity, such as fishing, mining, deforestation, etc., serves as a threat for coral reefs by affecting the niche of the coral reefs. For example, Edinger and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reef degradation and coral biodiversity in indonesia: Effects of land-based pollution, destructive fishing practices and changes over time|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X98000472|journal = Marine Pollution Bulletin|date = 1998-08-01|pages = 617–630|volume = 36|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/S0025-326X(98)00047-2|first = Evan N|last = Edinger|first2 = Jamaluddin|last2 = Jompa|first3 = Gino V|last3 = Limmon|first4 = Wisnu|last4 = Widjatmoko|first5 = Michael J|last5 = Risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate a correlation between a loss in diversity of coral reefs by 30-60% and human activity such as sewage and/or industrial pollution.

The ocean is in great danger of collapse. In a study of 154 different marine fish species, David Byler found out that many factors such as overfishing, climate change, and fast growth of fish populations will cause ecosystem collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fishing, fast growth and climate variability increase the risk of collapse|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151053|journal = Proc. R. Soc. B|date = 2015-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmid = 26246548|pages = 20151053|volume = 282|issue = 1813|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.1053|first = Malin L.|last = Pinsky|first2 = David|last2 = Byler|pmc=4632620}}&lt;/ref&gt; When humans fish, they usually will fish the populations of the higher trophic levels such as salmon and tuna. The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen(DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.

Although global climate change and human dominance are inevitable, humans can institute greater self-awareness in order to aid the habits of creatures such as coral reefs.

Some scientists predict that a global ecological collapse will occur after 50% of the natural landscape is gone due to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Fear Global Ecological Collapse Once 50% of the Natural Landscape is Gone|url = http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/scientists-fear-global-ecological-collapse-once-50-natural-landscape-gone.html|website = TreeHugger|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Although the causes of ecological collapse are due to factors unique to their environment, they all for the most part share similar ramifications such as loss in biodiversity, trophic cascades, and even extinction. For example, the urbanization and deforestation of the South east Asian Pacific has led to the extinction of three plant species and eight animal species in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sodhi, Koh, Brook, Ng|first1=Navjot, Lian, Barry, Peter|title=Southeast Asian Biodiversity and impending disaster|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=December 2004|volume=19|issue=12|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.09.006|pages=654–660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America''' (commonly known as the '''Suomi Synod''') was a Lutheran church body which existed in the United States from 1890 until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Du-Ha/Finnish-Americans.html|title=    Finnish Americans|publisher=  Advameg, Inc.|author=      Marianne Wargelin |accessdate= April 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America  (FELC) was organized at [[Calumet, Michigan]] in 1890. FELC was defined more by its [[Ethnic Finn|Finnish]] ethnic origin than by any specific theological strain. In 1896, the church established Suomi College and Theological Seminary (now called [[Finlandia University]]) in [[Hancock, Michigan]]. It is the only private institution of higher learning in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and the only remaining university in North America founded by Finnish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlandia.edu/our-finnish-founders-history-and-heritage.html|title = Suomi College Finnish Heritage|publisher =  Finlandia University|accessdate= April 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FELC was one of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church bodies that merged into the [[Lutheran Church in America]] (LCA) in 1962. At that time, FELC had 36,274 members and 105 ministers in 153 congregations, and was the smallest of LCA's founding church bodies.&lt;ref name=ARDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church (Suomi Synod)|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_903.asp|work=American Denomination Profiles|publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]]|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCA was subsequently party to the merger that created the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=f&amp;word=FINNISHLUTHERANSINAMERICA|title= Finnish Lutherans in America.|publisher= Concordia Publishing House|accessdate= April 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1147">The '''Kolokuma tribe''' of the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people live along the Nun River in [[Bayelsa State]], [[Nigeria]]. Kolokuma settlements include: Seibokorogha (Sabagreia), Odi, Okoloba, Igbedi and Kaiama. The geographic position of the Kolokuma clan caused them to interact with neighboring peoples including the [[Mein tribe|Mein]], [[Tarakiri West|Western Tarakiri]], [[Isoko people|Isoko]], and [[Ndokwa]] [[Igbo people|Igbo]]. Also, wars were fought between the Kolokuma and the [[Boma tribe|Boma]] and [[Oyakiri tribe|Oyakiri]] tribes in the distant past. Egbesu is the tribal god of the Kolokuma. Historically, the tribe came under the central authority of the high priest of [[Egbesu cult|Egbesu]].&lt;ref&gt;Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe, Ikidi Dengiyefa Emmanuel.(2005). ''A History of the Niger Delta'', Port Harcourt: Onyoma Research Publications. {{ISBN|978-37314-5-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kolokuma people speak the [[Izon language]]. They are predominantly farmers and fishermen. The freedom fighter Major [[Adaka Boro]] was from the Kolokuma tribe.

The '''Mahi''' are a people of [[Benin]]. They live north of [[Abomey]], from the Togo border on the west to the [[Zou River]] on the east, and south to [[Cové]] between the Zou and [[Ouemé]] rivers, north of the Dassa hills.  

The Mahi established their own kingdom before 1800 years ago, and were a target of the Slave trade before French colonization at the end of the 19th century.

'''NSRD''' or '''Nebijušu Sajūtu Restaurēšanas Darbnīca''' (Latvian for "Workshop for the Restoration of Unfelt Feelings") was a [[Latvia|Latvian]] musical group who also greatly influenced [[New media art|multimedia art]] in their country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973024306|title=Workshop for the restoration of unfelt feelings = Nebijušu sajūtu restaurēšanas darbnīca|last=1955-2004|first=Lediņš, Hardijs,|last2=1979-|first2=Astahovska, Ieva,|last3=Māra|first3=Žeikare,|isbn=9789934850998|oclc=973024306}}&lt;/ref&gt; They played [[Experimental music|experimental]]/[[electronic music]] with influences of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[New-age music|new-age]].

The band was formed in 1982 by [[Hardijs Lediņš]], architect and DJ, and [[Juris Boiko]], universal artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early years they played electronic avant-garde. They were pioneers of this kind of music in Latvia. Along with their fellow musicians [[Dzeltenie Pastnieki]] (who were more popular than NSRD), they were the first [[New wave music|new wave]] musicians in the [[Latvian SSR]]. Their records were available only on [[magnetic tape]].

As they were so untraditional in the Latvian music scene, they didn't gain a lot of popularity in the 1980s. Nowadays their music is popular among collectors and music fans.

It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west, [[Zambia]] to the north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. The economy, closely tied to South Africa's, is dominated by mining (especially diamonds), tourism, and cattle.

'''Surgical Eye Expeditions International''', or '''SEE International''', is a nonprofit humanitarian organization based in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Founded in 1974, SEE connects over 650 volunteer [[ophthalmologists]] and medical professionals to host clinic sites worldwide. Its objective is to provide sight-restoring surgeries in communities that are overwhelmed with the large number of [[Blindness|blind]] individuals who cannot afford surgery. The organization is headed by President/CEO Randal Avolio, along with a 16-member Board of Directors. In the [[United States]], it is classified by the [[IRS]] as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seeintl.org/about/ About SEE International]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a GuideStar Platinum Participant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guidestar.org/profile/31-1682275 SEE International GuideStar Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

SEE's mission statement is, "To provide medical, surgical and educational services by volunteer ophthalmic surgeons with the primary objective of restoring eyesight to disadvantaged blind individuals worldwide."

==Programs==

===International===
[[Image:Ajalli, Nigeria Sep 07 2.JPG|thumb|left|SEE Patients in Ajalli, Nigeria. September 2007.]]SEE International coordinates short-term medical expeditions all over the world at the request of ophthalmologists in host countries where access to vision care is scarce. SEE International’s volunteer ophthalmologists work closely with the host eye surgeons to perform safe and quality sight-restoring surgeries.

In 2015 alone, SEE International performed over 15,000 surgeries in 39 countries around the world. Over the course of 40 years SEE has screened approximately 3.8 million individuals, and completed over 460,000 surgeries in over 80 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seeintl.org/publications/ 2015 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

SEE expeditions typically take place over the course of one week. All teams are invited by the local health authority from the host country. SEE’s international clinic coordinators work with the host ophthalmologists three to six months in advance to coordinate logistical details and to ensure the availability of proper facility, equipment, supplies, support and staff.

====The Need for Cataract Surgery====
SEE’s primary focus of [[cataract surgery]] is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Cataracts cause nearly half of the world’s loss of sight, and are surgically correctable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/priority/en/index1.html Cataract Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the most [[developed countries]], cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness in all regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/vision/01_en.html World Health Organization's 10 Facts about Blindness and Visual Impairment]&lt;/ref&gt; With a 30-minute surgery and the patient under local anesthetic, a volunteer SEE surgeon can restore the sight of a person who has been blind with cataracts for 5, 10 or even 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/ World Health Organization Blindness Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)====
Cataract surgeries in developing countries require a technique that is not normally practiced in the United States. Because of the density of the cataracts and the lack of infrastructure for sophisticated equipment, a manual process must be utilized in many developing countries. While ophthalmologists have traditionally employed the [[extracapsular cataract extraction]] (ECCE) manual method, this technique requires a relatively large incision made in the cornea which requires sutures. With the newer MSICS procedure, a much smaller incision is made that is also self-sealing. Skilled surgeons can perform twice as many surgeries in the same amount of time with the MSICS procedure compared to ECCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Extracapsular-Cataract-Extraction.html Surgery Encyclopedia- Definition of extrascapular cataract extraction]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, patients typically have better post-op visual acuity, less [[astigmatism]], fewer incidences of [[infection]] and heal faster through this process.

As part of SEE International’s ongoing commitment to patient care and affiliate ophthalmologists, and because of all the benefits of Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery, SEE International has begun to train ophthalmologists in the technique through a one-day course held one to two times a year at the SEE offices in Santa Barbara.

===Local===
SEE International established the Santa Barbara Vision Care Program (SBVCP) in the 1980s, in response to the population within SEE’s own local community that could not afford vision care. The SBVCP saves eyesight in patients through early detection and to provide sight-restoring surgery to those in need. In 2015, the SBVCP provided services for 1,424 low-income and uninsured patients in Santa Barbara County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seeintl.org/publications/ 2015 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==

In the December 10, 2001 issue of [[Forbes]], SEE International was cited in the Charity Investment Guide for its 99% efficiency as a charity, meaning that financially almost nothing is lost to overhead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2001/1210/178s02.html "Clarity Of Vision"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2015, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] announced that SEE affiliate Dr. [[Helena Ndume]] was selected to receive the first-ever United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize. According to General Assembly President [[Sam Kutesa]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51221#.VYr2E5RdXMA "General Assembly awards first-ever UN Nelson Mandela Prize to nationals of Namibia and Portugal"]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The prize recognizes the achievements of those who dedicate their lives to the service of humanity by promoting UN purposes and principles while honouring Nelson Mandela’s extraordinary life and legacy of reconciliation, political transition and social transformation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2016, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) recognized SEE volunteer Dr. Janak M. Shah, M.D., as an Eye Health Hero. Dr. Shah has collaborated with SEE on over 140 ophthalmic expeditions worldwide, the most out of any SEE surgeon to date. The purpose of the Eye Health Heroes program is "to celebrate eye care practitioners and front line staff whose everyday efforts behind the scenes are making a real difference towards Universal Eye Health." Dr. Shah and other Eye Health Heroes will be recognized at the 10th General Assembly of the IAPB, in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], October 27–30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heroes.iapb.org/ IAPB - Eye Health Heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Partners==
Corporate and foundation partners support SEE through in-kind medical donations and cash grants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seeintl.org/corporate-sponsors/ Corporate &amp; Foundation Supporters]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa''' was a Czech [[alternative rock]] band, formed in 1990 by Jan Muchow, Jan Gregar, Petr Wegner and Irna Libowitz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ecstasy-of-saint-theresa-mn0001241930/biography&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[shoegaze]] influences included [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Cocteau Twins]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].

The band released the EP ''Pigment'' in 1991. This album, along with 1992's ''Susurrate'', featured a feedback-drenched psychedelic rock sound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

From there, the band moved into ambient and techno influenced soundscapes as evidenced by their 1993 album ''Free-D'' produced with [[Guy Fixsen]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} ''Free-D'' marked the end of the original line-up and something of a hiatus for the band releasing only the 1994 remix EP ''AstralaVista'' in the following six years.

1999's ''In Dust 3'' featured Muchow and the actress [[Kateřina Winterová]] on 11 tracks of laptop-pop and [[post rock]] ambience. As opposed to the pastoral feel and dubby continuous mix of ''Free-D'', this album consisted of pop songs voiced by actress-singer Winterová backed by the electro-acoustic soundscapes of Muchow. This downtempo sample-infused style was further pursued on 2003's ''Slowthinking'' album released with an accompanying ''Fastmoving/Slowthinking'' DVD featuring the single ''I'm (Not Really) Optimistic''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The ''Watching Black'' album came out in 2006, and in 2011, the band released the ''101010'' DVD, featuring a live performance recorded on 10 October 2010.

It was established in 1998. The theatre has many funny stage plays with some serious messages, that are mostly about [[Social integration|integration]], [[bilingualism]], [[dual citizenship]], [[women's rights]], men society, generational conflicts and so on. The plays are all written by the Turkish playwright [[Aydın Engin]].
Its permanent venue is in Ulm. It mainly brings stage plays for Turks living in Germany and Germans of Turkish origin in their native language, but with German-language passages. For interested German-born spectators, there are German-language textbooks.

The Ulüm is in southern Germany so far the only Turkish theater with its own house (Schillerstr. 1).</text>

The '''Verige bridge''' ({{lang-sr|Мост Вериге}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Most Verige}}) is a planned bridge in [[Montenegro]] that would span the [[Bay of Kotor]], crossing the ''Verige Strait'' at the Bay's entrance, after which it is named. It will be part of the [[Adriatic Highway]] (''Jadranska Magistrala''). As of 2007, the planning stage of the bridge is completed, and construction of the bridge can begin upon the providing of the financial means. The project is estimated to cost 48.5 million [[US dollar]]s.&lt;ref name="mne-2004-project" /&gt; Because the Kotor Bay is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], UNESCO has had some concerns regarding this project.&lt;ref name="whc-29com" /&gt;

Following a recommendation of the [[World Heritage Committee]] the [[Government of Montenegro]] is expected to consider alternative ways of crossing the bay. In particular, a tunnel passage is reported to be under consideration: {{quotation|In the upcoming period, the Government is expected to determine the best way of passage through the Bay of Kotor, whether with a bridge or a tunnel, taking into account the recommendations and suggestions of UNESCO Mission, the Parliament conclusion and the decision of municipalities in the Bay of Kotor. After that, the optimal passage solution will be adopted, the one which will exalt best both the development and touristic potential of the state of Montenegro and the interest of its citizens, as well as the aspects of the protection of the World Heritage area of Kotor.|Branislav Mićunović&lt;ref name="whc-2014-socr" /&gt;}}

The '''Vision for Europe Award''' is an honour that has been bestowed annually since 1995 by the non-profit [[Edmond Israel Foundation]] in "recognition of outstanding achievements in taking Europe into the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ei-foundation.lu/vision/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121180916/http://ei-foundation.lu/vision/index.htm |archive-date=21 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is presented to the recipient in a ceremony at the Edmond Israel Foundation building in [[Luxembourg City]]. Luxembourg's best-known sculptor [[Lucien Wercollier]] designed the statue presented to the recipients.

The first Vision for Europe Award was given to [[Jacques Santer]] in 1995, the year he left his position as [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]] to become President of the [[European Commission]]. The award honored his efforts to unite Europe into a single entity.

==Biography==
Alvaro VIII was elevated to the throne by [[Paulo da Silva, Count of Soyo]], who marched on [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]] and killed his predecessor, [[Álvaro VII of Kongo|King Alvaro VII]].

In 1667, he sent his ambassador, Anastasius, to [[Luanda]] ([[Angola]]), to negotiate a treaty that ceded to the Portugueses the right to exploit the mines of Congo, located in the provinces of [[Mbamba]] and [[Mpemba]]. Theodosius, Duke of Mbamba, bowed to the king's decision, but Peter, Duke of Mbemba, refused.

Leading a small army, Peter attacked Mbamba, killed Theodosius and then invaded the kingdom's capital, [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]], killing Alvaro VIII and proclaimed himself king under the name of [[Pedro III of Kongo|Peter III]].
