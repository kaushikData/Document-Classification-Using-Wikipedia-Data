'''3D city models''' are digital models of urban areas that represent terrain surfaces, sites, buildings, vegetation, infrastructure and landscape elements in three-dimensional scale as well as related objects (e.g., city furniture) belonging to urban areas. Their components are described and represented by corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial data and geo-referenced data. 3D city models support presentation, exploration, analysis, and management tasks in a large number of different application domains. In particular, 3D city models allow "for visually integrating heterogeneous geoinformation within a single framework and, therefore, create and manage complex urban information spaces." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/hpi/FG_Doellner/publications/2006/DBB06/CORP2006_doellner.pdf  |title=J. Döllner, K. Baumann, H. Buchholz: ''Virtual 3D City Models as Foundation of Complex Urban Information Spaces''. 11th international conference on Urban Planning and Spatial Development in the Information Society (REAL CORP), (Manfred Schrenk, ed.), CORP – Competence Center of Urban and Regional Planning, pp. 107–112, 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwDSj9Yo_38 |title=Example video for 3D city models as complex information spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage of 3D City Models ==
To store 3D city models, both file-based and database approaches are used. There is no single, unique representation schema due to the heterogeneity and diversity of 3d city model contents.

=== Encoding of Components ===
Components of 3D city models are encoded by common file and exchange formats for 2D raster-based GIS data (e.g., [[GeoTIFF]]), 2D vector-based GIS data (e.g., [[AutoCAD DXF]]), 3D models (e.g., [[.3DS]], [[Object file|.OBJ]]), and 3D scenes (e.g., [[Collada]], [[Keyhole Markup Language]]) such as supported by [[Computer-aided design|CAD]], [[GIS]], and [[computer graphics]] tools and systems. All components of a 3D city model have to be transformed into a common [[geographic coordinate system]].

=== Databases ===
A database for 3D city models stores its components in a hierarchically structured, multi-scale way, which allows for a stable and reliable data management and facilitates complex GIS modeling and analysis tasks. For example, the 3D City Database is a free 3D geo database to store, represent, and manage virtual 3D city models on top of a standard spatial relational database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/welcome/ |title=3D City DB Web Site www.3dcitydb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A database is required if 3D city models have to be continuously managed. 3D city model databases form a key element in 3D spatial data infrastructures that require support for storing, managing, maintenance, and distribution of 3D city model contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitydatabase |title=virtual city database for 3D city and landscape models}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their implementation requires support of a multitude of formats (e.g., based on FME multi formats). As common application, geodata download portals can be set up for 3D city model contents (e.g., virtualcityWarehouse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitywarehouse.html |title=virtualcityWarehouse |access-date=2014-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531190348/http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitywarehouse.html |archive-date=2014-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CityGML ===
The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) defines an explicit [[XML]]-based exchange format for 3D city models, [[CityGML]], which supports not only geometric descriptions of 3D city model components but also the specification of semantics and topology information.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Kolbe: ''Representing and Exchanging 3D City Models with CityGML''. 3D Geo-Information Sciences, J. Lee, [[Sisi Zlatanova|S. Zlatanova]], W. Cartwright, G. Gartner, L. Meng, and M. P. Peterson, Eds. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2009, pp. 15–31&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of 3D City Models ==

=== Level of Detail ===
3D city models are typically constructed at various [[level of detail|levels of detail]] (LOD) to provide notions of multiple resolutions and at different levels of abstraction. Other metrics such as the level of spatio-semantic coherence and resolution of the texture can be considered a part of the LOD.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |title=Formalisation of the level of detail in 3D city modelling

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[CityGML]] defines five LODs for building models: 
* LOD 0: [[2.5D]] footprints
* LOD 1: Buildings represented by block models (usually extruded footprints)
* LOD 2: Building models with standard roof structures
* LOD 3: Detailed (architectural) building models
* LOD 4: LOD 3 building models supplemented with interior features.

There exist also approaches to generalize a given detailed 3D city model by means of automated generalization.&lt;ref&gt;T. Glander, J. Döllner: ''Techniques for Generalizing Building Geometry of Complex Virtual 3D City Models''. Advances in 3D Geoinformation Systems, (Peter van Oosterom and [[Sisi Zlatanova]] and Friso Penninga and Elfriede M. Fendel, ed.), Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, Springer, pp. 381–400, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a hierarchical road network (e.g., [[OpenStreetMap]]) can be used to group 3D city model components into "cells"; each cell is abstracted by aggregating and merging contained components.

=== GIS Data ===
[[GIS]] data provide the base information to build a 3D city model such as by digital terrain models, road networks, land use maps, and related geo-referenced data. GIS data also includes cadastral data that can be converted into simple 3D models as, for example, in the case of extruded building footprints. Core components of 3D city models form [[digital terrain model]]s (DTM) represented, for example, by TINs or grids.

=== CAD Data ===
Typical sources of data for 3D city model also include [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] models of buildings, sites, and infrastructure elements. They provide a high level of detail, possible not required by 3D city model applications, but can be incorporated either by exporting their geometry or as encapsulated objects.

=== BIM Data ===
[[Building information modeling|Building information models]] represent another category of geo-spatial data that can be integrated into a 3D city model providing the highest level of detail for building components.

=== Integration at Visualization Level ===
Complex 3D city models typically are based on different sources of geodata such as geodata from GIS, building and site models from CAD and BIM. It is one of their core properties to establish a common reference frame for heterogeneous geo-spatial and geo-referenced data, i.e., the data need not to be merged or fusioned based on one common data model or schema. The integration is possible by sharing a common geo-coordinate system at the visualization level.&lt;ref&gt;J. Döllner, B. Hagedorn: ''Integrating Urban GIS, CAD, and BIM Data By Service-Based Virtual 3D City-Models''. Urban and Regional Data Management: UDMS 2007 Annual, (Massimo Rumor and Volker Coors and Elfriede M. Fendel and [[Sisi Zlatanova]], ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., Stuttgart, Germany, pp. 157–170, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building Reconstruction ===
The simplest form of building model construction consist in extruding the footprint polygons of buildings, e.g., taken from the cadaster, by pre-compute average heights. In practice, 3D models of buildings of urban regions are generated based on capturing and analyzing 3D [[point cloud]]s (e.g., sampled by terrestrial or aerial [[3D scanning|laser scanning]]) or by photogrammetric approaches. To achieve a high percentage of geometrically and topologically correct 3D building models, digital terrain surfaces and 2D footprint polygons are required by automated building [[3D reconstruction|reconstruction]] tools such as BREC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/buildingreconstruction&lt;/ref&gt; One key challenge is to find building parts with their corresponding roof geometry. "Since fully automatic image understanding is very hard to solve, semi-automatic components are usually required to at least support the recognition of very complex buildings by a human operator."&lt;ref&gt;N. Haala, M. Kada: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fatemeh_Sadeghi/post/Can_anyone_suggest_to_me_the_possible_methods_to_semantically_enrich_3D_city_model/attachment/59d632fbc49f478072ea1e47/AS%3A273638396235777%401442251886039/download/An+update+on+automatic+3D+building+reconstruction.pdf An update on automatic 3D building reconstruction]. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 65 (2010), 570–580.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical approaches are common for roof reconstruction based on airborne laser scanning point clouds.

Fully automated processes exist to generate LOD1 and LOD2 building models for large regions. For example, the Bavarian Office for Surveying and Spatial Information is responsible for about 8 million building models at LOD1 and LOD2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/references.html#projects |title=Bavarian LOD2 Building Model Project |access-date=2014-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531173221/http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/references.html#projects |archive-date=2014-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization of 3D City Models ==
The [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of 3D city models represents a core functionality required for interactive applications and systems based on 3D city models.

=== Real-Time Rendering of 3D City Models ===
Providing high quality visualization of massive 3D city models in a scalable, fast, and cost efficient manner is still a challenging task due to the complexity in terms of 3D geometry and [[texture mapping|textures]] of 3D city models. [[Real-time rendering]] provides a large number of specialized 3D rendering techniques for 3D city models. 
Examples of specialized real-time 3D rendering include:

* Real-time 3D rendering of [[multiperspectivity|multiperspective]] views on 3D city models.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT01QsZMYDE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/doellner/publications/year/2014/2390/PSTD2014.html Multiperspective Views for 3D City Models&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-time rendering algorithms and data structures are listed by the virtual terrain project.&lt;ref&gt;http://vterrain.org/LOD/Papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service-Based Rendering of 3D City Models ===
[[Service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) for visualizing 3D city models offer a separation of concerns into management and rendering and their interactive provision by client applications. For SOA-based approaches, 3D portrayal services&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/3dpie&lt;/ref&gt; are required, whose main functionality represents the portrayal in the sense of 3D rendering and visualization.&lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke, J. Döllner: ''Service-oriented Visualization of Virtual 3D City Models''. Directions Magazine, 2012. http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/service-oriented-visualization-of-virtual-3d-city-models/226560&lt;/ref&gt; SOA-based approaches can be distinguished into two main categories, currently discussed in the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]:

* Web 3D Service (W3DS): This type of service handles geodata access and mapping to computer graphics primitives such as scene graphs with textured 3D geometry models as well as their delivery to the requesting client applications. The client applications are responsible for the 3D rendering of delivered scene graphs, i.e., they are responsible for the interactive display using their own 3D graphics hardware.
* Web View Service (WVS): This type of service encapsulates the 3D rendering process for 3D city models at the server side. The server generates views of the 3D scene or intermediate, image-based representations (e.g., virtual panoramas or G-buffer cube maps&lt;ref&gt;J. Döllner, B. Hagedorn: ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Klimke/publication/254463533_Server-Based_Rendering_of_Large_3D_Scenes_for_Mobile_Devices_Using_G-Buffer_Cube_Maps/links/56c72b2f08ae0d3b1b65d517/Server-Based-Rendering-of-Large-3D-Scenes-for-Mobile-Devices-Using-G-Buffer-Cube-Maps.pdf Server-Based Rendering of Large 3D Scenes for Mobile Devices Using G-Buffer Cube Maps]''. Web3D '12 Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on 3D Web Technology, pp. 97-100, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;), which are streamed and uploaded to requesting client applications. The client applications are responsible for re-construction the 3D scene based on the intermediate representations. Client applications do not have to process 3D graphics data, but to provide management for loading, caching, and displaying the image-based representations of 3D scenes and do not have to process the original (and possibly large) 3D city model.

=== Map-Based Visualization ===
A map-based technique, the "smart map" approach, aims at providing "massive, virtual 3D city models on different platforms namely web browsers, smartphones or tablets, by means of an interactive map assembled from artificial oblique image tiles." &lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke et al.: "Scalable Multi-Platform Distribution of Spatial 3D Contents". ISPRS 8th 3D GeoInfo Conference &amp; WG II/2 Workshop 27–29 November 2013, Istanbul, Turkey, (U. Isikdag, ed.), vol. II-2/W1, ISPRS Annals, ISPRS, pp. 193-200, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The map tiles are synthesized by an automatic 3D rendering process of the 3D city model; the map tiles, generated for different levels-of-detail, are stored on the server. This way, the 3D rendering is completely performed on the server's side, simplifying access and usage of 3D city models. The 3D rendering process can apply advanced rendering techniques (e.g., global illumination and shadow calculation, illustrative rendering), but does not require client devices to have advanced 3D graphics hardware. Most importantly, the map-based approach allows for distributing and using complex 3D city models with having to stream the underlying data to client devices - only the pre-generated map tiles are sent. This way, "(a) The complexity of the 3D city model data is decoupled from data transfer complexity (b) the implementation of client applications is simplified significantly as 3D rendering is encapsulated on server side (c) 3D city models can be easily deployed for and used by a large number of concurrent users, leading to a high degree of scalability of the overall approach." &lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke et al.: "Scalable Multi-Platform Distribution of Spatial 3D Contents". ISPRS 8th 3D GeoInfo Conference &amp; WG II/2 Workshop 27–29 November 2013, Istanbul, Turkey, (U. Isikdag, ed.), vol. II-2/W1, ISPRS Annals, ISPRS, pp. 193-200, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternating current electrospinning''' is a fiber formation technique to produce micro- and nanofibers from polymer solutions under the dynamic drawing force of the electrostatic field with periodically changing polarity.

''Beyond CMOS'' is the name of one of the 7 focus groups in [[ITRS 2.0]] (2013) and in its successor, the [[International Roadmap for Devices and Systems]].

[[File:Clock CPU Scaling.jpg|thumb|CPU Clock Scaling|390x390px]]

CPUs using CMOS were released from 1986 (e.g. 12&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Intel 80386]]). As CMOS transistor dimensions were shrunk the clock speeds also increased. Since about 2004 CMOS CPU clock speeds have leveled off at about 3.5&amp;nbsp;GHz.

[[File:Beyond CMOS IRDS.jpg|thumb|A graph of efficiency gains possible under 'more Moore' (ie, further improvements to current technology) and 'Beyond CMOS' (ie, a paradigm shift in technology). From the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems&lt;ref&gt;https://irds.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/2017/2017IRDS_BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

CMOS devices sizes continue to shrink – see [[Intel tick–tock]] and [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS]] :
* [[22 nanometer|22nm]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] in 2012
* first [[14 nanometer]] processors shipped in Q4 2014.
* In May 2015, Samsung Electronics showed a 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafer of [[10 nanometer|10&amp;nbsp;nm]] [[FinFET]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung vows to start 10nm chip production in 2016|url=http://www.kitguru.net/components/anton-shilov/samsung-vows-to-start-10nm-chip-production-in-2016-shows-first-wafers/|date=23 May 2015|accessdate=16 July 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

CMOS transistors may not work below 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Carta/&gt; See [[10 nanometer]] and [[7 nanometer]].

==Comparisons of technology==
About 2010 the [[Nanoelectronic Research Initiative]] (NRI) studied various circuits in various technologies.&lt;ref name=NikonovYoung2012/&gt;

==Superconducting computing and RSFQ==

[[superconducting computing|Superconducting computing]] includes several beyond-CMOS technologies that use superconducting devices, namely Josephson junctions, for electronic signals processing and computing. One variant called [[rapid single flux quantum|rapid single-flux quantum]] (RSFQ) logic was considered promising by the NSA in a 2005 technology survey despite the drawback that available superconductors require cryogenic temperatures. More energy-efficient superconducting logic variants have been developed since 2005 and are being considered for use in large scale computing.&lt;ref name="Holmes2013"&gt;Holmes DS, Ripple AL, Manheimer MA (2013).

A '''charge card''' is a card that provides a [[payment method]] enabling the cardholder to make [[purchases]] which are paid for by the card issuer, to whom the cardholder becomes indebted. The cardholder is obligated to repay the [[debt]] to the card issuer in full by the due date, usually on a monthly basis, or be subject to late fees and restrictions on further card use.  It can also be a [[smart card]].

Though the terms ''charge card'' and ''[[credit card]]'' are sometimes used interchangeably, they are distinct protocols of financial transactions. Credit cards are [[revolving credit]] instruments that do not need to be paid in full every month. There is no late fee payable so long as the minimum payment is made at specified intervals (usually every thirty days). The [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] of the account accrues interest, which may be backdated to the date of initial purchase. Charge cards are typically issued without spending limits, but credit cards usually have a specified credit limit that the cardholder may not exceed.

Though originally charge account identification was paper-based, in 1959 [[American Express]] became the first charge card operator to issue embossed plastic cards to [[ISO/IEC 7810]]  ID-1 standard. Cards have an embossed [[bank card number]] complying with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard.

== History ==
In 1914, [[Western Union]] opened the first charge account for its customers and provided them with a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store charge accounts for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, [[Diners Club]] began opening charge accounts with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card could be used in a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store's cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, [[American Express]] also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to [[ISO/IEC 7810]] standards.

In Europe, the [[MasterCard]]-affiliated [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] brand (which is a [[debit card]] rather than a charge card) replaced the European [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocheque]] brand for payment cards in 2002. Many Eurocheque cards, particularly in such countries as [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], were charge cards branded with the [[Eurocheque]] logo. In addition, the European [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]], issued as the competitor for [[American Express]] was, and in some countries (such as the [[Nordic countries]]) still is, a charge card.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Therefore, the majority of MasterCards in these countries still are charge cards. [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] charge cards are also available in Europe.

== Operation ==
The user of the charge card has to pay the balance of their account at the end of each month and the charge card company, unlike a credit card, does not charge interest. A charge card company's main source of revenue is the merchant fee, which is a percentage of the transaction value which typically ranges between 1 and 4%, plus an interchange or minimum fee.

Many charge cards have the option for users to pay for some purchases over time. [[American Express]] charge card customers, for instance, can enroll in the Extended Payment Option (internally referred to as ExPO) to be able to pay for purchases over $200 over time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanexpress.com/cards/expo/ American Express Extended Payment Option] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031206152359/http://www.americanexpress.com/cards/expo/ |date=December 6, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Sign &amp; Travel to be able to pay for eligible travel-related expenses over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanexpress.com/cards/st/ American Express Sign &amp; Travel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most charge cards also have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit (NPSL).  While consumers often take NPSL to mean that their cards are without limits, NPSL really means that a card's limit changes, often from month-to-month, based on factors such as consumer charging and payment history as well overall economic trends.  According to a [[CardHub.com]] NPSL study, the way NPSL charge cards are reported to the major credit bureaus varies by issuer and can lead to artificial increases in credit utilization, thereby lowering one's [[FICO Score]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cardhub.com/no-preset-spending-limit-2010/ |title=No Pre-Set Spending Limit Credit Card Study – 2010 |publisher=CardHub.com |accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Government]]s and large [[business]]es often use charge cards to pay for and keep track of expenses related to official business; these are often referred to as [[purchasing card]]s. Some retailers issue charge cards to customers.  Some [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards are also charge cards, rather than credit or [[debit card]]s such as [[VISA (credit card)|VISA]] and [[MasterCard]].

One common type is an all-in-one [[coverall]] worn by [[semiconductor]] and [[nanotechnology]] line production workers, technicians, and process / equipment engineers, as well as people in similar roles creating sterile products for the [[medical device]] industry.

The suit covers the wearer to prevent skin and hair being shed into a clean room environment.  The suit may be in one piece or consist of several separate garments worn tightly together.  The suit incorporates both boots and hood. It must also incorporate a properly fitted [[bouffant]] cap or [[mob cap]].

More advanced designs with face covers were introduced in the 1990s (like the [[Intel]] fab worker-style suits seen on the [[Pentium]] product advertisements).

Suits are usually deposited in a store after being contaminated for dry cleaning, autoclaving and/or repair.

Similar suits are worn in the [[Containment building|containment]] areas of [[nuclear power plant]]s.  These suits consist of the main garment, hood, thin cotton gloves, rubber gloves, plastic bags over normal work shoes, and rubber booties.  The wrists and ankles are taped down with masking tape.  Occasionally a plastic raincoat is also worn.  Removal of the garments (into several barrels) is a complicated process which must be performed in an exact sequence.  Often a [[health physics|health physicist]] is present in the work area to observe good anti-contamination practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcs-clean.com/gowning-degowning.html Pictorial demonstration of gowning]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''crystal bar process''' (also known as '''iodide process''' or the '''van Arkel&amp;ndash;de Boer process''') was developed by [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19251480133 | title =  Darstellung von reinem Titanium-, Zirkonium-, Hafnium- und Thoriummetall | first = A. E. | last = van Arkel |author2=de Boer, J. H. | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages =345–350 | year = 1925 | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic [[zirconium]]. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra-pure titanium and zirconium. It primarily involves the formation of the metal iodides and their subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal. This process was superseded commercially by the [[Kroll process]].

==Process==

[[File:Van-Arkel-de-Boer-Verfahren.svg|350px|thumb|The crystal bar process. ''M'' refers to ''metal'']]

As seen in the diagram below, impure [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], [[vanadium]], [[thorium]] or [[protactinium]] is heated in an evacuated vessel with a halogen at 50–250&amp;nbsp;°C. The patent specifically involved the intermediacy of [[titanium tetraiodide|TiI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[zirconium tetraiodide|ZrI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], which were volatilized (leaving impurities as solid). At atmospheric pressure TiI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; melts at 150&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 377&amp;nbsp;°C, while ZrI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; melts at 499&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 600&amp;nbsp;°C. The boiling points are lower at reduced pressure. The gaseous metal tetraiodide is decomposed on a white hot tungsten filament (1400&amp;nbsp;°C). As more metal is deposited the filament conducts better and thus a greater electric current is required to maintain the temperature of the filament. The process can be performed in the span of several hours or several weeks, depending on the particular setup.

Generally, the crystal bar process can be performed using any number of metals using whichever halogen or combination of halogens is most appropriate for that sort of transport mechanism, based on the reactivities involved. The only metals it has been used to purify on an industrial scale are titanium, zirconium and hafnium, and in fact is still in use today on a much smaller scale for special purity needs.

A '''crystal earpiece''' is a type of piezoelectric [[earphone]], producing [[sound]] by using a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric crystal]], a material that changes its shape when [[electricity]] is applied to it.  It is usually designed to plug into the [[ear canal]] of the user.

==Operation==
A crystal earpiece typically consists of a piezoelectric crystal with [[metal]] electrodes attached to either side, [[Adhesive|glued]] to a conical plastic or metal [[foil (metal)|foil]] diaphragm, enclosed in a plastic case. The piezoelectric material used in early crystal earphones was [[Potassium sodium tartrate|Rochelle salt]], but modern earphones use [[barium titanate]], or less often [[quartz]]. When the [[audio signal]] is applied to the electrodes, the crystal bends back and forth a little with the signal, vibrating the diaphragm. The diaphragm pushes on the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]], creating sound waves. The plastic earpiece casing confines the sound waves and conducts them efficiently into the ear canal, to the [[eardrum]]. The diaphragm is generally fixed at its outer edge, relying on bending to operate. The air path in the earpiece is generally a [[horn (acoustic)|horn]] shape, with a narrowing column of air which increases the air displacement at the eardrum, increasing the volume.

==Application==
Crystal earpieces are usually [[monaural]] devices with very low sound fidelity, but high sensitivity and impedance.  Their peak use was probably with 1960s era [[transistor radio]]s and [[hearing aid]]s.  They are not used with modern [[portable media player]]s due to unacceptable sound quality.  The main causes of poor performance with these earpieces are low diaphragm excursion, nonlinearity, in-band [[resonance]] and the very short horn shape of the earpiece casing. The resulting sound is very tinny and lacking in [[Bass (sound)|bass]].  Modern headphones use electromagnetic drivers that work similarly to speakers, with [[moving coil loudspeaker|moving coil]]s or [[moving iron speaker|moving iron cores]] in a magnetic field.

One remaining use for crystal earpieces is in [[crystal radio]]s.  Their very high [[sensitivity (instrument)|sensitivity]] enables them to use the very weak signals produced by crystal radios, and their high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (on the order of 20 kilohms) is a good match for the typical crystal radio.  They have also been used as [[microphone]]s, with their high output requiring less [[Amplifier|amplification]].

'''Defensive design''' is the practice of planning for [[Contingency plan|contingencies]] in the [[design]] stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.

Defensive design in [[software engineering]] is called [[defensive programming]]. [[Murphy's law]] is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design. It is considered the opposite approach to [[design by contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org | title = Design by contract | date = 2017-05-17 | publisher = Wikipedia | location = Internet | language = English | format = HTML | archiveurl = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_by_contract&amp;oldid=780850256 | archivedate = 2017-05-17 | accessdate = 2017-07-25 | quote = The DbC approach assumes all client components that invoke an operation on a server component will meet the preconditions specified as required for that operation.

A '''dishcloth''' is used in the [[kitchen]] to clean [[Dishware|dish]]es and other surfaces. Typically they are made of [[cotton]] or other cloth, such as [[microfiber]], and measure 11" to 13" inches square.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}

== Microwave disinfection ==

Dishcloths are often left damp and provide a breeding ground for [[bacteria]]. Since the kitchen sink is used to clean food, dishcloths are routinely infected with [[E. coli]] and [[salmonella]]. In 2007 a study from the [[Journal of Environmental Health]] found that putting a damp dishcloth (or sponge) in the [[microwave]] for 2 minutes killed 99% of living pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6293735.stm Microwave 'sterilisers' warning]&lt;/ref&gt; However, fire departments have subsequently warned people not to do this as it can be a fire hazard, especially if the dishcloth or [[kitchen sponge|sponge]] is not sufficiently wet. Several small fires have been started as a result of people following the advice from the study.

The '''Dobson spectrophotometer''', also known as '''Dobsonmeter''', '''Dobson spectrometer''', or just '''Dobson''' is one of the earliest instruments used to measure atmospheric [[ozone]].

The Dobson spectrometer was invented in 1924 by [[Gordon Dobson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/meteorology/1950-159.aspx Dobson's original ozone spectrometer, 1926. - - Science Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A history of the development of the instrument is here&lt;ref&gt; G. M. B. Dobson - March 1968 / Vol. 7, No. 3 / APPLIED OPTICS (pps. 387 - 405). http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ozwv/dobson/papers/Applied_Optics_v7_1968.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; and an example of one of Dobson's own instruments remains on display in the University of Oxford Department of Physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics/history History | University of Oxford Department of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Dobson spectrophotometers can be used to measure both total column ozone and profiles of ozone in the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of the instrument can be found here: ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/dobson/Papers/dobson%20ozone%20spectrophotometer%20overview2.ppsx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
A copy of the instrument handbook is available from the WMO: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/documents/GAW183-Dobson-WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone is tri-atomic oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; ozone molecules absorb harmful [[UV light]] in the atmosphere before it reaches the surface of the earth. No UVC radiation penetrates to the ground as it is absorbed in the [[ozone-oxygen cycle]]. However some longer-wave and less harmful [[UVB]] and most of the [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] is not absorbed as ozone is less opaque to these frequencies, so they penetrate to the ground level of Earth in higher quantities. The sources of [[light]] used may vary. Beside the direct [[sun]] light, the light from the clear sky, [[moon]] or [[star]]s may be used.

The Dobson Spectrometer measures the total ozone by measuring the relative intensity of the UVB radiation that reaches the Earth and comparing it to that of UVA radiation at ground level. If all of the ozone were removed from the atmosphere, the amount of UVB radiation would equal the amount of UVA radiation on the ground. As ozone does exist in the atmosphere, the Dobson Spectrometer can use the ratio between UVA and UVB radiation on the ground to determine how much ozone is present in the [[upper atmosphere]] to absorb the UVC radiation. 

The ratio is determined by turning the R-dial, which  can be rotated a full 300°, on the instrument. The spectrometer compares two different wavelength intensities, UVB (305 nm) and UVA (325 nm),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.gi.alaska.edu/dobson.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205184820/http://ozone.gi.alaska.edu/dobson.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to calculate the amount of ozone. When turned, the R-dial filters and blocks out the light of the UVC wavelength until the intensity of the two wavelengths of light are equal. The ratio of the two wavelengths at incidence can be calculated once the filtered intensities are the same. The results are measured in [[Dobson Unit]]s, equal to 10 µm thickness of ozone compressed to [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP) in the column. If all of the ozone in the atmospheric column one was measuring were compressed to STP, the thickness of the compressed atmosphere in mm would equal an answer in Dobson Units divided by 100. 

The vertical distribution of ozone is derived using the [[Umkehr effect|Umkehr method]]. This method relies on the intensities of reflected, rather than direct, [[UV light]]. Ozone distribution is derived from the change in the ratio of the same UV-pair frequencies with time as the sun sets. An "Umkehr" measurement takes about three hours, and provides data up to an altitude of 48 km, with the most accurate information for altitudes above 30 km. 

The Dobson method has its drawbacks. It is strongly affected by [[Particulate|aerosols]] and [[pollutants]] in the atmosphere, because they also absorb some of the light at the same wavelength. Measurements are made over a small area in the direction of the sun. Today this method is often used to calibrate data obtained by other methods, including satellites. 

==Instruments and manufacturers==
Some modernized versions of Dobson spectrophotometer exist and continue to provide data.  

About 120 Dobsonmeters have been made, mostly by R&amp;J Beck of London, of which about 50 remain in use today. The most famous ones are probably Nos. 31 and 51 with which [[Joe Farman]] of the [[British Antarctic Survey]] discovered the [[Ozone Hole]] in 1984.  The "World Standard Dobson", No. 83, is owned and operated by the US Dept of Commerce's, NOAA, as is the secondary standard, No. 65.

The oldest instrument still in use is No.8 located at the roof of the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]] at [[Ny Ålesund]], [[Svalbard]]. This instrument has the last reported data for 1997.

The instrument D003, operated in [[Kunming|Kunming, China]] reported data to August 2009.  The history of the stations and instruments can be found at the World Ozone and UV Data Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woudc.org/index_e.html Home - World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) - [Meteorological Service of Canada - WOUDC&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environment Canada ([[Alan Brewer]]) developed double- and single- monochromator spectrophotometers known as the "Brewer" Spectrophotometer produced by Kipp &amp; Zonen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kippzonen.com/?productgroup/26142/Brewer+Spectrophotometer.aspx Brewer Spectrophotometer - Kipp &amp; Zonen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409110247/http://www.kippzonen.com/?productgroup%2F26142%2FBrewer+Spectrophotometer.aspx |date=2011-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}

The '''E-plane and H-plane''' are reference planes for linearly polarized [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]s, [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] and other [[microwave]] devices.

In waveguide systems, as in the electric circuits, it is often desirable to be able to split the circuit power into two or more fractions. In a waveguide system, an element called a junction is used for power division.

In a low frequency electrical network, it is possible to combine circuit elements in [[series and parallel circuits|series or in parallel]], thereby dividing the source power among several circuit components.
In microwave circuits, a waveguide with three independent ports is called a TEE junction. The output of E-Plane Tee is 180° out of phase where the output of H-plane Tee is in phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=George Kennedy, Bernard|title=Electronic communication systems|date=1999|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=0074636820|page=343|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== E-Plane ==

For a [[Linear polarization|linearly-polarized]] antenna, this is the plane containing the electric field vector (sometimes called the E aperture) and the direction of maximum radiation. The [[electric field]] or "E" plane determines the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] or orientation of the radio wave.  For a vertically polarized antenna, the E-plane usually coincides with the vertical/elevation plane.  For a horizontally polarized antenna, the E-Plane usually coincides with the horizontal/azimuth plane.
E- plane and H-plane should be 90 degrees apart.

== H-plane ==

In the case of the same linearly polarized antenna, this is the plane containing the magnetic field vector (sometimes called the H aperture) and the direction of maximum radiation. The [[magnetic field#The H Field|magnetizing field]] or "H" plane lies at a right angle to the "E" plane.  For a vertically polarized antenna, the H-plane usually coincides with the horizontal/[[azimuth]] plane.  For a horizontally polarized antenna, the H-plane usually coincides with the vertical/elevation plane.

[[Image:E and H Plane PD.png|thumb|500px|center|Diagram showing the relationship between the E and H planes for a vertically polarized omnidirectional [[dipole antenna]]]]

== Co-Pol and Cross-Pol Directions ==
Co-polarization (Co-pol) on cross-polarization (X-pol) are defined for the radiating E and H planes. These directions are defined in spherical coordinates to  correspond to the spherical wavefronts of the propagating wave.  By convention the co-pol direction is the direction of the E field while the cross pol direction is the direction of the H field. Receive power for an co-pol oriented antenna is maximum while receive power is minimum for cross-pol orientation.

From 1802 to 1921, '''Eleutherian Mills''' was a [[powder mill|gunpowder mill]] site used for the manufacture of explosives by the [[Du Pont]] family business. The name also refers to the house on the hill above the mills, which was the first Du Pont family home in America. The business was founded by [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]]. In 1952, the site became an outdoor museum and the [[Hagley Museum and Library]] was founded.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt;

==History==
[[Jacob Broom]] built a [[cotton mill]] on the site in 1795.  The mill burned down in 1797 and in 1802 he sold the site, complete with a working [[dam]] and [[millrace]] to [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]], who paid $6,740 for the {{convert|95|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref name=kinnane&gt;Kinnane, Adrian (2002). ''DuPont: From the Banks of the Brandywine to Miracles of Science''. Wilmington: E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. {{ISBN|0-8018-7059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first domestic supplies of high-quality gunpowder were made in the US by [[du Pont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]].&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, G.I. (1998). ''The Big Bang: A history of explosives''. Thrupp: Sutton Publishing Limited. {{ISBN|0-7509-2361-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded in 1802 by E.I. du Pont, two years after he and his family left [[France]] to escape the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name = dupont&gt;{{Cite book | last =du Pont | first =B.G. | year =1920 | title =E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company: A History 1802 to 1902|place =Boston | publisher =Houghton Mifflin | isbn =1-4179-1685-0 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hagley DuPont Wagon.jpg|thumb|Original DuPont powder wagon]]
They set up the Eleutherian gunpowder mill on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] just north of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], based on gunpowder machinery bought from France and site plans for a gunpowder mill supplied by the French Government.&lt;ref name = dupont/&gt; They also built housing for 30 workers.&lt;ref name=kinnane/&gt;

Starting, initially, by reworking damaged gunpowder and refining [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] for the US government they quickly moved into gunpowder manufacture.&lt;ref name = dupont/&gt;

Saltpetre was refined in an area between the house and the mills that now is occupied by a formal garden.  [[Charcoal]] was produced from the [[willow]] trees that lined the Brandywine.

By the end of 1804, DuPont had sold 39,000 pounds of powder; the following year sales tripled. The federal government and [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]] became regular customers. In 1813 the Hagley property, just downstream from the original mills, was purchased, doubling the size and capacity of the mills. Sales grew during the [[Mexican-American War]] and the [[Crimean War]].  During the [[American Civil War]], the firm sold 4,000,000 barrels of powder to the federal government.

A major explosion killed 33 people in 1818. Another major explosion occurred on the site in 1847. In 1854 three gunpowder wagons exploded in the city of Wilmington.

==The site==
[[File:Hagley mill race.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Mill race which supplied water power to the mills. A railway car is on the right.]]
The mill buildings used in the manufacture of gunpowder were built with strong stone-walled structures on three sides; but were only covered by light wood structures on the fourth side, which faced out onto the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]].  When an accident occurred, the explosion was directed away from the other mills and storage areas and over the creek.

Water power was provided from a [[mill race]] behind the mills, thus further isolating the mills in case of accident. One water wheel was often used to provide power to two mills. Water [[turbine]]s were introduced in the 1840s.
[[Alfred Victor du Pont]] acquired additional property, down stream from the Eleutherian Mills, to add to the manufacturing site. One of these properties was called ''Hagley'', and it became known as the '''Hagley Yard'''.
[[File:Hagley Unrestored Mill 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Unrestored mill on the Brandywine]]
[[File:Hagley Mill Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Edge-runner mill in a restored mill]]
Most of the industrial remains are located in the Hagley Yard. The mills were used in the purification, crushing, and mixing of [[charcoal]], [[sulfur]], and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]]. Other mills in the complex were used for glazing and [[Process of corning black powder|corning]], making metal powder kegs, and in cotton and woolen manufacturing. Stables, offices, a machine shop, and a steam powerhouse from the late 19th century also were located in the complex, as was a narrow gauge railway.

==Rundown and closure==
After the introduction of [[smokeless powder]], the mills were to be closed in the 1910s, but were kept open at the request of the federal government until after the end of [[World War I]].

In 1952 family members donated {{convert|185|acre|km2}} of land and the [[DuPont]] company established a $6,000,000 endowment for the Eleutherian Mill-Hagley Foundation for a museum of [[industrial history]].

The site was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;Richard Greenwood (1979) {{NHLS url|id=66000259|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eleutherian Mills}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000259|title=''Accompanying 12 photos, from 1966-1975''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located on [[Delaware Route 141]] at the Tyler Mcconnell Bridge spanning the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7550">'''Financial intelligence''' is a type of [[business intelligence]] constituted of the knowledge and skills gained from understanding [[finance]] and [[accounting]] principles in the business world. Although a fairly new term, financial intelligence has its roots in [[organizational development]] research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6570.1985.tb00538.x | last1 = Lawler | first1 = E.E. III | year = 1985 | title = Education, Management Style, and Organizational Effectiveness | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 1–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in the field of employee participation.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E.E. III (1986). ''High Involvement Management''. Jossey-Bass:San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial intelligence has emerged as a [[best practice]] and [[core competency]] in many organizations leading to improved financial results, increased employee morale, and reduced employee turnover. Many organizations include financial intelligence programs in their leadership development curriculum. Financial intelligence is not an innate skill, rather it is a learned set of skills that can be developed at all levels.&lt;ref name="Berman"&gt;Berman, K., Knight, J., Case, J., (2006). ''Financial Intelligence: A Managers Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean''. Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of understanding ==
The four areas of understanding&lt;ref name="Berman" /&gt; that make up financial intelligence are:
 
''Understanding the foundation.'' Financial intelligence requires an understanding of the basics of financial measurement including the [[income statement]], the [[balance sheet]], and the [[cash flow statement]]. It also requires knowing the difference between [[cash]] and [[profit (accounting)|profit]] and why a balance sheet balances.

''Understanding the art.'' Finance and accounting are an art as well as a science. The two disciplines must try to quantify what can't always be quantified, and so must rely on rules, estimates, and assumptions. Financial intelligence ensures people are able to identify where the artful aspects of finance have been applied to the numbers, and know how applying them differently might lead to different conclusions.

''Understanding analysis.'' Financial intelligence includes the ability to analyze the numbers in greater depth. This includes being able to calculate profitability, leverage, liquidity and efficiency ratios and understanding the meaning of the results. Conducting ROI analysis and interpreting the results are also part of financial intelligence.

''Understanding the big picture.'' Financial intelligence also means being able to understand a business's financial results in context - that is, within the framework of the big picture. Factors such as the [[economy]], the competitive environment, regulations and changing customer needs and expectations as well as new technologies all affect how the numbers are interpreted.

Financial intelligence is not just theoretical book learning. It also requires practice and real world application. In the [[corporate]] world, managers can display financial intelligence by speaking the language, that is, asking questions about the numbers when something doesn't make sense, reviewing financial reports and using the information to understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, using ROI analysis, [[working capital management]], and [[ratio analysis]] to make decisions, and identifying where the art of finance has been applied.

== Roots of financial intelligence ==
In 1954, Peter F. Drucker, in his groundbreaking book, ''The Practice of Management'', wrote the following. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The worker] should know how his work relates to the work of the whole. He should know what he contributes to the enterprise...if he lacks information, he will lack both incentive and means to improve his performance."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is in the best interest of the organization that the worker have the information."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of financial intelligence in organizations comes from the research of several well-known organizational development academics, including Dennis Denison, Edward Lawler and Jeffrey Pfeffer. For example, the research of Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford &lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. E. III, Mohrman, S.A., Ledford, G.E. Jr. (1995)., ''Creating High Performance Organizations''. (1995) Jossey -Bass: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the indices that have the most impact on both direct performance outcomes in organizations (productivity, customer satisfaction, quality and speed) and on profitability and competitiveness were sharing information and developing knowledge.

Karen Berman's research,&lt;ref&gt;Karen R. Berman, "Information and the Effectiveness of Employee Participation in Organizations" (PhD dissertation, [[California School of Professional Psychology]], 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; asked specifically if information (operationalized by teaching business basics to improve financial intelligence and sharing information on a regular basis) improves the results of employee participation, as seen through organizational performance improvement and employee attitude improvement. The results of the study found that certain financial performance measures improved and that employee turnover decreased. &lt;br /&gt;
Financial literacy also has its roots in open book management.&lt;ref&gt;Case, John. (1995) ''Open Book Management: The Coming Business Revolution''. HarperBusiness:New York&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of [[open-book management]] is business literacy, that is, ensuring everyone understands how the business measures financial success.

== Financial intelligence in organizations ==
Many companies, (Southwest Airlines being a prime example) consider financial intelligence a core competency or best practice. Several universities, including [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] and [[Stanford]] have programs targeted at the corporate world, mostly at the leadership level, to increase the financial intelligence in organizations. There are a variety of methods to increase financial intelligence in organizations, including classroom training, webinar training, and business simulations. Training companies have supported these efforts as well, including Business Literacy Institute, Paradigm Learning, and Workplace Development.

Proponents of financial intelligence in organizations believe that if employees, managers and leaders understand financial information and how financial success is measured, they will make decisions and take action based on an understanding of the financial impact of those decisions. If everyone knows the financial goals of the company, for example, and knows how to make decisions that support those financial goals, then the company is going to be more financially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Dolezalek, H, "Working Smart", Training Magazine, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee owned companies are one group of organizations that are focused on ensuring everyone in the company is financially intelligent, as employees are owners and therefore must understand the financial side of the business.

'''Fishkill Farms''' is an [[apple]] [[orchard]] and small-scale farm located in [[Hopewell Junction]], a hamlet of [[East Fishkill]] in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. Founded by family friends of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Fishkill Farms is one of the [[Hudson Valley]]'s oldest apple orchards.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2015/07/28/dateline-morgenthau-family-homestead-fishkill-farms-local-history/30812361/|title = 102 years later, Fishkill Farms still in care of Morgenthau family|date = July 28, 2015|accessdate = October 14, 2015|website = Poughkeepsie Journal|publisher = Poughkeepsie Journal|last = Musso|first = Anthony p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic Authority LLC named Fishkill Farms its 2010 "top pick" apple farm in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Big Apple – Top 5 apple picking farms near NYC - Organic Authority|url = http://www.organicauthority.com/foodie-buzz/the-big-apple-top-5-apple-picking-farms-near-nyc.html|website = Organic Authority|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Fishkill Farms was founded by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], who purchased the land in 1914. The farm has been handed down through family members, including former Manhattan District Attorney [[Robert M. Morgenthau]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Manhattan Morgenthaus Are Farmers, Too|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303595404579318903949156422|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-14|issn = 0099-9660|first = Ralph Gardner|last = Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is now run by his son, Joshua Morgenthau.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Josh Morgenthau takes over family pastime|url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/10/10/young-professional-fishkill-farms/17057577/|website = The Poughkeepsie Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm originally produced apples, chickens and dairy but  ceased dairy farming during [[World War II]] when hired help was hard to find.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1980, a hailstorm damaged the apples and rendered them unsellable to wholesale distributors so  the orchard was opened up to the local public for [[pick-your-own|U-pick]] harvesting. The farm has been doing U-pick ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.williams-sonoma.com/the-story-of-fishkill-farms/|title = The Story of Fishkill Farms|date = July 27, 2015|accessdate = October 14, 2015|website = Williams-Sonoma Taste|publisher = Williams-Sonoma, Inc.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:JoshMorgenthau.JPG|thumb|Josh Morgenthau leads students on a tour of Fishkill Farms]]

''GSP Saturn'' drilling rig was designed by [[Sonnat Offshore]] and was built by [[Petrom]] at the [[Port of Galați|Galaţi Shipyard]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="saturn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gspoffshore.com/download/technical_documents/GSP%20Saturn.pdf |title=GSP Saturn |year=2010 |publisher=Grup Servicii Petroliere |language=Romanian |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was completely reconstructed and refurbished in 2009 at a cost of US$50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.standard.money.ro/articol_71532/grup_servicii_petroliere_a_inceput_lucrarile_de_retehnologizare_la_gsp_saturn__de_50_milioane_dolari.html|title=Grup Servicii Petroliere a inceput lucrarile de retehnologizare la GSP Saturn, de 50 milioane dolari|date=2 December 2008|publisher=''Business Standard''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823160135/http://old.standard.money.ro/articol_71532/grup_servicii_petroliere_a_inceput_lucrarile_de_retehnologizare_la_gsp_saturn__de_50_milioane_dolari.html|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was owned and operated by [[Petrom]] from 1988 to 2005 when the company sold its six offshore platforms (including [[GSP Atlas|Atlas]], [[GSP Jupiter|Jupiter]], [[GSP Orizont|Orizont]], [[GSP Prometeu |Prometeu ]] and Saturn) to [[Grup Servicii Petroliere]] for US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfin.ro/articol_9126/gsp_vrea_platforme_de_foraj_in_marea_nordului.html|title=GSP vrea platforme de foraj in Marea Nordului|date=25 May 2007|publisher=''Săptămâna Financiară''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518142807/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_9126/gsp_vrea_platforme_de_foraj_in_marea_nordului.html#|archive-date=2011-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GSP Saturn'' has a length of {{convert|52.4|m|ft}}, breadth of {{convert|40.8|m|ft}}, draft of {{convert|9.75|m|ft}}, height of {{convert|120|m|ft}} and depth of {{convert|6.4|m|ft}}. She has a maximum drilling depth of {{convert|9100|m|ft}} and she could operate at a water depth of {{convert|91|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name="saturn"/&gt; As a drilling rig, ''GSP Saturn'' is equipped with advanced drilling equipment and has to meet strict levels of certification under international law. ''GSP Saturn'' is able to maneuver with its own [[engine]]s (to counter [[Stokes drift|drift]] and ocean currents), but for long-distance relocation it must be moved by specialist [[tugboat]]s. The rig is capable of withstanding severe sea conditions including {{convert|12|m|ft}} waves and {{convert|155|km/h|mi/h}} winds.&lt;ref name="saturn"/&gt;

==Operations==
Currently the GSP Saturn is operated by the Dutch company [[Wintershall|Wintershall Noordzee]]

'''Hillclimbing''' is a problem faced by railway systems when a load must be carried up an incline. While railways have a great ability to haul very heavy loads, this advantage is only significant when the tracks are fairly level. As soon as the [[Grade (slope)|gradients]] increase, the tonnage that can be hauled is greatly diminished.

== History ==
Early tramways and railways were laid out with very gentle grades because locomotive and horse haulage were so low in tractive effort. The only exception would be with a line that was downhill all the way for loaded traffic. Brakes were very primitive at this early stage.

Where a railway has to cross a range of mountains, it is important to lower the summit as much as possible, as this reduces the steepness of the gradients on either side. This can be done with a summit tunnel or a deep summit cutting.

A summit [[tunnel]] can lower the summit even more, and steeper hills result in shorter tunnels. Also, tunnels cost the same no matter how much overburden there is, while cuttings tend to increase in cost with the square of the overburden.

Care had to be taken with summit tunnels in the early days of steam with designs that suffered from problems with smoke and slippery rail.

== Ruling gradient ==

The [[ruling gradient]] of a section of railway line between two major stations is the gradient of the steepest stretch. The ruling gradient governs the tonnage of the load that the locomotive can haul reliably.

== Techniques to overcome steep hills ==
Some of the techniques that can be used to overcome steep hills include:
* dividing the [[Cargo|load]] or splitting the [[train]], which requires a siding at the summit.
* attaching additional [[bank engine|banking engine(s)]].
* replacing the [[Locomotive|engine]] with a more powerful heavier engine for the duration of the steep grade.
* strengthening the track on or approaching the steep grade, allowing higher speeds, and allowing the train a run at the gradient. This can be used in short underwater tunnels, where there is a steep descent just before the climb.
* using two-in-one [[articulated locomotive]]s such as the [[Fairlie]], [[Garratt]] or [[Mallet locomotive]].
* using a [[booster engine]], though this is usually limited to starting the heavy train.
* [[Zig zag (railway)|Zig zags]]
* [[Spiral (railway)|Spirals]]
* [[Horseshoe curve (railway)|Horseshoe curves]]
* [[Rack railway]]
* [[Fell mountain railway system]]
* [[Elevator]]s, [[Cable railway|cable]] railways, or [[funicular]] railways driven by [[stationary engine]]s (cable haulage up and down inclines).
* [[Geared steam locomotive]]s such as a [[Shay locomotive]]
* [[Atmospheric railway]]
* [[Cable car (railway)]]
* [[Rail surface treatment]]
* [[Compensation (engineering)|Compensation]] for curvature - the gradient is slightly eased on sharpest curves so that the tractive effort to pull the train is uniform.

== Examples ==

=== Liverpool and Manchester Railway ===

The pioneering [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was built at a time when choice between locomotive and cable haulable was not clear cut.  Therefore, all hill climbing (1 in 100) sections was concentrated in one place where cable haulage by [[stationary engines]] could be used if necessary, while the rest of the line was engineered to be so gently graded (say 1 in 2000) that even primitive locomotives would have a chance of succeeding.  As it turned out at the [[Rainhill Trials]] of 1829, locomotives proved capable of handling the short 1.6-km length of 1 in 100 gradients on either side of the Rainhill level.

Since the early trains had primitive brakes, it was also necessary to have very gentle gradients to reduce the need for strong brakes.  Sudden changes in gradients would have also overstressed the primitive [[Railway coupling|couplings]] between the carriages.

The gentle 1 in 2000 gradients were made possible by very substantial earthworks and bridges.

=== Cromford and High Peak Peak Railway ===

The [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]], which mainly hauled coal, also opened in 1830 but had gradients so steep - 1 in 8 - that cable haulage was essential.
[http://www.wirksworth.org.uk/CHPR.htm]

===Redruth and Chasewater Railway===
The [[Redruth and Chasewater Railway]], a narrow gauge route across the Cornish peninsula (planned in 1818, opened in 1825) used a significant incline to access the harbour at [[Portreath]], which like many in [[Cornwall]] sits in a steep valley.

=== Lancaster and Carlisle Railway ===
On the [[Lancaster and Carlisle Railway]] (L&amp;CR) of 1847 a deep cutting was cut at the Shap Summit. This cutting was cut through rock, about 0.5 mile (800 m) in length, and is between 50–60 feet (15–20 m) deep.

=== Docklands Light Railway ===
On the [[Docklands Light Railway]] the entrance to the tunnel from the original [[London and Blackwall]] railway viaduct to the tunnel to [[Bank–Monument station|Bank]] has the steepest gradient on any British railway at 1 in 17 (5.88%).  A zig zag stripe has been welded to the rail surface to allow trains to gain a satisfactory grip, and prevent slipping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3235">The '''Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association''' was a [[United Kingdom]] company set up in the 19th century to produce [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] signal lights and [[foghorn]]s. It was founded by Nathaniel John Holmes, a [[telegraphy|telegraph]] engineer from [[Middlesex]]; and it passed to his son Joseph R. Holmes. The company was taken over by [[Albright and Wilson]] in 1919.

==Holmes' patents==
In 1875 Holmes obtained a British [[Patent]] for a marine audible alarm signal (B.P. 2564 of 1875); and in 1877 he bought, for £80 [[Pound Sterling]], a half-share of John Grey's Patent (B.P. 2564 of 1868) for ''Improvements in fog alarms''.

In 1876 he obtained, with J.H. Player as co-applicant, a provisional application for ''Improvements in self-igniting and inextinguishable signal lights for marine and other purposes''; it became British Patent 4215 of 1876.

Further patents were taken out by Holmes in 1885 and 1887; and his company up to 1906.

==Marine markers and signals==
In July 1873 he demonstrated his Patent Signal Light to the [[Liverpool]] shipping company [[P and W Maclellan]] and was awarded a Certificate of Merit. It was based on the use of [[Calcium phosphide]]; which they initially made themselves at [[Feltham]], Middlesex, before moving to [[Barking, London|Barking]]. Up to the end of [[World War I]] the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association sold [[lifebuoy]] lights and distress lights; and sales increased dramatically during the war.[[Image:Mercator03.jpg|thumb|Lifebuoy. Photo: Georges Jansoone]]

The provision of Lifebuoy lights was mandatory for British seagoing vessels under [[Board of Trade]] Regulations. Holmes' lights were sold under various [[Trade name]]s: '''The Handyman's Light''' for lifebuoys; the '''Manwell-Holmes Marine Light''' distress light for merchant vessels; and a modified '''Handyman Light''' for lifebuoys for the [[Admiralty]]. They also produced a distress signal, the '''Deck Flare'''. They were all charged with [[calcium carbide]], it produced [[acetylene]] gas when water was dripped onto it. They also included a small quantity of [[calcium phosphide]], which in contact with water produced impure [[phosphine]], it spontaneously ignited, thereby igniting the acetylene.

The Handyman lifebuoy light had a [[buoyancy]] chamber filled with air to keep it afloat. It was attached to the lifebuoy with a long cord, and to the boat with a shorter cord. When the lifebuoy was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out. For the [[mast (sailing)|mast]]-head distress signal light and the Deck Flare the two plugs were removed by hand and the units placed in a bucket of water.

==Expansion under Albright and Wilson==
Albright and Wilson bought the company after the end of World War I, they had large stocks of produced and sales had dropped substantially.

A '''hydrogen breath test''' (or '''HBT''') is used as a diagnostic tool for [[small intestine bacterial overgrowth]] and [[carbohydrate]] [[malabsorption]], such as [[lactose intolerance|lactose]], [[Fructose malabsorption|fructose]], and [[Sorbitol#Adverse medical effects|sorbitol]] malabsorption.&lt;ref name=SimrenStotzer2006&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Simrén M, Stotzer PO| title=Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests | journal=Gut | year= 2006 | volume= 55 | issue= 3 | pages= 297–303 | pmid=16474100 | doi=10.1136/gut.2005.075127 | pmc=1856094 | type= Review  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is simple, [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]], and is performed after a short period of [[fasting]] (typically 8–12 hours).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rana|first=Satya Vati|last2=Malik|first2=Aastha|date=2014-10-01|title=Hydrogen Breath Tests in Gastrointestinal Diseases|journal=Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry|volume=29|issue=4|pages=398–405|doi=10.1007/s12291-014-0426-4|issn=0970-1915|pmc=4175689|pmid=25298621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the test is normally known as a "hydrogen [[breath test]]", some physicians may also test for [[methane]] in addition to [[hydrogen]]. Many studies have shown that some patients (approximately 35% or more) do not produce hydrogen but actually produce methane. Some patients produce a combination of the two gases.&lt;ref name=deLacyCostelloLedochowski2013&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=de Lacy Costello BP, Ledochowski M, Ratcliffe NM| title=The importance of methane breath testing: a review | journal=J Breath Res | year= 2013 | volume= 7 | issue= 2 | pages= 024001 | pmid=23470880 | doi=10.1088/1752-7155/7/2/024001 | type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other patients, who are known as "non-responders", don't produce any gas; it has not yet been determined whether they may actually produce another gas. In addition to hydrogen and methane, some facilities also utilize [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the patient's breath to determine if the breath samples that are being analyzed are contaminated (either with room air or bronchial dead space air).

Testing may be administered at hospitals, clinics, physician offices or if the physician/laboratory has the proper equipment and breath collection kit, patients can collect samples at home to then be mailed in for analysis.

==Conditions==
Tests vary from country to country, so the following information is provided as a rough guide to typical uses of the hydrogen breath test:

[[Fructose malabsorption]] &amp;ndash; the patient takes a base reading of hydrogen levels in his/her breath. The patient is then given a small amount of [[fructose]], and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours. The basis of the test is a failure to absorb the given sugar, which is then metabolized by bacteria that give off either hydrogen or methane. Therefore, the more gas that is produced, the less absorption has occurred. If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a fructose malabsorber. If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive. If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value.

[[Lactose intolerance|Lactose malabsorption]] &amp;ndash; the patient takes a base reading of hydrogen levels in his/her breath. The patient is then given a small amount of pure [[lactose]] (typically 20 to 25 g), and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours. If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a [[Lactose intolerance|lactose malabsorber]]. If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghoshal|first=Uday C.|date=2011-07-01|title=How to interpret hydrogen breath tests|journal=Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility|volume=17|issue=3|pages=312–317|doi=10.5056/jnm.2011.17.3.312|issn=2093-0887|pmc=3155069|pmid=21860825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Yanyong|last2=Misselwitz|first2=Benjamin|last3=Dai|first3=Ning|last4=Fox|first4=Mark|date=2015-09-18|title=Lactose Intolerance in Adults: Biological Mechanism and Dietary Management|journal=Nutrients|volume=7|issue=9|pages=8020–8035|doi=10.3390/nu7095380|issn=2072-6643|pmc=4586575|pmid=26393648}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Däbritz|first=Jan|last2=Mühlbauer|first2=Michael|last3=Domagk|first3=Dirk|last4=Voos|first4=Nicole|last5=Henneböhl|first5=Geraldine|last6=Siemer|first6=Maria L|last7=Foell|first7=Dirk|date=2014-02-27|title=Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=14|pages=59|doi=10.1186/1471-2431-14-59|issn=1471-2431|pmc=3975941|pmid=24575947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome]] (SBBOS) or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) &amp;ndash; the patient is either given a challenge dose of glucose, also known as dextrose (75–100&amp;nbsp;grams), or [[lactulose]] (10&amp;nbsp;grams). A baseline breath sample is collected, and then additional samples are collected at 15 minute or 20 minute intervals for 3–5 hours. Positive diagnosis for a lactulose SIBO breath test &amp;ndash; typically positive if the patient produces approximately 20 ppm of hydrogen and/or methane within the first two hours (indicates bacteria in the small intestine), followed by a much larger peak (colonic response). This is also known as a biphasic pattern. Lactulose is not absorbed by the digestive system and can help determine distal end bacterial overgrowth, which means the bacteria are lower in the small intestine.

===Alternative test methods===

The idea that a SIBO test should be several hours long and that distal overgrowth is important is wrong and is not supported by the scientific literature.&lt;ref name = basilisco&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Basilisco, G. | author2 = Risicato, R. | author3 =  Bonazzi, P | author4 = Di Sario, A. | author5 = Portincasa, P. | year = 2009 | title = H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-breath testing for evaluation of oro-caecal transit time | journal =  Aliment.

Bacterial concentrations greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; organisms per milliliter is diagnostic for SIBO. We know bacteria are colonizing the proximal and not the distal small intestine for several reasons.  First, the gold standard method for detection of SIBO is jejunal aspirates.&lt;ref name = basilisco/&gt;&lt;ref name = eisenmann/&gt;&lt;ref name = simren/&gt;&lt;ref name = hirakawa/&gt;&lt;ref name = bond/&gt;&lt;ref name = ghoshal/&gt; Intestinal fluid of the proximal intestine is sampled, not distal intestinal fluid.  Secondly, the consequences of SIBO are the result of competition between bacteria and the human host for ingested nutrients in the intestine.  Various functional consequences of bacterial infiltration cause enterocyte damage in the jejunum such as diminished disaccharidase activity, fat malabsorption, decreased amino acid transport and decreased vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; absorption.  Thus, detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth is critical.

The SIBO breath test typically uses a 10 gram oral dose of lactulose for detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth.  The best practice is to have breath samples collected at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after dosing.  Since SIBO occurs in the proximal intestine, breath samples should be collected only within 1 hour after lactulose ingestion.  This truly reflects proximal intestinal bacterial activity, not distal or colonic activity.  The same argument is true if glucose is the substrate.

Lactulose is a carbohydrate that is not absorbed by humans.  Lactulose is well known to measure oro-cecal transit time.&lt;ref name = basilisco/&gt;&lt;ref name = eisenmann/&gt;&lt;ref name = simren/&gt;  The mean oro-cecal transit time in normal healthy individuals is 70 to 90 minutes.&lt;ref name = hirakawa/&gt;&lt;ref name = bond/&gt;&lt;ref name = ghoshal/&gt;  By 90 minutes, at least 50% of individuals would have delivered the lactulose dose to the colon.  Approximately 90 to 95% of individuals have colonic bacteria that can metabolize lactulose to hydrogen or methane gas. Thus, any SIBO breath test that collects longer than 60 minutes may be measuring colonic activity.  Diagnostic criteria of 20 ppm hydrogen and/or methane changes within 90 or 120 minutes will have higher positive rates of SIBO but this will reflect colonic activity not jejunal metabolism.  A one-hour SIBO breath test avoids false positive results by collecting breath up to 60 minutes.

Positive diagnosis for a glucose SIBO breath test – glucose is absorbed by the digestive system so studies have shown it to be harder to diagnose distal end bacterial overgrowth since the glucose typically doesn't reach the colon before being absorbed. An increase of approximately 12 ppm or more in hydrogen and/or methane during the breath test could conclude bacterial overgrowth. Recent study indicates "The role of testing for SIBO in individuals with suspected IBS remains unclear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ford, A. C. | author2 = Spiegel, B. M. | author3 = Talley, N. J. | author4 = Moayyedi, P. |title= Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal= Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |date=August 12, 2009|pmid=19602448|doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2009.06.031|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1279–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The excess hydrogen or methane is assumed to be typically caused by an overgrowth of otherwise normal [[Gut flora|intestinal bacteria]].&lt;ref name = basilisco/&gt;&lt;ref name = eisenmann/&gt;&lt;ref name = simren/&gt;&lt;ref name = hirakawa/&gt;&lt;ref name = bond/&gt;&lt;ref name = ghoshal/&gt;

Other breath tests that can be taken include: sucrose intolerance, d-[[xylose]] and [[sorbitol]].

'''D²B''' ('''Domestic Digital Bus''', '''IEC 61030''') is an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard for a low-speed [[multi-master bus|multi-master]] [[serial communication bus]] for [[home automation]] applications. It was originally developed by [[Philips]] in the 1980s. In 2006 it has been withdrawn by IEC because another standard was proposed, JTC1 SC 83/WG1. There remain many IEC61030-compliant devices, such as some Philips-branded head units and CD changers from car stereos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Car Stereos |url=http://www.onlinecarstereo.com |accessdate=21 April 2013|author=Marjorie M. Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SCART]] connector provides a D²B connection for inter-device communication.

== History ==
Founded in May 2009, Kno was headed by CEO [[Osman Rashid]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16021119?nclick_check=1 |title=Kno: Andreessen Horowitz, others invest $46M in digital textbook startup |format= |work= San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder of [[Chegg]], and CTO Babur Habib, a consumer electronics veteran. The firm received funding from [[Andreessen Horowitz]],&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877020_1877030_2030923,00.html |title=Kno Wants a Slice of Apple |work= Time Magazine|accessdate=2010-11-19 |date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intel Capital]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[FLOODGATE]] and [[GSV Capital]], and was based in Santa Clara, California.

The company initially announced, in June 2010, a line of tablet computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/a-tablet-to-let-students-replace-notebooks-and-textbooks |title=A Tablet to Let Students Replace Notebooks and Textbooks |format= |work= New York Times|accessdate=2010-11-19 |first=Miguel |last=Helft |date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal was to offer a "digital textbook/student platform" aimed at the academic market.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The textbook tablet was available either with a single panel 14.1" touchscreen or with dual 14.1" touchscreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/kno-offers-a-second-lighter-tablet/ |title=Kno Offers a Second, Lighter Tablet Computer For Students |format= |work= New York Times|accessdate=2010-11-19 |first=Miguel |last=Helft |date=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was based on [[Linux]] and [[Webkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/02/kno-dual-screen-tablet-appears-at-d8-we-go-hands-on/ |title=Kno dual-screen tablet appears at D8, we go hands-on |format= |work=Engadget |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the company announced that it had licensed its hardware design to Intel and would instead focus on developing software.&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110408005601/en/Intel-Capital-Advance-Publications-Andreessen-Horowitz-Capital |title=Intel Capital, Advance Publications, Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, FLOODGATE and SV Angels Invest $30 Million in Kno |format= |work= Press release|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the company released an iPad application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110606005790/en/Kno-Unveils-Beta-Textbook-App-iPad-World%E2%80%99s|title=Kno Unveils Beta Textbook App for iPad with World&amp;rsquo;s Largest eTextbook Catalog|website=www.businesswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by versions for the Galaxy Note 10.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120815005341/en/Kno-Education-App-Samsung-GALAXY-Note-10.1|title=Kno Education App and Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 Bring Interactive Textbook Experience to Android|website=www.businesswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android Jelly Bean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kno.textbooks|title=Intel® Education Study App - Android Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 7 &amp; 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/kno-textbooks/c9ca3bf7-7379-4448-aeae-91a8e8d0c075|title=Buy Kno Textbooks - Microsoft Store|website=Microsoft Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Web platforms and devices.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kno.com/account/courseManager&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 the company expanded its catalog of titles from college textbooks to include the [[K-12]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120807005373/en|title=Kno Launches K-12 Digital Textbooks, Empowering Parents to Go Digital at Home|website=www.businesswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lingualeo''' is an educational online platform offering an English language learning service based on gamification methods. Initially a Russian-language service, it is now localized for Turkey and Brazil. As of December 2015, over 13 million people worldwide have used this online service to learn English, 9 million of which are from The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. In May 2017, Lingualeo announced its expansion to Spain and Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Total number of users reached 17,5 million people. Lingualeo is available as an app on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. There is also a web version and as a browser extension for Google Chrome. The company is named after its mascot, Leo the Lion.

== History ==
Lingualeo is Aynur Abdulnasurov’s second educational project. He sold his share in his first project called “Native Speakers Club” (which helped students find teachers) for $250,000 in order to start working on Lingualeo. The service was meant to be a set of creative approaches to learning English online.

In October 2009, Aynur Abdulnasurov traveled to Koh Chang, Thailand with a team of developers in order to work on the service. In the future, this practice became a kind of a tradition. They launched a blog on Habrahabr, describing the process of app development on a tropic island. Lingualeo first came into the spotlight thanks to this blog, which in turn became a prototype for many tech startups and company blogs. In Thailand they came up with an idea to use Leo the lion as a symbol of a student who gets lost in a jungle of new information.

The first version, released in March 2010, didn’t do enough to prompt people to upgrade to the paid service. The company failed to strike a deal with a huge linguistic company, so development was put on hold for six months. In November, Lingualeo received a high rating at Strogino technopark. At the Youth Innovation Congress in Perm, Aynur Abdulnasurov met Sergey Kuznetsov and Egor Rudy (founders of the educational project Eruditor Group), who introduced him to Igor Ryabenky, an angel investor. Lingualeo was valued at $1 million, and the company also raised $200,000 in funding from investors. Also in November, the platform was nominated for the Runet Prize for the first time.

In May 2011, Lingualeo was ranked eighth in a ranking of startup companies compiled by the recruiting agency Pruffi. From December to July, the number of users grew to 200,000 (compared to just 60,000 in December) and paid-service sales increased by 15 times since July. Lingualeo reached a break-even point. The company was named ‘best web-application’ by Mail.ru for the ‘Soft of the year - 2011’ Award. And in August 2011, Lingualeo received a 4.2 million ruble subsidy from The Department of Science, Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship of the Moscow Government. By May 2012, Lingualeo was valued at $10 million. In June, the startup raised $3 million from the venture fund Runa Capital. A team of developers travelled to Sveti Stefan, Montenegro and created a new version of the service for Portuguese speakers in 2.5 months. Lingualeo launched its service in Brazil.

By the end of 2012, Lingualeo’s revenue grew sevenfold. According to Aynur Abdulnasurov, he remained the company’s controlling shareholder. The number of users reached 3 million people, including 100,000 Brazilian users.

In 2013, Lingualeo was listed in Kommersant’s ‘TOP Mobile Apps Pack’ ranking, took third place in Kommersant’s general startup research ranking, and won first place in the ‘Consumer Services’ category. The startup was nominated for the ‘Made in Russia’ award in the “Entrepreneurship” category and for the ‘Runet Prize’ award in the ‘Technologies and Innovations’ category. According to Wired, Lingualeo took seventh place in ‘the hottest Russian startup’ ranking. The service also received the Russian Startup Award in 2013.

In the beginning of 2014, Lingualeo’s founder Aynur Abdulnasurov was ranked 81st on the list of Russian internet-millionaires, compiled by ‘The Firm’s Secret’. The company announced a partnership with Evernote in May, and with TED Conferences in July. As a result, Lingualeo added grammar rules, vocabulary notes, and an interactive video player that enabled users to le.arn English by watching TED Talks.

In the fall, Lingualeo released a TOEFL prep program. By the end of October 2014, the number of users reached 10 million.

In April 2015, Lingualeo introduced its new B2B sales product based on the ilingin.com platform. The product let corporate customers’ staff members to get personalized learning programs that take into account industry specifics, job functions, and language skills of the employee. Lingualeo succeeded in raising $500,000 from Social Discovery Ventures and Runa Capital in May 2015. In August, Pavel Gushin (former Head Editor of Yandex.Maps) joined the team as a Vice-President of Development. In December, Lingualeo made it to Google’s ‘Best apps for Android 2015’ list in the ‘Made in Russia’ category. According to a report from 2015, the company reached a break-even point in July and saw a 7% revenue growth compared to 2014.

In March 2016 Dmitry Stavisky resigned as CEO and Irina Shashkina took over the position. On April 25, Lingualeo announced a relaunch of the platform: now, vocabulary and grammar skills sections are formed automatically. 30 new grammar rules were added to grammar trainings, so all basic grammar structures were covered with more than 500 examples for each rule. New vocabulary trainings were introduced - ‘Savanna’ (aimed at enlarging active vocabulary) and ‘Audiocall’ (aimed at training active listening skills). ‘Gold status’ was replaced by ‘Lingualeo Premium’ and together with ‘Lingualeo Basic’ they presented two ways to use the platform: paid and free, respectively.

In honour of its 6th birthday, Lingualeo held a competition and the winner was awarded two weeks of English learning at a language school in Manchester. In June, Lingualeo was listed in Google Play’s collection in the ‘Best from Russia’ category. In the beginning of 2017, a new section aimed at developing reading comprehension skills was launched on the Lingualeo app for iOS. The set of exercises suits everyone regardless of the user’s language level. In May 2017, Lingualeo announced its expansion to Spain and Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23442">This list contains weapons that are classified as crew-serve or crew service, often mislabeled as [[crew served weapon|crew-served]], as the term is used in the [[United States]] [[military]].

While the general understanding is that crew-serve weapons, unlike individual service weapons, require more than one person to operate them, there are important exceptions in the case of both [[squad automatic weapon]]s (SAW) and [[sniper rifle|special application rifle]]s (SAR).  Within the [[Table of Organization and Equipment]] for both the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], these two classes of weapons are understood to be crew-serve, as the operator of the weapon (identified as a marksman or as a SAW gunner) has an assistant, who carries additional ammunition and associated equipment, acts as a [[Sniper team|spotter]], and is also fully qualified in the operation of the weapon.

      <comment>I would argue that "most" modern PC's these days do NOT have a TV Tuner card.  Can they output to TV via HDMI or DVI?  Yet.  But that's different than "tuning" TV (i.e., intercepting broadcast TV signals).  ~~~~</comment>

A '''multimedia computer''' is a [[computer]] that is optimized for high [[multimedia]] performance.

Early [[home computers]] lacked the power and storage necessary for true multimedia. The games for these systems, along with the [[demo scene]] were able to achieve high sophistication and technical polish using only simple, blocky graphics and digitally generated sound.
The [[Amiga 1000]] from [[Commodore International]] has been called the first multimedia computer.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070407132023/http://www.byte.com/art/9408/sec14/art1.htm] Its groundbreaking animation, graphics and sound technologies enabled multimedia content to flourish. Famous demos such as the [[Amiga#Marketing|Boing Ball]][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ga41edXw3A] and Juggler [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQgJ2jZwu9Y] showed off the Amiga's abilities. Later the [[Atari ST]] series and [[Apple Macintosh II]] extended the concept; the Atari integrated a [[MIDI]] port and was the first computer under US$1000 to have 1 megabyte of RAM which is a realistic minimum for multimedia content and the Macintosh was the first computer able to display true photorealistic graphics as well as integrating a [[CD-ROM]] drive, whose high capacity was essential for delivering multimedia content in the pre-[[Internet]] era.

Multimedia capabilities were not common on [[IBM PC compatible]]s until the advent of [[Windows 3.0]] and the [[Multimedia PC|MPC]] standards in the early 1990s. The original PCs were devised as "serious" business machines and colorful graphics and powerful sound abilities weren't a priority. The few games available suffered from slow video hardware, [[PC speaker]] sound and limited color palette when compared to its contemporaries. But as PCs penetrated the home market in the late 1980s, a thriving industry arose to equip PCs to take advantage of the latest sound, graphics and animation technologies. [[Creative Technology|Creative]]'s [[SoundBlaster]] series of sound cards, as well as [[video cards]] from [[ATi]], [[nVidia]] and [[Matrox]] soon became standard equipment for most PCs sold.

Most PCs today have good multimedia features. They have dual- or single-core CPUs clocked at 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz or faster, at least 1GB of RAM and a 128 MB or higher video card.  Popular graphics cards include Nvidia [[Gforce]] or ATI [[Radeon]]. The [[Intel]] [[Viiv]] platform, and [[Microsoft]] [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] are some of today's products aimed at multimedia computing. 

More recently, high-performance devices have become more compact, and multimedia computer capabilities are found in mobile devices such as the [[Apple iPhone]] and [[Nokia Nseries]], featuring DVD-like video quality, megapixel class cameras, fully capable browser, music and video players, podcasting, blogging, as well as e-mail, instant messaging, presence and internet call (VoIP) functionality. Multiradios help to offer broadband wireless connectivity, including for instance WCDMA/HSDPA and WLAN/Wifi. Devices are also increasingly equipped with GPS receivers and maps applications, providing new capabilities for location-aware services. The Nseries devices are also expandable, allowing for the addition of multiple applications and multimedia content.

'''Nano-scaffolding''' (or nanoscaffolding) is a medical process used to regrow tissue and bone, including limbs and organs. The nano-scaffold is a [[three-dimensional]] structure composed of polymer fibers very small that are scaled from a [[Nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; m) scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://nanoscaffoldtech.com/ May 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by the [[American military]], the [[medical technology]] uses a microscopic apparatus made of fine [[Fiber#Polymer fibers|polymer fibers]] called a scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=941552] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged cells grip to the scaffold and begin to rebuild missing bone and tissue through tiny holes in the scaffold. As tissue grows, the scaffold is absorbed into the body and disappears completely.

Nano-scaffolding has also been used to regrow burned skin. The process cannot grow complex organs like hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/19/nanoscaffolding-regrows-limbs-organs/|title=Nanoscaffolding regrows limbs, organs|date=19 November 2008|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, research on nano-scaffolds dates back to at least the late 1980s when Simon showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as ''in vitro'' cell and tissue substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872_NIH_PHASE_I_FINAL_REPORT_FIBROUS_SUBSTRATES_FOR_CELL_CULTURE_R3RR03544A|title=NIH PHASE I FINAL REPORT: FIBROUS SUBSTRATES FOR CELL CULTURE (R3RR03544A) (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M.|date=1988|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
Nano-scaffolding is very small, 100 times smaller than the human hair and is built out of biodegradable fibers. The use of this scaffolding allows more effective use of stem cells and quicker regeneration. Electrospun [[nanofibers]] are prepared using microscopic tubes that range between 100 and 200 [[nanometers]] in diameter. These entangle with each other in the form of a web as they're produced. [[Electrospinning]] allows the construction of these webs to be controlled in the sense of the tube's diameter, thickness, and the material being used.&lt;ref name="nst"&gt;http://nanoscaffoldtech.com/nanoscaffold.php May 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Nano-scaffolding is placed into the body at the site where the regeneration process will occur. Once injected, [[stem cells]] are added to the scaffolding. Stem cells that are attached to a scaffold are shown to be more successful in adapting to their environment and performing the task of regeneration. The nerve ends in the body will attach to the scaffolding by weaving in-between the openings. This will cause them to act as a bridge to connect severed sections. Over time the scaffolding will dissolve and safely exit the body leaving healthy nerves in its place.

This technology is the combination of stem cell research and [[nanotechnology]]. The ability to be able to repair damaged nerves is the greatest challenge and prize for many researchers as well as a huge step for the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080225085147.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow doctors to repair nerves damaged in an extreme accident, like third degree burns. The technology however, is still in its infancy and is still not capable of regenerating complex organs like a heart, although it can already be used to create skin, bone and nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/19/nanoscaffolding-regrows-limbs-organs/|title=Nanoscaffolding regrows limbs, organs|date=19 November 2008|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nano scaffolding has been shown to be four to seven times more effective in keeping the stem cells alive in the body, which would allow them to perform their job more effectively. This technology can be used to save limbs that would otherwise need amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=25107.php|title=Avoiding amputations - development of nano-scaffold significantly increases effectiveness of angiogenesis treatment|publisher=nanowerk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoscaffolding provides a large [[surface area]] for the material being produced, along with changeable [[chemical]] and [[physical property|physical properties]]. This allows them to be applicable in many different types of technological fields.&lt;ref name="nst"/&gt;

== Mechanical Properties ==
Mechanical properties are one of the most important considerations when designing scaffolds for medical use. If the mechanical properties, in particular the elastic modulus, of the scaffold do not align with those of the host tissue, the scaffold is more likely to inhibit regeneration or mechanically fail.

=== Bone Scaffolds ===
As with natural bone, the primary issue with bone scaffolds is brittle failure. They typically follow linear elastic behavior, and under compressive forces experiences a plateau and recovery reminiscent of cellular solids as well as trabecular bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014296120600723X|title=The mechanical properties and osteoconductivity of hydroxyapatite bone scaffolds with multi-scale porosity|access-date=2017-06-01 | doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.021|volume=28|issue=1|journal=Biomaterials|pages=45–54|author=Woodard Joseph R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elastic modulus of natural bone ranges from 10 to 20 GPa; it requires a high stiffness to withstand constant mechanical load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rho|first=J. Y.|last2=Ashman|first2=R. B.|last3=Turner|first3=C. H.|date=February 1993|title=Young's modulus of trabecular and cortical bone material: ultrasonic and microtensile measurements|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=26|issue=2|pages=111–119|issn=0021-9290|pmid=8429054|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(93)90042-d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone scaffolds must therefore be as stiff as natural bone, or the scaffold will fail through crack nucleation and propagation before the host tissue can regenerate. However, if the scaffold is significantly stiffer than the surrounding tissue, the elastic mismatch and continuity at the scaffold boundary with cause strain in the natural bone and could create unwanted defects.

=== Heart Muscle Scaffolds ===
Cardiac muscle, on the other hand, has an elastic modulus of only around 10 MPa, 3 orders of magnitude smaller than bone. However, it experiences constant cyclic loading as the heart pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. J.|last2=McCulloch|first2=A. D.|last3=ter Keurs|first3=H. E. D. J.|date=March 1998|title=Modelling the mechanical properties of cardiac muscle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610798000133|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=69|issue=2–3|pages=289–331|doi=10.1016/S0079-6107(98)00013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the scaffold must be both tough and elastic, a property achieved using polymeric materials.

=== Spinal Cord Engineering ===
The spinal cord presents yet another challenge in the engineering of mechanical properties for tissue engineering. Discs in the spine are stiff like bone, and must withstand high mechanical loading; this part of the spine must be engineered with a high elastic modulus. The discs are filled with white and grey matter, which are gel-like and much less stiff. In repairing a defect in the grey matter, the modulus must be matched precisely so that the shock-absorbing properties are not affected. A mismatch in elastic modulus will also hinder contact between the regenerative material and the host grey matter as well as the exterior bone layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparrey|first=Carolyn J.|last2=Manley|first2=Geoffrey T.|last3=Keaveny|first3=Tony M.|date=April 2009|title=Effects of White, Grey, and Pia Mater Properties on Tissue Level Stresses and Strains in the Compressed Spinal Cord|journal=Journal of Neurotrauma|volume=26|issue=4|pages=585–595|doi=10.1089/neu.2008.0654|issn=0897-7151|pmc=2877118|pmid=19292657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenPicus is an Italian hardware company who designs and produce Internet of Things system on modules called Flyport. Flyport is [[open hardware]] and the openPicus framework and IDE are [[open software]].&lt;br/&gt;
Flyport is a stand-alone system on module, no external processor is needed to create IoT applications.

==History==
OpenPicus was founded by Claudio Carnevali and Gabriele Allegria during 2011. The idea was to create a hardware and software open platform to speed up the development of professional IoT devices and services.

==Product==
Flyport is a smart and connected system on modules for the [[Internet of Things]]. Flyport is powered by a powerful and light open source framework (based on [[FreeRTOS]]) that manages the [[TCP/IP]] software stack, the user application and the integrated ''web server'''.
Flyport is available in 3 pin compatible versions:
# FlyportPRO Wi-Fi 802.11g
# FlyportPRO GPRS quadband
# FlyportPRO Ethernet

[[File:Flyport.png|800px|frameless|left|Flyport modules]]

Flyport system on module is based on [[Microchip Technology]] PIC24 low power processor. It is used to connect and control systems over Internet through an embedded customizable web server or the standard TCP/IP services. The integrated microcontroller runs the customer application, so no host processor is needed. The pinout is very flexible since it is customizable by software.
 
Flyport can connect with several cloud servers such as Evrthng, [[Xively]], ThingSpeak and many more.

He was born in [[Halden|Fredrikshald]]. He attended middle school in Fredrikshald and technical school in [[Horten]], and then studied chemistry at the [[Fachhochschule|Dresden University of Applied Sciences]]. He graduated in 1880, and worked as an engineer and chemist at the Hafslund Chemical Wood Pulp Factory ({{lang-no|Hafslund Kemiske Træmassefabrik}}) from 1883 to 1889. He came in contact with [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Carl Kellner]], and in 1888 Kellner and [[Edward Partington]] bought the Borregård farm,&lt;ref&gt;http://parareligion.ch/sunrise/kellner.htm&lt;/ref&gt; acquired rights in [[Sarp Falls]], and established the Kellner-Partington Paper Pulp Co.

A '''projection augmented model''' ('''PA model''') is an element sometimes employed in [[virtual reality]] systems. It consists of a physical three-dimensional model onto which a computer image is projected to create a realistic looking object. Importantly, the physical model is the same geometric shape as the object that the PA model depicts.

==Uniting physical and virtual objects==
Spatially augmented reality (SAR) renders virtual objects directly within or on the user's physical space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.scientificcommons.org/42668071]&lt;/ref&gt; A key benefit of SAR is that the user does not need to wear a head-mounted display. Instead, with the use of spatial displays, wide field of view and possibly high-resolution images of virtual objects can be integrated directly into the environment. For example, the virtual objects can be realized by using digital light projectors to paint 2D/3D imagery onto real surfaces, or by using built-in flat panel displays.

Real objects can be physically handled and naturally manipulated to be viewed from any direction, which is essential for ergonomic evaluation and provides a strong sense of palpability.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii &amp; Ullmer, 1997.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although simulated [[haptic feedback]] devices enable some aspects of computer-generated objects to be touched, they can not match this level of functionality.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Wallace, Cheshire &amp; Sener, 2005; Baradaran &amp; Stuerzlinger, 2005; Khoudja, Hafez &amp; Kheddar, 2004{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, therefore, unsurprising that physical objects are still used for many applications, such as [[product design]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutson &amp; Wood, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, computer-generated objects have a key advantage; they provide a level of flexibility that cannot be matched by physical objects. Therefore, a display is needed that somehow joins the real physical world and computer-generated objects together, thus enabling them to be experienced simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gao &amp; Campbell, 2004; Ishii &amp; Ullmer, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tangible user interface]]s (TUI) and [[augmented reality]] both aim to address this issue. TUI systems use real physical objects to both represent and also interact with computer-generated information (Figure 1). However, while TUIs create a physical link between real and computer-generated objects, they do not create the illusion that the computer-generated objects are actually in a user’s real environment. That is the aim of augmented reality.

''Figure 1 Continuum of advanced computer interfaces, based on Milgram and Kishino (1994). ''

Unlike [[virtual reality]] (VR), which immerses a user in a computer-generated environment, augmented reality (AR) joins together physical and virtual spaces by creating the illusion that computer-generated objects are actually real objects in a user’s environment&lt;ref&gt;Azuma et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; (Figure 1). Furthermore, head-mounted-display based AR and VR systems can directly incorporate physical objects. Thus, as a user reaches out to a computer-generated object that they can see, they touch an equivalent physical model that is placed at the same spatial location.&lt;ref&gt;Whitton, Lok, Insko &amp; Brooks, 2005; Billingshurst, Grasset &amp; Looser, 2005; Borst &amp; Volz, 2005; Lee, Chen, Kim, Han &amp; Pan, 2004; Hoffman, Garcia-Palacios, Carlin, Furness &amp; Botella-Arbona, 2003.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such systems enable the computer-generated visual appearance of the object to be dynamically altered, while the physical model provides haptic feedback for the object’s underlying form. However, head-mounted-display based systems require users to wear equipment, which limits the number of people who can simultaneously use the display.

A variant of the AR paradigm that does not suffer from these limitations is spatially augmented reality (Figure 1).&lt;ref&gt;Raskar, Welch, Fuchs, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Spatially augmented reality displays project computer-generated information directly into the user’s environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bimber &amp; Raskar, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are several possible display configurations, the most natural type is the projection augmented model.

==Projection augmented models==
[[Image:Projection Augmented model 1.jpg]]

''Figure 2 The Projection Augmented model concept''

A projection augmented model (PA model) consists of a physical three-dimensional model, onto which a computer image is projected to create a realistic looking object (Figure 2).  Importantly, the physical model is the same geometric shape as the object that the PA model depicts.  For example, the image projected onto the objects shown in Figure 3 provides colour and visual texture, which makes them appear to be made from different materials.

[[Image:Projection Augmented model 2.jpg]]

''Figure 3 An example of a Projection Augmented model (inset - with the projection off).''

PA models use a unique combination of physical objects and computer-generated information, and hence they inherit advantages from both.  ''“The human interface to a physical model is the essence of ‘intuitive’.  There are no widgets to manipulate, no sliders to move, and no displays to look through (or wear).  Instead, we walk around objects, moving in and out to zoom, gazing and focusing on interesting components, all at very high visual, spatial, and temporal fidelity”''.&lt;ref&gt;Raskar, Welch, Low &amp; Bandyopadhyay, 2001, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;  PA models combine the high level of intuitiveness of physical models with the flexibility and functionality of computer graphics, such as the ability to be quickly altered, animated, saved and updated (Jacucci, Oulasvirta, Psik, Salovaara &amp; Wagner, 2005).  Thus, a PA model essentially gives a physical form to a computer-generated object, which a user can touch and grasp with their bare hands.  It is therefore unsurprising that user studies, which compared PA models to other Virtual and Augmented Reality displays, found PA models to be a natural and intuitive type of display (Nam &amp; Lee, 2003; Stevens et al., 2002).

However, the PA model concept is not new.  In fact, one of the first PA model type displays was created over twenty years ago when Naimark built the ‘Displacements’ art installation (Naimark, 1984) and more recently in the “Haunted Mansion” attraction in Disney World (Liljegren &amp; Foster, 1990).  At the time technology did not exist for a PA model to be much more than an artistic statement.  However, given the technology available today and a little “unfettered imagination”, exploring novel projection displays is now “potentially boundless”.&lt;ref&gt;Naimark, 2005, p.605&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in PA model technology has been marked by the recent recreation of Naimark’s ‘Displacements’ installation at SIGGRAPH (Displacements, 2005).  Specifically, new technology has been developed that semi-automates the process of both creating and aligning the physical model and projected image.  This supports multiple projectors, which enables a PA model to be illuminated from every direction.  Furthermore, powerful projectors (2000-3000 lumens) can be used to allow a PA model to be located in a well-lit room (Nam, 2005; Umemoro, Keller &amp; Stappers, 2003).  However, whilst this technology enables a PA model to be a viable and useful type of display, it does not address its main aim.

A PA model aims to create the illusion of actually being the object that it depicts.  For example, when used for a product design application, it is important that a PA model provides a convincing perceptual impression of actually being the final product (Nam, 2006; Saakes, 2006; Verlinden, Horváth &amp; Edelenbos, 2006; Keller &amp; Stappers, 2001).  Similarly, when used for a museum display application to create a replica of an artefact, a PA model aims to create the illusion of being the real artefact (Hirooka &amp; Satio, 2006; Senckenberg Museum, 2006; Bimber, Gatesy, Witmer, Raskar &amp; Encarnacao, 2002; Museum of London, 1999).

However, no previous research has specifically considered this illusion.  Therefore, this thesis defines the ‘Projection Augmented model illusion’ as the situation in which a PA model is perceived to actually be the object that it depicts.  For example, this illusion occurs when a user perceives the PA model in Figure 3 to be real bricks, flower pots, and pieces of wood, as opposed to white models with an image projected onto them.  However, the essence of this illusion does not involve deceiving the user.  A user can perceive a PA model to be the object that it depicts, whilst knowing that it is actually a white model and a projected image.

Technology has been developed to enhance this illusion by increasing the physical similarity between the PA model and the object that it depicts, or in other words, increasing the fidelity of the PA model.  For example, the way in which the specular highlights on an object move as the viewer changes position can be dynamically simulated.  This enables a PA model to appear to be made from a wide range of materials.  For example, a dull clay vase can appear to be made from a shiny plastic material.

However, whether or not the PA model illusion occurs is entirely dependent on a user’s subjective perceptual impression.  Therefore, increasing the fidelity of different aspects of a PA model may each have a different effect on the strength of the illusion.  This is essentially the same as the way in which increasing the fidelity of different aspects of a computer-generated photorealistic image, may each have a different effect on the degree to which the image is perceived to be a real photograph (Longhurst, Ledda &amp; Chalmers, 2003; Rademacher, Lengyel, Cutrell, &amp; Whitted, 2001).  For example, increasing the fidelity of the textures in the image may typically be more important than increasing the fidelity of the shadows.
It cannot therefore be assumed that increasing the fidelity of any aspect of a PA model will automatically strengthen the PA model illusion, and similarly it cannot be assumed that decreasing the fidelity of any aspect will automatically weaken it.  Therefore, given that no previous research has investigated this illusion, it is difficult to determine the success of the technology that aims to enhance it, and difficult to make informed decisions when developing new technology.  The capabilities of the human perceptual system should guide the development of any advanced interface (Stanney et al., 2004), hence this issue needs to be addressed.

Note: Projection Augmented models are sometimes referred to as [[Shader lamps|'Shader Lamps']] (Raskar, Welch, Low &amp; Bandyopadhyay, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;89).

'''Railway archaeology''' is the study and enjoyment of relics from past eras of rail transportation (including railways and tramways of all gauges and sizes). The aim of railway archaeology is to learn about the history and see images of the previous appearance of a defunct rail system that became redundant or abandoned and to enjoy searching out these remains and exploring them.

Railway archaeology comes under the general ambit of the study of the industrial past and therefore is a sub-set of [[Industrial archaeology]].

==Societies undertaking railway archaeology==
The Railway Archaeological Society, a UK-based group that seems to be defunct.

Light Railway Research Society of Australia is an Australian-based society that was formed in 1961 to promote interest in special-purpose railways. Much of its members' work would fall into the category of Railway archaeology.

==Discoveries==
* '''London Bridge Station''' Archaeologists have discovered hundreds of artifacts at an excavation site under the London Bridge Station.  Excavation pits were dug 6 meters deep revealing many artifacts from Roman times, timber piles that were recorded as to be from 59 AD to 83 AD that was used for buildings during the first London Bridge, and Medieval floors.  The Archaeologists continue excavating the site for more artifacts around the 16th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.networkrail.co.uk/archaeological-finds-at-london-bridge-station/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Victorian Era''' Archaeologists in London have discovered a railway infrastructure near the London tube station created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, an engineer that is well known for his invention approximately 200 years ago called the Broad-Gauge Great Western Steam Railway.  The area has evidence of seven foot-wide broad gauge train tracks and buildings from the 1850s.  At the moment, Archaeologists are further researching the site with laser scanning technology for more artifacts of the Victorian-era railway.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art500045-victorian-railway-infrastructure-discovered-by-archaeologists-near-london-tube-station&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also using a series of 3D models of the architecture of the 1850s buildings in order to identify paths of the railway.
* '''Derbyshire''' In May 2013, a group of archaeologists have discovered what is believed as the oldest railway tunnel at Derbyshire in England (United Kingdom.) The tunnel lies on the route of the Butterley Gangroad, a horse-operated railway built by 1793 to link the Cromford Canal with the limestone quarries at Crich.  The line closed in 1933 after being open for over 100 years and the tunnel was sealed up 50 years later in the 1980s.  Trevor Griffin, who is project managing the work for the Derbyshire Archaeological Society, said he thought the tunnel could be older than the one regarded as the world's first - which is also in Derbyshire.  He said: "The tunnel that was currently generally considered to be the world's oldest was on the Peak Forest Tramway and was built in 1795."  The two-year project began in January. The society worked with Wessex Archaeology to reopen the tunnel and made a three-dimensional computer model of the interior using laser scanning.  Written evidence suggested the railway was operating by 1793 and Mr Griffin says they were able to prove the line must have run through the tunnel. The Butterley Gangroad, which was engineered by Benjamin Outram, was modernised in the 1840s and turned into a narrow gauge railway.  When the work is completed, the tunnel will be sealed up for further preservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">'''Railway costing''' is the calculation of the variable and fixed costs of rail movements. Variable costs are those that increase or decrease with changes in the traffic volumes or service levels and include fuel, maintenance and train crew costs, for example. Fixed costs are normally associated with items such as head office, interest charges and other overhead.  Unit costs can then be calculated based on the expenses of the railway divided into standard categories.

==Types of cost==
In order to assist in its deliberations regarding rate and service complaints, the [[Canadian Transportation Agency]] has identified various types of costs. These costs include: 

*the maintenance and operation of way and structures, such as track and roadway, signals, communication, and fuel stations[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*the maintenance and operation of equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, intermodal equipment, and work equipment[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*railway operations, such as train and yard operations, train control, and intermodal[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*general costs, such as general administration, employee benefits, taxes, insurance, purchasing and material stores[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*cost of capital[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*depreciation[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]

==Methodology==
The methodology used in railway costing breaks down the costs of rail traffic to their unit value and from there determines their relationship to traffic handled and service provided. Therefore, as traffic and services change, the effect of these changes can be estimated from the unit values previously determined.  The costing model methodology allows for variable costs to increase as traffic increases, whereas the fixed costs will remain constant, regardless of the overall level of traffic.

==Mathematical models==
Railway costing is typically performed using [[mathematical model]]s. Using unit costs from current operating data and current accounting and operating information, it is possible to develop costing information for the railway. This costing information may be used to estimate the operating cost of a new line and to determine whether it is economically viable. Alternatively, the model could be used to estimate the cost effects of changing speed limits along a route. The savings that can be achieved with a railway costing model are endless. For example, by knowing the costs of doing business, a railway can appropriately determine the tariffs to be charged.

In addition, railway costing models typically handle passenger and freight traffic, making them applicable in more situations, including mixed traffic situations.

some commercial variations of railway costing models have been implemented, including the OSCAR railway costing model developed by [[CPCS Transcom Limited]]. CPCS is an international infrastructure development firm and has successfully used this model in dozens of its projects worldwide.

The Cartage railway costing model was developed by Vectorail, a global supplier of railway costing solutions with more than forty years of experience in the field.

'''Richard M. "Dick" Goldstein''' (born April 1927){{citation needed|date=April 2012}} is an American radar astronomer and planetary scientist, who has been called "The Father of Radar Interferometry."

==Biography==

Richard Goldstein was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. He studied Electrical Engineering at [[Purdue]]. After working at his family furniture store for eleven years, he followed his brother (astronomer [[Samuel J. Goldstein, Jr.]]) to [[California]] and NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].  He is married to Ruth Goldstein (née Lowenstam).

As a graduate student at [[Caltech]] in 1961, Goldstein used the antenna at the [[Goldstone Tracking Station]] to obtain the first realtime radar echos from the planet [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Richard M |last=Goldstein |title=Radar Exploration of Venus |publisher=Caltech |date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1963, Goldstein and co-author had measured the period and retrograde rotation of [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein, RM|author2=Carpenter, RL|journal=Science|date=1963|title=Rotation of Venus - Period Estimated from RADAR Measurements|volume=139|issue=355|doi=10.1126/science.139.3558.910|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/139/3558/910.abstract|pmid=17743054|bibcode = 1963Sci...139..910G|first1=R. M.|pages=910–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using his same techniques, he confirmed Soviet experiments that acquired radar echoes from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=Roland |last2=Goldstein |first2=R. M. |title=Radar Observations of Mercury |journal=Science |volume=142 |date=1963 |pages=381–2|bibcode = 1963Sci...142..381C |doi = 10.1126/science.142.3590.381 |issue=3590 |pmid=17799479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was first to obtain echos from [[Mars]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=R. M. |last2=Gillmore |first2=Willard F. |title=Radar Observations of Mars |journal=Science |volume=141 |date=1963 |pages=1171–1172|bibcode = 1963Sci...141.1171G |doi = 10.1126/science.141.3586.1171-a |issue=3586 |pmid=17751790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Goldstein was the first to obtain a radar echo from an asteroid, when he measured the radar cross section of [[Icarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=R. M. |title=Radar Observations of Icarus |journal=Science |volume=162 |date=1968 |pages=903–904 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3856.903 |pmid=17769079 |issue=3856|bibcode = 1968Sci...162..903G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he also measured the size and rotational period of the nucleus of a comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldstein, RM|author2=Jurgens, RF|author3=Sekanina, Z|title=A RADAR Study of Comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock 1983D|journal=Astronomical Journal|date=1984|volume=89|issue=11|doi=10.1086/113683|bibcode=1984AJ.....89.1745G|pages=1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Goldstein had analyzed the spectrum of radar echos from Venus to obtain the first images of features on the surface of that planet. Later, using range-Doppler and radar interferometric techniques, he was able to create some of the first maps of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=R. M. |last2=Rumsey |first2=Howard C. |title=A Radar Image of Venus |journal=Icarus |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=1972 |pages=699–703 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(72)90034-6 |bibcode=1972Icar...17..699G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was also first to get echos from [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=R. M. |last2=Morris |first2=G. A. |title=Ganymede: Observations by Radar |journal=Science |volume=188 |date=1975 |pages=1211–1212 |doi=10.1126/science.188.4194.1211 |issue=4194|bibcode = 1975Sci...188.1211G |pmid=17818164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later other moons of [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=8|last=Ostro |last2=Campbel |last3=Simpson |last4=Hudson |last5=Chandler |last6=Rosema |last7=Shapiro |last8=Standish |last9=Winkler |last10=Yeomans |last11=Velez |last12=Goldstein |first1=S.

M. |last2=Morris |first2=G. A. |title=Radar Observations of the rings of Saturn |journal=Icarus |volume=20 |issue=3 |date=1973 |pages= 260|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90002-X |bibcode=1973Icar...20..260G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein began work in the mid 1980s on topographical mapping techniques using [[synthetic aperture radar]]. Initially using two antennas (and later a single antenna with a repeated track), he was able to use the phase interferometry to improve over stereoscopic optical mapping techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zebker |first=H. A. |last2=Goldstein |first2=R.

In the 1990s, Goldstein also worked on applying radar techniques for detecting orbital debris. Previous radar approaches were able to detect orbiting objects as small as 5mm. By using short wavelength pulses and a separate antenna to detect echos, Goldstein was able to improve the detection of objects to less than 2mm at a 600&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on Space Debris, National Research Council |title=Orbital debris: a technical assessment |publisher=National Academies Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0309051255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he discovered that the Earth has rings of debris (some apparently left over from the [[West Ford Project]]). He has continued to refine the technique, extending the capabilities to detect 3mm objects as far away as 3200&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=R. M. |last2=Goldstein |first2=S. J. |last3=Kessler |first3=D.

Goldstein is a regular participant and frequent award-winner in the annual JPL Invention Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/inventionchallenge/index.cfm |title=JPL Annual Invention Challenge |accessdate=11 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309073034/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/inventionchallenge/index.cfm |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">A '''Satellite Emergency Notification Device''' or '''SEND''' is a portable emergency notification and locating device which uses commercial satellite systems rather than the [[Cospas|COSPAS-SARSAT]] satellite system. An example of this device is [[SPOT Satellite Messenger|SPOT]].

The devices use an internal [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip to gather location information. When the SEND is triggered, this information is sent via commercial satellite to a commercial monitoring agency whose role is to pass the information to an appropriate responding agency. The responding agency contacted depends, in part, on the location. Examples of responding agencies would be military Search and Rescue, Coast Guard, local police, voluntary Search and Rescue.

Typical users/purchasers of these devices are participants in activities such as hiking, mountain biking, climbing, boating and flying. They are also useful for those who work in remote areas (loggers, foresters, geologists, fisheries and wildlife staff).

Additional features are increasingly being offered: sending preprogrammed messages, breadcrumb tracking via [[Google Earth]]. Some newer devices offer two-way communication via satellite, for example [[DeLorme]]'s inReach Communicator and the Yellowbrick 3 Messenger/Tracker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowbrick-tracking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/YB3_datasheet_en.pdf] Yellowbrick two-way messenger datasheet&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations when buying them, is ensuring that the International Emergency Response Coordination Centre (IERCC) which receives a distress call maintains an accurate and up-to-date database of response agencies to contact and can quickly determine which is appropriate to the situation/location. The commercial, IERCC is GEOS, used by both SPOT and DeLorme SENDs.

The [[USCG|US Coast Guard]]'s National Search and Rescue Committee (NSARC) set up a working group which includes representation from other US agencies, international organizations and device manufacturers to discuss how these "technologies can be properly reviewed and integrated with the SAR response system in the United States"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/nsarc/NSARC_SEND_minutes_Dec09.pdf] NSARC minutes from December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and to aid the [[RTCM|Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM)]] in "development of a minimum operating and performance specification for such devices".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icao.int/icaoimojwg/meetings/jwg16/docs/JWGSAR16_wp09.pdf] Emerging technologies in commercially available alerting devices from [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]/[[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] JOINT WORKING GROUP, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The RTCM working group SC has completed and approved a standard for Emergency Satellite Notification Systems, which was published in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/gmdss/taskForce/TFSR_67.pdf] NATIONAL GMDSS IMPLEMENTATION TASK FORCE&lt;/ref&gt;

BriarTek was granted a US Patent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equipped.org/US7991380_Global_Bidirectional_Beacon_Briartek. pdf] US Patent 7,991,380 B2&lt;/ref&gt; on August 2, 2011 for a "Global Birectional Locator Beacon and Emergency Communications System", which covers SENDs with Receive / Transmit capabilities such as the DeLorme inReach unit.

== inReach ==
inReach, like SPOT, does not use the 406&amp;nbsp;MHz signal nor the system of satellites. Instead, it depends on the Iridium satellite system. Unlike SPOT, inReach is a two way system capable of receiving confirmation that the message was received. Like SPOT, the message is transmitted to the private GEOS International Emergency Response Center who then notifies the appropriate SAR authorities.

inReach also provides tracking capability and two way SMS text messages.

== SPOT ==
SPOT does not use the 406&amp;nbsp;MHz signal nor the system of satellites. Instead, it depends on the [[GlobalStar]] satellite system. It has richer features (for instance, can send many non-emergency signals) - but it does not work in as many places as 406&amp;nbsp;MHz PLBs - for instance under dense forest canopy or steep canyons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equipped.org/SPOT_ORSummer2007.htm SPOT Satellite Messenger FIRST LOOK - EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE (tm)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When a user presses the "911" button on a SPOT device an emergency message containing the unit's identification and GPS location is transmitted to the GEOS International Emergency Response Center who then notifies the appropriate emergency agency for the region after first calling the user to ensure the transmission is not accidental.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=104 SPOT Emergency Response]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosalliance.com/sar/ GEOS Search And Rescue]&lt;/ref&gt;

SPOT additionally has the ability to provide non-emergency web based tracking information. This allows family or friends at home to track the holder's progress. The tracking operates by sending a tracking signal to the [[GlobalStar]] network every 10 minutes. This feature can additionally be useful to provide location of an individual even if the individual is unable to activate the emergency '911' button.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=104 How SPOT works]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical costs are $169 plus a $99/year service fee for basic services or $150/yr for basic services and tracking services, as compared to around $250 for a 406-MHz PLB with no service fee.

== Yellowbrick ==
Yellowbrick, like SPOT, does not use the 406&amp;nbsp;MHz signal nor the system of satellites. Instead, it depends on the Iridium satellite system. Unlike SPOT, Yellowbrick is a two way system capable of receiving confirmation that the message was received and exchange two-way messages via short emails and SMS. Alert messages are transmitted to destinations specified by the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowbrick-tracking.com/ Yellowbrick Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722152215/http://www.yellowbrick-tracking.com/|date=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[microelectronics]] industry a '''semiconductor fabrication plant''' (commonly called a '''fab'''; sometimes '''foundry''') is a factory where devices such as [[integrated circuits]] are manufactured.

A business that operates a semiconductor fab for the purpose of fabricating the designs of other companies, such as [[fabless semiconductor company|fabless semiconductor companies]], is known as a foundry.  If a foundry does not also produce its own designs, it is known as a [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]].

Fabs require many expensive devices to function. Estimates put the cost of building a new fab over one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[United States dollars|U.S. dollars]] with values as high as $3–4 billion not being uncommon. [[TSMC]] invested $9.3 billion in its ''Fab15'' 300 mm [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] manufacturing facility in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&amp;language=E&amp;newsid=5041TSMC Begins Construction on Gigafab In Central Taiwan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129181137/http://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&amp;language=E&amp;newsid=5041TSMC |date=2012-01-29 }}, issued by TSMC, 16 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same company estimations suggest that their future fab might cost $20 billion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3018890/tsmc-says-3nm-plant-could-cost-it-more-than-usd20bn|title=TSMC says 3nm plant could cost it more than $20bn - TheINQUIRER|author=|date=|website=theinquirer.net|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012043608/https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3018890/tsmc-says-3nm-plant-could-cost-it-more-than-usd20bn|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central part of a fab is the [[clean room]], an area where the environment is controlled to eliminate all dust, since even a single speck can ruin a microcircuit, which has features much smaller than dust.  The clean room must also be damped against vibration and kept within narrow bands of temperature and humidity. Controlling temperature and humidity is critical for minimizing static electricity.

The clean room contains the [[stepper]]s for [[photolithography]], [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]], cleaning, [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] and [[Wafer dicing|dicing]] machines.  All these devices are extremely precise and thus extremely expensive. Prices for most common pieces of equipment for the processing of 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers range from $700,000 to upwards of $4,000,000 each with a few pieces of equipment reaching as high as $130,000,000 each (e.g. steppers). A typical fab will have several hundred equipment items.

==History==
Typically an advance in chip-making technology requires a completely new fab to be built. In the past, the equipment to outfit a fab was not very expensive and there were a huge number of smaller fabs producing chips in small quantities. However, the cost of the most up-to-date equipment has since grown to the point where a new fab can cost several billion dollars.

Another side effect of the cost has been the challenge to make use of older fabs. For many companies these older fabs are useful for producing designs for unique markets, such as [[embedded processor]]s, [[flash memory]], and [[microcontroller]]s. However, for companies with more limited product lines, it's often best to either rent out the fab, or close it entirely. This is due to the tendency of the cost of upgrading an existing fab to produce devices requiring newer technology to exceed the cost of a completely new fab.

There has been a trend to produce ever larger [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s, so each process step is being performed on more and more chips at once. The goal is to spread production costs (chemicals, fab time) over a larger number of saleable chips.  It is impossible (or at least impracticable) to retrofit machinery to handle larger wafers.  This is not to say that foundries using smaller wafers are necessarily obsolete; older foundries can be cheaper to operate, have higher yields for simple chips and still be productive.

The current, as of 2014, state-of-the-art for wafer size is 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12&amp;nbsp;in). The industry is aiming to move to the 450&amp;nbsp;mm wafer size by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011ITRS/2011Chapters/2011ExecSum.pdf 2011 Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084135/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011ITRS/2011Chapters/2011ExecSum.pdf |date=2012-07-10 }} - [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of March&amp;nbsp;2014, [[Intel]] expects 450&amp;nbsp;mm deployment by 2020.&lt;ref name="intel450mm"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.timesunion.com/business/intel-says-450mm-will-deploy-later-in-decade/59430/ | title = Intel says 450&amp;nbsp;mm will deploy later in decade | date = 2014-03-18 | accessdate = 2014-05-31 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010946/http://blog.timesunion.com/business/intel-says-450mm-will-deploy-later-in-decade/59430/ | archivedate = 2014-05-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a large push to completely automate the production of semiconductor chips from beginning to end. This is often referred to as the "[[lights out (manufacturing)|lights-out fab]]" concept. 

The International Sematech Manufacturing Initiative (ISMI), an  extension of the US consortium [[SEMATECH]], is sponsoring the  "300&amp;nbsp;mm Prime" initiative.  An important goal of this initiative is to enable fabs to produce greater quantities of smaller chips as a response to shorter lifecycles seen in consumer electronics.  The logic is that such a fab can produce smaller lots more easily and can efficiently switch its production to supply chips for a variety of new electronic devices.  Another important goal is to reduce the waiting time between processing steps.&lt;ref&gt;Chip Makers Watch Their Waste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISMI Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Short Message Service Center''' ('''SMSC''') is a network element in the [[mobile phone|mobile]] telephone network. Its purpose is to store, forward, convert and deliver [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) messages.

The full designation of an SMSC according to 3GPP is ''Short Message Service - Service Center (SMS-SC).''

Basic Trajectories of SMS are
# From mobile to another mobile - referred to as MO-MT (Mobile Originated - Mobile Terminated)
# From mobile to a content provider (also known as Large Account / ESME) - referred to as MO-AT (Mobile Originated - Application Terminated)
# From application to a mobile - referred to as AO-MT (Application Originated - Mobile Terminated)

==Operation==
The tasks of an SMSC can be described as
# Reception of text messages (SMS) from wireless network users
# Storage of text messages
# Forwarding of text messages
# Delivery of text messages (SMS) to wireless network users
# Maintenance of unique time stamps in text messages

When a user ''sends'' a text message (SMS message) to another user, the message gets stored in the SMSC (short message service centre), which delivers it to the destination user when they are available. This is a [[Store-and-forward switching center|store and forward]] option.

An SMS centre (SMSC) is responsible for handling the SMS operations of a wireless network. 

# When an SMS message is sent from a mobile phone, it will first reach an SMS centre.
# The SMS centre then forwards the SMS message towards the destination.
# The main duty of an SMSC is to route SMS messages and regulate the process. If the recipient is unavailable (for example, when the mobile phone is switched off), the SMSC will store the SMS message.
# It will forward the SMS message when the recipient is available and the message's expiry period is not exceeded.

SMSCs can be used to interface with other applications, for example a spreadsheet can interface with the SMSC allowing messages to be sent SMS from an [[Microsoft Excel|Excel spreadsheet]], or to send an SMS from Excel. Inbound messages to a long number or short code can also be passed through the SMSC allowing m2m communications or Telematics.

===Validity period of an SMS message===
An SMS message is stored temporarily in the SMS center if the recipient mobile phone is unavailable. It is possible on most mobile handsets to specify an expiry period after which the SMS message will be deleted from the SMS center. Once deleted, the SMS message will no longer be available for dispatch to the recipient mobile phone (even if it comes on line). The validity period should be regarded by the handset user as a request, as the SMSC itself can be configured to ignore or otherwise handle message delivery schedules.

===Message status reports===
The SMS sender needs to set a flag in the SMS message to notify the SMS centre that they want the status report about the delivery of this SMS message. This is usually done by changing a Setting on the mobile handset.

It should not be confused with [[false pregnancy]], where a person mistakenly believes that they are pregnant.

== Techniques ==
People who wish to ''look'' pregnant, generally for social, sexual, entertainment, or psychological purposes, have the option of body suits and the like to wear under their clothes. It can be done by using [[pillows]] or pads, or light-weighing, small balls with a round shape to simulate a pregnant abdomen. A common practice is to place a form replicating a belly (rolled up clothes, deflated ball, etc.) under a skin colored, tight bodysuit. This creates a realistic color and shape.

== Reasons ==
The reasons for a person to desire a simulated pregnancy vary greatly from one individual to another.  It could be an intellectual curiosity, a cosmetic effect or social experiment, an erotic or sexual experience, or part of a larger psychological issue. A simulated pregnancy may in some cases be a manifestation of [[factitious disorder]].

[[File:Sony Watchman TV FD-10A Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|Sony FD-10 Pocket Watchman]]
The '''Sony Watchman''' is a line of portable [[Handheld television|pocket televisions]] trademarked and produced by [[Sony]]. The line was introduced in 1982 and discontinued in 2000.

==FD-210==
The initial model was introduced in 1982 as the FD-210, which had a grayscale five [[centimeter]] display. The device weighed around 650 [[gram]]s, with a measurement of 87 x 198 x 33 [[millimeter]]s. The device was sold in Japan with a price of 54,800 [[yen]]. Roughly two years later, in 1984, the device was introduced to [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

==Later releases==
[[File:Sony watchman models.jpg|thumb|Various models of Sony Watchmen]]
Sony manufactured more than 65 models of the Watchman before its discontinuation in 2000. Upon the release of further models after the FD-210, the display size increased, and new features were introduced. The FD-3, introduced in 1987, had a built-in digital clock. The FD-30, introduced in 1984 had a built-in AM/FM Stereo radio. The FD-40/42/44/45 were among the largest Watchmen, utilizing a 4" CRT display. The FD-40 introduced a single composite A/V input. The FD-45, introduced in 1986, was water-resistant. In 1988/1989, the FDL 330S color Watchman TV/Monitor with LCD display was introduced. In 1990, the FDL-310, a Watchman with a color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] was introduced. The FD-280/285, made from 1990 to 1994, was the last Watchman to use a black and white CRT display. One of the last Watchmen was the FDL-22 introduced in 1998, which featured an ergonomic body which made it easier to hold, and introduced Sony's ''Straptenna'', where the wrist strap served as the antenna.

==Legacy==
Due to the switch of television broadcasts to digital, most models of the Sony Watchman have lost their usefulness, because they now require to be connected to a digital converter box.

==Marketing and media==
A model of the Sony Watchman is seen multiple times in the film [[Rain Man]].

Mathematically, turn by turn navigation is based on the [[shortest path problem]] within [[graph theory]], which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc.) between two points in a large network.
