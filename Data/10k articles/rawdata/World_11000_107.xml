'''''1985''''' is a sequel to [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/1985-What-Happens-After-Brother/dp/0394537807|title=1985: What Happens After Big Brother Dies|last=Dalos|first=György|date=1983|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=9780394537801|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author [[György Dalos]], originally published in 1983, this novel begins with the death of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] and reflects an intermediate  period between 1984 and a more optimistic future characterized with a decline in orthodoxy of the totalitarian system, struggles of the ensuing powers and the near destruction of the [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] air force by [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">The '''Association of Provinces of the Netherlands''' (''Interprovinciaal Overleg''; IPO) is the association of the twelve [[provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] of the [[Netherlands]].  The association looks after provincial interests and forms a platform for exchanging knowledge and experience among the twelve Dutch provinces.  The IPO also stimulates and takes the initiative in reform programmes.  

The executive of the IPO consists of thirteen members, made up of one from each province (who can be a member of that province's ''[[Gedeputeerde Staten]]'', or its [[Queen's Commissioner]]) plus a chairman.  The present chairman is [[Jan Franssen]], Queen's Commissioner in [[South Holland|Zuid-Holland]].  The IPO's general assembly is made up of sixty members of the [[States-Provincial]] (5 from each province).  

The office of the IPO presents provincial interests through relations with the central government, the [[European Union]], the [[Association of Netherlands Municipalities]], the [[Unie van Waterschappen]] and with social organizations.

'''BSF''' is the [[callsign]] of the [[time signal]] transmitter for [[Taiwan]], which transmits [[time]] information on 77.5&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz|kHz]] in the [[longwave]] range, and 5&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]] &amp; 15&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[shortwave]] range from [[Chung-Li]]. The [[longwave]] transmitter, which uses a T-antenna is situated at {{Coord|24|03|59|N|120|25|18|E|type:landmark_region:TW-CHA|name=BSF Time Signal Transmitter|display=it}}.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Due to "low demand", the short wave of BSF was discontinued as of July 1, 2004. The time signal is currently transmitted at a low frequency of 77.5 kHz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stdtime.gov.tw/chinese/index_c/c_1.htm |title=Standard Time and Frequency Broadcast}} - in chinese&lt;/ref&gt;

== Longwave transmitter ==
The longwave transmitter of the station uses 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]] of power, achieving an [[effective radiated power]] of 460&amp;nbsp;W.  Each second, two bits of information are transmitted using [[amplitude-shift keying]], making 120 bits per minute.

The format is similar to that of [[WWVB]], reducing the carrier amplitude by {{val|10|u=dB}} on the second, and encoding information via the time when it is restored.  However, BSF uses five possible times to communicate two data bits per second, or a special synchronization mark:

* 0.2 seconds of reduced power and 0.8 s of full power means 00
* 0.4 seconds of reduced power and 0.6 s of full power means 01
* 0.6 seconds of reduced power and 0.4 s of full power means 11
* 0.8 seconds of reduced power and 0.2 s of full power means 10
* No reduced power and 1.0 s of full power means SYNCH, a synchronization mark

Note that the data is [[Gray code]]d so that confusion between 0.4 and 0.6 seconds of full power will only corrupt one data bit, and thus be detectable by the parity bits.

Each minute is divided into two blocks.  The first 40 seconds are used to broadcast 76 bits of non-time information (weather, disaster warnings, etc.), and the last 20 seconds are used to broadcast the time, as follows:

Although bits are reserved for [[daylight saving time]] information, they are currently always broadcast as zero, as Taiwan does not observe DST.

== Shortwave transmitter ==
The shortwave transmitter on 5&amp;nbsp;MHz operates continuously, while that on 15&amp;nbsp;MHz has an interruption from 35 to 40 minutes after the hour. Except for this, the broadcast repeats every 10 minutes.

Each second is marked with a 5&amp;nbsp;ms tick of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, [[amplitude modulated]].  At the start of each minute, the tick is lengthened to 300&amp;nbsp;ms.  [[DUT1]] is transmitted by doubling some ticks: seconds :01 through :08 for DUT1 of +0.1 through +0.8 seconds, and seconds :09 through :16 for DUT1 from &amp;minus;0.1 through &amp;minus;0.8 seconds.

Each tick is preceded and followed by 40&amp;nbsp;ms of silence.  The remaining "background" is filled on a 10-minute schedule:
* For the first 5 minutes (:x0:00 through :x4:59), a background 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tone is transmitted.
* For the next 4 minutes (:x5:00 through :x8:59), no background tone is transmitted, only the ticks.
* During minute 9 (:x9:00 through :x9:59), voice call sign and time announcements are made in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]].

This schedule repeats every ten minutes, on the hour, except for the previously mentioned 5-minute  interruption on 15&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The '''Company of Guinea''' was an official [[Portugal|Portuguese]] governing institution whose task was to deal with spices imported during the [[Age of Discovery]]. It was called ''Casa da Guiné'' ('''House of Guinea'''), ''Casa da Guiné e Mina'' from 1482 to 1483 and ''Casa da Índia e da Guiné'' in 1499, or simply ''[[Casa da Índia]]''. It monitored and enforced the Crown's monopoly, coordinated voyages, maintained warehouses, fixed prices, and performed other roles associated with the [[Spice trade]].

{{EU history}}
The '''Del Bo Authority''' was the last [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority of the]] [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), between 1963 and 1967. Its president was [[Rinaldo Del Bo]] of [[Italy]]. Del Bo was briefly followed by [[Albert Coppé]]'s [[Coppé Authority|interim Authority]].

There were only five High Authorities, this being the last, before ECSC was merged with the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in 1967 to become the [[European Community]].

When they were created, the Authorities of the Atomic Energy and Economic Communities were called "Commissions", and that name was kept after the three bodies merged rather than "High Authority", hence no Authority exists today.

Del Bo's term was until 19 December 1963 but had it extended on 10 January 1964 until 8 March 1967 when he resigned.&lt;ref name="ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=3526"&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=3526 Members of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, 1963–1967] European NAvigator (ena.lu)&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication has not been labeled as the "Fifth Theory of the Press", with "social transformation and development", and "the fulfillment of basic needs" as its primary purposes.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Flor, Alexander G. (2007). Development Communication Praxis, Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; Jamias articulated the philosophy of development communication which is anchored on three main ideas.

Laguna, Philippines: Department of Development Communication, College of Agriculture, UPLB.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora C.

Nora Cruz-Quebral, ''Ph.D.'', in the lecture she delivered for an Honorary Doctorate at the London School of Economics, University of London in December 2011, clearly accounted that the Development Communication was first articulated on December 10, 1971 at the University of the Philippines in Los Banos ([[UPLB]]). At that time, the UPLB College of Agriculture held a symposium (in honor of Dr. Dioscoro L. Umali, a national scientist in the area of plant breeding) titled "In Search of Breakthroughs in Agricultural Development".&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, N. C. (2011). DevCom Los Banos Style. Lecture delivered during the Honorary Doctorate Celebration Seminar, LSE, University of London, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent and more encompassing [[definition]] of development communication states that it is:
&lt;references group="Quebral, N. C. (2011). DevComm Los Banos Style. Lecture delivered at the Honorary Doctorate Celebration Seminar, LSE, University of London, December 2011." /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''...the art and science of human communication linked to a society's planned transformation from a state of poverty to one dynamic socio-economic growth that makes for greater equality and the larger unfolding of individual potentials.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

[[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] defined it as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Development support communications is a discipline in development planning and implementation in which more adequate account is taken of human behavioural factors in the design of development projects and their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogan | first1 = C.L. | year = 1982 | title = Development journalism/communication: The status of the concept | url = | journal = [[International Communication Gazette]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 1–13 | doi = 10.1177/001654928202900101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the World Bank, the Development Communication is the "integration of strategic communication in development projects" based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

In addition, the UNICEF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/|title = COMMUNICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT GOES BEYOND PROVIDING INFORMATION|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; views it as:

"...a two-way process for sharing ideas and knowledge using a range of communication tools and approaches that empower individuals and communities to take actions to improve their lives." The Thusong government center described it as "providing communities with information they can use in improving their lives, which aims at making public programmes and policies real, meaningful and sustainable".&lt;ref name="Thusong"&gt;{{cite web

Bessette (2006) defined development communication as a "planned and systematic application of communication resources, channels, approaches and strategies to support the goals of socio-economic, political and cultural development".&lt;ref name="Bassette, Guy 2006"&gt;Bassette, Guy. 2006. People, Land, and Water: Participatory Development Communication for Natural Resource Management. London: Earthscan and the International Development Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} Development communication is essentially participatory, because, according to Ascroft and Masilela (1994) "participation translates into individuals being active in development programmes and processes; they contribute ideas, take initiative and articulate their needs and their problems, while asserting their autonomy."&lt;ref name="Bassette, Guy 2006" /&gt;

Who are development communicators? What qualities do they possess? Nora C. Quebral&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Development Communication Primer|last = |first = |publisher = Penang: Southbound|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a succinct characterization:

# They understand the process of development, the process of communication, and the environment in which the two processes interact.
# They are knowledgeable in communication skills and techniques as well as proficient in subject matter to be communicated.
# They have internalized the values inherent in equity and the unfolding of individual potential.
# They have firsthand knowledge of the several kinds of end-users of development communication.
# They have a sense of commitment, the acceptance of individual responsibility for advancing human development.

=== Concepts ===

According to Felstehausen (1973), conventional theoretical assumptions are drawn from development communications research and are challenged on the grounds that as theoretical concepts they are inadequate guides to the selection of data and the resolution of development problems. The first conceptual fallacy results from the regular practice of choosing operational examples and analogies from the experiences of developed rather than underdeveloped countries. This is especially evident in terms of a bias favoring technology (especially U.S. technology) as a correlate to communication phenomena and as a solution to development problems. The second fallacy results from the use of inappropriate and frequently untested theoretical models within communication research causing a distorted view of the role of communication in relation to social and behavioral systems. The first issue is argued by presenting a review of empirical studies which show that communication processes and the adoption of new technology does not go on apart from the factors which define the behavior of the social, economic and political system. Correlational analyses are of little value in explaining communication processes, or in establishing their role in relation to development. The second issue is addressed by suggesting that communication is to be viewed as part of a social interaction theory in which communication is treated as a process which unveils and transforms reality in the exchange of information among persons. Communication can be defined as a process of accumulating and integrating intelligence. This reformulation shifts the research focus from questions of how communication functions to change persons (senders or receivers), to how it functions to change and transform ideas. Concepts, ideas, interests and positions can then be used as the primary units of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Conceptual Limits of Development Communications Theory |last = Felstehausen|first = H.|date = January 1973|journal = Sociologia Ruralis |volume=13 |issue=1 |p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The practice of development communication began in the 1940s, but widespread application came about after [[World War II]]. The advent of [[communication sciences]] in the 1950s included recognition of the field as an academic discipline, led by [[Daniel Lerner]], [[Wilbur Schramm]] and [[Everett Rogers]]. Both Childers and Quebral stressed that DC includes all means of communication, ranging from mass media to person to person.

According to Quebral (1975), the most important feature of Philippines-style development communications is that the government is the "chief designer and administrator of the master (development) plan wherein, development communication, in this system then is purposive, persuasive, goal-directed, audience-oriented, and interventionist by nature".&lt;ref name="ManyozoAJC"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Manyozo  |first=Linje |author-link= |title=Manifesto for Development Communication: Nora C. Quebral and the Los Baños School of Development Communication |journal=[[Asian Journal of Communication]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=79–99 |date=March 2006  |doi= 10.1080/01292980500467632 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;  |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic schools ==

Various schools of development communication arose in response to challenges and opportunities in individual countries. Manyozo (2006) broke the field into six schools. The "Bretton Woods" school was originally dominant in international literature. The others were the Latin American, Indian, African, Los Baños and participatory schools.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

=== Catholic social change ===

While not per se an academic school, the Church has been conducting "development communication" for many decades. The Catholic Church's social teachings and moral norms parallel those of social development. ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the New Things), for example, an encyclical written in 1891 by [[Pope Leo XIII]] critiqued social ills and promoted "the Catholic doctrine on work, the right to property, the principle of collaboration instead of class struggle as the fundamental means for social change, the rights of the weak, the dignity of the poor and the obligations of the rich, the perfecting of justice through charity, on the right to form professional associations"{{sfn|Leo XIII|1891|p=144}}In 1961, [[Pope John XXIII]], writing on the topic "Christianity and Social Progress", produced an encyclical entitled ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' (Mother and Teacher), which taught that the "Church is called in truth, justice and love to cooperate in building with all men and women an authentic communion. In this way, economic growth will not be limited to satisfying men's needs, but it will also promote their dignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_15051961_mater_en.html|title=John XXIII – Mater et Magistra |publisher=Vatican.va | page=161|year=1961|accessdate=17 October 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1967, [[Pope Paul VI]] published ''[[Populorum Progressio]]''(Progressive Development). In it the Pope underscored the importance of justice, peace, and development by declaring that "development is the new name of peace". Addressing development workers, he said, "genuine progress does not consist in wealth sought for personal comfort or for its own sake; rather it consists in an economic order designed for the welfare of the human person, where the daily bread that each man receives reflects the glow of brotherly love and the helping hand of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul VI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_26031967_populorum_en.html |title=Populorum Progressio |publisher=Vatican.va |page=86 |date=1967 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope John VI wrote that the Church's very nature was missionary (''[[Lumen gentium]]'' – Light of the Nations), and its deepest identity (''[[Evangelii nuntiandi]]'' – Sharing the Gospel)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19751208_evangelii-nuntiandi_en.html |title=Evangelii nuntiandi – Paolo VI |publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; embracing the entire life of the Church (''[[Redemptoris missio]]'' – Mission of the Redeemer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_07121990_redemptoris-missio_en.html |title=Redemptoris missio, Encyclical Letter, John Paul II|publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content communicated through mission is transformative and liberating—manifested in the message to the poor, setting the captives free, giving sight to the blind ({{Bibleverse||Luke|4:18|KJV}}), defending the interest of ordinary laborers and the value of work (''[[Laborem exercens]]'' – Through Work),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens_en.html |title=Laborem Exercens, Encyclical Letter, John Paul II, 14 September 1981|publisher=Vatican.va|date=14 September 1981 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the welfare of the widows and the orphans and protecting the rights of children and infants (''[[Pacem in terris]]'' – Peace on Earth).&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem_en.html |title=Encyclical ''Pacem in terris'' of John XXIII, 11 April 1963 |publisher=Vatican.va |page=12 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928182928/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem_en.html |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of engagement for social transformation and development is also asserted in the [[Catechism]] of the Catholic Church, which states that, "as far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life; the manner of this participation may vary from one country or culture to another... as with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in realizing the common good calls for a continually renewed conversion of the social partners" (pp. 1915–1916). Moreover, ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' (Joy and Hope), commonly referred to as the Magna Carta of the Catholic Church's teaching on human dignity, states, "to satisfy the demands of justice and equity, strenuous efforts must be made, without disregarding the rights of persons or the natural qualities of each country, to remove as quickly as possible the immense economic inequalities which now exist and in many cases are growing and which are connected with individual and social discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |title=Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Word – ''Gaudium et spes'' |publisher=Vatican.va |pages=66 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017073250/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of many organizations and individual members of the Catholic Church in highlighting the plight of the needy and reaching out to the disadvantaged through works in education, health, livelihood projects, among others, serves as a concrete example of a Church that communicates a transformative and life-changing message.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, Tony. The Catholic Church and Social Policy. In 'The Furrow'. Vol. 49, No. 4, April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church advocates "establishing new relationships in human society, under the mastery and guidance of truth, justice, charity and freedom—relations between individual citizens, between citizens and their respective States, between States, and finally between individuals, families, intermediate associations and States on the one hand, and the world community on the other".&lt;ref name="vatican.va" /&gt; Pope John Paul II, touching in part on Quebral's (2007) thought on 'development communication in a borderless world',&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, Nora C. 2007. Reflections on Development Communication: Update on Development Communication. In 'Philippine Communication Today'. Maslog, Crispin C. Editor. Quezon City, Phil.: New Day Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; instructed Christian communicators to "interpret modern cultural needs, committing themselves to approaching the communications age not as a time of alienation and confusion, but as a valuable time for the quest for the truth and for developing communion between persons and peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II. 2002. Address to the Participants in the Conference For Those Working in Communications and Culture Promoted by the Italian Bishops' Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bretton Woods ===

The Bretton Woods school of development communication paralleled the economic strategies outlined in the [[Marshall Plan]], the [[Bretton Woods system]] and of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1944.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}&lt;ref name="ManyozoMazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comminit.com/early-child/content/cfsc-pioneer-honouring-nora-quebral|title=CFSC Pioneer: Honouring Nora Quebral |last=Manyozo |first=Linje|year=2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The little-used name served to differentiate the original paradigm from other schools that evolved later.{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}} Leading theorists included Daniel Lerner, Wilbur Schramm and Everett Rogers. Due to his pioneering influence, Rogers was referred to as "one of the founding fathers of development communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adhikarya |first1=R. |title=A Personal Tribute to Everett Rogers |journal=Media Asia |date=20 May 2016 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=123–126 |doi=10.1080/01296612.2004.11726745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to development communication was criticized by Latin American researchers such as [[Luis Ramiro Beltan]] and Alfonso Gumucio Dagron, because it emphasized problems in the developing nation rather than its unequal relation with developed countries. They claimed that it proposed [[industrial capitalism]] as a universal solution and that many projects failed to address obstacles such as lack of access to land, agricultural credits, and fair market prices.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Failed projects in the 1960s led to revisions.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} Manyozo found that the school had been the most dynamic in testing and adopting new approaches and methodologies.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

Institutions associated with the Bretton Woods school of development communication include:
[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)
[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO)
[[Rockefeller Foundation]]
[[Department for International Development]], United Kingdom
[[Ford Foundation]]

=== Latin America ===

The Latin American school of development communication predates the Bretton Woods school, emerging in the 1940s with the efforts of Colombia's [[Radio Sutatenza]] and Bolivia's [[Radios Mineras]]. They pioneered participatory and educational approaches to empowering the marginalised. In effect, they served as the earliest models for [[participatory broadcasting]] efforts around the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In the 1960s [[Paolo Freire]]'s theories of [[critical pedagogy]] and Miguel Sabido's enter-educate method became important elements of the Latin American development communication school.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Singhal, Everett M. Rogers (1999).{{google books|id=FWNPUpuLav4C|pg=49}}, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-3350-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Singhal, Michael J. Cody, Everett M. Rogers, Miguel Sabido (2004).{{google books|id=FWNPUpuLav4C|pg=49}} Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential theorists include Juan Diaz Bordenave, Luis Ramiro Beltran, and [[Alfonso Gumucio Dagron]] (Manyozo 2006, Manyozo, 2005).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

In the 1990s, technological advances facilitated social change and development: new media outlets emerged, cable TV reached more regions, and the growth of local communication firms paralleled the growth of major media corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peirano|first=Luis|title=CFSC Analysis and Opinion: Developing a Unique Proposal for Communication for Development in Latin America|url=http://www.comminit.com/sbcs2016/content/cfsc-analysis-and-opinion-developing-unique-proposal-communication-development-latin-ame|work=MAZI Articles|publisher=Communication for Social Change Consortium, Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

Organized development communication in India began with rural radio broadcasts in the 1940s. Broadcasts adopted indigenous languages to reach larger audiences.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Organized efforts in India started with community development projects in the 1950s. The government, guided by socialist ideals and politicians, started many development programs. [[Field publicity]] was employed for person-to-person communication. The radio played an important role in reaching the masses because literacy was low. Educational institutions – especially agricultural universities, through their extension networks – and international organizations under the [[United Nations]] umbrella experimented with development communication.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) relied on close inter-personal relations among communicators.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Communication from the government was more generic and unidirectional. So-called Public Information Campaigns were government-sponsored public fairs in remote areas that presented entertainment along with information on social and developmental schemes. Villagers engaged in competitions to attract attendees. Public and private organizations sponsored stalls in the main exhibition area. Development agencies and service/goods providers also attended. Some state governments employed this model.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Community radio was used in rural India. NGOs and educational institutions created local stations to broadcast information, advisories and messages on development. Local participation was encouraged. Community radio provided a platform for villagers to publicize local issues, offering the potential to elicit action from local officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The widespread adoption of mobile telephony in India created new channels for reaching the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Indian Phone Book| last=Doron |first=Assa |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

The African school of development communication sprang from the continent's post-colonial and communist movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Anglophone Africa employed radio and theatre for community education, adult literacy, health and agricultural education (Kamlongera, 1983, Mlama, 1971).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

In 1994, the [[FAO]] project "Communication for Development in Southern Africa" was a pioneer in supporting and enhancing development projects and programs through the use of participatory communication. The FAO project, placed under SADC, developed an innovative methodology known as [[Participatory Rural Communication Appraisal]] (PRCA), which combined participatory tools and techniques with a strong communication focus needed to enhance projects results and sustainability. FAO and SADC published a handbook on PRCA that was used in projects around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The radio maintained a strong presence in research and practice into the 21st century. Radio was especially important in rural areas, as the work of the non-governmental organization [[Farm Radio International]] and its members across sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated. Knowledge exchange between development partners such as agricultural scientists and farmers were mediated through rural radio (Hambly Odame, 2003).

=== Philippines ===

Systematic study and practice began at the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] in the 1970s, through the establishment of the Department of Development Communication in the College of Agriculture,&lt;ref name="Quebral, N.C. 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quebral | first1 = N.C. | year = 1975 | title = Development communication: Where does it stand today? | url = | journal = Media Asia | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 197–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which offered undergraduate and master's degrees.&lt;ref name="doi10.1177/001654928202900101"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ogan | first1 = C. L. | doi = 10.1177/001654928202900101 | title = Development Journalism/Communication: The Status of the Concept | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 29 | pages = 3–09 | year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebral coined the term "development communication" while at the university's Office of Extension and Publications, now the [[UPLB College of Development Communication|College of Development Communication]] (CDC).&lt;ref name="Quebral, N.C. 1975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1177/001654928202900101" /&gt; According to Felix Librero, the term was first used by Quebral in her 1971 paper, "Development Communication in the Agricultural Context," presented in at a symposium at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. In her paper, Quebral argued that development communication had become a science, requiring the tasks associated with communicating development-oriented issues be based on scientific inquiry. At the time the field was limited to agricultural and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Librero |first=F. |date=December 2008 |title=Development communication Los Baños style: A story behind the history. ''Development communication: Looking back, moving forward.'' Symposium |location=Meeting of the UP Alliance of Development Communication Students, UPLB College of Development Communication, Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines |url=http://www.upou.edu.ph/papers/flibrero_2009/DevcomLB_history.pdf |page=8 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130022559/http://upou.edu.ph/papers/flibrero_2009/DevcomLB_history.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the term 'development support communication' was used in [[UNDP]] programmes under Erskine Childers, with coauthor and wife, Malicca Vajrathron.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This area of research focused on the functions of communication in promoting UN agricultural and development programmes. Development communication at Los Baños became an academic field rather than a techniques program.{{sfn|Librero|2008|pp=8–9}} Quebral cited Seers's definition of development in arguing for the term, as opposed to Childer's 'development support communication', which was used in public and in the scientific literature for the first time. Librero recounted that colleagues in agricultural communications in Los Baños agreed with Quebral, but colleagues from the field of mass communication in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], and from countries in North America, did not initially agree, although they ultimately relented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 1993, in the Institute of Development Communication's faculty papers series, Alexander Flor proposed expanding the definition of development communication to include the perspective of [[cybernetics]] and [[general systems theory]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If information counters entropy and societal breakdown is a type of entropy, then there must be a specific type of information that counters societal entropy. The exchange of such information – be it at the individual, group, or societal level – is called development communication.''&lt;ref name="upstream"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Flor |title=Upstream and Downstream Interventions in Environmental Communication |version= |publisher=Institute of Development Communication |year=1993 |url= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Thailand ===

In Thailand, development communication is presently overseen by Kasetsart University through its International Center for Development Communication (ICDC).  The Center's vision is to be a leading centre of excellence in development training, communication and consultancy services.  As an extension arm of Kasetsart University its international service mission includes building and maintaining quality services to support organizations in their efforts for sustainable development in social and economic sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icdc.eto.ku.ac.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119&amp;Itemid=1|title=The Location|first=|last=Administrator|website=icdc.eto.ku.ac.th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participatory development communication ===

{{Main|Participatory development communication}}
The evolution of the [[participatory development communication]] school involved collaboration between First World and Third World development communication organizations. It focused on community involvement in development efforts and was influenced by [[Paulo Freire|Freirean]] critical pedagogy and the Los Baños school (Besette, 2004).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

=== World Bank ===

The World Bank actively promotes this field through its Development Communication division and published the ''Development Communication Sourcebook'' in 2008, a resource addressing the history, concepts and practical applications of this discipline.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;Mefalopulos, Paulo. Development Communication Sourcebook: Broadening the Boundaries of Communication. World Bank. Retrieved from: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/DevelopmentCommSourcebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development Communication or Communication for Development'''

World Bank tends to espouse and promote the title "Development Communication" while UNICEF uses "Communication for Development". The difference seems to be a matter of semantics and not ideology since the end goals of these global organizations are almost identical to each other.

UNICEF explains: {{block quote|Communication for Development (C4D) goes beyond providing information. It involves understanding people, their beliefs and values, the social and cultural norms that shape their lives. It includes engaging communities and listening to adults and children as they identify problems, propose solutions and act upon them. Communication for development is seen as a two-way process for sharing ideas and knowledge using a range of communication tools and approaches that empower individuals and communities to take actions to improve their lives.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[World Bank]] defines Development Communication "as an interdisciplinary field, is based on empirical research that helps to build consensus while it facilitates the sharing of knowledge to achieve a positive change in the development initiative. It is not only about effective dissemination of information but also about using empirical research and two-way communications among stakeholders". (Development Communication division, the World Bank).&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org" /&gt;

== Examples ==
One of the first examples of development communication was [[Farm Radio Forums]] in [[Canada]]. From 1941 to 1965 farmers met weekly to listen to radio programs, supplemented by printed materials and prepared questions to encourage discussion. At first, this was a response to the [[Great Depression]] and the need for increased food production in World War II. Later the Forums dealt with social and economic issues. This model of [[adult education]] or [[distance education]] was later adopted in India and Ghana.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Radio [[DZLB-AM|DZLB]] was the community broadcasting station of UPLB College of Development Communication. It was a forerunner of the school-on-air (SOA) concept that provided informal education for farmers. DZLB hosted SOAs on nutrition, pest management and cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alexander |last1=Flor |first2=Ila Virginia |last2=Ongkiko |authorlink= |title=Introduction to Development Communication |version= |publisher=SEAMEO Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research and Agriculture and University of the Philippines Open University |year=2006 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} DZLB aired educational programming for farmers and cooperatives.
Established in 2009, [[Global South Development Magazine]] has been a recent example of development communication in practice.
[[Instructional television]] was used in [[El Salvador]] during the 1970s to improve primary education. One problem was a lack of trained teachers. Teaching materials were improved to make them more relevant. More children attended school and graduation rates increased.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
In the 1970s in [[Korea]] the [[Planned Parenthood Federation]] succeed in lowering [[birth rate]]s and improving life in villages such as Oryu Li. It mainly used [[interpersonal communication]] in women's clubs. Oryu Li's success did not recur in all villages. The initial effort had the advantage of a remarkable local leader and visits from the provincial governor.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
A [[social marketing]] project in [[Bolivia]] in the 1980s tried to get women in the [[Cochabamba]] Valley to use [[soybean]]s in their cooking. This was an attempt to deal with chronic malnourishment among children. The project used cooking demonstrations, posters and broadcasts on local commercial radio stations. Some people tried soybeans but the outcome of the project was unclear.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
In 1999 the US and [[DC Comics]] planned to distribute 600,000 [[comic books]] to children affected by the [[Kosovo War]]. The books were in Albanian and featured [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. The aim was to teach children what to do when they find an unexploded [[land mine]] left over from [[Kosovo civil war|Kosovo's civil war]]. The comic books instruct children not to touch and not to move, but instead to call an adult for help.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Since 2002, [[Journalists for Human Rights]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] NGO, has operated projects in [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. JHR works directly with journalists, providing monthly workshops, student sessions, on the job training and additional programs on a country by country basis.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Cuban Media and Education - In 1961, the year of education, the well known literacy campaign was initiated. Television and radio played a complementary role in the dissemination of literacy training programs. Live coverage of literacy worker and students was used to dramatise and this was reinforced on radio and in newspapers. &lt;ref name=“:3”&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.F. |last1=Mathew |authorlink= |title=The Case of Development Communication: Perspectives, Issues and Trends |version= |publisher=Palabra Clave vol.13., No. 1 Universidad La Sanaba Columbia |year=2010 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
{{split section|date=July 2018}}
Development communication policy covers formal and informal processes where interests are defined, expressed and negotiated by actors with different levels of power and with the goal of influencing policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansell|first1=Robin|title=The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|last2=Marc |first2=Raboy|authorlink=Introduction: Foundations of the Theory and Practice of Global Media and Communication Policy|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander G. Flor, Ph.D., a noted development communicator and professor at the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) and University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU), posits that development communication and the policy sciences are linked inextricably albeit distinct and mutually exclusive disciplines. "Policy sciences", he states in a nutshell, is the scientific study of policies and policy-making while "policy" is the set of decisions with specific objectives and target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Journal of Development Communication, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|last = |first = |date = 1991|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication is intended to build consensus and facilitate knowledge sharing to achieve positive change in development initiatives. It disseminates information and employs empirical research, two-way communication and dialogue among stakeholders. It is a management tool to help assess socio-political risks and opportunities. By using communication to bridge differences and take action towards change, development communication can lead to successful and sustainable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozammel|first=Mazud|title=Development Communication: Challenges in an Empowered Information Environment|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/Mozammel_DevComm_edit.ppt|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication is a response to historic, social and economic factors that limit access to information and citizen participation. These include poverty and unemployment, limited access to basic services, remote settlement patterns, lack of access to technology, lack of information, inadequate health services, lack of education and skills and lack of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thusong Service Centre|title=The Government Development Communication Initiative: A Response to Democratic Communication and Citizen Participation in South Africa|url=http://www.thusong.gov.za/documents/policy_legal/gdc.htm|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO asserted that communication can play a decisive role in promoting human development. Democracy, decentralization and the market economy empower individuals and communities to control their own destinies. Stimulating awareness, participation, and capabilities are vital. Policies must encourage effective planning and implementation of communication programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Food and Agriculture Organization|title=Communication: A key to human development|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t1815e/t1815e01.htm|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee advocated that communication policies and practices require joint action among leaders in social, economic, scientific, educational and foreign affairs and that success requires constant contact and consultation with communicators and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=John|title=Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analyzed|year=1976|publisher=The UNESCO Press|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Habermann and De Fontgalland, the difficulties in the adoption of a viable development communication policy have to be simultaneously analyzed horizontally and vertically. Horizontally government agencies, semi-governmental offices (e.g., rural extension service), independent development organizations and private media outlets must coordinate policy. Vertically, information must flow in both directions between the population base and decision-making bodies. This involves local and supra-local administrations that are active in handing out directives and reporting back to the government. Commonly, default policies do not encourage/require such institutions to feed information from the populace to policymakers, with the exception of government extension bureaus.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Stakeholder analysis ===
{{Main|Stakeholder analysis}}

The design and implementation of policies is becoming more complex, and the number and type of actors involved in policy implementation more diverse;&lt;ref name=EVAL /&gt; hence, the policy process is evolving towards multi-actor and multi-goal situations.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlsson|first=L|title=Non-hierarchical Evaluation of Policy|journal=Evaluation|year=2000|volume=6|pages=201–216|doi=10.1177/13563890022209217}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Project stakeholder|Stakeholder]]" has been variously defined according to the goal of the analysis, the analytic approach or the policy area. Where several groups of stakeholders are involved in the policy process, a stakeholder analysis can provide a useful resource.

Stakeholder analysis can help analyze the behavior, intentions, interrelations, agendas, interests and the resources of stakeholders in the policy processes.&lt;ref name=EVAL /&gt;  Crosby described stakeholder analysis as offering methods and approaches to analyze the interests and roles of key players. Hannan and Freeman include groups or individual who can affect or be affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives, while others exclude those who cannot influence the outcome. For instance, Brugha and Varvasovszky defined stakeholder as "individuals, groups, and organizations who have an interest (stake) and the potential to influence the actions and aims of an organization, project, or policy direction."&lt;ref name=EVAL&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mehrizi | first1 = M.

Government – Enacts all communication policies, making it the most powerful stakeholder.
Education sector – Conducts research that underlies subsequent policies.
Communication industry – Influences communication policies. May adopt self-regulation to avoid/delay government regulation. For example, the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas]] and the Philippine Press Institute institute [[ethics codes]].
Private sector – Avoid policies that limit content and to protect themselves from opponents.
Religious sector – Traditionally opposes policies that allow obscenity, violence and profanity to be distributed.
Foreign interests – e.g., international lending agencies may demand the end of monopolies—including state media entities—as a condition for financial aid.
Consumers – Traditionally not consulted, but more recently claiming to protect the public interest.

The United Nations has recognised the importance of "the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to express their aspirations and concerns and participate in decisions...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UN Agencies and Communication for Development|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21370&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such two-way interactions can help expose local reality.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Historical perspectives ===
{{See also|History of communication}}

Cuilenburg and McQuail (2003) identify three main phases of communications policy-making:&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Cuilenburg | first1 = J. | last2 = McQuail | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1177/0267323103018002002 | title = Media Policy Paradigm Shifts: Towards a New Communications Policy Paradigm | journal = European Journal of Communication | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–207 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Emerging Communications Industry Policy (until the Second World War)—during this era, communications policy mainly supported state and corporate benefits. Policy-covered telegraph, telephony and wireless and later, cinema.&lt;!--what about the press?--&gt; Policies were ad hoc measures designed to facilitate a series of technical innovations.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;
Public Service Media Policy (1945–1980)—After the Second World War, policy was dominated by sociopolitical rather than economic and national strategic concerns. This phase began after the Second World War. Policy expanded from addressing technical matters to the content of communications and to cover the traditional press.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;
New Communications Policy Paradigm (1980 to present)—Technological, economic and social trends fundamentally changed media policy from 1980 onward. Technological convergence became an agenda item when the US [[Office of Technology Assessment]] published its pioneering study, ''Critical Connections'' (OTA, 1990) followed by the European Union (CEC, 1997). "Convergence" meant that the boundaries between information technologies blurred: computer and telecommunications converged to telematics; personal computers and television become more similar; and formerly separated networks become interconnected. Regulation of mass media became increasingly linked to telecommunications regulation. Globalization and the permeability of national frontiers by multinational media limited the impact of policy in most countries.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;

=== Critiques ===

Development communication policy as a field experienced persistent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=R.|title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates operated within the discourse of each period: autonomous vs. dependent in the 50s;{{clarify|date=September 2013}} unequal North-South communication flows in the 60s and 70s; transnational corporations and non-governmental actors in the 80s; the converged global information society and the market-based media structure in the 90s; and online media and the [[digital divide]] in the 2000s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==== Participation ====
Hamelink and Nordenstreng called for multistakeholder participation in [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) governance and for formal and informal policy development mechanisms to enable state and non-state actors to shape the media and communication industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamelink|first=C.|author2=Nordenstreng, K.|title=Towards Democratic Media Governance. Media Between Culture and Commerce|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Funding agency bias ====

Manyozo advocated a rethinking of communication for development policies, perceiving a failure by communication policy makers to identify funding institutions that encourage cultural imperialism and unequal power relations between Western and local organizations. He attributed this to the absence in communication policy debates of a political economy discourse.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Manyozo, Linje (2011). Rethinking Communication for Development Policy: Some Considerations,  in R. Mansell and M. Raboy (eds.), The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy,  Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 319–335.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reviewing the different approaches to communication for development policies—media, participation and community dialogue—Manyozo criticizes groups that emphasizes one over the others.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Development communication policy science ===
{{Main|Development communication policy science}}

Development communication policy science take off from development theory that which it says that policy recommendation becomes an engine to the process of social change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jan|first1=Servaes|title=Development Theory and Communication Policy: Power to the People!|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323186001002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Servaes, 1986).  The concept of development communication policy science has reference to the following:
a) Diffusion model which enunciates that 'that the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a 'climate for modernization' among the members of the public'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett|first1=Rogers|title=Communication technology: the new media in society|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
b) The participatory model which incorporates the concept of multiplicity development through democratization and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual but values the cultural identity of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jan|first1=Servaes|title=Development communication – for whom and for what? Communicatio|doi=10.1080/02500169508537827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flor recognizes the affinity of Development Communication and Policy Science; hence coined “Development Communication Policy Science”. In his writings, this concept can be deduced to mean creating guidelines that “stems from the need for actively applying knowledge from and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change” and of which in the process communication is a critical variable.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

UNESCO posits that in order to effect positive developmental change, there is a need to form people and processes that facilitate the creation of knowledge.  For development to happen, a two-way horizontal model which allow direct participation of those most affected by the development issue(s) can be adopted. In this model, the stakeholder's participation are in a form of defining and implementing solutions and identifying development directions. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders for purposes of understanding their perceptions, perspectives, values, attitudes and practices are essential inputs to the design and implementation of development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNESCO|title=Communication for Development and Social Change|date=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication policy science is a thriving and a contemporary field in social sciences.&lt;ref name=Calhoun2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Calhoun |first=Craig |date=2011 |title=Communication as Social Science (and More) |journal=International Journal of Communication 5 |pages=1479–1496 |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/files/ahcs/communication_as_social_science_and_more.pdf |access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the application of the policy sciences to improve policy development, implementation and evaluation in the development communication context. According to Flor (1991), development communication and policy sciences are regarded as distinct and mutually exclusive areas of study but are inextricably linked. He added that development communication and the policy sciences, although different in scope, stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge from the principles&lt;ref name=Calhoun2011 /&gt; of social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Separately, development communication is a purposive, pragmatic, and value-laden development intervention while the policy sciences are the scientific study of policies and policy-making for the social good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both endorse a normative or prescriptive role for the social sciences, work to alleviate societal problems and recognize communication's important function (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006). As an academic discipline, development communication policy science is the study of the use of the art and the science of policy in the development communication context.
Development communication's ultimate goal is to catalyze local development activities, local development planning and implementation, and local communication to smoothen the path to development. It is the science which uses communication to educate, change and motivate people's attitudes and values leading to developmental goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfamedia.org/main/|title=Communication Foundation for Asia {{!}} Media for Total Human Development|website=cfamedia.org|language=English|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy is a term which frames the action rather than simply describing it (Colebatch, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Colebatch, H.K. (2002). Policy. PA: Open University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it labels what we see so that we can make sense of it in a particular way. Understanding policy means understanding the way in which practitioners use it to shape action. It leads us to ask who is involved in what setting, how the action is framed and what significance in this process of the idea of authorized purpose, and not simply an outcome. Indeed, the "approach of the policy science is forward-looking and anticipatory".

The two fields are undoubtedly different. However, Flor&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; accurately stated that "both stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change". The connection between the two fields will be apparent once the question, 'what is the policy for?' is answered. Since policy is the pursuit of goals and the effect they have on the action; and development communication aims to facilitate social change, the two processes are represented as a sequence of stages in the development, beginning with the thought and the intention (policy), moving through action brought about by communication, and ending with the solution (action). To reiterate, unless the policy decision could shape the action, there would be no point in making it.

When policy sciences and development communication have been firmly established in an organization or community, the instruments of policy analysis will provide "unprecedented versatility and effectiveness" (Lasswell, 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1969). A Preview of policy sciences. http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the practice and application of social marketing strategies to influence the stakeholders in making decisions to create not only an individual but also social change.

==== Policy sciences ====

Lasswell (1970: 3)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Pre-view of Policy Sciences|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|publisher=American Elsevier|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines policy sciences as ''knowledge of the policy process as well as knowledge in this process''. Torgerson (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torgerson|first=Douglas|date=1985|title=Contextual Orientation in Policy Analysis: The Contribution of Harold D. Lasswell|url=|journal=Policy Sciences|volume=18|pages=241–261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that Lasswell proposed the development of policy science-or policy sciences-as an interdisciplinary field to embrace all the social sciences and to produce knowledge applicable to public problems. The term "policy sciences" in its plural form, therefore, emphasizes its interdisciplinary nature (Flor, 1991). According to Hale (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Ben|date=2011|title=The methods of applied philosophy and the tools of the policy sciences|url=|journal=International Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=25|pages=215–232|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the central aim of policy sciences is to resolve problems [in the service of human dignity] and the diverse human, historical, and contextual element in public policy-making. This is a reiteration of the Lasswellian maxim on public policy in the following key elements: "contextual"; "problem-oriented"; "multi-method inquiry" or diverse empirical methods, "political", "normative, welfare-oriented" in the case of social policy goals; and posing "interdisciplinarity" or moving between humanities and social sciences. Indeed, Lasswell's original goal of the policy sciences was to provide, "intelligence pertinent to the integration of values realized by and embodied by interpersonal relations [such as] human dignity and the realization of human capacities" (Lasswell and Kaplan, 1950: p. xii).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Society|last=Lasswell |first=Harold |last2=Kaplan |first2=Abraham |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1950|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "policy sciences" therefore adopts an approach to understanding and solving problems that draw on and contribute to all fields of knowledge (Quebral, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quebral|first=Nora|date=2006|title=Development Communication in a Borderless World|url=|journal=Glocal Times|volume=3|pages=1–5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sets out procedures in an integrated and comprehensive form to help clarify and secure common interests.

According to [[Harold Lasswell]] (1971), the policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge ''of'' and ''in'' the decision processes of the public and civic order.&lt;ref name="Laswell, H.D. 1971"&gt;Laswell, H.D. (1971). [http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf A Preview of Policy Sciences]. American Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;   Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of how policies are made and executed. At one moment, the analyst regards his subject-matter as an objective phenomenon, but this phase alternates with another in which the analyst comes to view himself as actively involved in the phenomenon which he investigates. Inquiry displays both tension and interplay between these moments; they are distinct yet interwoven, complementary in the ongoing development and refinement of contextual orientation (Togerson, 1985). Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry and observation as applied to decision processes. As such, the notion of the policy sciences is construed in various shades since it was introduced in the 1940s and over the years, Lasswell and his colleagues refined the concept, through practice and peer review, as the intellectual tools needed to support problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method inquiry in the service of human dignity for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/TheUniversity/Committees/SPS/F/courses/psci5076.html|title=Introduction to the Policy Sciences|last=Brunner|first=Ronald|date=1996|website=PSCI5076: Introduction to Policy Sciences|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy sciences is a forward-looking body of knowledge, with the plural form emphasizing its interdisciplinary and holistic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. ''Journal of Development Communication''. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomena that are subject to decision processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  According to Laswell (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;39),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Pre-View of Policy Sciences|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|publisher=American Elsevier Publishing Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adequate strategy of problem solving in policy sciences encompasses five intellectual tasks performed at varying levels of insight and understanding namely: goal clarification; trend description; analysis of conditions; projection of developments; and invention, evaluation, and selection of alternatives. As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented.  Since a problem is multidimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon. The trend toward a policy sciences viewpoint is a move away from fragmentation and the fragmented "worm's eye view" of policy matters.&lt;ref name="Laswell, H.D. 1971" /&gt;

The policy sciences provide an integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems at all levels in ways that help clarify and secure the common interest. Policy sciences are concerned with helping people make better decisions toward fostering human dignity for all. Since we are living in a "turbulent field" environment, policy science is necessary to address issues before it will get bigger. The approach of policy sciences,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flor, Alexander G. (December 1991). [https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences "Development Communication and the Policy Sciences".] ''Journal of Development Communication'', Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; as cited by Flor in his article, is forward-looking or anticipatory. Policy sciences tell us what we need to do and prepare before certain issues or problems occur. Using an allegorical definition, Dror (1971), as cited by Ongkiko and Flor (2006), explains that "''one should not leave the problem of crossing a river until the river is reached; rather, one should survey the territory in advance, identify rivers flowing through it, decide whether it is at all necessary to cross the river—and if so, where and how to cross it—then prepare in advance the materials for crossing the river and design a logistics network so that the material is ready when the river is reached.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, given its interdisciplinary and holistic nature, policy sciences does consider several variables (education, communication, money, culture) in coming up with a decision. These variables are important factors in coming up with a sound and relevant policy.

In the context of communication policy development, the policy sciences are necessary to make more purposeful, responsive, and effective communication policies. Profoundly influenced by Freud and Marx, Lasswell emphasized the importance of the contextual orientation of policy analysts, both individually and collectively (Lasswell, 1965). When he first articulated this principle of contextuality, Lasswell indeed referred explicitly to the "exposition of the dialectical method" (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Revolution of Our Time: A Framework for Basic Policy Research|last=Harold D. Lasswell|first=in Harold Lasswell and Daniel Lerner (Eds) World Revolutionary Elites|publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=29–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lukacs's ''History and Class Consciousness'', adding that the insights of psychoanalysis provided a complement to the Marxian dialectic which would aid in understanding "the symbolic aspects of historical development" (Laswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Here Lasswell proposed a mode of contextual-configurative analysis whereby, through "an act of creative orientation" (Laasswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;13), the inquirer could locate himself in an 'all-encompassing totality" (Lasswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;12). In this regard, Lasswell considered such contextual orientation indispensable to the conduct of rational inquiry, and urged the use of contextual-configurative analysis in the development of a policy science profession. Hale (2011, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Ben|date=2011|title=The Methods of Applied Philosophy and the Tools of the Policy Sciences|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/2011.37.pdf|journal=International Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=25|pages=215–232.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that Lasswell saw that robust policy solutions could only be obtained by insisting upon a commitment to contextuality, problem orientation, and methodological diversity. All for good reasons: first, no decision can adequately be understood apart from the larger social process in which it is itself apart. Thus '''contextuality''' is a key element in the policy sciences. As a reliance on ideology, principle, and grand historical projects cannot, given the complexity and contextuality of policy problems, serve with reliable solution, a discipline geared to resolve problems should expressly orient itself on those problems and should be purposeful. Thus '''problem orientation''' is the second key element in the policy sciences. Finally, due to the multidimensionality and complexity of many of these problems it stands to reason that the policy scientist should draw from a diversity of methodologies. Thus '''methodological diversity''' is the third key element in the policy sciences. It is Lasswell's sincere belief that understanding the policy formation and decision-making process will eventually also be beneficial in the creation of public policy (Hale, 2011).

[https://tidsskrift.dk/mediekultur/article/view/21614 Hepp, A., Roitsch, C., &amp; Berg, M. (2016)] introduces the approach of contextualised communication network analysis as a qualitative procedure for researching communicative relationships realised through the media. It combines qualitative interviews on media appropriation, egocentric network maps, and media diaries. Through the triangulation of these methods of data collection, it is possible to gain a differentiated insight into the specific meanings, structures and processes of communication networks across a variety of media. The approach is illustrated using a recent study dealing with the mediatisation of community building among young people. In this context, the qualitative communication network analysis has been applied to distinguish “localists” from “centrists”, “multilocalists”, and “pluralists”. These different “horizons of mediatised communitisation” are connected to distinct communication networks. Since this involves today a variety of different media, the contextual analysis of communication networks necessarily has to imply a cross-media perspective.

[https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/4/302/3916737 Oancea, A., Florez Petour, T., and Atkinson, J. (2017)] noted a particular advantage of qualitative network analysis tools approach in its fit to the study of cultural value and impact in different disciplinary and institutional settings.

Sciences are policy sciences when they clarify the process of policy-making in society or supply data for the making of rational judgments on policy questions" Lasswell (1975). The 'art' of policy sciences, therefore, seek to improve decision-making by reinforcing and supporting human dignity to elide the blinders of instrumental reason by addressing the manifold of human experience (Hale, 2001). The personalities who significantly play vital roles in this field are the policy scientists and analysts who are involved in the scientific design, formulation, analysis, and evaluation of policies in particular and are concerned with the study of the policy-making process in general (Flor, 1991). Lasswell and McDougal&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action" /&gt; called on "policy scientists to aid decision makers in clarifying goals, identifying trends relative to goals, analyzing the factors causing or contributing to specific trends, projecting the future, and inventing and evaluating policy proposals—alternative actions that may be taken related to the desired results." To ensure that policy scientists would be adequately equipped for these intellectual tasks, Lasswell and McDougal proposed educational training programs devoted to the knowledge and skills needed for better policy (decision) making: contextual thinking, problem orientation, and mastery of diverse methods.&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action" /&gt;

To guide communication policy-makers in addressing challenges, Picard and Pickard (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Picard, R.G. and Pickard, V. (2017). Essential Principles for Contemporary Media and Communications Policymaking. Retrieved from https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/Essential%20Principles%20for%20Contemporary%20Media%20and%20Communications%20Policymaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposed policy principles that aim to guide contemporary media and communications policymaking in democratic countries so the contributions of these operations and systems to society may be improved.   They maintain that “Media and communications policies are central to many of the social and political issues that societies face today.” However, existing policies are often unable to respond to rapid technological, economic, political, and social developments because they address only particular media and communication challenges at a particular time.  On the other hand, fundamental principles are constant, thus providing guidance on how to respond to new concerns and challenges and making appropriate policies.

Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. University of Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; note that "policy principles are coherent statements based on underlying norms and values that help policymakers and organisations respond to issues and take part in legislative and regulatory activities". In practice, principles are articulated and then used to set policy objectives and determine the means to achieve them. The latter two stages opine Picard and Pickard (2017), are subjected to ''political'' processes that determine the final policy outcome.

Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. University of Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore came up with the following rubric list of potential principles that they believe are crucial in crafting a much reflective communication policy:

# Meeting fundamental communication and content needs;
# Providing effective ability for public use of media and communications;
# Promoting diversity/plurality in ownership of media and content available;
# Affording protection for users and society;
# Providing transparency and accountability;
# Pursuing developmental and economic benefits; and
# Pursuing equitable and effective policy outcomes.

The authors (Picard and Pickard, 2017) disaggregated these key principles as follows:

Principles are therefore not neutral, because they are normative, reflecting specific values that are subject to contestation.

"Communication and Culture, Conflict and Cohesion" is a book edited by Alexander G. Flor (2002), an expert on Knowledge Management for Development, which discusses the need for convergence in society through inter-cultural communication, using case studies in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It also examines environmental conflicts, indigenous peoples, and the official development assistance in the Philippines. In the book, Flor noted that communication and culture are “inextricably linked”. Societal conflict in this age of informatization is a “function of culture caused by a dysfunction of societal communication”. The quality and degree of societal communication – the mass media and education -- determine the ways that cultures are exposed to others. The higher the quality and degree of inter-cultural communication, the lower the propensity for conflict, and vice versa. He observed that many of the world’s contemporary wars – in Rwanda, Basque, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Aceh, East Timor -- are not being waged by national political struggles “but by cultures”. For example, Catholic bishops and Islam ulama agree that the conflict in the island of Mindanao in the Philippines is triggered by “opposing value systems (on the use of natural resources), opposing social structures (feudal vs. oligarchic), and opposing worldviews (materialistic vs. idealistic)” – all of which, Flor noted, are components of culture. One of the first steps to help repair the situation is for communication policy scientists to “begin with tolerance as a short-term solution, and understanding as a long-term solution”. Tolerance and understanding require “good communication” from both ends of the spectrum that are striving to achieve “mutual understanding” – the goal of Kincaid (1979) for communication in his Convergence Model. The concept of convergence looks at the communication process as cyclical between source and receiver, and interactive between their message and feedback. “With convergence comes cohesion.” Mutual understanding achieved through communication helps preclude conflicts, and encourages cohesion among the world’s cultures.

==== Communication policy science ====
The atmosphere of participation created by recent administrations has brought about a more significant role for the development communication specialist/ policy scientist. His involvement in communication policymaking is facilitated by the so-called institutionalization of people power. His expertise may be directly tapped by the most important stakeholder, the media consumer. The participation of information users and media consumers in policy making may be realized by the formation of a nationwide media consumer's organization or a federation of local organizations of this nature in which policy analysts play a significant role. This proposed organization could initiate media education in the formal and non-formal modes. Media education at the formal level may be facilitated by lobbying for the inclusion of such in existing secondary and tertiary curricula. Non-formal education may be conducted through media consumer sponsored awareness campaigns. This organization could also conduct its own audience related studies and policy research. It could establish a nationwide network involving the church, academic communities, grassroots organizations and cause-oriented groups. Communication policy scientists may also serve as part of the staff of our legislators in the Congress and Senate. In their private capacities, they can form research and development outfits or "think tanks" whose services may be availed of by government agencies. Indeed, now is a fortuitous time for policy engagement in development communication.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Culture, politics, economics and technology have an impact on policy decisions.  In order to investigate the factors that influence communications policy, one has to go beyond conventional views of media and communication and should combine these with policy studies.

According to experts, communication policy science would be understood if the public just had access to the right scientific information. Coyle, in his article "Theory of Development Communication", articulates that people have options to change their ways of life through communication. People improve their lives and ways of thinking through communication, sharing their perspectives and understanding what is going on in their surroundings. As highlighted by Flor, communication development has something to do with policy science as these are anchored for improving policy making.

As stipulated in Walt Rostow's theory in Boado's article, societies progress through specific stages of development on their way to modernity. Policy makers and scientists can communicate directly with the public through social media and blogging. By using social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, policymakers and scientists can serve as critical mediators in disseminating scientific information by sharing advancements directly with society.

=====Communication policy and its dimensions=====

John A.R. Lee, author of ''Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analysed'', published by The Unesco Press, shares that every state or nation carries communication policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000165/016578eo.pdf|title=Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analysed|last=Lee|first=John|date=1976|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120001913/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000165/016578eo.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies are stated/embedded in "legislation, conditions, codes of conduct, rules and proceedings" or implied/suggested "in accepted practices." He adds that they are present "at the national, institutional and professional levels."

By citing a Unesco report made by experts on communication and planning, Lee defines communication policies as "sets of principles and norms established to guide the behaviour of communication systems."

He adds that the dimensions of communication policies as well as communication planning encompass the communication system, its components and structures; the functions of the system; the "clients" or audience using the system; the types of information carried by the system and its components; the values and qualities of the information content; and a variety of considerations about the system, its functions, audience, types of information and qualities. Members of the audience are classified based on such characteristics as age, sex, occupations, socio-economic strata, urban-rural (locations) and persuasions. Types of information refer to the conversation, cultural forms, data, education, entertainment, general information, music, news and opinion. Meanwhile, truth, objectivity, relevance, educational effectiveness, violence, humour, sex, libel are examples of values and qualities of the information content.

According to Lee, the "consideration, identification and determination" of the scope of specific communication systems and societal principles and norms are needed in formulating communication policies.

In his paper, Lee also discusses participation in the formulation of communication policies by asking, "Who is involved?" and identifying the stakeholders. They are government executive, legislative bodies, authorities in charge of social and economic planning, individual ministries and their planning boards, communication enterprises, professional organizations, the citizen, the social scientist and the economist.

E. Lloyd Sommerland, UNESCO Regional Communication Adviser for Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000397/039772eb.pdf|title=Why a Communication Policy and Plan|last=Sommerland|first=E. Lloyd|date=1976|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out the difference between communication policies and communication planning by saying that the former provides "the principles, rules and guidelines on which the communication system is built," while the latter is concerned with the policy implementation.

He shares that every country engages in development planning that touches different sectors of a society like "agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, education, health, transport and communication, social and community services." At the heart of these plans for development is communication. "Communication is part and parcel of this whole process of development and needs its own infrastructure," said Summerland. The word "communication" in this particular context includes telecommunications, mass media (print and broadcast), face-to-face communication and traditional channels and these are resources tapped by a society "to enable information to flow within it", he adds.

The author emphasizes the role of communication in national development.

Sommerland also underlines that communication policies are not the ends and they provide a framework for action. He makes a reference to what a UNESCO expert group has said that behind these policies is strategic planning.

"(It) determines the alternative ways to achieve long-range goals and sets the frame of reference for shorter-range operational planning. Strategic planning translates into quantified targets and systematic approaches, the general objectives of communication policies," he says.

Sommerland also supports some claims of Lee that communication policies are either embedded or implied in the existing policies of a nation.

"For a country to try and formulate a coherent national communication policy does not, of course, imply that no policies in this area already exist," the former says. "...Because communication is interdisciplinary and because it is the thread which binds a nation together, communication policies even if incomplete and implicit, are to be found in many different parts of a political and social system.

==== Development communication and policy sciences as mutually constitutive fields ====
Development communication and policy sciences exhibits mutuality as catalysts of change in this fluid environment. Both are geared towards effecting change in society. Will these two sciences be robustly beneficial if converged in one developmental framework? Allen (as cited in Flor, 1991) postulates that policy is a science of decision-making based on empirical data gathered from observation.&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; One important characteristic of policies is, it is created to facilitate civic order, an agent to development process. How does it relate to development communication? Although a relatively young science, Development Communication has now been recognized and adopted by various agencies: the government and private sector as a means to institute effective changes using bottom-up approach. In the same vein, policy sciences grew out of this need to reorient actively the social sciences to the resolution of policy issues.&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; Recognizing that every human being is a value-shaper and sharer in the social process, interaction as whole has been considered systemically by both sciences. A policy science is anchored on its ''intelligence'' function, followed by mobilization and bureaucratic reforms where mobilization is a key component of development communication. Development communication practitioners are well-equipped when it comes to understanding social phenomena which can aid in the ''intelligence function'' of policy scientists. The development agenda of both sciences are anchored on ''contextuality,'' meaning both recognizes the human's social values and institutions in drafting interventions, plans and policies to achieve an ''enlightened society''.

These policies are products of Development Communication initiatives that can influence decision makers or the government in enacting pertinent laws for the benefit of the publics. Development communication's process is akin to policy science as both recognizes the context or the environment where humans socially interact. Both are using social science procedures in solving large-scale problems&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; and further acknowledges communication as an integral part of the process. Hence one can surmise that policy decision-making is dependent on communication.

In an era of rapid development, each field should not be viewed as dialectically superior against the other, rather both development communication and policy sciences should mutually work to advance for the social change. The thrusts and goals of Development communication can be sustainable if it is backed by certain policies.

Following Quebral’s definition of Development communication “the ''art'' and ''science'' of ''human communication'' applied to ''speedy transformation'' of a country and the mass of its people from ''poverty'' to ''dynamic state of economic growth'' that makes possible ''greater social equality'' and the ''larger fulfillment of human potential''”, Flor and Ongkiko explained each aspect of this definition for better understanding on why development communication was defined this way.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia C. Ongkiko, Ila &amp; Flor, Alexander. (2006). Introduction to Development Communication. 10.13140/RG.2.1.2952.6887. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''ART'''

In relaying a message, creativity is needed to attract the attention of its audience. It does not focus only on beautifying the message or the image but the art of communicating with people that would help them understand and adapt to the changes that will happen to them.

'''SCIENCE'''

As Flor and Ongkiko emphasize, development communication is a social science. At the same time, it is both theory and practices. The theory is backed-up with science in order to understand a situation, then the application or execution of plans towards development is the practice. A systematic approach which mostly based on the methods of science is followed in order to address a situation. The most commonly used method is identifying the problem, gathering data about the problem and develop communication processes that will be useful in able to address the situation and helped the community for development.

'''HUMAN COMMUNICATION'''

This is an important aspect for development communication because it is people-centred. The people need to communicate with one another for their own development. The people behind the development is reaching out to the people who need development. That is human communication.

'''SPEEDY TRANSFORMATION'''

This represents the social change that will happen to the community. All the researches made in able to identify the problem must put into action for the transformation of the lives of the people in the community.

'''POVERTY'''

The greatest challenge in development communication is poverty. Even in the Millennium Development Goals of United Nations, poverty is at the top of the list that needs to address with the hope of eradicating it in the future. Because of poverty, many people are experiencing malnutrition, unemployment and illiteracy which adds to the burden of the people.

'''DYNAMIC STATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, GREATER SOCIAL EQUALITY, LARGER FULFILLMENT OF HUMAN POTENTIAL'''

Since the goal is for development, this is a continuous process. The aim is to help the people with their economic, social, and environmental goals.

Noticeably, everything that was mentioned in the explanation of the definition of development communication has something to do with goals, progress, theory, research, problem identification, and practices. Thomas L. McPhail, also describes development communication as a process of change using education or media as long as it is for the purpose of positive social change.

This coincides with Harold Lasswell’s vision that policy sciences bring together social sciences and practical policymaking to solve public problems, formalizing the link between the two. &lt;ref&gt;Nick Turnbull. (2008). Harold Lasswell’s ‘problem orientation’ for the policy sciences. Critical Policy Studies Journal. volume 2, issue 1, 2008: 72-91 Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19460171.2008.9518532#.UjwQzfJ4GTN &lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, development communication is backed with science through theories by identifying the problems needed to address. Lasswell identified policy science as problem-solving, with the idea of when addressing the problems, it should focus on human dignity or the fulfilment of human potential as Quebral said on her definition of development communication.

'''NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT'''

According to Jaime B. Ramirez (2011), members of the development media have considered economic and social development as one of the significant and vital signs of national development. Admittedly, he said, development communication cam always bridge gaps between the traditional and modern changing society, as it can raise the full aspirations of the people under the new society in the overall strategy for change.  Development communication accordingly, can enforce social norms. In terms of policy sciences, development communication Ramirez adds, can broaden the policy dialogue by providing the two-way flow of information and opinion required for development as a nation. It, therefore, plays a potent and major role to economic and social development as well as political power. Without sacrificing its freedom, the development media can contribute to the growth of democratic institutions and to political stability, essential to national development.&lt;Philippine Journalism Handbook, 3rd Edition. 2011 reprint&gt;.

==== Strategic communication for sustainable development ====

"Communication is a key factor to begin and keep a proper Sustainable Development strategy" (Bucur and Petra, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bucur, M &amp; Petra, C.|title=Why Is Communication So Special For Sustainable Development?|journal=Scientific Bulletin of the Petru Maior" University of Târgu Mureş|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://scientificbulletin.upm.ro/papers/2011-1/Bucur-M.-Petra-C-Why-is-communication-so-special-for-sustainable-development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development Communication can be defined as a "dialogue-based process entailing the strategic application of communication approaches, methods and/or technologies for social change". This definition highlights the three important features of development communication – process, analytical activity based on dialogue, and aims to achieve change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mefalopulos, P. and Grenna, L.|title=Promoting sustainable development through strategic communication|date=2004|publisher=IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK|isbn=2-8317-0822-2|pages=25|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57dd/349db9843a3876de72bd76b53116f93e8286.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic Communication is essential in encouraging public participation and achieving effective policy making. It affects goal setting, decision making, development and implementation, and impact assessment. However, communication as a strategic tool remains deficient in development programs creating the need to establish an Interest Group on Strategic Communication for Sustainable Development. Strategic communication "aims at the innovative and sustainable change of practices, behaviors and lifestyles, guides communication processes and media interventions within and among social groups".
An effective strategy for sustainable development integrates the vision and action plan of the government, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willner|first1=Susanne|title=Strategic Communication for Sustainable Development: A Conceptual Overview|url=https://www.cbd.int/cepa/toolkit/2008/doc/strategic%20communication%20for%20sustainable%20development.pdf|publisher=Schneller Druck, Reutlingen|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank views development communication as the "integration of strategic communication in development projects" based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manyozo|first1=Linje|title=Manifesto for Development Communication: Nora C.

This is aligned with the long tradition of strategic communication initiatives used in development projects related to human rights, democracy, poverty alleviation and health aimed at generating awareness, promoting behavioral changes, affording mobilization, and creating partnerships to reach common goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sida Department for Policy and Methodology, Information Department|title=Dialogue and Strategic Communication in Development Cooperation|url=https://www.sida.se/contentassets/b4b1a8018a804e02848e716ca71cacb7/dialogue-and-strategic-communication-in-development-cooperation_1399.pdf|publisher=Edita Communication AB|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====

Development communication efforts, along with other development strategies, have failed to improve the conditions of women on a global scale, and when compared with men, women are disproportionately subject to poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, discrimination, and barriers to senior professional positions, even in development organizations (Harbour &amp; Twist, 1996). As a group that is marginalized from global, national, and community power structures, Wilkins (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Karin|date=1999|title=Development discourse on gender and communication in strategies for social change|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=49|pages=46–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that women tend to constitute a target more often than a participant in the production of development communication. Moore (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debating development discourse: Institutional and popular perspectives|author1=David B. Moore |author2=Gerald J. Schmitz|publisher=St. Martin’s Press.|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=1–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that “gender” made its “first discursive appearance” in development institutions during the 1960s (p.&amp;nbsp;43). However, it was not until 1975 that women’s contributions to the development process were formally acknowledged by the United Nations (UN). The mid-1970s marked a shift in attention to women in development, along with other critical transitions in the field of development communication (Rogers, 1976;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Everett|date=1976|title=Communication and development: The passing of the dominant paradigm|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=3|pages=213–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schramm &amp; Lerner, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and change: The last ten years—and the next|last=Wilbur Schramm|first=and Wilbur Schramm|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A WID strategy advocated including women as an explicit focus in order to achieve development goals (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, feminism and development|last=Huguette Dagenais|first=and  Denise Piché|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, WID was placed on a global agenda when the UN sponsored a conference in Mexico City to launch the Year of Women. This facilitated the designation of the Decade for the Advancement of Women (1976 until 1985). As a discourse, WID served to organize principles for the production of knowledge about women by states, institutions, and communities (Escobar, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;210).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encountering development: The making and unmaking of the third world|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WID construed women as actively contributing to society through their economic production and human reproduction (Staudt, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, foreign assistance and advocacy administration|last=Staudt|first=Kathleen|publisher=Praeger|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WID also pointed to a need to improve women’s access to education, employment, and political participation (Valdivia, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valdivia|first=Angharad|date=1996|title=Is modern to male as traditional is to female?: Re-visioning gender construction in international communications|url=|journal=Journal of International Communication|volume=3|pages=5–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conditions considered in earlier models of modernization that tended to privilege male constituents. Throughout the Decade for the Advancement of Women however, several scholars recognized limits to using media to promote social change, such as problematic stereotypes of women in media texts, a lack of women’s employment in positions of power in media industries, and poor access to mediated technologies as a source of information, particularly among rural women.

Following the Decade for Women, attention to WID gradually shifted toward a concern with gender and development (GAD). This shift from “women” to “gender” resonates with an understanding of gender as a socially constructed category, rather than essentializing sex as a biological condition (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). GAD attempted to position women as active agents of social change situated within social and structural systems of patriarchy and power (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). Steeves (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steeves|first=Leslie|date=1993|title=Creating imagined communities: Development communication and the challenge of feminism|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=43|pages=218–229|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to critical scholarship about the political economy of communication and participatory approaches to development (Freire, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to propose the creation of a global, imagined feminist community that challenges power relations. A “global feminist” approach to development would critique what appears to be defining gender according to reproductive capacity in a way that promotes motherhood as a universal role for women, rather than celebrating diversity in women’s intentions, experiences, backgrounds, and capabilities.

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that the most significant and longest social movement continuing is the movement for the emancipation of women. However, the primary goal for women empowerment is to improve the quality of life of women, but also has deep ramifications in social, economic and political scenario of body polity. It is such contentions that stressing the need to recognize power dimensions within women’s domestic, professional, and social contexts, GAD proponents would advocate interventions designed to change structures or norms.

Development communication activity embodies models of social change that are implemented across political and cultural boundaries wherein, issues of gender, communication, and development are grounded in global structures and processes of power, which condition access to and acquisition of economic and social resources. Watkins (1999) notes that in as much as critical scholars have described the global domination of media systems by Western and corporate agencies, gender also factors into this equation, as the extensive documentation of the tendency of media industries to trivialize women’s roles and concerns has been historically demonstrated (van Zoonen, 1994). Early scholars of development communication did not explicitly address the role of gender in their discussions of media and modernity (Watkins, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;48). However, an examination of their work illustrates implicit assumptions made about men’s and women’s roles in the development process.  There is thus a need to understand the dynamics contributing to the institutional construction of gender within development communication strategies designed to alleviate social problems. Watkins (1999) cites Steeves (1993) whose summary of feminist scholarship concluded that, among other areas, research is needed “on women’s roles and representations in Third World development communication activities, including funding agency projects” (p.&amp;nbsp;120). Along with integrating regional, national, and/or organizational perspectives, one specific tool for policymakers is ensuring that gender perspective is incorporated into policies. Regardless whether gender plays a central role in a development communication policy, the policy-making process has to be taken in a deliberate way to address concerns of both women and men. When views of different groups of women and men in policy formation and delivery are taken accordingly, misjudging of the different effects on each group, and the systems and organizations that support them can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Sutcliff&amp;Court"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Sophie|last2=Court|first2=Julius|title=A Toolkit for Progressive Policymakers in Developing Countries|date=2006|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|isbn=0 85003 786 7|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a quest to ensure that the overall legal and policy framework is promoting gender equality, more than just adopting laws that explicitly provide for gender equality can be done. Thus it is essential that all laws and policies reflect gender equality considerations, through a process called [[gender mainstreaming]]. [[Gender mainstreaming]] is the mechanism to ensure a gender-sensitive approach to policy making.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite book|last1=OECD, CAWTAR|title=Women in Public Life Gender, Law and Policy in the Middle East and North Africa|date=2014|publisher=OECD Publishing, Paris|isbn=9789264224636|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/women-in-public-life_9789264224636-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender mainstreaming]], according to the [[United Nations]], is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a strategy, an approach, a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities—policy development, research, advocacy/ dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, and planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes and projects. A strong, continued commitment to gender mainstreaming is one of the most effective means for the [[United Nations]] to support promotion of gender equality at all levels—in research, legislation, policy development and in activities on the ground, and to ensure that women as well as men can influence, participate in and benefit from development efforts.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women|title=Gender Mainstreaming|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|website=www.un.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Children's Fund or [[UNICEF]] also promotes gender sensitivity in its policies. [[UNICEF]] gender review ensures that gender is mainstreamed in all [[UNICEF]]'s projects and programs as well as in its work with partners. [[UNICEF]] also ensures that the monitoring and evaluation tools are gender sensitive and that every staff is aware of the UN Code of conduct. UNICEF also uses the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGAD) as a tool to promote gender equality and women's empowerment in the development and implementation of projects.&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNICEF Philippines|title=Gender Mainstreaming|url=http://www.unicef.org/philippines/aboutus_13424.html|website=www.unicef.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communication approach embedded within empowerment models combines the use of appropriate media. This means using a variety of channels ranging from indigenous media, local and international media systems. (Einsiedel 1996).

==== Demography ====
Defined as the statistical study of populations, Demography is seen as more of a general science that can analyze populations that show change over a period of time. However, in combination with the more specific aspect of communication that has to do with social sciences, demographics can be a significant factor and consequently influencer of Development Communication policy design. Population changes are brought about by birth, migration and mortality. These demographic processes affect the use of resources, nation-building and society formation, and cultural development calling for development communication policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Demography?|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/education_career/what_is_demography_1908/default.htm|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher for the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research Sebastian Klüsener "investigated how the exchange of ideas and information between people could affect the development of spatial, temporal, and social differences in demographic change. The results highlight that communication plays a much larger role in shaping demographic processes..."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_press/news/news/the_role_of_communication_in_demographic_change_4105.htm|title=The role of communication in demographic change.|last=Klusener|first=Sebastian|date=|website=Max Planck Institute For Demographic Research|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her discussion of the relationship between communicators and their audiences, Natalie T. J. Tindall, an associate professor in the department of communication at Georgia State University, US, shares "Demographic categories can still tell us a lot about our social structure, and continue to be useful for macro-level understandings of people and societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communication-director.com/issues/different-perspective/going-beyond-demographics#.VyNjxEfNOng|title=Going beyond demographics|last=Tindall|first=Natalie T.J.|date=|website=Communication Director|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is with this understanding that policies can be designed more tailor-fit to those it is designed for.
Furthermore, the criterion by which a demography is performed are relevant factors that may act as a roadmap that can guide development communication policy making. This includes but is not limited to age, level of education, gender distribution profile, individual and household income, etc. With the anticipatory objective of policy sciences in relation to crisis or problem solving, the better policy makers get a grasp of how a population is demographically—not just socially—the more sensitive and pro-active policy making as a process can be. When perspectives of an accurate cross-sectional sampling of a population, group, or culture are taken into consideration, the ensuing policies are better geared towards the pre-set objectives. Scalone, Dribe, and Klusener have further found that "Communication can significantly increase the impact of population-relevant policies and other processes of social change..."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; which reinforces the idea that as a science in itself, development communication policy design, becomes more accurate and purposeful when the correct information and variables are holistically integrated.

==== Selected approaches to communication planning for policy development ====
UNESCO or the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is one of the multilateral organizations that uses communication planning for policy development.  In one of its publications back in 1980 "Approaches to Communication Planning," where it presents some of the most common approaches that scholars, planners and professionals to use.  Below are common approaches to communication planning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNESCO (1980).  Approaches to Communication Planning.  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000424/042484eo.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; on 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Process approach ====
The process approach deals directly with the communication planning process which deals to the theories within the planning process that asserts that planning is the application of theory on how and why they are used.  (UNESCO, 1980) The second is it deals with the planning process itself that provide alternative ways of organizing the planning function and process, given different purposes and planning contexts.  (UNESCO, 1980)  The thrust of the argument is that there are alternatives to the widely known rational/comprehensive planning approach (UNESCO, 1980).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Communication policy makers are not acting in isolation; they had the full support of scientist and theorists. Communication for Development aims at upholding change in people's attitudes and behavior so as to increase their participation in the development process.  Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory is perhaps the most influential theory in the modernization paradigm. The diffusion model gained wide currency in most developing nations and still looms large with the agenda to support 'development' by "informing the populations about the development projects, illustrating their advantages and recommending that they be supported"(Servaes, 1996). Communication within the modernization approach is synonymous to information and ignores the importance of feedback in the communication process. Melkote and Steeves (2001)&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Melkote, Srinivas R. and Steeves, H Leslie (2001). Communication for Development in the Third World: Theory and practice for empowerment, New Delhi, India: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed three key qualities of modernization theory and practice: blaming the victim, Social Darwinism, and sustaining class structure of inequality. (1) Blaming the victim is an ideological process, an almost painless circumvention among policy-makers and intellectual all over the world. It is a process of justifying inequality in society by finding defects in the victims of inequality. The policymakers simply blame the despondent lives led by the poor in Third World countries and it is being attributed to the lack of motivation and access to information relating to the various social and economic aspects that they need in order to redeem themselves. (2) Social Darwinists believed that government interventions on behalf of the poor would have disastrous results since they would interfere with the laws of natural selection. The theorist believed that outside interventions to address matters concerning the poor would have dreadful results since these would be interfering with a natural course of events and individual choices and rights. (3) Sustaining class structure of inequality, this is a capitalist interest and quite difficult to overcome. The effect of a focus on individual level cultural deficiencies has been to sustain the status quo within and between unequal societies and thus delay change.

===== Systems approach =====

The systems approach in communication planning deals on how to establish new systems within organizations (UNESCO, 1980). This approach is valuable to planners faced with the task of setting up organizational systems to carry out communication functions (UNESCO, 1980). This approach can also be best applied to problems in the environment, providing planners with an analytical perspective on problem analysis and a range of techniques to use in implementing this perspective (UNESCO, 1980).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Network approach =====

Network approach (Padovani &amp; Pavan, 2014) is a heuristic framework for theorizing and empirically investigating global communication governance (GCG) environments or networks in supranational settings characterized by plurality and multiplicity of agents, actors and stakeholders, plurality and diversity of cultures, complexity of interactions, plurality of political systems, and multiplicity of policy processes. GCG is a term coined by Padovani &amp; Pavan (2014) to "indicate the multiplicity of networks of interdependent but operationally autonomous actors that are involved with different degrees of autonomy and power, in processes of formal or informal character, through which they pursue different goals, produce relevant knowledge and cultural practices, and engage in political negotiation while trying to influence the outcome of decision-making in the domain of media and communication in transnational context" (p.&amp;nbsp;544). Network approach specifically focuses on the transnational dynamics that govern communication systems.&lt;ref&gt;(Source: Padovani, C. &amp; Pavan, E. (2014). Actors and Interactions in Global Communication Governance: The Heuristic Potential of Network Approach. In Mansell R. &amp; Raboy, M. (eds). The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy. John Wiley &amp; Sons.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Policy life cycle =====

Government officials and policy makers in both developed and developing countries are often confronted with problems for which they have no design solutions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Servaes, J., Jacobson, T. L., &amp; White, S. A. (1996). Participatory communication for social change. New Delhi: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Every problem, country and culture requires a specific approach and seems to go through policy life cycle. Winsemius proposed four phases of policy cycle;
Phase 1: Recognizing the problem; groups in the society such as government official, lobbyists and countries' leaders recognize the problem, e.g. terrorism, poverty, global warming, and other. The problem is made known to all stakeholders, during this stage the members realized that problem should be tackled through policy.
Phase 2: Gaining Control over the Problem; at this point, the government start to advance in their mechanisms through the formulation of policies. Policy oriented research is often appointed to scientific institutions, opinion surveys are piloted, and options for improving and solving the problem are accounted.
Phase 3: Solving the Problem; at this stage, policies, programs and projects are implemented. In most cases, the government will manage all the details of a program by itself but the best scenario is when NGOs and other involved groups participate in the initiatives.
Phase 4: Monitoring the Problem: At this point the focus is to ensure that the problem is under control and must remain so. This is also the time to think about future policies and to develop public and private partnerships in implementing policies.

==== Interdisciplinary research for policy and practice ====
Policy analysis has traditionally followed a linear model – problem identification, policy formulation, legislation, implementation, evaluation, and iteration. However, in solving complex socio-economic problems, a more interdisciplinary approach to societal problems may be more effective particularly for research topics of interdisciplinary nature (e.g., women's studies, environment) or those relevant to policy or strategic issues – drawing from different disciplines to enhance understanding of particular issues or for concept development. The main interest of interdisciplinary research for policy and practice is description, prediction, and ultimately social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyall|first1=Catherine|title=A Short Guide to Designing Interdisciplinary Research for Policy and Practice|url=http://www.genomicsnetwork.ac.uk/media/Short%20Guide%20to%20Designing%20Interdisciplinary%20Research%20for%20Policy%20and%20Practice.pdf|publisher=The Institute for the Study of Science Technology and Innovation (ISSTI)|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interdisciplinary research, different disciplines interact and work together at each and every stage of the research process – from conceptualisation, research design and methodology, data analysis and interpretation into policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carr &amp; MacLachlan|title=INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH FOR DEVELOPMENT:|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Development_communication&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods in communication policy analysis ====
Ongkiko and Flor (2006)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; argue that a development communication specialist (DCS), at one time or another, also assumes the role of a communication policy analyst in Communication Policy Analysis 'because of his proactive posture and his preoccupation with purpose' (Flor, 1991). Remember that policy sciences anticipates, and looks forward, thus, substantiates the proactive nature of a DCS. In order to fully act out this role, there is a need for a rudimentary knowledge of methods in policy analysis, particularly those related to development communication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among these methods are discussed below:

===== Communication technology assessment (CTA) =====
Communication plays a vital role in project coordination, management, knowledge collection and transfer among different project shareholders (Malone &amp; Crowston, 1994; Espinosa &amp; Carmel, 2003, as cited by Gill, Bunker, &amp; Seltsikas, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&amp;context=pacis2012

| first =

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). CTA is a qualitative method that seeks to determine the higher and lower order impacts of specific forms of communication technology on the individual and society (Flor, 1991) prior to the adoption of new technology (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;). The decision to adopt or not depends on the findings of the assessment. CTA is forward-looking and adopts certain value premises on what is socially beneficial or detrimental to society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Being anticipatory in nature, CTA forecasts, at least on a probabilistic basis, the full spectrum of possible consequences of technological advance, leaving to the political process the actual choice among the alternative policies in the light of the best available knowledge of their likely consequences (Brooks, 1976, as cited by Ely, Zwanenberg, &amp; Stirling, 2010).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ely, Adrian, Zwanenberg, Patrick Van, &amp; Stirling, Andrew (2010).

===== Cost-Benefit Analysis =====
Introduced by Jules Dupuit in 1840s, French engineer and economist, the cost benefit analysis is a methodology used in policy analysis as a way of weighing up projects costs and benefits, to determine whether to go ahead with a project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_08.htm|title=Cost Benefit Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=Mind Tools|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyea (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/research-starters/cost-benefit-analysis-decision-making-public#research-starter-research-starter|title=Cost-Benefit Analysis: Decision Making Tools in Public Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the types of cost analysis used in policy making to aid decision process. These are: Cost-Benefit analysis, Cost-effectiveness, cost-utilization and cost utility.

===== Social cost-benefit analysis =====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is also referred to as Economic Analysis (EA). SCBA or EA is a feasibility study of a project from the viewpoint of a society to evaluate whether a proposed project will add benefit or cost to the society (Ibid.). Ongkiko and Flor (2006&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;) further elaborate that SCBA is a quantitative method which attaches monetary values on social conditions brought by certain communication policies. Flor (1991) explains the monetary value of the social costs is subtracted from the social benefits of a particular program or policy. A positive difference is required for a program or policy to be adjudged as socially beneficial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The purpose of SCBA is to assist public decision-making, not in terms of producing the ideal project but simply by proposing the optimum solution for the community out of the spectrum of possibilities (Dupuis, 1985).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Dupuis, Xavier (1985). ''Applications and Limitations of Cost-Benefit Analysis as Applied to Cultural Development.'' A study commissioned by UNESCO. Retrieved online from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000819/081977eo.pdf [April 24, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the objective is to determine optimum quantities as a contribution to decision-making or to evaluate the effectiveness of decisions already taken.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== Problematique analysis =====
The problematique analysis procedure is a naturalistic approach&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233046805_Towards_a_methodology_for_problematique_analysis_A_philippine_experience

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seeks to discover the influential factors&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and describe the structure of problems that exist in communication systems (Librero, 1993; Flor, 1991). The basic purpose of this approach, according to Librero (1993), is to identify the problem rather than the solution. In the process, therefore, the evaluator employing problematique analysis identifies the factors that influence the system, shows the hierarchical relationships of these factors and traces the root causes of the problems of the system.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Flor (1991) classified these influential factors as either ''subordinate'' or ''superordinate'', with the former being merely the symptoms of the latter. The identification of the superordinate influential factors or the root causes, then, prevents the recurrence of the problem situation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Scenario construction =====
As a policy analysis tool, scenario construction (SC) describes a possible set of future conditions (Moniz, 2006&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Moniz, Antonio Brandão (2006). ''Scenario-Building Methods as a Tool for Policy Analysis''. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200002555_Scenario-Building_Methods_as_a_Tool_for_Policy_Analysis [accessed Apr 23, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;) or hypothetical events that may occur in the future of a particular system (Allen, 1978, as cited by Flor, 1991). It has also been defined as a description of the conditions and events under which some system being studied is assumed to be operating (Kraemer, 1973, as cited by Flor, 1991). Scenarios provide an educated description of one of many possible futures of a system, usually presented at the most optimistic or "best-case" state and the most pessimistic or "worst-case" state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Moniz (2006), the most useful scenarios are those that display the conditions of important variables over time. In this approach, the quantitative underpinning enriches the narrative evolution of conditions or evolution of variables; narratives describe the important events and developments that shape the variables. In terms of innovative methods for policy analysis, the foresight and scenario construction methods can be an interesting reference for social sciences (Moniz, 2006&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;). Citing Allen (1978), Flor (1991) enumerates six steps in scenario construction, namely: (1) defining the system; (2) establishing a time period for the system to operate; (3) defining the external constraints on the environment of the system; (4) defining the elements or events within the system that are likely to increase or decrease the chances of the system's meeting its goals and objectives; (5) stating in probabilistic terms the likelihood of the occurrence of the elements or events; and (6) conducting a sensitive analysis of the results.

===== Policy Delphi =====
The Policy Delphi, according to Flor (1991), is a variation of the Delphi technique. It is a tool for the analysis of policy issues seeking the involvement and participation of anonymous respondents (usually representatives of the different stakeholders of the policy). Herein, the desirability and feasibility of certain policies are assessed from the points of view of the different stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Meanwhile, according to Turoff (1975), the policy Delphi aims to create the best possible contrasting insights to resolve a major policy problem. Herein, the decision maker is interested on having a group that will give him options and supporting evidences where he can choose from for him to make a solution, rather than having a group that will produce the decision for him. ''"The Policy Delphi is, then, a tool for the analysis of policy issues and not a mechanism for making a decision"'' (Turoff, 1975).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Turoff, Murray (1975). The Policy Delphi. In ''Harold A. Linstone and Murray Turoff (Eds.), The Delphi Method: Techniques and Applications.'' pp. 80–96. Online copy was accessed from http://is.njit.edu/pubs/delphibook/delphibook.pdf [April 24, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Turoff (1975) notes the challenging nature of policy Delphi as a means for policy analysis, "both for the design team and for the respondents" (Turoff, 1975). As a process, the policy Delphi undergoes the following six phases: (1) Formulating the issue; (2) Citing options; (3) Deciding preliminary stance about the issue; (4) Searching and getting reasons for disputes; (5) Assessing the underlying reasons; (6) Reassessing the options.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

As a methodology, Delphi is used for structuring a group communication process so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As mentioned, one of the advantages of this technique is the involvement of stakeholders in the analysis which is imperatively instrumental in building a consensus among people who will be/are affected by the policy/project. In the Philippines, this has also been well applied in a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor and Dr. Felix Librero in the Southeast Asian Needs Assessment for a Global Open Agriculture and Food University.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Recently, Haynes, Palermo and Reidlinger(2016) adopted a Delphi modified technique(James Lind Alliance Approach) in their study in exploring obesity prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Emily|last2=Palermo|first2=Claire|last3=Reidlinger|first3=Dianne P.|date=2016-09-01|title=Modified Policy-Delphi study for exploring obesity prevention priorities|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e011788|journal=BMJ Open|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e011788|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011788|issn=2044-6055|pmid=27601495|pmc=5020738}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.

Flor (1991)&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; emphasizes the incorporation of divergent stakeholders in communication policy making. That the State is not a lone actor in the creation of public policies as noted by the various stakeholders identified by Flor (1991), attesting to the fact that State actions do not occur in an empty space. Consumer involvement to policy making can therefore of paramount importance in helping create relevant policies vis-à-vis Gatung’s (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johian. (1971). ‘A structural theory of imperialism’. ''Journal of Peace Research'', 8 (2) pp.81–117.&lt;/ref&gt; postulation of policies promoting "''horizontalization'' where exchanges occur between the centers and peripheries "on more equal terms"." In this regard, employing appropriate methods in policy research such would be necessary in ‘light of the diversity of stakeholders involved, there is a possibility to broaden the scope of ‘expertise’ to share opinion across diverse perspectives including local communities’ (Haynes, et al., 2016). Employing the Modified Policy-Delphi technique to crafting an all-inclusive communication policy include the following jusutification:
* The Policy-Delphi technique ability to explore consensus and dissent, rather than aiming to achieve consensus,
* As a flexible technique, it can be applied to various situations to map overlapping priorities from different perspectives and identify mutual priorities across stakeholder groups and therefore is a valuable exercise for investigating complex public issues
* The technique facilitates an in-depth investigation which may detect limitations, considerations and consequences of policy options which may enhance the value and success of policy implementation.
* The diversity of stakeholders involved makes reaching consensus on priorities less feasible but where mapping perspectives may identify mutual concepts behind the most agreeable options to inform future research and practice.
* The technique provides an opportunity for participants to contribute equally, and offers additional options and comments throughout; in this respect, it gives all participants, including consumers, a voice in the complex debate [equity in ‘Voices’]

The methodology outlined in Haynes et al (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, E., Palermo, C. and Reidlinger, D.P. (2016). ‘Modified Policy-Delphi study for exploring obesity prevention priorities’, ''BMJ Open'' 6:e011788. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011788&lt;/ref&gt; paper align with Servaes (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt; reference to the application of Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective by positing that for dialectical and emancipatory process of action and reflection that constitutes the "process of ''conscientization,'' where an agenda instead of defined by an academic elite and programs enacted by a bureaucratic elite for the benefit of an economic or political elite, participatory research involves people gaining an understanding of their situation, confidence and an ability to change that situation" (Servaes, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore the notion of Participatory Communication stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities, and of democratisation and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional 'receivers'. However one needs not to romanticize the use of such ‘equity’ methods. Sarveas(1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt; had outlined the following caution:
* Participatory research can all too easily be utilized as yet another tool of manipulation by vested interests.
* While the approach strives towards empowerment, challenges existing structures, and is consequently ideological, rigidly prescribed ideologies must be avoided
* In addition, knowledge and perspective gained may well empower exploitative economic and authoritarian interests instead of local groups.
* Far from helping the process of liberation, if the researcher is not careful, he or she may only enable the traditional policy-makers and vested interests to present their goods in a more attractive package.
* Even the best intentioned researcher/activist can inadvertently enhance dependency rather than empowerment. If she/he enters communities with ready-made tools for analyzing reality, and solving problems, the result will likely be that as far as those tools are successful, dependency will simply be moved from one tyrant to another".

===== Simulations and modelling =====
Simulations and modelling recently become a useful tool policy analysis involving computers and software in creating a virtual representation of the scenario. Because it offers a systems view of the situation, the analyst or researcher can monitor how the players or variables interacts in the simulated environment. The purposes of simulations may vary to include education, research, design improvement and/or the exploration of the probable effect of different policy decisions.

Guyonne Kalbe(2004) identifies and distinguishes two types of simulation models: macro and micro levels. According to Kalbe, the macro-level is applied mostly for huge sectors of the industries. This macro simulation is usually applied by developed countries in order to assess and understand policy changes. On the other hand, the micro-level is used for a specific company using a sample of population when a need for more precised and focused information is its goal. In contrast to large-scale industries that use the macro-level approach, the micro-level is individualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalbe|first=Guyonne|date=|title=Introduction: The Use of Simulation Models in Policy Analysis|url=http://businesslaw.curtin.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/05/AJLE-v7n1-kalb-intro.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Labour and Economics|volume=7|pages=1–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since problems in policy decisions are not linear by nature, computer simulations provides a concrete view of the situation and how the variables changes pace. These changes in behaviors are integral in developing policies. Steven Bankes(1992) explicates the use of computer simulation in policy decisions wherein models used in policy analysis provide arguments to illuminate options for policy decisions based on the result of computer simulated analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bankes, S. (1992). https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2009/N3093.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology has been successfully used in development projects. Thorngate &amp; Tavakoli(2009) mention fields where computer simulations has aided decision makers in assessing the context and solutions to specific problems. Among these include: the climate changes, effects of fiscal changes in economic policies, traffic regulations, health allocation resources, air regulations and crisis management to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;Thorngate, W., and Tavakoli, M. (2009). Simulation, Rhetoric, and Policy Making. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Sage Publications. Volume 40 number 4. https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878108330539&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted that simulations and modelling could be based on artificial data generating process (DGP) or real live data from the environment for analysis. The real data derived from the environment is often called “big data” due to the significantly larger size. This is especially critical in the development communication discussion when there is prevalent use of digital communication technology in low and middle income countries (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015). The technologies in these countries include mobile phones and notebooks. These technologies emit data as a byproduct and have great potential to fill some of the problematic gaps encountered by country policy makers and international development organizations. There is research indicating that the use of big data represents an important complement to country level statistics (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor, L &amp; Schroeder R |first1=L&amp;R |title=Is bigger better? the emergence of big data as a tool for international development policy |journal=Geojournal |date=2015 |volume=80 |issue=4 |page=503-518 |doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;, better water quality modelling (Korfmacher, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korfmacher |first1=K. S |title=Water quality modeling for environmental management: Lessons from the policy sciences |journal=Policy Sciences |date=1998 |volume=31 |issue=1 |page=35-54 |doi=10.1023/A:1004334600179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved agricultural development (WESTERVELT, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=WESTERVELT |first1=J.D |title=Empowering stakeholders and policy makers with science-based simulation modeling tools |journal=The American Behavioral Scientist |date=2001 |volume=44 |issue=8 |page=1418-1437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of big data can ensure a more accurate measurement of macro-economic data such as price track. The Billion Prices Project (BPP) initiated by MIT’s Sloan School of Management challenges the Argentina government on the misleading inflation index report. It reported by very high inflation rate by the government’s statistical institute which led to the fire of all government officials in the department a few years later. The actual inflation rate after the lay-off eventually stabilizes. The group in MIT decided to investigate what is going on by programming a web scraper to find prices for everyday goods posted on the web by the country’s supermarkets. It scrapes many data on the web and is a financially affordable experiment. The outcome of the result led to an increased suspicion that Argentina’s statistical agency was under pressure to level off inflation rate by higher order authority. The BPP proves to be influential because it produced an inflation index that was more intuitively reflective of perceptions and in real society than the government. It also provides an alternative set of perspective on economic trends which policymakers can use to make prudent finance policy decisions. There is an increasing need for major governments in the world to rethink how development statistics should be collated in order to craft better and finer public policy.

The simulation approach in policy science is beneficial to policy coherence on the sustainable development goals commonly called SDGs. The SGDs developed by United Nations has integrative nature which is suitable for integrative modelling techniques (Collste et al., 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collste, D., Pedercini, M., Cornell, S. E. |title=Policy coherence to achieve the SDGs: Using integrated simulation models to assess effective policies |journal=Sustainability Science, |date=2017 |volume=12 |issue=6 |page=921-931 |doi=10.1007/s11625-017-0457-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Collste and the researchers have shown in a Tanzania experiment that modelling approach towards SGDs can bring interlinks to the forefront and facilitate a shift to a discussion on development grounded in systems thinking. It brings the multitudes of possible feedback loops that shape a country’s development especially those in developing country. The modelling approach in SDGs maps interlinkages and provide analysis about the resulting behaviour of different policy decisions. It also provide new casual pathways on investments in public projects.

==== Applications of policy sciences to context-specific developmental policy issues ====

===== Environmental assessment =====
The [[policy science]]s are highly relevant in environmental impact assessments (EIA) and large-scale environmental change modeling. One example is the use of scenario-making in the study by Garb, Pulver, and VanDeveer (2008). Using storyline driven modeling, they sought to understand the impacts of human activities on natural systems. The said study departs from the increasingly technical approach to [[scenario analysis]]. Instead, they drew concept and methodologies from science and technology studies, sociology, and political science. Policy-making is multi-method, and in this case, multi-disciplinary. In this study's framework, scenario is said to be able to "co-produce knowledge and social order by facilitating collaboration between scientific and technical experts of various types and policy-makers and other non-scientists, as together they 'make sense' of aspects of the natural world and aspects of social interaction (their own and that of societies at large)." The intertwined relationship between development communication and policy sciences is affirmed because the study recommends including more representatives of social science professionals in global environmental scenario teams, and creating fora with their active involvement, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/3/4/045015/pdf|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/4/045015|title=Scenarios in society, society in scenarios: toward a social scientific analysis of storyline-driven environmental modeling |author= Yaakov Garb |displayauthors=etal|year=2008|journal=Environ. Res. Lett.|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, international-funding agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank has recognised the potential of EIA as an opportunity for dialogue between and among project stakeholders (Flor, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication |title=Environmental Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flor posits that though the EIA is generally regarded as a regularly and management tool, it should also be regarded as a communication process that seeks to achieve mutual understanding—the overall purpose of development communication and for that matter, environmental communication programs. This mutual understanding would translate to societal environmental consciousness.
Development communication as a discipline grew as a response to some of the most pressing problems of underdevelopment including environment and resources degradation. Environmental communication programs are logically subsumed under development communication.

Citing five case studies of the use of communication and social mobilisation in environmental protection and natural resources management programs, Flor laid out the following lessons learned from the five programs:

# Effective environment communication is not merely instructive nor consultative.
# Effective environmental communication is not merely informative either.
# Participation and collective action is internally driven, not externally imposed.
# Environmental communication should make use of indigenous media.
# Environment communication should be done on an interpersonal level as well as on a community level, and further on a national level.
# Participation takes time; effective communication proceeds at its own pace.
# Effective environment communication assumes a momentum of its own.

====Policy science as catalyst instrument for environmental communication towards development====

[[Policy science]] is the bedrock in developing environmental and social movement to address immense issue and predicament regarding environmental depletion and societal development. However, there are three components to be considered when addressing about the issue and talking about development (economy, environment, and society). The most prevalent phenomenon bound to become increasingly imperative through the on-going dual process of economic-cum-ecological globalization wherein the process of constructing policies for [[sustainable development]] is essential. The concept of "policy science" plays a central role in the development; therefore, the incorporation and synchronization of communication and policy science in tackling the challenges encountered is valuable. The communicators are critical contributors to societal development and environmental sustainability wherein the basis could be aided as the framework for [[policy analysis]] and policy construction. At these science-policy interfaces, policymakers, communicators and other key stakeholders are supposed to interact on a constant basis.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=N.|title=The Science-Policy Interface as a Communication Process: Exploring How Policy Decision-Makers Perceive Science-Driven Policy and Make Evidence-Based Decisions on the Nuclear Fuel Cycle|journal=ProQuest LLC|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development with emphasis on [[environmental communication]] instrument guided by the policy science is a trending topic. Indeed, the consideration of environmental communication in developing policy to handle the enduring distresses act as catalyst for policy makers to unravel protuberant concern. Numerous countries that have developed or are developing when surfacing about the environment is essentially crucial as the development that is being misguided by the policy science will lead to a plethora of [[environmental crisis]]. Therefore, policy creation in fostering environmental communication is vital as it has significantly contributed to the totality growth of economy and serve as a platform to raise key questions that positively helpful in [[decision making]]. Environmental communication, defined as "... the medium that we use in constructing environmental problems and negotiating communities different responses to them.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=R.|title=Risk communication: Nonexpert publics and acceptable risk. In Environmental communication and the public sphere|date=2006|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=205-240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of environmental policy instruments at the national level has a positive influence on [[environmental management]] at other levels and all sectors.&lt;ref name="Lagzdina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lagzdina|first1=E.|title=Environmental communication instruments for environmental policy integration|journal=Scientific Journal of Riga Technical University: Environmental and Climate Technologies|date=2010|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the requirement in developing "environmental communication instrument" is essential to lay the foundation for the framework to understand the environmental communication policy science in stimulating for development into top-down stream from national level. Communication in the environmental sector that is primarily formally regulated by access to information and participation legal acts, has great potential, if an immense variety of well-developed and continuously emerging new environmental communication forms represented by different sectors and target groups, are utilized for the common goal of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Lagzdina" /&gt; However, these will become successful when communicators, policy makers, and key stakeholders can effectively convey their messages to each other and build mutual trust based on a set of co-constructed knowledge.&lt;ref name="Bogenschneider"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogenschneider|first1=K.|last2=Corbett|first2=T.|title=Evidence-based policymaking: Insights from policy-minded researchers and research-minded policymakers|journal=Routledge|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting policy to promote environmental communication for development is essential. However, understanding environmental communication instruments especially the broad spectrum of technical content and social consideration to lever the consequences should not be deserted.

===== Governance =====
In a study by Hilbert, Miles, and Othmer (2009), a five-round Delphi exercise was conducted to show how "international foresight exercises, through online and offline tools, can make policy-making in developing countries more participatory, fostering transparency and accountability of public decision-making". Policy science was used to identify future priorities with regard to the 2005–2007 Latin American and Caribbean Action Plan for the Information Society ([[ELAC Action Plans|eLAC2007]]). The paper presented specific policy guidance, and explained how [[Delphi method|Policy]] [null Delphi] methods can be applied to make public decision-making more transparent and accountable, particularly in developing countries. Practical implications drawn include 1) "the governments' acknowledgement of the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi and the ensuing appreciation of participative policy-making" and 2) "the role that can be played by the United Nations (and potentially by other inter-governmental agencies) in international participatory policy-making in the digital age, especially if they modernize the way they assist member countries in developing public policy agendas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|last2=Miles|first2=Ian|last3=Othmer|first3=Julia|date=2009-09-01|title=Foresight tools for participative policy-making in inter-governmental processes in developing countries: Lessons learned from the eLAC Policy Priorities Delphi|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162509000031|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=76|issue=7|pages=880–896|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2009.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Distance education =====
In the book "Beyond Access and Equity: Distance Learning Models in Asia", Flor (2002) details the case of SMP Terbuka, a junior secondary education in Indonesia delivered in distance learning mode. This is in consonance with the country's pursuit of the Universalization of Basic Education. In assessing the socio-cultural environment of SMP Terbuka and in determining the policy environment for [[distance learning]], environmental scanning was done. The study also used the problematique method to analyze structural-organizational problems in a distance learning system, along with their causes. Overall, a systems analysis approach was employed where the environment, the stakeholders, the organization cum network, and problem structure were analyzed. Flor proceeds with a proposed communication and advocacy plan for SMP Terbuka aimed at eliciting public support to this alternative education mode. In designing the [[social marketing]] and advocacy blueprint, situation analysis was used. This employed four methods, namely, "environmental scanning, communication resources assessment; review of existing communication strategies; and strategic impact analysis directed at sector stakeholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flor|first=Alexander G. |title=Beyond Access and Equity: Distance Learning Models in Asia |url=https://www.academia.edu/579451/Beyond_Access_and_Equity_Distance_Learning_Models_in_Asia |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Health reforms =====
Walt and Gilson (1994) emphasized the central role of policy analysis in health reforms in developing countries. In their study, they argue that [[health policy]] narrowly focuses on the content of reform, and neglects other crucial considerations such as the context that calls for such reform, the processes involved, and the social actors or the stakeholders associated with the reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WALT|first=GILL|last2=GILSON|first2=LUCY|date=1994-12-01|title=Reforming the health sector in developing countries: the central role of policy analysis|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/9/4/353/649125/Reforming-the-health-sector-in-developing?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Health Policy and Planning|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=353–370|doi=10.1093/heapol/9.4.353|issn=0268-1080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information overload and the wastage ratio ====
Fred Fedler (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=S.D.|title=Dilemmas in the Study of Information: Exploring the Boundaries of Information Science|date=1992|publisher=. Greenwood Publishing Group.}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned in the book, Dilemmas in the Study of Information: Exploring the Boundaries of Information Science, describes the impact of the Information age by referring to media's "vulnerability to hoaxes".  Fedler contends "journalists are vulnerable to information and will always be. Journalists cannot determine the truth to the stories they publish, nor check every details. They receive too many stories, and a single story may contain hundreds of details".  In the same vein, this is what majority of the specialists posits as the information explosion.

Now more than ever, information has exceeded in millions of gigabytes. Technology has brought people around the world to be confronted with so much information that utilization of this information has now become an issue.  Dr Paul Marsden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsden|first1=Paul|title=Fast Facts: Information Overload 2013|url=http://digitalintelligencetoday.com/fast-facts-information-overload-2013/|website=Digital Intelligence Today|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Digital Intelligence Today defines information overload as "when the volume of potentially useful and relevant information available exceeds processing capacity and becomes a hindrance rather than a help" (Marsden, 2013).

Dr. Alexander Flor, in his article on the information wastage ratio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flor|first1=Alexander|title=Development Communication Praxis|date=2007|publisher=UP Open University}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that although information can be consumed anytime and seldom has expiration date;

"Research information is generated for a particular purpose, a specific user and a definite problem in mind. If such information is unavailable to the right person, at the right time and at the right place, then we conclude that the effort exerted to generate this amount of information has been wasted".

One approach that Flor has postulated to establish the underutilization is his information wastage ratio. The ratio takes into consideration the concepts of information generation (IG) and information utilization (IU) expressed as "wastage ratio that is equivalent to one minus the amount of information utilized divided by the quantity of information generated", thus:

Wr = 1 – IU/IG

Flor's formula accounts for the information deficit especially, among the Third World countries, where information utilization is constrained by factors such as  "low literacy, limited media access and availability, low computer literacy, low levels of education and unsound communication policy".
The framework that Flor presented is best described as "the communication revolution contributes to the quantity of information generated thus, information explosion happens". Since the relationship of the two phenomena is reciprocal, "the quantity of information, the quality of information and the information overload determine the information wastage in an information society".
The outcome of this wastage ratio provides support for the initiation of communication policies to ensure full utilization of information in varied fields.

====Between research, development and policy====

It is a complex task to achieve effectiveness in development policy especially in rural areas. It involves a range of stakeholders who need to demonstrate coordinated action. Sunitiyoso et al. (2012) claim that holistic thinking is needed to solve public policy problems which requires collaborative efforts across different organizational boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt; The government through its administration must show vigor and integrity to implement these programs. Development policy makers must consider providing education and sustained training in order to materialize the programs provided to the beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatnagar, S. (2000). Social implications of information and communication technology in developing countries: Lessons from Asian success stories. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 1(1), 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustained training does not only rely to ICT, it also needs emotional quotient to motivate beneficiaries to get involved and develop a sense of ownership.  President Julius K. Nyerere once stated that the people must participate in considering, planning, and implementing their development (in Tanganyika African National Union, 1971 ).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1976). Communication and development: The passing of the dominant paradigm. Communication research, 3(2), 213-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore development can only be achieved when people develop themselves. This has been realized by not only socialist and communist nations, but also by capitalist nations such as Singapore and South Korea. Self- development is usually accompanied by social mobilization by political parties, non- government organizations and workers from the academe.

Scholars have proposed categories for the analysis of changes present in the research and policy sectors. What generates lack of accord between the effectiveness of development communication policy is the unrealized link between the importance of research and development to policy making.&lt;ref&gt;Leydesdorff, L. (2005). The Triple Helix Model and the Study of Knowledge-based Innovation Systems. Int. Journal of Contemporary Sociology 42 (1), 2005, 12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to Europe, the United States and Latin America, the challenges of knowledge and technology transfer have been solved in the forefront of attention in economic, social and industrial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Etzkowitz, H., &amp; Ranga, M. (2015). Triple Helix systems: an analytical framework for innovation policy and practice in the Knowledge Society. In Entrepreneurship and Knowledge Exchange (pp. 117-158). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gap between researchers and policy makers=====
The ''praxis'' or the marriage of research and practice, according to Flor (1991)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is needed to address the pressing social issues that are pestering the society. However, there are factors that delay its realization. According to UNCTAD Virtual Institute (2006), there are still a huge communication gap between researchers and policy makers. On the side of the policy makers, the information on ongoing researchers barely reaches to them. The researchers, on the other hand, lack the awareness and the knowledge on the most important policy that could contribute so much in the research. Here are some common reasons for the wide gap between the two:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
Policy makers turn primarily to international organizations, international research institutes or their own technical experts or diplomatic missions to obtain information and analysis as policy inputs. Local universities and research institutes may have the capacity but are often not able to engage in cooperation with policy makers.
Policy-makers consider the credibility of researchers and research outputs a key requirement for cooperation.
Governments lack systematic procedures regarding which research institutions to turn to, and when and how to establish contact with researchers.
Data required for informed research may be non-existent or inaccessible.
Hence, the joint UNCTAD-WTO-ITC workshop on trade policy analysis workshop has forwarded these recommendations for both the research institutions and policy making bodies:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;UNCTAD-WTO-ITC (2006). [http://vi.unctad.org/tda/papers/tradedata/tdarecs.PDF Research-based Policy Making: Bridging the Gap between Researchers and Policy Makers], Recommendations for researchers and policy makers arising from the joint UNCTAD-WTO-ITC workshop on trade policy analysis, Geneva, 11–15 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a researcher:
Try to disseminate information about current research projects as widely as possible:
Invite concerned government officials to conferences or presentations of research, or organize specific events bringing together policy makers and researchers
Send notes and abstracts to relevant ministries
Distribute research to government agencies but also to NGOs, which might also be among its users. Be ready to discuss work in progress with policy-makers after initial contacts have been established.
Try to get in direct contact, for example with negotiators, by providing them with short notes/abstracts of relevant research findings.
Establish contact and build a long-term cooperation with relevant ministries. The start can be facilitated by having a "champion" in the ministry. However, the researcher/research institution may need to avoid being too closely identified with a "champion", and hence, depending too much on the evolution of the "champion's" status.
Access to high-ranked officials at ministries can be facilitated by involving higher-level representatives at universities (deans, vice-chancellors…) in the establishment and maintenance of contacts. However, more decentralized cooperation can also be productive if he procedures within the university tend to be very hierarchical and bureaucratic.
As a policy maker:
Involve policy-makers in research. Policy-makers who are consulted at the initial stages of a research project tend to be more open since they can actively participate and hence have a stake in shaping the research questions, and thereby take "ownership" of the research as well. Regular interaction during the research project can help adjusting the questions researched and the tools used to the needs of policy makers.
Make sure that your research addresses issues of policy relevance to your country by approaching permanent missions in Geneva which can act as facilitators by providing information regarding current policy-relevant research questions.

=====Bridging the gap through collaboration=====

There has been shift of policy-making from academic sources of development relations between government, academia and industry, and scholars often refer this as “triple helix model”. Henry Etzkowitz defines it as a “a spiral model of innovation that captures multiple reciprocal relationships at different points in the process of knowledge capitalization.”&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzkowitz and Melo (2004) stated that recognizing that university is the source of new knowledge, industry is where the practice ground for technology and development and the supporting role of government as policy makers. The importance of collaboration is a successful model in any project management. More so when a holistic approach is applied in policy development, it may be a solution to address the complexity of policy implementation as all stakeholders are required to participate beginning from the conceptualization, planning, policy formulation and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Policy sciences ====
Nora Quebral (1971) defines development communication as "the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and larger fulfilment of the human potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://devcomconvergence.wordpress.com/tag/nora-c-quebral/|title=Nora C. Quebral – devcomconvergence|website=devcomconvergence.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental characteristic that distinguishes development communication from traditional views of mass communication is its purposive nature. According to Flor, policies, being guidelines, imply that certain directions are already assumed. Development communication and the policies sciences stem from the same rationale, which is the need for actively applying knowledge form and principles of the social sciences in order to solve large-scale societal problems under the premise of social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Melafopulos (2008) presented two modes or approaches to development communication: the monologic mode and the dialogic mode. The monologic mode is linked to the standpoint of 'diffusion' following the one-way model of communication. The purpose of this mode is to disseminate information and messages to persuade its recipients about the intended change. In short, communication is positioned to (1) inform and (2) persuade. In this model, the feedback is enhanced and canned allowing the sender to refine its persuasive message. On the other hand, dialogic mode is related with the participatory paradigm which follows a two-way communication model. It seeks to create a conducive environment where stakeholders are involved in all stages of the project from the definitions down to the implementation of solutions. This model seeks to make use of communication (1) to assess and (2) to empower. The use of dialogic communication paves the way for building of trust and understanding which is the key to participation and eventually for the empowerment of the people in the grassroots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Achieving development in the community is collaboration between different stakeholders. Development communication believes that in order to have genuine development, that desire to improve and uplift their lives must come from the grassroots level; it must come from the people. Development communication empowers the people to believe in themselves that they can do something in order to alleviate their standard of living. In their book, [http://booklikes.com/introduction-to-development-communication-ila-virginia-c-ongkiko-alexander-/book,6911885 Introduction to Development Communication], Ongkiko and Flor (2006) claimed that Development communication entails motivating individuals and groups of people such as farmers, fisherfolks, workers, housewives, and the youth to change their habits, their lifestyles, their way of thinking and their way of doing things. This further proves that development communication is not just merely providing facts and information instead its goal is to persuade the people to become an active participant in the achievement of their goals.

Policy sciences refer to the scientific study of policies and policy making. Policy refers to a cluster of decisions with a particular purpose and audience in mind. The word "science" is used to suggest the use of empirical data gathered from systematic observation. The plural form (sciences) is used to underscore the interdisciplinary nature of this field (Allen, 1978). Policy science was conceived in order to cope-up with the fast changing landscape of our society. Because of these changes they called, "turbulent field", the traditional social science methodology was already considered inadequate in solving today's societal problems (Allen, 1978). The goal of policy sciences is to develop and provide concrete solution to the rising problems brought by technological progress.&lt;ref name=":87"&gt;[http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy sciences are concerned with knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order. Knowledge of the decision process implies systematic, empirical studies of how policies are made and put into effect. When knowledge is systematic, it goes beyond the aphoristic remarks that are strewn through the "wisdom" literature of the past.&lt;ref name=":87"/&gt;

Development communication and policy sciences are two essential elements in resolving recurring dilemma especially in the third world societies.

==== In the Information Age ====
In Flor's ''Developing Societies in the Information Age: A Critical Perspective'', he mentioned the 2000 Okinawa Summit of G7/G8 nations that described information and communications technology or ICT as "one of the most potent forces in shaping the Twenty-first Century...fast becoming a vital engine of growth for the world economy". The summit also decried the existence of a digital divide between rich and poor nations and that the major challenge posed today is to bridge this widening chasm. The Information Age, the so-called third era of human civilization is a pervasive social phenomenon, a global environment. In the Information Age, capital becomes less important than information. In fact, information becomes the "primary resource". There is an observed global shift in resources of power from land, labor and capital to information. The change is more on the nature of resources that are being controlled.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developing Societies in the Information Age: A Critical Perspective|last=Flor|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=July 2008|isbn=|location=Los Baños, Laguna|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Flor stated, "informatization comes with the Information Age. All aspects of society – politics, culture, business and economy – have become increasingly information-oriented. Information gives rise to economies and societies wherein information, naturally, becomes the dominant commodity or resource. Concomitant to informatization is the globalization of the economy. The communications or information revolution has tended to shrink the size of the world, figuratively. Instant communication between two persons situated at opposite sides of the globe is a common occurrence. Distance no longer serves as a minor factor in communication."

===== Information society vs. Information Age =====
An ''information society'' should be differentiated from ''Information Age''. An information society refers to a social system, meanwhile, the Information Age refers to an era in human civilization, a worldwide phenomenon. It is possible for people to live in an information age but not in an information society. Observations have also pointed that the trend towards information societies can be found in the Third World. For example, in Asia, certain trends that are indifferent to political developments show that Asia is moving towards that direction. These trends include: the growing demand for mobile devices and software, broadband, Wi-Fi, wi-max services, and even online educational programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Control through communication =====
"Control is achieved through communication. Norbert Weiner, the father of cybernetics, equated communication with control and observed that it is negatively related to entropy, the tendency for all systems towards breakdown. This function or relationship is magnified in the Information Age." Therefore, in the Information Age, there seems to be a positive correlation between information and power, between communication and power. The logical consequence of this is the gravitation of special interest groups to the communication/information industry and the mad scramble for communication resources. Those who will gain access to more resources would understandably hold more political and economic power. They may, in turn, perpetuate this condition by determining enabling societal structures. According to Flor, information, traditionally defined, is that which contributes to the reduction of uncertainty. Although technically accurate, the definition neglects the social dimension of information. "It is the social function which adds value to information and which gives those who possess it advantage over those who do not. Thus, information should be regarded first and foremost as a resource. As in the case of other resources, there is a tendency for other exploitative groups to hoard information and to use it to further their interests. Information nowadays is associated with influence and power. It is now treated as a dominant commodity under the control and manipulation of the elite." He also noted that "Information resources should contribute more towards equality than exploitation, towards harmony than conflict, towards complementarities than dominance, towards integration than segregation, towards participation than elitism, towards indigenous development than dependency, and towards convergence than divergence."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The availability of information may be a function of the availability of mass media, new media and other channels of information. Availability of communication media is obviously a prerequisite for access. For communities wherein media are relatively unavailable, access to communication media is hampered to a considerable degree.

In contrast, development communication can also be key towards more democratic societies. Democracy has been a prevailing philosophy in many countries for the recent years. However, until today, how democratic institutions affect human well-being, particularly people’s health is still argued. Existing evidences are not robust or strong in providing critical insights into the significance of democratic institutions on achieving better life expectancies and reducing mortalities (Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006). Life expectancies have increased dramatically and mortalities have significant reduced over the years. Such progress has been mostly attributed to increasing income per capita (Li and Zhu, 2006), improved medical technologies and interventions (Papageorgiou et al., 2007) and strengthened global collaborations (Elobu et al., 2014, Chu et al., 2014), among others. Previous literature has also favoured more democratic governments in maximizing health systems performance; and thereafter, improving health outcomes. In this view, health outcomes are better achieved because governments are controlled by the majority, leaders are more accountable for the benefit of all rather than minor groups of society, and mechanisms for selecting competent leaders to implement policies are deemed stronger. Despite evidence on its significance, some have still argued that democracy can only be successful in effecting positive impacts only if proper conditions are met. For example, the 1983 Polish health system has moved from a communist model without general practitioners to where clinicians in polyclinics provided free healthcare. The former system was then perceived to be better because the latter created more opportunities for bribery; hence, increasing inequitable access to healthcare (Scully, 2007). Recently, most health systems have transitioned along a continuum of private or market health systems similar to the United States and a public or state health systems similar to the United Kingdom (Chernichovsky, 1995). Such transitions may also be highly attributable to transitions in political states.  In a market/private-based health system similar to the United States health system, medical care is provided by private physicians and by private and public hospitals and patients have free choice of physicians. In addition, most people receive health insurance coverage through their workplace and health insurance is provided by multiple third-party insurers (Chernichovsky, 1995). On the other hand, planned/public-based health systems such as in the United Kingdom expects that healthcare is a right (Chernichovsky, 1995). As such, health demands are provided directly through budgeting and management of providers.  Low and middle income countries (LMICs) are placed in between these continuum. In most LMICs, various health system reforms and transitions have already been done. Despite such transitions, they are still faced with poorer health outcomes and health statuses that are far beyond health targets. Hence, is it really democracy that matters or does it simply serve as proxy for societal and political progress? Some argued that proper conditions must first be met for such gains of democracy to be achieved. Development communication can serve as a tool to ensure the country's visions are aligned, a step towards creating such proper conditions.

===== Information and communication technologies for development =====
In the Information Age, technological growth is a crucial driving force behind economic progress, citizen engagement and job creation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are shaping many aspects of the world's economies, governments and societies. Developing countries, too, recognize the importance of engaging various stakeholders to harness the transformative power of ICTs to provide more efficient services, catalyze economic development and strengthen social networks. When done properly and implemented effectively, ICT infrastructure investment and policy reform can empower poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

The World Bank Group's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/07/25/transform-innovate-connect-strategy-ict|title=Transform, Innovate, and Connect: A New Strategy for Information and Communication Technology|publisher=|date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted in 2012, intends to help developing countries make use of the potential of ICTs to improve the delivery of public services; drive innovations and productivity gains; and improve competitiveness. Under the strategy, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) focus on three priorities: (1) ''Transformation'', by making developments more open and accountable and improving service delivery; (2) ''Connectivity'', by scaling up affordable access to broadband including for women, disabled citizens, disadvantaged communities and people living in remote and rural areas; and (3) ''Innovation'', by developing competitive IT-based industries and fostering ICT innovation with a focus on job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/ict/overview#1|title=Information &amp; Communication Technologies Overview|website=www.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nascent technologies, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, are also set to reshape the development landscape. The United Nations, through its Virtual Reality Series Project, has tapped virtual reality to build platforms for advocacy, awareness, and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxu2GOkj6qbRbTlVVnBXZXkwR1E/view|title=Virtual Reality Series|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its VR production titled [[Clouds over Sidra]] earned accolades for shedding light on the conditions of some 84,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan's Za'atari camp. HTC, developer of the Vive VR system, also supports the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]] through its "VR for Impact" program, which seeks to "create a pathway to global peace and prosperity together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vrforimpact.com/|title=VR for Impact|website=www.vrforimpact.com|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of policy implication, the immersive experience brought about by VR is expected "to elevate the voices of those who often do not have a say, bringing peoples' voices directly into the decision making process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sdgactioncampaign.org/virtualreality/|title=Virtual Reality and Vulnerable Communities|website=www.sdgactioncampaign.org/|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Digital divide ====
The rapid transformation of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate. As a result, more and more people are getting "wired", which means connected to the Internet. The explosion of information creates an interconnected global village where everyone can easily connect and transact business in a flick of a second. This explosion of information however has widen the gap between the information rich and the information poor creating Digital Divide. IGI Global&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/digital-divide/7600|title=what is digital divide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines digital divide as ''"the inequalities between groups in terms of access of knowledge of the use of ICT"''. Groups or communities that can afford technologies and has full access to the internet are the information rich while the underprivileged are the information poor.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

In his book ''Developing Societies in the Information Age'',Alexander Flor elucidated that digital divide emerges from an information dependent social environment. He further emphasized that "the divide is further aggravated by domineering system between the haves and the have-nots".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor from 1983–1986 on the widening gap and its implications on the agricultural sector, he found out that "the information rich gets richer while the information poor gets poorer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Development Communication|last=Ongkiko|first=Ila Virginia C.|last2=Flor|first2=Alexander G.|publisher=SEAMEO SEARCA and the University of the Philippines Open University|year=1998|isbn=|location=Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender equality====

Although the discourse of development communication may recognize the importance of considering gender in the process of social change, organizational structures and norms may inhibit the successful implementation of projects. Despite the considerable attention directed toward women in health, nutrition, and population projects, women's conditions have not improved. This failure should not, however, be attributed as a direct consequence of development communication. Rather, the problematic conditions of women, along with the interventions designed to resolve them, need to be situated within a broader context of discourse and practice that privileges individual consumption and structural privatization in strategies for social change (Watkins, 1999, 63).

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that many feminist scholars recognize that everyday women's participation in the process of communication is essential. Involvement by the women to state their opinions in the institutions and systems that govern their lives is not only for recognition that participation is a basic human right, but also for a redistribution of political power in favor of disadvantaged groups. Involvement in decision-making is primarily about confronting the hegemonic structures of power—locally, nationally and globally (Sheth, 1997). It is a political action, a political struggle, a struggle that is not only among states, but also among people. Indeed, Wong (2012) shows why a discourse on gender matters in ICT for Development. Wong (2012) cites Resurreccion (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Resurreccion, B. (2011) ''The Gender and Climate Debate: More of the Same or New Pathways of Thinking and Doing?'', Asia Security Initiative Policy Series Working Paper no.10. Singapore: Nanyang Technological University.&lt;/ref&gt; who stresses that the access to, and the use of, ICTs is gender-shaped in that gender influences how the benefits, costs and risks of ICTs are distributed between, and within, women and men. As noted by Kothari (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, R. (1985). New social forces. Development: Seeds of Change, 1, 11–14. La touche, S. (1997). Paradoxical growth. In M. Rahnema &amp; V. Bawtree (Eds.), The Post-Development Reader (pp. 135–42). London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; communications is not taken as informatics (alone), but as politics on issues of empowerment.

Information and communication, food security and nutrition, and gender equality are closely linked dimensions of rural development, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-Dimity Project, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dimitra Project|title=Dimitra Project: Communicating Gender for Rural Development, Integrating Gender in Communication for Development|url=http://www.fao.org/dimitra/home/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vital contribution of women to the agricultural sphere in developing societies cannot be overemphasized. It's critical to give rural women access to the same resources and opportunities as men in order to be more productive. To achieve enhanced productivity and better performance, women have to be provided access to information, knowledge and decision-making. Hooda and Singh (2011) however opine that with regard to the impact of technologies on women, there has been a tendency on the part of governments and development agencies to treat technologies as neutral, value-free, without taking into account the social, environmental and economic effects of the technology being introduced. A common assumption with respect to technology is that the simple existence of technology itself will advance competence and will thus fetch empowerment and reimbursement to the women. Wong (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Sam (2012). ''Exploring the 'GenderICTClimate Change' Nexus in Development:'' From Digital Divide to Digital Empowerment. ''Centre for Development Informatics.'' Institute for Development Policy and Management, SED&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates that restricted access to assets, gender-biased institutional arrangements, and unfavourable social structures have reduced women's capability to draw on ICTs in tackling climate change.  According to Hooda and Singh (2011), focus on ICT competence and capability compromises concerns related to equity. In any case, social equity requires assurance to women's equal opportunity. Therefore, women's equality needs to be integrated as a cornerstone of any development and communication strategy. In addressing these limitations, Wong (2012) outlines four digital empowerment proposals that may make 'ICT climate change' interventions more gender-sensitive:

(1) '''''Contextualise gender mainstreaming''''': gender mainstreaming helps integrate gender analysis into ICT policies. It acknowledges that men and women perceive and receive information differently, and that this requires diverse approaches to adaptation. However, the attempt to reposition women and girls as 'ecocarers' is problematic because this fails to capture their protective, as well as their destructive, role in relation to natural resources. Without addressing the unequal power relations between women

and girls, e-adaptive practices can also help reproduce the intergenerational equalities.

(2) '''''Strengthen governance''''': crafting new and reforming old, institutional arrangements is essential to improve gender inclusion. Women only interventions are sometimes necessary to empower previously excluded women to engage in ICT related decisions. However, poor and powerless men should also have their say in climate change policies.

(3) '''''Develop gender-sensitive funding mechanisms''''': securing adequate funding to support ICT interventions is crucial to gender empowerment. Yet, targeting women by microcredit projects risk putting an additional financial burden on them, and that needs serious reconsideration.

(4) '''''Recognise agency-structure dynamics''''': women are active agents, but they are socially constrained from engaging in ICT related decisions. Women's preferences, institutional arrangements and politics need to be taken into account in order to tackle digital exclusion.

Wong (2012) believes that taking the outlined four proposals are useful for development agencies, governments and NGOs to improve the gendered outcomes from use of ICTs in response to an issue as climate change. Thus, communicating from a gender perspective is important for fighting poverty and for supporting the economic empowerment of women. Women who are frequently the most disadvantaged gender in society are central to development, yet they have very little voice in the process of development planning. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment|publisher=United States Agency for International Development|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that ''"while women make up more than 40 percent of the agriculture labor force, only 3 to 20 percent are landholders. In Africa, women-owned enterprises make up as little as 10 percent of all businesses. In South Asia, that number is only 3 percent. And despite representing half the global population, women comprise less than 20 percent of the world's legislators."''

Advancing gender equality and women's empowerment is a vital key in utilizing human resources and capital on an enormous scale. According to the World Bank, ''"countries with greater gender equality are more prosperous and competitive".'' For communities to grow, gender equality policy and strategies have to be developed and implemented. Women must be provided access to information, technology, and education. They must have equal rights and equal opportunities as entrepreneurs, wage earners, and leaders of our society. Promoting gender equality is a profitable investment we can make to advance women development.

Since its early inception, development communication has been widely utilized by many regions of the world owing its strategic direction of alleviating the lives of the poor by extending knowledge and information to a number of projects and programs intended to create a sustainable life. Hence, development communication practice in various areas of the world yielded a number of policy integrations reflecting its core objectives for an inclusive development. True to its definition, development communication, according to S.T. Kwame Boafo, author of the article 'Utilizing Development Communication Strategies in African Societies: A Critical Perspective', "is the application of modem and traditional communication technologies to aid and enhance the process of socio-economic, political and cultural change. It is the planned, conscious and systematized use of communication strategies and processes to bridge informational and attitudinal gaps and to establish or sustain a climate that favors the process of change and development."&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"&gt; Boafo, S.T.K. (1985). Utilizing development communication in African Societies: A critical perspective [Development communication in Africa]. Retrieved May 8, 2018 from http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001654928503500202
&lt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001654928503500202&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition itself does not lend the idea that change immediately follows. Hence, Boafo articulated further that the definition above "does not imply that communication or information per se can effect development or change without an integrated and consistently pursued national development policy."&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"/&gt; Therefore, it is vital that development communication should be an integral element in the formulation of national policies so as to utilize its full potential.&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"/&gt;

==== Catholic Church: sample communications policies ====
Christ commissioned the Apostles to preach the Good News to the whole world, a mission extended to all Christians today. Communication therefore is part of following Christ. Being committed to spread the Good News, the Catholic Church has always been at the forefront of communications – from oral preaching, catechesis, personal friendships, small or big groups gatherings (openly or in secret where Christians are persecuted, even in present times), manual copying in papyrus or parchments scrolls, artwork, architecture, oral traditions, printing, theaters, tri-media and online, etc.

For academic studies within the Catholic setting, Pontifical Universities in Rome offer Bachelor's, Licentiate and Doctoral courses on Church communications, lasting three to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-08|title=Pontifical universities in Rome|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pontifical_universities_in_Rome&amp;oldid=809265705|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following guidelines, and communication as a whole, should, as Prof. Flor states, "be employed for the service of others” (Chapter 3, p. 7).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

This setup is replicated in various degrees in countries all over the world. Communications policies are left to the regional, national or parish levels, rather than having a unified policy for the Catholic Church in the whole world.

Many documents, in the form of reflections or guidelines, have been published on different topics related with communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/index.htm|title=Pontifical Council for Social Communications|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this website, one document dates back to 1936, an Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI, called "Vigilanti Cura", manifesting his thoughts on the “Motion Picture” as it affects the moral and religious life of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_29061936_vigilanti-cura.html|title=Vigilanti Cura (June 29,&amp;nbsp;1936) {{!}} PIUS XI|last=Pope Pius XI|first=|date=|website=w2.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the Regional Level:''' '''CELAM'''

The Consejo Episcopal LatinoAmericano (CELAM), is the umbrella organization of 22 Episcopal Conferences (groups of Latin American and Caribbean Catholic Bishops, usually by country).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/|title=CELAM - Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano|website=www.celam.org|language=es|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its office is based in Bogotá, Colombia, and has a Department of Communications and Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/dep_comunicacion.php|title=CELAM - Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano|website=www.celam.org|language=es|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no Comunications Policy is posted on CELAM’s website (nor is any retrievable online), there is a link to a presentation of the Department’s four programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/programas/COMUNICACION_Y_PRENSA.pdf|title=DEPARTAMENTO DE COMUNICACIÓN Y PRENSA|last=CELAM|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific objectives contained therein could be considered as general directives indicating what the different lower levels of Church organization should undertake (my own translation from Spanish follows):
Common Communication Efforts in Communion and Dialogue towards Fraternity
Formation and Expression in Communication for the Development of the Culture of Encounter and the Announcing the Good News
Communication for the Transformation of Reality Towards the Fullness of Life of our Peoples
Inter-institutional Communion and Dialogue (within the Church)

CELAM is situated at a very broad level, covering part of North America (Mexico), the whole of Central and South America, and the Caribbeans. It is quite typical for Church documents at a high level, to focus heavily on principles, objectives and generalized directives; meanwhile, the concrete communications policies would be left to the local levels.

'''Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the National Level: USCCB Social Media Guidelines'''

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) "is an assembly of the hierarchy of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands who jointly exercise certain pastoral functions on behalf of the Christian faithful of the United States.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/|title=USCCB|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usccb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its Introduction states, “These guidelines are offered as a synthesis of best practices. They include material compiled from church entities, for-profit corporations, and non-profit organizations”, presented as an aide to come up with local or organizational communications policies when it comes to the social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/communications/social-media-guidelines.cfm|title=Social Media Guidelines|last=USCCB|first=|date=|website=www.usccb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It begins with guiding principles, quoting from Pope Francis: “Communication is a means of expressing the missionary vocation of the entire Church; today the social networks are one way to experience this call to discover the beauty of faith, the beauty of encountering Christ. In the area of communications too, we need a Church capable of bringing warmth and of stirring hearts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/communications/documents/papa-francesco_20140124_messaggio-comunicazioni-sociali.html|title=XLVIII World Communications Day, 2014 - Communications at the Service of an Authentic Culture of Encounter|last=Pope Francis|first=|date=|website=w2.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media is a powerful instrument, changing the way people communicate. Pope Benedict XVI says that the Church has to be involved in social media to advance its mission of spreading the Good News, at the same time encouraging respect and dialogue, true friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/messages/communications/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20090124_43rd-world-communications-day.html|title=43rd World Communications Day, 2009 - New Technologies, New Relationships.

The USCCB document tries to cover all the areas in social media, suggesting the following elements to be included when parishes or other Church organizations develop guidelines: define boundaries, include examples of codes of conduct, define instructions, recommendations on dealing with offenders, providing trusted sites, and reminding administrators of their broad audience. Guidelines are also provided for organizational and personal sites, and social networking with minors.

Being a parish that serves the churchgoers, St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church tries to make clear the procedures that would make the communications processes as efficient as possible. The document is quite detailed, allowing the reader (whether a parish employee, or the public) to know exactly how to proceed in each scenario.

== International communication ==

[[International communication]], the intellectual field that deals with issues of [[mass communication]] at a global level, is sometimes also called development communication. This field includes the history of the [[telegraph]], [[submarine communication cables]], [[shortwave]] or [[international broadcasting]], [[satellite]] television, and global flows of [[mass media]]. Today it includes issues of the [[Internet]] in a global perspective and the use of new technologies such as [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thussu |first=Daya Kishan |authorlink=Daya Kishan Thussu |title=International Communication: Continuity and Change |publisher=Arnold |year=2000 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{Main|Risk communication}}

Risk communication originated in the United States where environmental clean-up efforts were implemented through legislation. The terms 'risk communications' and 'risk management' were first used by [[William Ruckelshaus]], the first administrator of the U.S. '[[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), which was established in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Walaski"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk communication includes management decision risks, implementation risks and risks related to existing environmental, health, political, or social circumstances. For instance, in the health sector, risk communication addresses pandemics, natural disasters, bioterrorism, resource contamination, etc.&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of "risk" include:
"The identification and analysis, either qualitative or quantitative, of the likelihood of the occurrence of a hazardous event overexposure, and the severity of injury or illness that may be caused by it." —American National Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (ANSI/AIHA Z10 – 2005 ):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}
"...the probability that a substance or situation will produce harm under specified conditions. Risk is a combination of two factors: (1) the probability that an adverse event will occur and (2) the consequences of the adverse event."—The Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management (Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}
"...the probability (or likelihood) that a harmful consequence will occur as a result of an action."—The Safety Professionals Handbook (Fields 2008 ):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}

Risk management was described as:
The evaluations and decisions that go into coping with risks (Lundgren and McMakin, 2004){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}}
Planning for a crisis, which should involve the removal of risks and allow an organization, a society, or a system adequate control&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.policysciences.org/institute.php|title = Policy Sciences in Action|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Fearn-Banks, 2007){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}} and
Factors that combat crises with the objective of minimizing damage. (Combs, 1999){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}}

Risk communications involves important information for managing risks, both from authorities to those at risk and vice versa.{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=9}}

Development communication benefits from risk communications when the latter clarifies the risks of development (or lack thereof).

==Policy analysis in an organizational communication==

Development in the community has been observed critically not only the stakeholders but also the public themselves. Being one the recipients of the community projects, the public has been eyeing the government on the implementation of the development projects they are implementing. Part of the analysis in the organization is by analyzing how the communication in an organization works. The two are related as discussed as follows:

===Communication and its roles in development===
In the Philippines, the Medium Term Development Plan for 2004–2010 of the National Economic Development Authority states, "the successful implementation of the plan rests on the support of all sectors of society—the legislature, the judiciary, the local government units, the media and all sectors of society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDA|title=Medium Term Development Plan 2004–2010|url=http://library.pcw.gov.ph/node/735}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NEDA, 2004).

In the context of Carnoy and Samoff (1990), they believed that education has great importance as part of the means of achieving social transformation. They emphasized that "appropriate ideas, values, and worldviews will be developed so that from the process of scholarship there emerges a new person—not simply with skills, but also someone with an understanding of his or her own role in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carnoy|first1=Martin|last2=Samoff|first2=Jeff|title=Education and Social Transformation in the Third World|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than analyzing how the process of the implementation will run through, it is also relative to note who will deliver the message pertaining to the development project. This is where the role of communication takes place. As mentioned by NEDA, media played an important role in the process of the delivery of development projects. With the wide range of power of media to influence and to transmit information, it has the capability to reach the public connecting to the government and vice versa.

Communication is pervasive in the process of development. Communication includes mass media, telecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs), organized interpersonal communication, and all resources used by a society to enable information to flow within it. It has for its aims to inform, educate, persuade, entertain, motivate people and induce behavior change that contributes toward national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openuni-clsu.edu.ph/openfiles/modules/dc808/Unit%201.doc|title=Unit 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fraser and Restrepo-Estrada (2001):
"Communication succeeds when it is an integral part, from the very beginning, of a development programme, playing a full role during the identification of the problems and priorities, as well as during the detailed planning, implementation, and evaluation… communication needs clear objectives, identification of different audience groups... careful message design... and monitoring and feedback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Colin|last2=Restrepo-Estrada|first2=Sonia|title=Communicating for Development. Human Change for Survival|date=1998|publisher=Taurus Publishers|location=London-New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and organizational theory===
As mentioned, delivery of development project can be achieved should proper communication will be used. In attaining such, an organization implementing the development project should consider the system to be used.
An organization is where a system is being implemented. Its structure varied depending on the goals of the company, the image it portrays, and the quality it aims to achieve. Being a member of an organization, one has to know how the organization works.

This aim in knowing the technical-know-how within the organization leads to the concept of 'Organization Theory'. Later it becomes a 'social science discipline' which refers to "a body of thinking and writing that describes, explains and influences what goes on in organization". This leads to making this discipline as basis for exploring 'management and leadership theory' that enables the scholars to understand how an 'organization theory' works in the application of a certain system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAuley|first1=J.|last2=Duberley|first2=J.|last3=Johnson|first3=P.|title=Organization theory: Challenges and perspectives|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, organizational theory (OT), according to Barzilai (2016), is the "study of organizations for the benefit of identifying common themes for the purpose of solving problems, maximizing efficiency and productivity, and meeting the needs of stakeholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barzilai|first1=K|title=Organizational theory|url=http://www.cwru.edu/med/epidbio/mphp439/Organizational_Theory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, development communication interweaves with policy science and organizational theory for one reason: Development projects require an organization as deciding body in crafting policy leading to the attainment of the project and as implementor of the projects.

==Interface revisited and reinforced: development communication and policy sciences==

To affirm the interface, I reviewed the notions of development communication and policy sciences.  Development education, a related and a younger discipline is shortly discussed.  I also highlight the similarities of these fields.

Quebral (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quebral|first1=N.C.|title=Development communication primer|date=2012|publisher=Southbound|location=Penang}}&lt;/ref&gt; redefines development communication as "the science of human communication linked to the transition of communities from poverty in all its forms to a dynamic overall growth that fosters equity and the unfolding of individual potential" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Meanwhile, Guru (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guru|first1=M.C.P.B.|title=Applied development communication|date=2016|publisher=Dominant Publisher and Distributions Pte Ltd|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that development communication "(1) provides a conceptual and practical framework in accelerating development in all spheres of life; (2) includes the integration of planned, organized, and specific communication package into planning, programming, and implementation; (3)facilitates the flow of development education among various stakeholders; and (4) empowers marginalized individuals, groups, and organizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;101).

I thought that development education is just a function or a subset of development communication just like information, motivation, persuasion, among others.  In fact, it is discipline in its own right that started in the 1990s. Bourn (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourn|first1=D|title=The theory and practice of development communication: A pedagogy for global social justice|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as "an education approach that (1) responds to issues of development, human rights, justice, and world citizenship; (2) presents an international development and human rights perspective within education in various parts of the world; (3) promotes voices and viewpoints of those who are excluded from an equal share in the benefits of international human development; (4) connects and compares development issues and challenges all over the world; (5) provides opportunities for people to reflect on their international roles and responsibilities with regard to issues of equality and justice in human development; and (6) narrates a new story of human development" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

On the other hand, policy sciences or policy studies basically refer to the policy cycle, which involves "policy making, policy implementation, policy evaluation, and policy feedback" (Flynn and Asquer, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;40).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flynn|first1=N.|last2=Asquer|first2=A.|title=Public sector management|date=2017|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, it is a function of governance and, therefore the domain of government officials.  However, with democracy as a form of government in many nations, it has also become the domain of the governed, hence, the term public policy.  Most available literature on policy studies quote the definition developed by Hence Thomas Dye as "whatever governments choose to do or not to do."

However, Chakrabarty and Chand (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chakrabarty|first1=B.|last2=Chand|first2=P.|title=Public policy: Concept, theory, and practice|date=2016|publisher=Sage Publications India Pte Ltd|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "[t]here cannot be a universal definition of policy although one can endure a near universal definition by highlighting its technical character" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).  With these, they characterize Dye's definition as "functional in character" and contend that "governments are not at all free to choose because their choice is context-dependent and governed by the ideology they adhere to" (p.&amp;nbsp;4).

They raise the limitations Dye's definition: (1) does not reflect or represent the ideological goals of the government; (2) does not reflect the critical role of institutions; and (3) does not provide enough inputs to conceptualize public policy as an executive device and as a marker of ideology.

After presenting the etymology of "public" and "policy", they propose a layman's definition through an acronym: POLICY.  PO stands for periodically organized, which suggests that policies are "constantly reinvented and transformed in accordance with changing social, economic, and political realities".  To add, LI means legally induced, which suggests it cannot dispense "constitutions and other legal instruments in shaping policy."  Lastly, CY means calculated yields, which implies that policies must be beneficial and profitable (p.&amp;nbsp;6).

With this, they propose a definition, that is, "[p]olicy being a functional design seeking to fulfill certain objectives on the basis of specific calculations of the pros and the cons, and this is naturally context-dependent" (p.&amp;nbsp;7).  Hence, it has a dynamic character: (1) it considers the changing environment, and (2) it prioritizes public good.

They also enumerate the features of a policy: (1) intentional or deliberately designed to address societal issues; (2) a course of action with specific goals and objectives; (3) devised in response to a perceived need or demand or problem; (4)creates an environment in which various actors converge to develop policy designs; (5) an authoritative decision by the government (Chakbarty and Chand, 2016, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Three broad and dynamic disciplines are presented.  It is then instructive to highlight their commonalities or similarities to affirm their interface: (1) systematic (planned, organized, designed, or an approach); (2) change-oriented, preferably for the better if not the best (public good); (3) holistic and multidimensional; (4) pro-people or advocates of equity or social justice, and (5) largely participatory.

Development education, being the youngest field or discipline, has two distinct emphases: sustainable development and global citizenship (Bourn, 2015).  A number of modifiers have come before the term development over time, but the most recent is sustainable, hence, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Guru (2016) defines it as "a vision of the future that provides necessary blueprint through which the developmental activities of individuals and institutions can be streamlined on the basis of ethical, humanitarian, and professional considerations" (p.&amp;nbsp;85).  It has three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 in Guru, 2016).  In fact, it is imperative for both development practitioners and policy makers to understand these dimensions.

== Culture ==
In the context of globalization, the need for communication is increasing. Many countries has invested in developing their technology which in turns speed up the exchange of information across different countries. This has led to a more complex work context in different institutions especially in business, education, and non-profit organizations. Employees not only has to deal with a lot of things that are not present in a very homogenous environment like observing other religious holidays, communicating in different languages, and also understanding different preferences on certain things. In a multi-cultural environment, organizational culture becomes more complex.

There were countless of research that show how poor communication can lead to poor organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell C. Matthews and Bharat Thakkar (2012). The Impact of Globalization on Cross-Cultural Communication, Globalization – Education and Management Agendas, Dr. Hector Cuadra-Montiel (Ed.), InTech, DOI: 10.5772/45816. Available from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.intechopen.com/books/globalization-education-and-management-agendas/the-impact-of-globalization-on-cross-cultural-communication&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for every organisation to develop an effective means to communicate internally and externally in the organization and find ways to develop a health knowledge sharing culture. Understanding the impact of globalisation is crucial for any organisation to be competitive in the global market. In this context, effective communication is expected to create a healthy organizational culture by providing necessary information that will bridge many gaps in the organization.

Flor (2007) noted that "communication and culture are inextricably linked" (p.&amp;nbsp;112). Seemingly, communication constitutes culture and vice versa in any organizational engagement internally and externally. From time immemorial, effective internal organizational communication which reduces uncertainties and increases productivity in the workplace has been the common goal of many organizations worldwide. Consequently, effective communication processes could mean effective communication policies are in place explicitly or have been legitimized in practice. Making this complicated is perceived in how decision-makers, policy experts and organizational members interact in furthering organizational communication processes. Flor (2007) describes potential complexities at work that could burden more than could help the organization's communication culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;The really difficult part of communication work (and perhaps the most time consuming) is pleasing everybody from your superior, to the subject matter specialist and, finally, to the user whose opinions (and tastes) may altogether vary from those of the decision-maker. This potentially is the most time consuming particularly since, right or wrong, everyone believes that he is a communication expert (p.167-168).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Participatory approach, community radio and policy development ===

The roots of participatory approaches in development communication according to Yoon (1996) can be found in the early years of the 1970s when many people in the development community began to question the top-down approach of development dominant in the 1950s and 60s which targeted the economic growth of countries as its main goal. Development according to Yoon (1996) was "thought to be triggered by the wide-scale diffusion and adoption of modern technologies". Such modernization Yoon (1996) further expounds, was planned in the national capitals under the guidance and direction of experts brought-in from developed countries. Often, the people in the villages who are the "objects" of these plans were the last to know when "strangers from the city turned-up, frequently unannounced, to survey land or look at project sites".&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, C. (1996). "Participatory communication for development". http://www.southbound.com.my/communication/parcom.htm Retrieved March 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the demarcation of the First, Second and Third Worlds by late 1960s to early 1980s has broken down and the cross-over centre-periphery can be found in every region, a need for a new concept of development which emphasizes cultural identity and multidimensionality is raised (Servaes and Malikhao, 2005). Servaes and Malikhao (2005) posit that the'global' world, in general as well as in its distinct regional and national entities, is confronted with multifaceted crises.&lt;ref&gt;Servaes,  J. and Malikhao, P. (2005).  "Participatory communication: the new paradigm?" 91–103 http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/edicion/media/09Chapter5.pdf Retrieved April 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the obvious economic and financial crisis, they elaborate that one could also refer to social, ideological, moral, political, ethnic, ecological and security crises thus the previously held dependency perspective has become more difficult to support because of the growing interdependency of regions, nations and communities in the globalized world. A new viewpoint on development and social change has come to the forefront according to them which "the common starting point is the examination of the changes from 'bottom-up', from the self-development of the local community".

At first, speech, traditional and folk media, and group activities were considered the most appropriate instruments for supporting participatory communication hence, the practitioners in the mass media responded by innovating their own approach towards participatory communication (Yoon, 1996) which brought the emergence of community radios. The historical philosophy of community radio is to use this medium as the voice of the voiceless, the mouthpiece of the oppressed people and generally as a tool for development.&lt;ref&gt;AMARC. (1991). Proceedings of the seminar:Participatory communication community radio development, Montreal April 11 and 12, 1991, AMARC Montreal Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon (1996) articulates that in community radios, the people "produced and voiced the programs which were focused on local issues which were the most current and important making way for participatory communication to be practiced at both the community or village level and at the broader regional or sub-regional level". Most of the successes of community broadcasting are to be found in the non-formal education sector (Beltran,1993 in Yoon, 1996). Literacy programs have been effectively conducted via community radio and television stations. Other subjects covered by these stations include gender issues, farming, health, income-generation, workers' safety and occupational health, land tenure, and religious matters (Yoon, 1996).

Mhagama (2015) posits that participatory development projects such as community radio employ a participatory approach to decision making processes and enable marginalized people to "define their own development path through the identification and implementation of projects that are initiated by them". He stresses that "participatory communication gives the local community a right to freely share or exchange information and to reach a consensus on what they want to do or to be done and how to do it". Tamminga (1997) in Mhagama (2015) addresses that in community radio the dichotomy between the rich and the marginalized sectors like women, indigenous peoples and the poor is broken by "allowing listeners an opportunity to shape the medium to meet their own specific needs and breakdown the monopolies of knowledge and power that marginalize them politically, economically and socially". In one project of UNESCO in partnership with the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), and the Philippine government a participatory communication project using community radio dubbed as ''"Tambuli"'' ('''Tambuli''' is a Filipino term referring to a traditional way of calling villagers to an important meeting)(Jayaweera and Tabing, 1997) was launched in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaweera, W. and Tabing, L. (1997). "Villages find their voice: Radio brings empowerment to rural communities in the Philippines". ''UNESCO Courier'', 34–35. https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-19278043/villages-find-their-voice-radio-brings-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt; According to Howley (2005) the project was able to make the community residents come to appreciate radio's potential as a forum to discuss issues of mutual concern allowing the local populations to give immediate and sustained feedback to local, regional and even national political leaders and authorities which afforded them greater opportunity to chart their own destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Howley, K. (2005). "Wireless world: Global perspectives on community radio". ''Transformational Journal''. Issue No.10. http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/10/article_01.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Howley (2010) as cited in Mhagama (2015) stressed that "community radio highlights people's ability to alter and rearrange existing media structures to better suit their needs".&lt;ref&gt;Mhagama, Peter Matthews. (2015). Community radio as a tool for development: A case study of community radio stations in Malawi. (Ph.D). University of Leicester. https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/32447/1/Thesis.pdf Retrieved March 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is made possible Servaes (1996) in Mhagama (2015) concludes because community radio allows non-professionals to participate in media production, management, and planning of the communication systems.

== Development communication and the policy sciences work together towards social change ==
Flor (n. d., as cited in Academia, 2015) states that policy sciences and development communication have seemingly identical underlying function in society: to solve societal issues and make social change possible for the benefit of the greater majority. Development communication and policy sciences share key characteristics. First, both policy sciences and development communication are purposive. They serve specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal which is to solve issues and problems in society in order to achieve change. Second, both policy sciences and development communication believe that, at times, power and corrupt practices in the government have the potential to undermine reasoned logic. This is evident in the commercialisation of mass media that advances profit over social responsibility. Thus, development communication and policy sciences have the role to combat such corrupt practices. The third characteristic that policy sciences and development communication share is to heed action for policies to take effect. Policies that remain in print/word without action is a futile enterprise. A policy to be effective needs to be implemented, monitored, assessed and sustained. For development communication and policy sciences to make great impact to the world, participation or engagement of stakeholders is necessary. Below is an analysis of a few studies that deal with how development communication relates with policy sciences, and how they fuse in order to effect change in the larger society. In a discussion on the policy sciences, Allen (1978, as cited in Flor, n. d.) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since communication permeates every facet of a person's behaviour, the study of communication is no less than one way to study policy making. Communication is a useful concept precisely because it is one more handle whereby we can effectively study policy making. Communication is one of those few variables through which any policy decision is dependent (p.69).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example where development communication takes an important role is in the global health space. International organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, ASEAN, and the United Nations have all used the principles of development communication to achieve global impacts. Specifically, on 08 August 1967, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was then composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was established with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration). In the succeeding years, other Southeast Asian countries have joined, including Brunei (1984), Viet Nam (1995), Lao PDR (1997), Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999) (ASEAN 2012a: 1). It was established to accelerate the economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region; promote regional peace and stability; promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest; provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities; and collaborate more effectively for the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries; among others (ASEAN 2012a: 1). Criticisms on the ASEAN have, however, noted various failures in the regionalism efforts in Southeast Asia. Previous studies have defined regionalism as “more than an institutional process of multilateral policy coordination and the negotiation of competing stakeholder interests... [It is a] collective and intersubjective identities” (Elliott 2003: 29-52). Recent regionalism efforts worldwide also worked either institutionally or through cooperation among governments (Anonymous2005: 2291-2313). Although some argues that the ASEAN’s regionalism efforts were seen as more of cooperation among the governments rather than an institutional one, development communication can play a key role in bridging these countries and towards commitment to the Declaration.

== Risk and disaster communication amongst the youths ==
The youths hold a pivotal role in making a difference in society. Being digital natives, they communicate efficiently, develop networks pervasively, and create, influence and change social norms and practices. In short, being communication natives who can create a collective voice, they have the power to influence policies and change perspectives deeply rooted in society. For instance, during disasters, the youths are viewed as passive victims with no role in communicating risks or preventing and responding to disasters. Since disaster management seems to be predominated by top-down strategies, not bottom-up, the youths are seen as weaklings who are at the receiving end of calamity relief operations. However, Mitchell, Haynes, Hall, Wei and Oven (2008) seem to have refuted this perception based on the findings of their case studies in El Salvador and New Orleans. Mitchell et al. (2008) concluded that children and youths can be potential informants within informal and formal risk communication networks. Their case studies have shown that:&lt;blockquote&gt;children and youth can become effective conduits, vehicles and bridges as they are embedded within the household and community and can act as trusted two-way "translators" and communicators. Overall, children and youth were found to be effective communicators of risk when language barriers exist increasing the agency of young people, an outside agent has helped support the organization of youth groups, the community has strong social cohesion, and there is a level of distrust in political sources (such as police impunity) (p. 269).&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the Philippines, a study by Fernandez and Shaw (2013) found that even until today, "young people are not given an active role in (or worse, are excluded from) the action toward disaster risk reduction" (p.&amp;nbsp;135). Fernandez and Shaw's (2013) review of national policies of the Philippines related to youth council participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) shows discrepancies between ideal scenarios and actual youth participation in DRR in practice. So much more needs to be done in engaging young people in helping build disaster resilient communities. However, although these discrepancies exist, there are many success stories of Filipino youths involved in development programs with the aim to prepare communities for disasters. The National Youth Commission (NYC, 2013) believed that children and youth are not just a vulnerable group, but can play vital roles in their communities to prepare for future disasters. For instance, the Tanay Mountaineers Youth Arm, a Ten Accomplished Youth Organization (TAYO) 2013 winner, has been responding to victims of disasters not only in Tanay, Rizal but even in Quezon Province since Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) hit their town in 2009 (Rappler.com, 2014). The local government of Tanay has tapped the Tanay Mountaineers as the official disaster response team of the municipality. Another TAYO 2013 winner, the Hayag Youth Organization, carried out the "Langoy para sa Kaluwasan," a Swim Camp Disaster Preparedness and Open Water Safety Training for children and youth from impoverished communities in Ormoc City, Leyte. This is in response to the fact that many youths in Ormoc still do not know how to swim apart from the fact that water safety skills are not taught to them in school (Rappler.com, 2014). Despite scepticism, there still exists a growing optimism that policy scientists and communication policy developers can help review and reaffirm existing youth policies in the Philippines in engaging youth groups themselves for DRR projects, among others. Fernandez and Shaw (2013) posited that open and engaging communication is necessary so that the youths become more involved in disaster management and risk reduction efforts in their communities.

== Urban farming in cities and countries ==
Globalisation has been shaping this world into a small village. With this phenomenon comes urbanisation or massive urban planning that governments and private industries are advancing. With policies being created and governance being mandated, remote heartlands of countries are now slowly being transformed into urbanised places and spaces which in turn produce setbacks such as pollution, health issues and other social problems. However, one trend that is becoming popular in some countries is urban forestry which somehow demands for sound scientific information and public participation. According to Janse and Konijnendijk (2007), urban society's manifold perceptions, preferences and demands for urban forest goods and services indicate the necessity for socially inclusive policy planning processes. They said that successful policies can only be formulated by establishing close links with, for example, urban planning and municipal policies. Inherently, this means that close ties between research and policy are required. They discussed the outcomes of the NeighbourWoods research and development project in which a wide range of tools for public participation were tested in six urban woodland case-studies across Europe. Findings confirmed that a set of tools comprising a step-wise process from informing the public in an attractive way, collecting information on public opinion, towards fully participatory approaches such as direct involvement in decision-making is most likely to ensure socially inclusive planning. Communication with policy-makers requires a high degree of openness, clearly explaining every phase of the process, being open about each other's expectations, and developing relationships based on mutual trust (Janse &amp; Konijnendijk, 2007).

Despite power issues that lurk in most organisations and governments, Development Communication and policy sciences seem to advance specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal for the benefit of the majority. This is shown in an increasingly global India, whereby an agricultural community in Pune, Maharashtra was faced with losing farmland to urbanisation and devised an unusual solution (Sami, 2013). Pooling their land together, the farmers in this community leveraged their social and political networks to take advantage of the changing economic climate in Pune and built a mixed-use township on their 400 acres of farmland (Sami, 2013). They formed alliances with other stakeholders, both internally within the agricultural community and externally at the city and state levels. Sami (2013) concluded that "ad-hoc coalitions in the power and politics of urban processes in an Indian city have emerged as a result of a political will and leadership vacuum in Indian cities in the face of the changing focus and priorities of national and regional governments as well as a growing gap in urban service provision" (p.&amp;nbsp;151).

== Communication for development (C4D) and e-Agriculture ==
If highly urbanised and wealthy cities or countries are advancing urban agriculture, it cannot be denied that many of the Third World countries are also at par when it comes to improving agricultural processes and policies and in the informatisation of agriculture. In Malawi, one of the poorest regions in Africa, Agunga (2012) emphasised that the success rate of poverty-reduction programming could be greater if C4D education was provided for development decision-makers and field staff, especially agricultural extension workers. Agunga (2012) further stated that agricultural extension education can impact development by focusing on how C4D can strengthen agricultural extension performance. He implied that educating policymakers about C4D will increase donor investments in pilot C4D projects, a strengthening of agricultural extension systems, and success of poverty-reduction programs (Agunga, 2012).

In the Philippines, a book by Flor (2007) entitled Development Communication Praxis discussed a rice scandal such that in the last quarter of 1990, the Philippines groaned as the price of rice and other commodities went up. Flor (2007) said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rice farmers who were expected to gain from the situation were likewise disadvantaged. They were not able to sell their produce at reasonable prices. On one hand, their bumper crop entailed expensive inputs – certified high yielding varieties, irrigation, pesticides and fertilizer. On the other, middle men bought their harvest at cutthroat prices leaving them penniless and in debt… the nature of the rice industry is such that information, particularly market information, means money and power. For all practical purposes, the Philippine rice industry is controlled by a group of obscure Filipino-Chinese businessmen called the Binondo Rice Cartel… Employing a nationwide marketing network composed mainly of fellow Filipino-Chinese traders, the cartel has held a viselike grip over rice trading since the post World War II years that enable them to virtually dictate the buying price of dried paddy all over the country (pp. 114–115).&lt;/blockquote&gt;What was done when this happened? Did development communication come into the picture? Was change sought? There were a few discussions on alternatives such as proper use of funds since it was observed that international donations for the agricultural farmers were spent more on the informatisation of agriculture (increasing need for computers, logistical aids, etc.) instead of investing into more practical and realistic methods to empower the farmers and improve their farming methods. Attention was also given to the rise of white-collar jobs which was cutting down the numbers of agricultural farmers tilling the land (Flor, 2007). The youths became more attracted to the life in the city and to seek for office or desk jobs than remain in the province and till the farm. With this, Flor (2007) suggested policy rationalisation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rationalisation need not mean a reduction of monies awarded to the information sector. It primarily means the rearrangement of priorities and the increase of allotment to actual farming activities in the case of agriculture or to direct social services in the case of rural development. (p. 123).&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, with the seemingly hegemonic influence of the internet and the impact of globalisation, the field of agriculture needs to adapt to radical changes in society for it to become sustainable. As policy sciences and development communication suggest, the goal of communication and policies is to empower individuals or groups, and this empowerment necessitates crucial adaptation to an ever-changing world. This brought agriculture into another layer: e-agriculture. What is e-agriculture? The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO, 2013) defined this as: &lt;block quote&gt;An emerging field focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. More specifically, e-Agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture (p.&amp;nbsp;1).

In a post on e-Agriculture webpage, Walter (2009), indicates that the Philippines has launched a Knowledge Working Towards Enhancing Agricultural Communities Program or K-Agrinet project with the aim to promoting the use of ICT to attain agricultural sustainability and competitiveness for the country's farmers. The project is a collaborative effort amongst the country's diverse agencies to utilize information technology (IT) as a tool to fast-track the dissemination of agriculture and natural resources information and technologies to farmers, upland dwellers, and rural entrepreneurs in the Philippines. The institutional key players in the agricultural and natural resource sectors are: (1) the e-Learning led by the Open Academy for Philippine Agriculture of the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) which focuses on e-extension and distance learning for agriculture extension workers; (2) the e-Consortia led by the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCARRD) which intensifies technology and knowledge generation and exchange amongst existing partner R&amp;D Institutions through improved ICT tools and applications; (3) the e-Farm also led by DOST-PCARRD that promotes e-commerce by initiating e- based farm to market opportunities through the FITS centers and their respective farmer-scientists; and lastly, (4) the e-Agrikultura led by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) tasked at mobilising and generating the participation of agrarian reform communities into the program (Walter, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;1).

Indeed, the goal of C4D and e-agriculture is clear: to improve the lives of people especially the poor and the marginalised. This entails educating and empowering them for the impact of change to be sustainable.

== Women's roles on development through advancing policies ==
Reports and studies show that women are mostly victims of many kinds of abuse. For instance, Kaunda (1990) described that a smallholder development strategy in Malawi, Africa puts emphasis on commercialization of agriculture, combined with decision making processes which are centralized in the bureaucracy, serving only to reproduce and perpetuate historical forms of social differentiation which are the basis of the women's subordination and/or subjugation.

However, it can be seen in the past few decades that women have been successful in championing a cause and in letting their voices be heard in the society. Women from all walks of life have been engaging themselves into some development projects. For Instance, in the Philippines, the World Food Programme (WFP, 2012) launched a project in the Philippine island of Mindanao to helping women kick start agriculture in the region by providing them with the training they need to become successful farmers. This shows that women can be empowered and independent – two qualities that development communication and policy sciences are championing. HumanaPeopletoPeople (2012) is also promoting gender equality in India, whereby, to release the empowerment of women, the women in their communities have formed coalitions such as women self-help groups focusing on community projects. The women are empowered to bargain, to have economic influence, to earn money for improvement of health and education of the family and to gain a stronger social standing.

Either in the First World or in the Third World nations, a huge number of women are making a difference in a lot of fields with the goal to contribute to character and nation-building. In the field of developing women's capacities to run and manage their small-medium enterprises (SMEs), Gail Romero, the founder and CEO for Collective Changes, has been providing effective technology platforms to business mentors for women's SMEs in developing nations. &lt;blockquote&gt;Gail continues to drive support for empowering women in business and global recognition of the economic engine that women can provide to their nations. Gail is also Senior Advisor for MacKenzie-Romero Consulting, Executive Producer for Rainmakers TV and carried the title of Ambassador for Global Health for the American Cancer Society until August 2011. Gail has spent the last two decades creating and directing the development and integration of innovative economic ideas and campaigns and strategic alliances with policy makers to advance women in leadership throughout the world… She has held numerous corporate board positions for start-up companies and guided new social venture partnerships. She has served as a visiting professor and international speaker and presenter on social justice, women's issues and education. Gail is a recent TED Prize nominee for her work to leverage technology to grow women's business skills ("Advancing Women in Leadership", 2014).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Development communication and policy sciences have gone a long way to advancing the rights and freedom of people – children and youths, women, farmers, labourers, etc., with the goal that they become more informed and empowered to make decisions for themselves and their communities, to realise their full potential and to become a catalyst for change as Flor (2007) postulated.

== Agenda setting ==
Agenda setting is an important topic in the Development Communication and policy sciences because it sets problems and issues into policies. It sets the tone of how policies are crafted, based on the needs of the public.  Equally important in this discussion is understanding the Agenda Setting Process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention (Birkland, 2011).  It is in this area where individuals take collective action and vie for attention.  According to Schattschneider (1960), groups that successfully describe a problem will also be the one to define the solutions to it, thereby prevailing in public debate.

Another idea offered by Schattschneider is the Theory of Group Mobilization &amp; Participation in Agenda Setting wherein the issues are more likely to be elevated to agenda status if the scope of conflict is broadened.  There are 2 ways to broaden an issue:
# Groups go public by using symbols and images or;
# Groups to lose the first level of public interest appeal to a higher decision-making level.
When powerful groups lose control of the agenda, they are said to enter into policy debates to gain attention (Baumgartner &amp; Jones), while other groups do venue shopping and ally with those who are able to advance their issues.&lt;ref name="Birkland"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giw8dRLqX74C|title=An Introduction to the Policy Process: Theories, Concepts, and Models of Public Policy Making|last=Birkland|first=Thomas A.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=9780765627315|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levels of Agenda'''&lt;ref name="Birkland"/&gt;

From the vast field of issues (Agenda Universe), groups push issues meriting public attention "within the legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority" (Birkland, quoting Cobb and Elder), moving to the next level (Systemic Agenda).  Ideas that gain active and serious consideration of decision/policy makers go the next level (Institutional Agenda).  If acted upon, it reaches Decision Agenda—the last level in the policy making process.  Within these levels there are push and pull actions that happen between and among interest groups in order to pursue or challenge such initiatives.

'''Process of Policy Development (also Stages of the Policy Cycle)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Public Policy Analysis|last=Fischer|first=Frank|publisher=CSC Press|year=2007|isbn= 1-57444-561-8|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=72–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes the following activities that sets off creation of policies:
# Issue Framing – which is a technique of getting the issues on the policy maker's agenda so that a problem is recognized and debated.
# Agenda setting as already discussed in previous paragraphs.
# Policy Formulation wherein proposed actions are articulated, debated and drafter into language.
# Advocacy &amp; policy dialogue which will involve and mobilize stakeholders and the public, and
# Data analysis which focuses on political costs and benefits.

'''Diples''' or '''Thiples''' ({{lang-el|Δίπλες}}) is a [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] [[dessert]] from the Peloponnese, made of thin sheet-like dough.  They are essentially the same as [[angel wings]], except that they are dipped in syrup rather than served dry.

The dough is rolled into long, thin strips, fried and folded in hot oil and then dipped in a sugar or honey syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <comment>/* Hellenistic Greeks */ this entire sub-section is about the Hellenistic period, an era that ended in 30 BC with the [[death of Cleopatra]]. Saying "the 13th century" is immensely ambiguous for readers not accustomed to history and some historically illiterate people might even think this means 13th century BC, during the Bronze Age. LOL. So yeah, no. We need the "Anno Domini" here.</comment>

[[File:YangzhouKatarinaVilioniTomb1342.jpg|thumb|1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family, in [[Yangzhou]].]]
Given textual and archaeological evidence, it is thought that thousands of [[History of Europe|Europeans]] lived in [[History of China|Imperial]] [[Yuan China|China]] during the period of [[Mongols|Mongol]] rule.&lt;ref name="Roux, p.465"&gt;Roux (1993), p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; These were people from countries traditionally belonging to the lands of [[Christendom]] during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] to [[Late Middle Ages]] who visited, traded, performed [[Christian missionary]] work, or lived in [[China]]. This occurred primarily during the second half of the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century, coinciding with the rule of the [[Mongol Empire]], which ruled over a large part of [[Eurasia]] and connected Europe with their Chinese dominion of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368).&lt;ref&gt;The term "Medieval China" is mainly used by historians of [[Universal History]]. The dates between 585 ([[Sui Dynasty|Sui]]) to 1368 ([[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]]) comprise the medieval period in Chinese history. Historians of Chinese history call this period the "Chinese Imperial Era", which began after the unification of the seven kingdoms by the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC). With the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[early modern era]] began.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the [[Byzantine Empire]] centered in [[Greece]] and [[Anatolia]] maintained rare incidences of correspondence with the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties of China, [[Papal States|the Roman papacy]] sent several missionaries and embassies to the early Mongol Empire as well as to [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]), the capital of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty.

Mainly located in places such as the Mongol capital of [[Karakorum]], European missionaries and merchants traveled around the Mongol realm during a period of time referred to by historians as the "[[Pax Mongolica]]". The most famous European visitor to China during this period was [[Marco Polo]], preceded by his father and uncle [[Niccolò and Maffeo Polo]]. Perhaps the most important political consequence of this movement of peoples and intensified trade was the [[Franco-Mongol alliance]], although the latter never fully materialized, at least not in a consistent manner.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher P. (2004), ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire'', New York: Facts on File, Inc., p. 583, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4671-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of the Ming dynasty|establishment of the Ming dynasty]] in 1368 and reestablishment of native [[Han Chinese]] rule led to the cessation of European merchants and [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries living in China. Direct contact with Europeans was not renewed until [[Portuguese exploration|Portuguese explorers]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jesuit China missions|missionaries]] arrived on Ming China's southern shores at the beginning of the 16th century, during the [[Age of Exploration]].

The Italian merchant [[Marco Polo]], as well as his father and uncle [[Niccolò and Maffeo Polo]], traveled to China during the period of Mongol rule. Marco Polo wrote an account of his travels there, as did the Franciscan friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] and the merchant [[Francesco Balducci Pegolotti]]. The author [[John Mandeville]] also wrote about his travels to China, but he may have merely based these on preexisting accounts. In Khanbaliq, the Roman archdiocese was established by [[John of Montecorvino]], who was later succeeded by [[Giovanni de Marignolli]]. Other Europeans such as [[André de Longjumeau]] managed to reach the eastern borderlands of China in their diplomatic travels to the Mongol royal court, while others such as [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], [[Benedykt Polak]], and [[William of Rubruck]] traveled instead to [[Mongolia]]. The [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] was the first diplomat from China to reach the royal courts of Christendom in the West.

In [[Quanzhou|Zaytun]], the first harbour of China, there was a small Genoese colony, mentioned in 1326 by André de Pérouse. The most famous Italian resident of the city was [[:it:Andalò da Savignone|Andolo de Savignone]], who was sent to the West by the Khan in 1336 to obtain "100 horses and other treasures."&lt;ref name="Roux, p.467"/&gt; Following Savignone's visit, [[Giovanni de Marignolli|an ambassador]] was dispatched to China with one superb horse, which was later the object of [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] and [[Chinese painting|paintings]].&lt;ref name="Roux, p.467"&gt;Roux (1993), p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Venetians lived in China, including one who brought a letter to the West from John of Montecorvino in 1305. In 1339 a Venetian named Giovanni Loredano is recorded to have returned to Venice from China. A tombstone was also discovered in Yangzhou, in the name of [[Katarina Vilioni|Catherine de Villioni]], daughter of Dominici, who died there in 1342.&lt;ref name="Roux, p.467"/&gt;

The ''[[History of Yuan]]'' (chapter 134) records that a certain Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph) from the country of Fu lin (i.e. the [[Byzantine Empire]]), initially in the service of [[Güyük Khan]], was well-versed in Western languages and had expertise in the fields of [[Byzantine medicine|medicine]] and [[Byzantine astronomy|astronomy]] that convinced Kublai Khan to offer him a position as the director of medical and astronomical boards. Kublai Khan eventually honored him with the title of Prince of Fu lin (Chinese: 拂菻王; ''Fú lǐn wáng''). His biography in the ''History of Yuan'' lists his children by their [[Chinese name]]s, which are similar to the [[Christian name]]s Elias (''Ye-li-ah''), Luke (''Lu-ko''), and Antony (''An-tun''), with a daughter named ''A-na-si-sz''.&lt;ref name="bretschneider 1888p144"&gt;[[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider, Emil]] (1888), ''Medieval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources: Fragments Towards the Knowledge of the Geography and History of Central and Western Asia from the 13th to the 17th Century, Vol. 1'', Abingdon: Routledge, reprinted 2000, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Jesuit missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] would be the first European invited into the Ming-era [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] (during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]]), where in 1602 he would publish his [[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu|map of the world]] in [[Chinese characters|Chinese]] that introduced the existence of the [[Americas|American continents]] to [[Chinese geography|Chinese geographers]].&lt;ref name="Abbe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/art/79576487.html|title=Million-dollar map coming to Minnesota|last=Abbe|first=Mary|date=2009-12-18|work= Star Tribune|publisher=Star Tribune Company|accessdate=6 September 2016|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in Macau in 1582, when he began to learn the Chinese language and information about China's ancient culture, yet was unaware of the events that had transpired there since the end of the Franciscan missions in the mid 14th century and establishment of the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Fontana, Michela (2011), ''Matteo Ricci: a Jesuit in the Ming Court'', Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, pp 18–35, 116–118, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang|the Islamic world]] presented an obstacle for the West in reaching East Asia and, barring the grand [[treasure voyages]] of the 15th-century admiral [[Zheng He]], the Ming dynasty had largely pursued [[Haijin|policies of isolationism]] that kept it from seeking far-flung diplomatic contacts.&lt;ref name="fontana 2011 p117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ming Empire was at least willing to engage in conflicts nearby, however, when it offered relief forces to its tributary state [[Joseon]] (Korea) against [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|invading Japanese forces]] in the [[Imjin War]] (1592–1598).

[[File:Flagge Großherzogtum Baden (1891-1918).svg|thumb|3:5 {{FIAV|historical}} Flag of Baden (1891-1935, 1947-1952)]]
The '''flag of Baden''' displayed a combination of [[yellow]] and [[red]], the heraldic colours of the former [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden]]. 

==Overview==
A red-yellow [[Commons:Bicolor flags|bicolour]] was introduced as the flag of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] (1806–1918) in 1871. This was replaced with a yellow-red-yellow [[triband (flag)|triband]] in 1891. Following the abolition of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]], the [[Republic of Baden]] was established, which continued to use this triband flag. After the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933, the individual German states and their symbols were eventually suppressed. After [[World War II]], the southern half of Baden became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#French Zone of Occupation|French Occupation Zone]] and established as [[South Baden]]. South Baden used the yellow-red-yellow triband as its flag until the state's disestablishment in 1952, when it became part of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Baden-Württemberg|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-BadenWur.html|encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

The flag is still a common sight in the Baden region today, as it is used by many private citizens.

'''Froschgrundsee''' also known as '''Schönstädtspeicher''' is a [[retention basin]] to protect the city of [[Coburg]] in [[Bavaria]] from the [[flood|flooding]] of the [[Itz]], [[Effelder (river)|Effelder]], and the [[Grümpen (river)|Grümpen]]. It lies in the municipality of [[Rödental]] in [[Upper Franconia]]. Froschgrundsee was completed in 1986 after four years of construction and cost 43 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lms-coburg.de/Gallerie/festschrift-40-jahre-roedental.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Google Latitude''' was a [[location awareness|location-aware]] feature of [[Google Maps]], developed by [[Google]] as a successor to its earlier [[SMS]]-based service [[Dodgeball (service)|Dodgeball]]. Latitude allowed a [[mobile phone]] user to allow certain people to view their current location.  Via their own [[Google Account]], the user's cell phone location was mapped on Google Maps.  The user could control the accuracy and details of what each of the other users can see — an exact location could be allowed, or it could be limited to identifying the city only. For privacy, it could also be turned off by the user, or a location could be manually entered. Users had to explicitly opt into Latitude, and were only able to see the location of those friends who had decided to share their location with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/see-where-your-friends-are-with-google.html| title=See where your friends are with Google Latitude| date=February 4, 2009| website=Google Blog| access-date=January 18, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230053801/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/see-where-your-friends-are-with-google.html| archive-date=December 30, 2009| dead-url=no| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2013, Google announced plans to shut down Latitude, and it was discontinued on August 9, 2013.&lt;ref name="retireBlog"&gt;{{cite web|author=Maps for mobile |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814192105/https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3001634?p=maps_android_latitude&amp;rd=1 |title=Latitude will be retired |publisher=Support.google.com |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the feature moved to Google+ in between, Google incorporated Latitude's location sharing feature into [[Google Maps]] in March 2017.&lt;ref name="google maps 2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps will let you share your location with friends and family for a specific period of time|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/google-maps-now-lets-you-share-your-location-with-friends-and-family-for-a-specific-period-of-time/amp|last1=Perez|first1=Sarah|publisher=TechCrunch|date=March 22, 2017|accessdate=August 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322164110/https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/google-maps-now-lets-you-share-your-location-with-friends-and-family-for-a-specific-period-of-time/amp/|archive-date=March 22, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5google.com/2017/03/28/location-sharing-removed-google-plus-moved-maps/|title=Google removes location sharing from Google+ as it appears for more Google Maps users|date=2017-03-28|work=9to5Google|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Dodgeball===
{{main|Dodgeball (service)}}
Dodgeball was founded in 2000 by [[New York University]] students [[Dennis Crowley]] and [[Alex Rainert]]. The company was acquired by Google in 2005 and Crowley and Rainert hired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.edu/management/_doc/nina/socialnetworking21.pdf |title=Polytechnic University paper |publisher=Poly.edu |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the coinage of the term ''[[wikt:acquihire|acquihire]]''. In April 2007, Crowley and Rainert left Google, with Crowley describing their experience there as "incredibly frustrating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dpstyles/460987802/ |title=Flickr blog |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Google, Crowley created a similar service known as [[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] with the help of [[Naveen Selvadurai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playfoursquare.com/about |title=About |publisher=Foursquare |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodgeball offered a facility to users by way of [[SMS]]. Dodgeball was available for the cities of [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[San Diego]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Dallas]]–[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], [[Miami]], [[Atlanta]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Minneapolis]]–[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="dodgeball"&gt;[http://dodgeball.com Dodgeball website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430083341/http://www.dodgeball.com/ |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 [[Vic Gundotra]], Vice President of Engineering at Google, announced that the company would "discontinue Dodgeball.com in the next couple of months, after which this service will no longer be available."&lt;ref name="discontinue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/01/changes-for-jaiku-and-farewell-to.html|title=Changes for Jaiku and Farewell to Dodgeball and Mashup Editor|work=Google Code Blog|date=January 2009|access-date=September 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816230305/http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/01/changes-for-jaiku-and-farewell-to.html|archive-date=August 16, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgeball was shut down and succeeded in February 2009 by Google Latitude.&lt;ref name="NYT Bits"&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/where-are-you-show-em-with-google-latitude/ Where Are You? Show ‘Em With Google Latitude] m ''The New York Times'' blog, February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latitude===
With Google Latitude, the service expanded to PC browsers (it used the [[W3C Geolocation API|Geolocation API]] as well as user-driven input) and automated location detection on mobile phones using [[Cell of origin (telecommunications)|cellular positioning]], [[Wi-Fi positioning system|Wi-Fi positioning]], and [[GPS]].

In November 2009, Google announced a Latitude feature called "Location History" which stores and analyzes a user's location over time, for example attempting to identify a user's home and workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/11/google-latitude-now-with-location.html |title=Google Latitude, now with Location History &amp; Alerts |last1=Lambert |first1=Chris |website=Google Mobile Blog |date=November 10, 2009 |access-date=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Web-based Location History is now provided by Google Maps.

At the end of May 2010, Google announced an API which allows applications to make use of Latitude data, with the user's explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/with-new-google-latitude-api-build.html With the New Google Latitude API, Build Latitude and Location Into Your App], by Ana Ulin, Google Code Blog, May 19, 2010. Retrieved November 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 a Leaderboard feature was added that provides point scoring and score comparison with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garun |first=Natt |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-latitude-launches-leaderboards-your-friendly-global-check-in-competition/ |title=Google Latitude launches Leaderboards, your friendly global check-in competition |publisher=Digitaltrends |date=February 20, 2012 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/02/google-latitude-leaderboards-take-direct-aim-at-foursquare/ |title=Google Latitude Leaderboards Takes Direct Aim at Foursquare |website=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Latitude was not available in Apple's Chinese App Store for download, but it might have been built into the Google Maps app.{{Original research inline|date=April 2013}}

==Discontinuation==

On July 10, 2013 (with less than a month before its closure), Google announced plans to shut down Google Latitude on August 9, 2013.&lt;ref name="retireBlog"/&gt; Google then offered location reporting on [[Google+]], but this did not yet run on all the platforms that Google Maps does ([[BlackBerry]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[S60 (software platform)|S60]], etc.). Later it was fully migrated into Google Maps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Compatibility==
Google Latitude was compatible with most devices running [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[Windows Mobile]], and [[S60 (software platform)|Symbian S60]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Support: Supported Phones|url=https://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=136640|publisher=Google|accessdate=August 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805222732/http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=136640|archive-date=August 5, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-latitude-now-for-iphone.html |title=Google Latitude. Now for iPhone. - Official Google Mobile Blog |publisher=Googlemobile.blogspot.com |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially Google stated on the Latitude page that it would be available for [[Java ME]] phones,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but this claim was later removed from the site. On most platforms Latitude could continue to update the user's location in the background when the application was not in use, while on others it only updated the user's location when the application was in use.

The [[Sony Ericsson W995]], [[Sony Ericsson C905|C905]], C903, C510, Elm and Satio mobile phones supported Google Latitude as part of their built-in [[Google Maps]] application. Although this was a Java ME application, it could not be downloaded for use with other mobile phones.

==Privacy concerns==
Amid concerns over [[Location-based service#Privacy issues|locational privacy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=213201991&amp;subSection=Web+Development "Google Latitude Spurs Privacy Backlash"], by Thomas Claburn, [[InformationWorld]], February 5, 2009. Retrieved April 15, 2009/&lt;/ref&gt; Google announced that Latitude overwrites a user's previous location with the new location data and does not keep logs of locations provided to the service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/business/2009/03/googles-latitud/ "Google Latitude to Cops: 'I Don't Remember'"], by Ryan Singel, Wired, March 5, 2009. Retrieved April 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/03/exclusive-google-takes-stand-location-privacy-alon "EXCLUSIVE: Google Takes a Stand for Location Privacy, Along with Loopt"], by [[Kevin Bankston]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], March 4, 2009. Retrieved April 15, 2009/&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2011, Google Latitude optionally recorded a history of places visited and counts time spent at each place. This information was then used to display statistics such as "Time At Work", "Time Spent At Home" and "Time Spent Out".

== Reception ==
The film was generally criticized for promoting nudity in films and introducing soft porn to Nigerian and Ghanaian home videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.ghananation.com/templates/?a=12798 | title=Heart of Men: Soft Porn? | publisher=Ghana Nation | accessdate=13 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414143724/http://news.ghananation.com/templates/?a=12798 | archivedate=14 April 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nigeriafilms.com/news/6663/20/nollywood-made-sexy-in-ghana.html | title=From Ghana with Soft Porn | publisher=Nigeriafilms.com | accessdate=13 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416040155/http://www.nigeriafilms.com/news/6663/20/nollywood-made-sexy-in-ghana.html | archivedate=16 April 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kemifilani.com/2014/04/film-maker-frank-rajah-arase-regrets.html | title=Frank Rajah regrets introducing Nudity to Ghollywood | accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rated 3 out of 5 stars on [[Nollywood Reinvented]] who praised the quality, setting and musical score, but found the plot too complex and the sex scenes overdone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nollywoodreinvented.com/2012/05/heart-of-men.html | title=Heart of Men Review on NR | accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Międzymorze''''' ({{IPA-pl|mʲɛnd͡zɨˈmɔʐɛ}}), known in [[English language|English]] as '''Intermarium''', was a plan pursued after [[World War I]] by [[Poles|Polish]] leader [[Józef Piłsudski]] for a [[federation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aviel Roshwald]], "Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914–1923", Routledge (UK), 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-17893-2}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard K Debo, '' Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918-192'', McGill-Queen's Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7735-0828-7}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H.

The Polish name ''Międzymorze'' (from ''między'', "between, among"; and ''morze'', "sea"), meaning "Between-seas", was rendered into [[Latin]] as "Intermarium."&lt;ref&gt;Tomasz Piesakowski, ''Akcja niepodległościowa na terenie międzynarodowym, 1945-1990'', 1999, p. 149:  "''... przyjmując łacińskie określenie 'Intermarium' (Międzymorze).

Within two decades of the failure of Piłsudski's grand scheme, all the countries that he had viewed as candidates for membership in the Intermarium federation had fallen to the [[Soviet Union]] or  [[Nazi Germany]], except for Finland (which suffered some territorial losses in the 1939–40 [[Winter War]] with the Soviet Union).

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita 1600.png|thumb|250px|The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent]]

=== Commonwealth ===
{{main|Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth}}
A [[Polish–Lithuanian union]] and [[military alliance]] had come about as a mutual response to a common threat posed by the [[Teutonic Order]]. The alliance was first established in 1385 by the marriage of Poland's [[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] and Lithuania's [[Gediminids|Gediminid dynasty]] in the person of Grand Duke [[Jogaila]], who became King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland.

A longer-lasting federation was subsequently established via the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, an arrangement that lasted until the late-18th-century [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Under the Commonwealth, proposals were advanced for the establishment of an expanded, [[Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian-''Muscovite'']] or Polish–Lithuanian–''Ruthenian'', Commonwealth. These proposals were never implemented.

=== Czartoryski's plan ===
[[Image:Coat of arms of the January Uprising.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] for proposed [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]] during [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]], with Polish [[Coat of Arms of Poland|White Eagle]], Lithuanian ''[[Pahonia]]'', and [[Ruthenia]]n [[Archangel Michael]].]]
[[Image:Adam Jerzy Czartoryski.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]]]

Between the [[November Uprising|November]] and [[January Uprising]]s, in 1832–61, the idea of resurrecting an updated Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was advocated by Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], residing in exile at the [[Hôtel Lambert]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''" ("A Polish Pioneer of a United Europe"), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'' (Pole Star), Sept. 17, 2005, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth Czartoryski had fought against Russia in the Polish-Russian War of 1792 and would have done so again in the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] of 1794, had he not been arrested at Brussels on his way back to Poland. Subsequently, in 1795 he and his younger brother had been commanded to enter the Russian army, and [[Catherine the Great]] had been so favorably impressed with them that she had restored to them part of their confiscated estates. Adam Czartoryski had subsequently served Emperors [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as a diplomat and foreign minister, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] establishing an anti-French coalition. Czartoryski had been one of the leaders of the Polish November 1830 Uprising and, after its suppression by Russia, had been sentenced to death but eventually allowed to go into exile in France.

In Paris the "visionary"&lt;ref&gt;"The Prince [Czartoryski] thus shows himself a ''visionary'' (emphasis added], the  outstanding Polish statesman of the period between the November and January Uprisings."  [[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''," p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; statesman and former friend, confidant and ''de facto'' foreign minister of Russia's [[Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] acted as the "uncrowned king and unacknowledged foreign minister" of a nonexistent Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''," p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Essai sur la diplomatie'' (Essay on Diplomacy), completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Czartoryski observed that, "Having extended her sway south and west, and being by the nature of things unreachable from the east and north, Russia becomes a source of constant threat to Europe."  He argued that she would have done better, cultivating "friends rather than slaves."  He also identified a future threat from Prussia and urged the incorporation of [[East Prussia]] into a resurrected Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], ''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

His diplomatic efforts anticipated Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Prometheist]] project in linking efforts for Polish independence with similar movements of other subjugated nations in Europe and in the east, as far as the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''," pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Czartoryski aspired above all to reconstitute—with French, British and Turkish support—a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth federated with the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians and all the [[South Slavs]] of the future [[Yugoslavia]]. Poland, in his concept, could have mediated the conflicts between Hungary and the Slavs, and between Hungary and Romania.&lt;ref name="Europy p. 11"&gt;[[M.K. Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''," p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan seemed achievable&lt;ref&gt;"Adam Czartoryski's great plan, ''which had seemed close to realization'' (emphasis added) during the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848–49, failed..."  [[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''," p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; during the period of [[Spring of Nations|national revolutions]] in 1848–49 but foundered on lack of western support, on Hungarian intransigence toward the Czechs, Slovaks and Romanians, and on the rise of German nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[M.K. Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "''Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy''", p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nevertheless," concludes [[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski|Dziewanowski]], "the Prince's endeavor constitutes a [vital] link [between] the 16th-century [[Jagiellon]] [federative prototype] and [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s federative-[[Prometheism|Prometheist]] program [that was to follow after [[World War I]]]."&lt;ref name="Europy p. 11"/&gt;

Józef Piłsudski's strategic goal was to resurrect an updated, quasi-democratic, form of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while working for the disintegration of the [[Russian Empire]], and later the [[Soviet Union]], into its ethnic constituents.&lt;ref name="Levy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Levy|title=The Intermarium: Wilson, Madison, &amp; East Central European Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNb4RXDxEt4C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=6 June 2007|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-369-2|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The latter was his [[Prometheism|Prometheist]] project.)&lt;ref name="Levy2007"/&gt; Piłsudski saw an Intermarium federation as a counterweight to Russian and German [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Cisek2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janusz Cisek|title=Kościuszko, we are here!: American pilots of the Kościuszko Squadron in defense of Poland, 1919-1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=26 September 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1240-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spero2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua B.

According to Dziewanowski, the plan was never expressed in systematic fashion but instead relied on Piłsudski's pragmatic instincts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878849 Review of ''Joseph Pilsudski: A European Federalist, 1918–1922'', by M.

Piłsudski's plan faced opposition from virtually all quarters. The Soviets, whose [[sphere of influence]] was directly threatened, worked to thwart the Intermarium agenda.&lt;ref name="Nowak"/&gt; The Allied Powers assumed that [[Bolshevism]] was only a temporary threat and did not want to see their important (from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] viewpoint) traditional ally, Russia, weakened.

Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said: "All that we can gain in the west depends on the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany," while in the east "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far."&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;[[Margaret MacMillan|MacMillan, Margaret]], ''Paris 1919 : Six Months That Changed the World'', Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2003, {{ISBN|0-375-76052-0}}, p.212"&lt;/ref&gt; In the eastern chaos, the Polish forces set out to expand as far as feasible.

[[File:Międzymorze (Intermarum) 1935-1939.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Józef Beck]]'s proposal of a "Third Europe". This was to be an alliance of Poland, Romania, and Hungary.]]
In the aftermath of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919–21), Piłsudski's concept of a federation of Central and Eastern European countries, based on a Polish-Ukrainian axis, lost any chance of realization.&lt;ref name="Marcz"&gt;Tadeusz Marczak, ''"[http://www.ism.uni.wroc.pl/publikacje/polonia/marczak_miedzymorze_wczoraj_i_dzis.pdf Międzymorze wczoraj i dziś]"'' ("Międzymorze Yesterday and Today"), a Polish-language version of the paper, "''Myezhdumorye vchera i syevodnia''" ("Międzymorze Yesterday and Today"), published in ''Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Polsha: Put k sotrudnichestvu. Materialy Miezhdunarodnoy Nauchnoy Konfierientsii'' (Belarus and Poland: the Path toward Cooperation. Materials of an International Scholarly Conference), [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]], 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Piłsudski next contemplated a federation or alliance with the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] and [[Balkan]] states. This plan envisioned a Central European union including Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Scandinavia]], the Baltic states, [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]—thus stretching not only west-east from the Baltic to the Black Sea, but north-south from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Marcz"/&gt;  This project also failed: Poland was distrusted by Czechoslovakia and Lithuania; and while it had relatively good relations with the other countries, they had tensions with their  neighbors, making it virtually impossible to create in Central Europe a large block of countries that all had good relations with each other. In the end, in place of a large federation, only a [[Polish-Romanian alliance]] was established, beginning in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ragsdale, ''The Soviets, the Munich Crisis, and the Coming of World War II'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge {{ISBN|0-521-83030-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Czechoslovakia had more success with its [[Little Entente]] (1920–38) with Romania and Yugoslavia, supported by France.   

Piłsudski died in 1935. A later version of his concept was attempted by [[interwar period|interwar]] Polish Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]], a Piłsudski protégé, whose proposal during the late 1930s of a "Third Europe"—an alliance of Poland, Romania and Hungary—also gained little ground before [[World War II]] supervened.&lt;ref name="Marcz"/&gt;

Despite the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Act of 1932 the Kremlin joined in alliance with Nazi Germany to divide central and eastern Europe into two parts for each power to control.&lt;ref name= "Intermarium"&gt;[[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]], ''Intermarium: The Land between the Black and Baltic Seas''. Transaction Publishers: [[New Brunswick, NJ.]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to create a strong counterweight to Germany and the Soviet Union, such as Piłsudski's ''Międzymorze'', according to some historians, doomed the prospective member-countries to [[Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin|their eventual fate as victims]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Cisek2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spero2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petersen2011-2"&gt;

== World War II and since ==
[[Image:Wladyslaw Sikorski 2.jpg|thumb|[[Władysław Sikorski]]]]
The concept of a "Central European Union"—a triangular geopolitical entity anchored in the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic or Aegean Seas—was revived during [[World War II]] in [[Władysław Sikorski]]'s  [[Polish Government in Exile]]. A first step toward its implementation—1942 discussions between the Greek, Yugoslav, Polish and Czechoslovak governments in exile regarding prospective [[Greek-Yugoslav federation|Greek-Yugoslav]] and [[Polish-Czechoslovak federation]]s—ultimately foundered on Soviet opposition, which led to Czech hesitation and Allied indifference or hostility.&lt;ref name="Marcz"/&gt; A declaration of the [[Polish Underground State]] from that period called for the creation of a Central European federal union, without domination by any single state.&lt;ref name=Gar246&gt;{{cite journal | author = Józef Garliński |date=April 1975 | title = The Polish Underground State 1939-1945 | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–259 | publisher = Sage Publications, Ltd. | jstor = 260146 | doi = 10.1177/002200947501000202}} P. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kersten1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krystyna Kersten|title=The establishment of Communist rule in Poland, 1943-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RD3-e7Zx-rEC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06219-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of the concept have survived into the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including regional-security proposals that were not framed as being Polish-led. Poland's neighbors, however, continued to perceive the idea as imperialist.&lt;ref name="Wohlefeld"&gt;Monika Wohlefeld, "[http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/94-96/wohlfeld/home.htm  Security Cooperation in Central Europe: Polish Views]," [[NATO]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Warsaw Pact]] collapsed, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] in 1999, paving the way for other post-Communist nations to also join;&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; and [[Bulgaria]], Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], in 2004. Ukraine had also expressed interest in joining under the [[Viktor Yushchenko]] administration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2007/s070614j.html Joint Press Conference with the NATO Secretary General and the Minister of Defence of Ukraine].

In 2004 Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, and the [[Baltic states]] joined the [[European Union]]; in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria;  in 2013, Croatia.

On 12 May 2011 the [[Visegrad Group]] countries ([[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Hungary]]) announced the formation of a [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] under the command of Poland. The battlegroup would be in place by 2016 as an independent force and would not be part of the NATO command. In addition, starting in 2013, the four countries would begin military exercises together under the auspices of the [[NATO Response Force]]. Some scholars see this as a first step toward close cooperation in the [[Central Europe]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110516-visegrad-new-european-military-force?

"'''{{lang|fr|J'ai déjà vu ça dans tes yeux}}'''" ([[English language|English]] translation: "I've Already Seen That in Your Eyes") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[United States of America|American]]-[[France|French]] singer, actress and former [[Playboy]] model [[Jeane Manson]]. Manson was born in the United States but relocated to Paris in 1974. "J'ai déjà vu ça dans tes yeux" was included on Manson's third studio album ''Fly to New York City''.

The song is a [[blues]] influenced ballad, with Manson describing a series of romantic visions (including one of a family) to her lover before telling him that ''"I've already seen that in your eyes"'' - that is to say, she can see their future together; "''{{lang|fr|tous les deux—si tu veux}}''" ("The two of us—if you want to").

The song was performed thirteenth on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Micha Marah]] with "[[Hey Nana]]" and preceding the [[Netherlands]]' [[Xandra (band)|Xandra]] with "[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 44 points, placing 13th in a field of 19.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 Contest]] by [[Sophie &amp; Magaly]] with "[[Papa Pingouin]]".

The '''Japanese people who conserve Article 9''' are a group of people who were among the favourites to win the [[2014 Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Rheana|title=Home&gt; International 2014 Nobel Peace Prize Contenders|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/2014-nobel-peace-prize-contenders/story?id=26083056|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]]|date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karimi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karimi|first1=Faith|title=Nobel Peace Prize: And the winner could be ...|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/09/world/europe/nobel-peace-prize-predictions/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] is the section of the Japanese constitution that states:

{{blockquote|ARTICLE 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. To accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Protest==
Over the years, there have been different attempts to change or abolish Article 9, which was adopted in 1947. [[Shinzō Abe]], Prime Minister of Japan since late 2012, is a supporter of making  Article 9 less restrictive. In January 2013, [[Naomi Takasu]] from [[Zama, Kanagawa]] emailed the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] to promote Article 9 as a means to protect children. She tried to get Article 9 itself nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but since she didn't have the time to organise protests, she campaigned from home, by email. Joined by other people from Zama and from [[Sagamihara]], she formed the "Organizing Committee for the Nobel Peace Prize for Article 9 of the Constitution.", which by August 2013 had gathered 24,000 signatures to support the nomination.&lt;ref name=Kyodo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo|first1=Jiji|title=How Japan’s Article 9 was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/07/national/japans-article-9-nominated-nobel-peace-prize/#.VDe81leDy8A|accessdate=10 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving the petition, the Committee replied that the Prize can only be awarded to people or organizations, disqualifying the Article 9 nomination. Takasu then changed the nomination to be about the Japanese people who want to keep Article 9.&lt;ref name=Kyodo/&gt; Since not everyone can make nominations for the Prize, she couldn't officially nominate the group herself. A number of Japanese professors with the right qualifications supported her cause and submitted the revised nomination.&lt;ref name=Japanfs&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 9 of Japan's Constitution Nominated for Nobel Peace Award|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/news/archives/news_id034940.html|website=www.japanfs.org|publisher=Japan for Sustainability|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has continued to grow in Japan and receive support from all over the world. By June 2014, about 80,000 people had signed the petition.&lt;ref name=Japanfs/&gt; Notable members include [[Yōichi Komori]], professor at the [[University of Tokyo]] and leader of the group ''Kyujo no Kai'' ("Association of Article 9"). Political reactions to the group and the chances of a Nobel Prize for it have been mixed.&lt;ref name=Kyodo/&gt;

==2014 Nobel Peace Prize speculation==
In the days running up to the announcement of the [[2014 Nobel Peace Prize]], there was widespread speculation that the so-called "Japanese people who conserve Article 9" group were favourites to win the prize. In the end, the winners were [[Kailash Satyarthi]] from India and [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan. 

The speculation about their chances was fueled when [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], director of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], who each year announces his shortlist of favourites for the prize, named the group as his tip for 2014 in his revised list, posted 3 October 2014.&lt;ref name=Harpviken&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harpviken|first1=Kristian Berg|title=Harpviken's 2014 Nobel Peace Prize shortlist|url=http://www.prio.org/About/PeacePrize/PRIO-Directors-Speculations-2014/|website=www.prio.org|publisher=[[Peace Research Institute Oslo]]|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">'''Keturi vėjai''' (''The Four Winds'') was a [[Lithuania]]n literary movement and literary [[magazine]], active from 1924 to 1928.

The ''Keturi vėjai'' movement began with the publication of ''The Prophet of the Four Winds'' by [[Kazys Binkis]] (1893–1942). The theoretical basis of ''Keturi vėjai'' initially was [[Futurism (art)|futurism]] which arrived through Russia from the West, and it later was influenced by [[cubism]], [[dadaism]], [[surrealism]], [[unanimism]], and German [[expressionism]]. The most influential futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. Members of ''Keturi vėjai'' included founder Kazys Binkis, [[Antanas Rimydis]] (b. 1905), [[Juozas Tysliava]] (b. 1902), [[Salys Šemerys]] (b. 1898), [[Juozas Žengė]] (b. 1899), and [[Teofilis Tilvytis]] (b. 1903).&lt;ref name=nyka&gt;[http://aidai.us/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=169%3A24-rugsjis&amp;id=2062%3Ali&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=197 Alfonsas Nyka-Niliūnas. ''Keturi vėjai ir keturvėjinikai'', ''Aidai'', 1949, No. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet [[Adomas Jakštas]] was a fierce critic of the ''Keturi vėjai'' movement. He objected to its literary principles, aesthetics, and philosophy. The only poet of that generation not attracted to ''Keturi vėjai'' was [[Stasys Santvaras]], who was more interested in symbolism and expressionism than in modern forms of poetry.&lt;ref name=nyka/&gt;

The poetry of [[dada]]ist [[Pranas Morkūnas]] (1900–1941) has been characterized as a continuation of rebellion started by ''Keturi vėjai'' against traditional poetry.

The Lithuanian school ''Keturi vėjai'' in [[Dublin, Ireland]] is named after the literary movement.

'''Kočani orkestar''' (in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Кочани оркестар'') also credited under the names: ''Kocani orkestar'', ''Kocani Orchestra'', ''Kochani orkestar'' and ''Kochani Orchestra'' is a [[Roma in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Romani]] [[Balkan Brass Band|brass band]] from [[Kočani]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] led till 2000 by Naat Veliov. 
Kočani orkestar are among the funkiest exponents of the Balkan brass band style which is found across ex-Yugoslavia and is a direct descendent of the music once played by Turkish army bands. They come from the city of [[Kočani]], in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Their music is based on Gypsy tunes from various parts of the Balkans and on Turkish rhythms, with a sprinkle of Latin flavour.

Their song "Siki, siki baba" is featured on the [[Stereophonic Musical Listenings That Have Been Origin in Moving Film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"|soundtrack]] for the movie [[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]] although it has no connection to the [[Music of Kazakhstan]]. Together with the Romani singer [[Esma Redžepova]], Naat Veliov has filed a lawsuit for the producers of the movie for an unauthorised use of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/faq|title=Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=37&amp;rel_id=123|title=CRAMMED DISCS: Kocani Orkestar - The Ravished Bride|first=CRAMMED|last=DISCS|website=www.crammed.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1491">'''Lempo''' is a sort of [[evil spirit|fiend]] from [[Finnish folklore]] and [[Finnish mythology|mythology]]. Lempo is the god of love and fertility in Finnish mythology.

After Christianity came to Finland, the reputation of Lempo worsened: (s)he is portrayed in the folklore usually as erratic spirit, as love can be capricious, even dangerous, and it could even take control of a being and turn them to destruction.

Lempo brought down the hero [[Väinämöinen]] with the help of his two demon cohorts, [[Hiisi]] and Paha. &lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

The words "lempo" and "hiisi" are also used as very mild [[profanity|swear words]] in the [[Finnish language]]. "Piru" is a slightly stronger swear word. This is also work of Christians, they weren't originally bad words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12040">The '''[[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] world records''' are the fastest times set over the international rowing distance of 2000 m.  They are believed to be correct as of June 18, 2017.

==On water records==
Rowing times are strongly affected by [[weather]] conditions, and to a lesser extent by water temperature – the majority of these times were set in warm water with a strong tailwind. World best rowing times have also decreased because of improvements in technology to both the [[racing shells|boats]] and the [[oars]], along with improvements in the conditioning of the rowers.

Because environmental conditions have a strong impact on boat speed, [[International Rowing Federation|FISA]] recognizes world best times instead of world records. A world best time is one recorded on a regatta course that has previously held the [[World Rowing Championships|World Championships]], [[Rowing at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], or [[Rowing World Cup|World Cup]] since 1980. A number of record times were set at the 2005 World Championships held on the [[Nagara River]] at [[Kaizu, Gifu|Kaizu]], [[Gifu Prefecture]], [[Japan]], but due to a fast [[Current (stream)|current]] caused by heavy rainfall from the remnants of [[Typhoon Mawar (2005)|Typhoon Mawar]], FISA declared that the race results were not eligible to be considered as world best times.

There is a category for [[lightweight rowing]]. For men the crew average, wearing racing kit, cannot exceed {{convert|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and no rower may be over {{convert|72.5|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. For women the limits are {{convert|57|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|59|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FISA rule book - rule 31|url=http://www.worldrowing.com/fisa/publications/rule-book|publisher=FISA|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamish Bond]] and [[Eric Murray (rower)|Eric Murray]] hold the record for most consecutive wins with 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/olympics/83090966/Rio-Olympics-2016-Hamish-Bond-and-Eric-Murray-win-gold-in-mens-pair-rowing |title=Rio Olympics 2016: Hamish Bond and Eric Murray win gold in men's pair rowing |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2016-08-12 |accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nextcom]] '''R5000-HD''' is a popular [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based system for [[Digital data|digital]]ly [[video capture|capturing]] HD ([[high-definition video|high-definition]]) and [[SDTV|SD]] (standard-definition) TV content from [[satellite TV]] and [[cable TV]] sources. A modification is required to the [[set-top box]], giving it a [[USB 2.0]] output that is connected to a PC. The [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) and companion [[personal video recorder]] (PVR) software runs on any Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10 system and can record just about any content (that is subscribed or [[free-to-air]] [[digital television|DTV]]) to [[hard disk]] or [[D-VHS]] [[magnetic tape|tape]]. Programming can be encoded in [[MPEG-2]], or [[MPEG-4]] type [[H.264|AVC/H.264]] formats. [[MPEG transport stream]]s compliant with the [[ISO 13818-1]] [[specification]] are created.

The R5000-HD differentiates itself from other DVR devices in that the captured [[MPEG]] data is an exact bit-for-bit replica of what is broadcast and encoded by the content provider. Other DVRs may encode the [[analog television|analog]] or [[composite video|composite]] signals from set-top box output jacks back into [[MPEG-2]] digital data for PC storage, or can only digitally capture (without re-encoding) signals via [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[Antenna tuner|tuner]]s. This significantly limits the amount content that can be recorded in a high-quality format. Decoding into the analog domain and then re-encoding back to digital ([[video compression|compression]]) is a lossy process resulting in visual and aural [[Compression artifact|artifacts]]. Furthermore, satellite providers have access to very expensive state-of-the-art MPEG [[encoder]]s that can provide unsurpassed quality at very low [[bitrate]]. It is advantageous to keep programs in this original form since it not only preserves quality but saves on storage space.

Companion PVR software allows users to program events using [[interactive TV]][[electronic program guide]]s (EPGs) such as [[Zap2it]] and [[TitanTV]]. An especially useful feature is TitanTV remote scheduling which allows users to program events from anywhere they can get [[Internet access]]. The R5000-HD PVR software automatically retrieves these events from a central server. The R5000-HD also supports third-party PVRs like [[SageTV]].

DVR systems such as the R5000-HD are alternatives to stand-alone devices such as [[TiVo]] and are increasingly popular with the growing number of [[home theater PC]] users. Although such solutions require more technical expertise to set up and use, they offer the ultimate in flexibility as to how media content is stored and distributed within a [[household]].

'''Palau''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Palau.ogg|p|ə|ˈ|l|aʊ}}, historically '''Belau''', '''Palaos''', or '''Pelew'''), officially the '''Republic of Palau''' ({{lang-pau|Beluu er a Belau}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palauembassy.com/Documents/ConstitutionP.pdf Constitution of Palau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526205103/http://www.palauembassy.com/Documents/ConstitutionP.pdf |date=26 May 2013 }}. (PDF). palauembassy.com. Retrieved 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[island country]] located in the western [[Pacific Ocean]]. The country contains approximately 340 islands, forming the western chain of the [[Caroline Islands]] in [[Micronesia]], and has an area of {{Convert|466|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palaugov.pw/rop-statistical-yearbooks/ "Statistical Yearbook 2015"]. Republic of Palau Bureau of Budget and Planning Ministry of Finance (2016-02-01). Retrieved on 2018-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The most populous island is [[Koror]]. The capital [[Ngerulmud]] is located on the nearby island of [[Babeldaob]], in [[Melekeok|Melekeok State]]. Palau shares [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].

The country was originally settled approximately 3,000 years ago by migrants from the [[Philippines]] and sustained a [[Negrito]] population until around 900 years ago. The islands were first explored by Europeans in the 16th century, and were made part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1574. Following Spain's defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the islands were sold to [[Imperial Germany]] in 1899 under the terms of the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty]], where they were administered as part of [[German New Guinea]], although the islands were already represented in the Malolos Congress of the revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] conquered Palau during [[World War I]], and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled [[South Pacific Mandate]] by the [[League of Nations]]. During [[World War II]], skirmishes, including the major [[Battle of Peleliu]], were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]]. Along with other [[Pacific Islands]], Palau was made a part of the [[United States]]-governed [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in 1947. Having voted&lt;!--referendum?--&gt; against joining the Federated States of Micronesia in 1979, the islands gained full sovereignty in 1994 under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States.

Politically, Palau is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[associated state|free association]] with the United States, which provides defense, funding, and access to social services. Legislative power is concentrated in the [[bicameral]] [[Palau National Congress]]. [[Economy of Palau|Palau's economy]] is based mainly on [[tourism]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[fishing]], with a significant portion of [[gross national product]] (GNP) derived from foreign aid. The country uses the [[United States dollar]] as its currency. The islands' culture mixes Micronesian, [[Melanesia]]n, Asian, and Western elements. Ethnic Palauans, the majority of the population, are of mixed Micronesian, Melanesian, and [[Austronesia]]n descent. A smaller proportion of the population is descended from [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] settlers. The country's two [[official language]]s are [[Palauan language|Palauan]] (a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family) and [[English language|English]], with [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]], and [[Tobian language|Tobian]] recognized as [[regional language]]s.

==Etymology==
The name for the islands in the [[Palauan language]], ''Belau'', likely derives from either the Palauan word for "village", ''beluu'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Palau.html Culture of Palau] – Every Culture. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or from ''aibebelau'' ("indirect replies"), relating to a creation myth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.underwatercolours.com/bai/bais.html The Bais of Belau] – Underwater Colours. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Palau" entered the [[English language]] from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Los Palaos'', via the [[German language|German]] ''Palau''. An archaic name for the islands in English was the "Pelew Islands".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010419154512/http://www.underwatercolors.com/neco.html Palau: Portrait of Paradise]. Underwater Colours. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Palau'' is unrelated to ''Pulau'', which is a [[Malay language|Malay]] word meaning "island" found in a number of place names in the region.

=== Early history ===
Palau was originally settled between the [[3rd millennium BCE|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BCE|2nd millennia BCE]], most likely from [[Indonesia]] or the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://histclo.com/country/oce/pal/co-pal.html Palau] – Historical Boys' Clothing. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands sustained a population of short-statured [[Melanesian]] or [[Pygmy people]] until the 12th century, when they were replaced.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The modern [[Micronesia]]n population, judging by its language, may have come from the [[Sunda Islands]] through the islands in the Philippines.

[[Sonsorol]], part of the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], an island chain approximately {{convert|600|km|mi|sp=us}} from the main island chain of Palau, was sighted by Europeans as early as 1522, when the Spanish mission of the ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'', the flagship of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of circumnavigation, sighted two small islands around the [[5th parallel north]], naming them "San Juan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micsem.org/pubs/articles/historical/forships/palau.htm Palau] – Foreign Ships in Micronesia. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Islas Marianas Palaos y Carolinas.JPG|left|thumb|Map of 1888 showing the Spanish East Indies, including Palau Islands (map without Philippines)]]
After the conquest of the Philippines in 1565 by the [[Spanish Empire]], the archipelago of Palau became part of the territory of the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]], established in 1574 as part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] with the capital based in the colonial centre in [[Manila]]. However, the Spanish presence only began to express with [[evangelization]], began at the end of the 17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century.

=== After 16th century ===
The conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697, when a group of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of [[Samar Island|Samar]] to the northwest. They were interviewed by the [[Czechs|Czech]] missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]] on 28 December 1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior General in a letter sent in June 1697,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Serrano, Andres |title=Los siete principes de los Angeles: validos del Rey del cielo. Misioneros, y protectores de la Tierra, con la practica de su deuocion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-6StnGKAIQC&amp;pg=PR132|year=1707|publisher=por Francisco Foppens|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt; equaling to the discovery of Palau.

=== Spanish era ===
This map and the letter caused a vast interest in the new islands. Another letter written by Fr. Andrés Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to Palau from [[Spanish Philippines]] in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''Santísima Trinidad'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave Palau the original Spanish name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).&lt;ref&gt;[http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/religion/frames/cathmissionsfr.htm Francis X. Hezel, SJ, Catholic Missions in the Carolines and Marshall Islands]. Micsem.org.

British traders became prominent visitors to Palau in the 18th century, followed by expanding Spanish influence in the 19th century. Palau, under the name ''Palaos'', was included in the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]], the first revolutionary congress in the [[Philippines]] which aimed to become fully independent from colonialists. Palau, at the time, was part of the Philippines. Palau had one appointed member to the congress, becoming the only group of islands in the entire Caroline Islands to be granted high representation in a non-colonial Philippine congress. The congress also supported the right of Palau to self-determination if ever it wishes to pursue such a path.&lt;ref name=PhilStar2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Balabo|first=Dino|title=Historians: Malolos Congress produced best RP Constitution|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/374302/historians-malolos-congress-produced-best-rp-constitution|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=December 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] annexed the islands after seizing them from Germany in 1914. Following World War I, the [[League of Nations]] formally placed the islands under Japanese administration as part of the [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|South Pacific Mandate]]. In World War II, Palau was used by Japan to support its [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|1941 invasion of the Philippines]], which succeeded in 1942. The invasion overthrew the American-installed Commonwealth government in the Philippines, and installed the Japanese-backed [[Second Philippine Republic]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t2-OmUA-EscC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=palau+japanese+invasion+philippines#v=onepage&amp;q=palau%20japanese%20invasion%20philippines&amp;f=false|quote=Admiral Takeo Takagi led the Philippines support force to Palau, an island 500 miles east of the southern Philippines where he waited to join the attack.|p=166|title=Japan Goes to War: A Chronology of Japanese Military Expansion from the Meiji Era to the Attack on Pearl Harbor (1868-1941)|author= Dorothy Perkins|publisher=DIANE Publishing|date=1997|isbn=9780788134272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States era ===
During [[World War II]], the [[United States]] captured Palau from Japan in 1944 after the costly [[Battle of Peleliu]], when more than 2,000 Americans and 10,000 Japanese were killed. In 1945–1946, the United States re-established control on the [[Philippines]], and managed Palau through the Philippine capital of [[Manila]]. By the later half of 1946, however, the Philippines was granted full independence with the formation of the [[Third Republic of the Philippines]], shifting the US Far West Pacific capital to [[Guam]]. Palau passed formally to the United States under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] established pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].

=== Independence ===

Four of the Trust Territory districts joined together and formed the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] in 1979, but the districts of Palau and the [[Marshall Islands]] declined to participate. Palau, the westernmost cluster of the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], instead opted for independent status in 1978, which was widely supported by the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]. It approved a new constitution and became the Republic of Palau on 1 January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pacific Island Battleground Now the Republic of Belau |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Bangor Daily News, via Google News |location=Bangor, Maine, USA |date=23 January 1981 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xHI-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3VkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1189,3024338&amp;dq=micronesia&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the [[United States]] in 1982.

Legislation making Palau an "offshore" financial center was passed by the Senate in 1998. In 2001, Palau passed its first [[bank regulation]] and anti-[[money laundering]] laws. In 2005,  Palau led the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of forest land of participating countries by 2020.

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Palau}}
[[File:Capitol, Melekeok, Palau.jpg|thumb|Capitol of Palau, the seat of government.]]

Palau is a [[Representative democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The [[President of Palau]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Palau National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary of Palau|judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Palau adopted a constitution in 1981.

The governments of the United States and Palau concluded a [[Compact of Free Association]] in 1986, similar to compacts that the United States had entered into with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]].&lt;ref name="gao-08-732_p7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Compact of Free Association: Palau's use of and accountability for U.S. assistance and prospects for economic self-sufficiency|journal=Report to Congressional Committees|date=10 June 2008|volume=GAO-08-732|pages=1–2|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/280/276299.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compact entered into force on 1 October 1994, concluding Palau's transition from trusteeship to independence&lt;ref name="gao-08-732_p7"/&gt; as the last portion of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] to secure its independence pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 956|Security Council Resolution 956]].

It primarily focuses on the issues of government, economic, security and defense relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palau.usembassy.gov/rop_cofa.pdf Compact of Free Association Between the Government of the United States of America and the government of Palau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006012927/http://palau.usembassy.gov/rop_cofa.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }}, Table of Contents&lt;/ref&gt; Palau has no independent military, relying on the United States for its defense. Under the compact, the [[American military]] was granted access to the islands for 50 years. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] role is minimal, limited to a handful of Navy [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabees]] (construction engineers). The [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] patrols in national waters.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Palau}}
As a sovereign nation, Palau conducts its own foreign relations.&lt;ref name="gao-08-732_p7"/&gt; Since independence, Palau has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including many of its Pacific neighbors, like [[Micronesia]] and the [[Philippines]]. On 29 November 1994, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 963|Resolution 963]] recommending Palau's admission to the [[United Nations]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved admission for Palau pursuant to Resolution 49/63 on 15 December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/49/63 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 49/63, ''Admission of the Republic of Palau to Membership in the United Nations'', adopted 15 December 1994]. Un.org. Retrieved on 12 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Palau has since joined several other international organizations. In September 2006, Palau hosted the first Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit. Its President has made official visits to other Pacific countries, including Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/press/release/press4e_000553.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|date=2014-12-15|language=en|title=The President of the Republic of Palau to Visit Japan|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States maintains a diplomatic delegation and an embassy in Palau, but most aspects of the countries' relationship have to do with Compact-funded projects, which are the responsibility of the U.S. [[Department of the Interior]]'s [[Office of Insular Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024234958/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Firstpginfo/oia_responsibilities.html Responsibilities and Authorities].

In international politics, Palau often votes with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly – Overall Votes – Comparison with U.S. vote] lists Palau as in the country with the third high coincidence of votes. Palau has always been in the top three.&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote=The president insisted there was no link to the island's hosting of six inmates from Guantanamo Bay. Palau had earlier rejected a 156 million dollar offer and the settlement came after the island nation agreed to resettle six Muslim Uighurs who had been held for more than seven years at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay. The six arrived in Palau in November. But Johnson said the two issues were not related.

Historically, Palau's [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] have been part of the State of Koror.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Palau}}

Palau's territory consists of an [[archipelago]] located in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its most populous [[island]]s are [[Angaur]], [[Babeldaob]], [[Koror]] and [[Peleliu]]. The latter three lie together within the same [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds of the [[population]] lives on Koror.

The [[coral]] [[atoll]] of [[Kayangel]] is north of these islands, while the uninhabited [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] (about 200) are west of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], some {{convert|375|mi|km}} from the main islands, make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol.

===Climate===

Palau has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with an annual [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|28|C|abbr=on}}. [[Rainfall]] is heavy throughout the [[year]], averaging {{convert|3800|mm|abbr=on}}. The average [[humidity]] is 82% and, although rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much [[sunlight|sunshine]].

[[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in [[2013 Pacific typhoon season|2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kitamoto|first1=Asanobu|title=Histogram of Typhoons Within 1 Degree of Koror|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/view_hist.pl?lang=en&amp;cmd=nn_pressure&amp;basin=wnp&amp;gid=40c8f127cdf990173254578948ac8291&amp;lat=7.36&amp;min=870&amp;lon=134.48&amp;quant=10|publisher=Digital Typhoon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mandatory [[emergency evacuation]] was issued for [[Kayangel]]. A [[storm surge]] damaged several houses. Despite residents' refusal to evacuate safely, no fatalities or major injuries were reported.

===Environment===
[[File:Palau-rock-islands20071222.jpg|thumb|[[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] in Palau.]]
[[File:Palau 2008030818 4709 (2347767520).jpg|thumb|An aerial view of limestone islands.]]

While much of Palau remains free of environmental degradation, areas of concern include illegal [[blast fishing|dynamite fishing]], inadequate [[waste management|solid waste disposal]] facilities in [[Koror]] and extensive [[sand]] and [[coral]] [[dredging]] in the Palau [[lagoon]]. As with other Pacific island nations, [[sea-level rise|rising sea level]] presents a major environmental threat. Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal [[vegetation]], [[agriculture]], and an already insufficient [[water supply]]. [[Wastewater treatment]] is a problem, along with the handling of [[toxic waste]] from [[fertilizer]]s and [[biocide]]s.

[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various [[mangrove]]s and in parts of the rock islands. Although this [[species]] is generally considered extremely dangerous, there has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history, and that was in the 1960s. In Palau, the largest crocodile measured in at {{convert|4.5|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The nation is also vulnerable to [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]]. Palau already has a problem with inadequate [[water supply]] and limited [[agricultural land|agricultural areas]] to support its [[population]].

On 5 November 2005, President Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of [[forest|forest land]] by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[territory (geographic region)|territories]] of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Together, this combined region represents nearly 5% of the marine area of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and 7% of its [[coastline]].

===Sanctuary===
On 25 September 2009, Palau announced that it would create the world's first [[shark sanctuary]].&lt;ref name="Palau creates world's first shark haven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=200|title=Palau creates world's first shark haven|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104125625/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=200|archive-date=4 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palau banned all commercial [[shark]] [[fishing]] within the waters of its [[exclusive economic zone|exclusive economic zone (EEZ)]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Palau}}

Palau's [[economy]] consists primarily of [[tourism]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Tourist activity focuses on [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]] in the islands' rich marine environment, including its [[Coral reef|barrier reefs]]' walls and [[World War II]] [[shipwreck|wrecks]]. The government is the largest [[employment|employer]], relying heavily on [[United States|U.S.]] [[aid|financial assistance]]. Business and tourist arrivals numbered some 50,000 in [[fiscal year]] 2000–2001.

[[File:Japan Palau Friendship Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Koror–Babeldaob Bridge]]]]
The [[population]] enjoys a [[per capita income]] twice that of [[Micronesia]] as a whole. Long-term prospects for the key tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the expansion of [[air travel]] in the [[Pacific Rim|Pacific]], the rising prosperity of leading [[East Asia]]n [[country|countries]] and the willingness of [[alien (law)|foreigners]] to [[investment|finance]] [[infrastructure]] development.

[[Airline|Air service]] has at times been spotty. [[Palau Micronesia Air]], [[Asian Spirit]] and [[Pacific Flier]] provided service to the [[Philippines]] and other destinations at various times during the 2000s, but all suspended service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palau's PacificFlier relooks business plan after suspension|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/13/346121/palaus-pacificflier-relooks-business-plan-after-suspension.html|author=Ghim-Lay Yeo|publisher=Flightglobal |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Airlines]] now provides near-daily service to and from [[Guam]], and once-weekly service to [[Yap]]. Also, [[Korean Air]] provides service three times per week to [[Incheon]].

In November 2006, [[Palau Saving Bank]] officially announced [[bankruptcy]]. On 13 December 2006, the [[Palau Horizon]] reported that 641 [[deposit account|depositors]] had been affected. Among them, 398 held less than US$5,000, with the remainder ranging from US$5,000 to US$2 million. On 12 December 79 affected people received compensation. Mr. Toribiong said, "The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government's loan from [[Taiwan]]." From a total of US$1 million, which originally was for assisting Palau's development, US$955,000 was left at the time of bankruptcy. Toribiong requested the Taiwanese government use the balance to repay its loans. Taiwan agreed to the request. The compensation would include those who held less than US$4,000 in an account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/101220/2/2jatl.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224064906/http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/101220/2/2jatl.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 |publisher=udn.com Center| accessdate=20 December 2010|title=帛琉銀行倒閉 賠償存戶竟由台灣埋單 (Taiwan pay for the bill of compensation for PSB bankruptcy)|author=李光儀、王光慈}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[income tax]] has three [[tax bracket|brackets]] with [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[tax rate|rates]] of 9.3 percent, 15 percent, and 19.6 percent respectively. [[Corporate tax]] is four percent, and the [[sales tax]] is zero. There are no [[property tax]]es.

==Transportation==
[[File:Palau International Airport 1.JPG|thumb|[[Palau International Airport]]]]
[[Palau International Airport]] provides scheduled [[direct flight]]s with [[Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport|Guam]], [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila]], [[Incheon International Airport|Seoul]] and [[Taoyuan International Airport|Taipei]] and since December 2010, [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo-Narita]]. [[Palau Pacific Airways]] also has charter flights to and from [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau International Airport|Macau]]. In addition, the states of [[Angaur]] and [[Peleliu]] have regular service to domestic destinations.

Freight, military and cruise ships often call at Malakal Harbor, on [[Malakal Island]] outside Koror. The country has no [[railway]]s, and of the {{convert|61|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} of [[highway]]s, only {{convert|36|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} are [[Road surface|paved]]. [[Driving]] is on the right and the [[speed limit]] is {{convert|40|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. [[Taxicab|Taxis]] are available in Koror. They are not metered and [[fare]]s are negotiable. Transportation between islands mostly relies on private [[boat]]s and domestic [[airline|air services]]. However, there are some state run boats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outofyourcomfortzone.net/all-the-schedules-and-prices-for-palaus-state-boat-between-koror-peleliu-and-angaur/|title=All the Schedules and Prices for Palau’s State Ferries between Koror, Peliliu and Angour|date=17 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between islands as a cheaper alternative.

The population of Palau is approximately {{UN_Population|Palau}}, of whom 73% are native Palauans of mixed [[Melanesia]]n, and [[Austronesian]] descent. There are many Asian communities within Palau. [[Filipinos in Palau|Filipinos]] form the largest Asian group and second largest ethnic group in the country. There are significant numbers of [[Chinese in Palau|Chinese]] and [[Koreans in Micronesia|Koreans]]. There are also smaller numbers of Palauans of mixed or full [[Japanese settlement in Palau|Japanese ancestry]]. Smaller numbers of [[Bangladeshi diaspora|Bangladeshi]] and [[Non Resident Nepali|Nepalese]] migrant workers and their descendants who came to the islands during the late 1900s can also be found. Most Palauans of Asian origin came during the late 1900s with many Filipinos, Chinese, Bangladeshis and Nepalese coming to Palau as unskilled workers and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Palau}}

According to 2015 estimates 45.3% of the population is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] (due to its shared colonial heritage with the [[Philippines]]), 6.9% [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-day Adventist]], 34.9% other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (due to American colonial rule), 5.7% [[Modekngei]] and 3.0% [[Islam|Muslim]] (due to its shared Islamic heritage with southern [[Philippines]]).&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; In 2009, the small [[Jewish]] community sent two cyclists to the 18th [[Maccabiah Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I've Got Friends in Low-lying Places... |url= http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/5515/features/ive-got-friends-in-low-lying-places-2/?print |last=Sokolow|first=Moshe|date=6 December 2012|work=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German and Japanese occupations of Palau both subsidized missionaries to follow the Spanish. Germans sent Roman Catholic and Protestant, Japanese sent Shinto and Buddhist, and Spaniards sent Roman Catholic missionaries as they controlled Palau. Three quarters of the population are [[Christian]]s (mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]), while [[Modekngei]] (a combination of Christianity, traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young University—Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; There are also approximately 400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] were allowed to settle in the island nation.

[[File:A traditional Palauan hut, 2012.jpg|thumb|A traditional Palauan house]]
Palauan society follows a very strict [[matrilineal]] system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance and the passing of traditional titles. The system probably had its origins from the Philippine archipelago, which had a similar system until the archipelago was colonized by Spain.

The cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. [[Western cuisine]] is favored among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer restaurants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the drink made from the roots of the [[kava]]; and the chewing of [[betel nut]]s.

The traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be free economic zones. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One such example occurred in early 2010, where the Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island belonged to the KSPLA.

===Traditional government===

The present day "traditional" government of Palau is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred.

Palau became divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises the states of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state.

The Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal government, safeguards are less meaningful. However, in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok.

It is a misconception that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter, are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, or close cousins, and have their own spouses.

===Sports===
{{See also|Baseball in Palau}}

[[Baseball]] is a popular sport in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The [[Palau national baseball team]] won the gold medal at the [[1990 Micronesian Games|1990]], [[1998 Micronesian Games|1998]] and [[2010 Micronesian Games]], as well as at the [[2007 Pacific Games]].

Palau also has a [[Palau national football team|national football team]], organized by the [[Palau Soccer Association]], but is not a member of [[FIFA]]. The Association also organizes the [[Palau Soccer League]].

===Education===

Primary education is required until age of 16. Schools include both public and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at [[Palau Community College]]. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular choices among Palauan scholars include the [[San Diego State University]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Mindanao State University]], and the [[University of the South Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Palau/Education-System|title=Palau Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{See also|List of Oceanian cuisines}}

Palau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called ''tama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ayearcookingtheworld.com/tag/tama/|title=Tama – A Year Cooking the World|website=ayearcookingtheworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. It also shares with [[Filipino cuisine]] with neighboring Philippines, notably on [[Asian cuisine|Asian]]-[[Latin]] food. [[Megabat|Fruit bat]] soup is a commonly referenced Palauan delicacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3960841/fruit-bat-soup-has-chicken-like-taste/|title=Fruit bat soup has chicken-like taste|date=2016-06-12|work=Newcastle Herald|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's Republic of Angola''' ({{Lang-pt|República Popular de Angola}}) was the self-declared [[socialist state]] which governed [[Angola]] from its independence in 1975 until 1992, during the [[Angolan Civil War]].

== History ==
The regime was established in 1975, after [[Portuguese Angola]], a colony, was granted independence from [[Portugal]] through the [[Alvor Agreement]].&lt;ref name=Rothchild&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothchild|first=Donald S.|year=1997|title=Managing Ethnic Conflict in Africa: Pressures and Incentives for Cooperation|publisher=Brookings Institution Press, 1997|location=Washington D.C.|pages=116|isbn=978-0-8157-7593-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tvedten&gt;{{cite book|last=Tvedten|first=Inge|year=1997|title=Angola: Struggle for Peace and Reconstruction|isbn=978-0-8133-3335-9|location=London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation in Portugal's other former large African colony, the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]], was similar.&lt;ref name="Faria 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Faria |first=P.C.J. |title=The Post-war Angola: Public Sphere, Political Regime and Democracy |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |series=EBSCO ebook academic collection |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4438-6671-2 |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=izsyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271 |access-date=10 September 2018 |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly-founded nation had friendly relations with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]], and the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-648.html|title=Angola – Communist Nations|website=www.country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was governed by the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), which was responsible for the transition into a [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[one-party state]]. The group was backed by both Cuba and the Soviet Union.

An opposing group, known as the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), led by [[Jonas Savimbi]], sparked a [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] with the MPLA, with the backing from both [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com: African Socialism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/african |title=African Socialism |website=www.encyclopedia.com |language=en |access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the MPLA and UNITA signed the peace agreement known as the [[Bicesse Accords]], which allowed for [[Multi-party state|multiparty elections]] in Angola.

In 1992, the People's Republic of Angola was constitutionally succeeded by the [[Republic of Angola]] and elections were held. However, the peace agreement did not last, as Savimbi rejected the election results and fighting resumed across the country until 2002.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2002"&gt;{{cite web|author=French, Howard W. |date=3 March 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/weekinreview/the-world-exit-savimbi-and-the-cold-war-in-africa.html|title=The World; Exit Savimbi, and the Cold War in Africa|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruben Henriques Jr.''' (1771-1846) was a Jewish-Danish banker.  He founded the [[brokerage firm]]  R. Henriques jr.  in 1801.

==Early life and career==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2296">The '''Suarines''' or '''Suardones''' were one of the [[Nerthus]]-worshipping [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. They have otherwise been lost to history, but Schütte [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/sagabook/n003.php] suggests that their name lives on in the name of the town [[Schwerin]].

Tacitus wrote of them in a group of tribes defended by rivers and forests, that worshipped [[Nerthus]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''(Original Latin)'' "[[Reudigni]] deinde et [[Aviones]] et [[Anglii]] et [[Varini]] et [[Eudoses]] et Suardones et [[Nuithones]]. Nec quicquam notabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune Nerthum, id est Terram matrem, colunt eamque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis arbitrantur. ..."  --Tacitus, ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]], [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus', ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]], Medieval Source Book. Code and format by Northvegr.[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/tacitus/009.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''(English translation)'' "There follow in order the [[Reudigni]]ans, and [[Aviones]], and [[Angles]], and Varinians, and [[Eudoses]], and Suardones and [[Nuithones]]; all defended by rivers or forests. Nor in one of these nations does aught remarkable occur, only that they universally join in the worship of ''Herthum ([[Nerthus]])''; that is to say, the Mother Earth."--Tacitus, ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]], [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]], translated 1877 by Church and Brodribb.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus', ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]]; translation from ''The Agricola and Germania'', A. J. Church and W. J. Brodribb, trans., (London: Macmillan, 1877), pp. 87- 10, as recorded in the ''Medieval Sourcebook''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/tacitus1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to some Italian scholars, there is trace of this tribe in a modern Lombard surname (''[[Suardi (dynasty)|Suardi]]'') as well in the surname Lusuardi. Both surnames belong to the same genetic family - Haplogroup U152 Z36.

[[Image:Convict Church, Port Arthur.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] convict church at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]]]]
'''Tasmanian Gothic''' is a [[literary genre|genre]] of [[Tasmanian literature]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlit.edu.au/specialistDatasets/Tas Auslit – Literature of Tasmania]&lt;/ref&gt; that merges the traditions of [[Gothic fiction]] with the history and natural features of [[Tasmania]], an island state south of the Australian continent. Tasmanian Gothic has inspired works in other artistic media, including theatre and film.

==Origins==
Although it deals with the themes of horror, mystery and the uncanny, Tasmanian Gothic literature and art differs from traditional European [[Gothic Literature]], which is rooted in [[medieval]] imagery, crumbling [[Gothic architecture]] and religious ritual. Instead, the Tasmanian gothic tradition centres on the natural landscape of [[Tasmania]] and its colonial architecture and history.

A densely populated Europe of the [[industrial revolution]] prompted [[Urban Gothic]] literature and novels like [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886) and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890). But in sparsely populated colonial Australia, especially the penal colony of Tasmania, the religious zeal of some prison wardens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leatherwoodonline.com/history/2004/pa-pw/ Port Arthur Gothic]&lt;/ref&gt; (akin, in many ways, to the institutionalised religion of the [[Inquisition]]; a theme reflected in European gothicism) and the mysterious rituals and traditions of Tasmania's indigenous [[Tasmanian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] inhabitants lent itself to an entirely different ''gothic'' tradition.

[[Frederick Sinnett]] (founder of the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|Sinnett, Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in 1856, considered traditional gothic romanticism inappropriate to [[Australian literature]] precisely because the colony lacked the requisite [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. For many, however, ''"the very landscape of Australia was gothic"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty of Arts – Papers|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/artspapers/60/|last=Turcotte|first=Gerry|year=1998|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of Tasmanian Gothic art and literature also merge [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] tradition with European [[gnostic]]ism, rustic spirits and the [[faerie]].

==History==

===Nineteenth century===
[[Image:Skull of Alexander Pearce.jpg|thumb|right|The skull of Alexander Pearce, held at the [[State Library of Tasmania]]]]

The dramatic landscape and impenetrable [[rainforest]]s of [[Tasmania]] and the real and imagined brutality of the original penal colony provided a ready source of horror stories. Unsettling events such as the story of [[Alexander Pearce]], the wandering cannibal who roamed through [[Van Diemen's Land]] in the 1820s, also influenced the bleak and sinister atmosphere that provided an ideal setting for gothic fiction. The first major work of Australian Gothic fiction, [[Marcus Clarke]]'s ''[[For the Term of his Natural Life]]'', provides a highly sensationalised account of the adventures of a convict unjustly [[penal transportation|transported]] to Van Diemen's Land for murder. It was first published as a novel in 1874 while the notorious prison settlement at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] was still in operation.

When the [[Victorian gold rush|gold rush]] switched the focus of attention to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Tasmania began to lose its importance in the Australian economy; "[one] of Tasmania's principal exports during the first twenty years of this century was her young men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skemp|first=J.R.|title=Tasmania Yesterday and Today|publisher=McMillan and Company|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, those who remained on the island became the butt of jokes by mainland Australians, who regarded them as [[inbred]], [[Parochialism|parochial]], and out of touch with civilisation.

Given Tasmania's relatively recent colonisation, artists and authors of the gothic tradition had little to draw on in terms of non-indigenous history. What indigenous history was available to them, however, was mysterious and misunderstood enough be drawn upon to support gothic imagery.

There are families (for example, the Jones family at Lower Marshes) who still own the land originally granted to their ancestors in the early years of the 19th century and still live in the houses built by their grandfathers. These families passed on stories of hardship, of encounters with [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]], convict servants, bushfires and floods as surrounding forests were cleared for farmland. This intersection of past and present informed the island's gothic character.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Jim. "Tasmanian Gothic". ''[[Meanjin]]'' 48.2-page 318, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
During the 20th century, a new generation of artists and authors living and working in Tasmania began to explore the gothic sensibility, drawing on Tasmania's colonial and more recent history for bizarre people and events, factual or imagined, and creating a uniquely Tasmanian stock of gothic characters and situations: deranged [[convict]] escapees (''"bolters"''), [[cannibals]], corrupt and [[drunk]]en officials, tough women, troubled and homesick immigrants, malevolent forest [[spirit]]s, deformed halfwits and feral [[wiktionary:backwoodsman|backwoodsmen]], set among spectacular mountains, remote forest camps and Tasmania's crumbling penal colony infrastructure.

The alleged discovery of a small degenerate community on the [[West Coast, Tasmania|West Coast]] in the 1930s became the subject of [[The Golden Age (play)|''The Golden Age'']], an important Tasmanian Gothic work by playwright [[Louis Nowra]], first performed by the [[Playbox Theatre Company, Australia|Playbox Theatre Company]] at the [[Victorian Arts Centre]]'s Studio Theatre in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nowra|first=Louis|title=The Golden Age|publisher=Currency Press|date=1989|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern variations==
Works by novelists [[Richard Flanagan]], [[Christopher Koch]] and [[Chloe Hooper]] are regarded as a continuation of the Tasmanian Gothic tradition. Flanagan's 2001 novel ''[[Gould's Book of Fish]]'', winner of the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]], is a fictionalised account of Van Diemonian painter [[William Buelow Gould]], focusing on his years spent imprisoned at the notorious [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station|convict settlement]] of [[Macquarie Harbour]]. According to [[Carmel Bird]], [[Helen Hodgman]]'s novels "distil the very essence of Tasmanian gothic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Hodgman|Hodgman, Helen]]. ''Blue Skies''. Melbourne: Text Publishing, 2011. {{ISBN|1921834196}}, p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; Danielle Wood's Tasmanian Gothic novel ''The Alphabet of Light and Dark'' won the 2002 [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyrill, Christopher (20 September 2003). [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625208867.html "The Alphabet of Light and Dark"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Retrieved 2 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rohan Wilson won the award for his 2011 novel ''[[The Roving Party]]'', a historical "re-imagining" into the misdeeds of [[John Batman]] and the band of convicts and [[Aboriginal tracker]]s he led through Van Diemen's Land in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Rintoul, Stuart (30 April 2011). [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/novel-revives-debate-over-vile-melbourne-founder/story-e6frg6nf-1226047239116 "Novel revives debate over 'vile' Melbourne founder"], ''[[The Australian]]''. Retrieved 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The debut novels of [[Cate Kennedy]] (''The World Beneath'', 2009) and Favel Parrett (''[[Past The Shallows]]'', 2011) have also been aligned with Tasmanian Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Rachel (20 June 2011).

[[Roger Scholes]]' 1988 film ''[[The Tale of Ruby Rose]]'' is about a young woman's fear of darkness in the Tasmanian highlands. Tasmanian sculptor [[Gay Hawkes]] created a series of wooden sculptures based on the film, citing Tasmanian Gothic's "synthesis of the present and past" as an inspiration. [[National Gallery of Victoria]] director Patrick McCaughey called her work the "visual embodiment of the fatal shore".&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, Anna (19 October 1989). "Inspired by a fatal shore". ''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Leigh]]'s 1999 novel ''[[The Hunter (1999 novel)|The Hunter]]'' is about a lone man's search for the last [[Tasmanian tiger]]. Described as being in the "best tradition of Tasmanian gothic",&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/June99/pee.html Review of ''The Hunter'' by Andrew Peek] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050516214439/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/June99/pee.html |date=16 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the novel won the 2000 [[Kathleen Mitchell Award]], and was adapted into a [[The Hunter (2011 Australian film)|2011 film of the same name]]. The story of Alexander Pearce was made into two feature films: ''[[The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce]]'' (2008) and ''[[Van Diemen's Land (film)|Van Diemen's Land]]'' (2009). The 2008 horror film ''[[Dying Breed (film)|Dying Breed]]'' is about Pearce's fictional descendants in the backwoods of Tasmania.

In 2011, Tasmanian art collector [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] opened the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) in Hobart, the Southern Hemisphere's largest privately-owned museum. The popularity of MONA — with its theme of "sex and death" — and the wider Tasmanian Gothic movement, has led Tasmanian tourism operators to promote the state's "dark, eerie, cold and bracing history and climate".&lt;ref name="tas"&gt;Fitzgibbon, Rebecca (29 August 2012). [http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/08/29/357041_opinion.html "Time to embrace our dark side"], ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]''. Retrieved 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 television series ''[[The Kettering Incident]]'', which won an award at the [[:fr:Festival Séries Mania|''Séries Mania'']] festival (French language Wikipedia) in [[Paris]], is also regarded as an example of Tasmanian Gothic.

Further examples include ''[[The Outlaw Michael Howe]]'' and ''[[The Nightingale (2018 film)|The Nightingale]]''.

'''Telstar 14R''', also known as '''Estrela do Sul 2''' ('''Southern Star 2''') is a commercial [[communications satellite]] in the [[Telstar]] series built by [[Space Systems/Loral]] for [[Telesat]] to provide Ku-band communications to [[South America]] and the Southern United States. It is a replacement for [[Telstar 14]], whose north [[solar array]] failed to open after launch, limiting its mission effectiveness. Telstar 14R experienced the same problem, with its north solar array failing to open too, but is now in service despite that failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/110525-stuck-array-telesat-samerica-push.html|title=Balky Satellite Solar Panel Threatens Telesat’s Growth Plans in S. America|first=Peter B.|last=de Selding|publisher=Space News|accessdate=2 June 2012|date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
It was launched 20 May 2011 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] aboard an [[International Launch Services]] [[Proton-M]] [[rocket]]. Telstar 14R is built around the [[Loral 1300]] [[satellite bus]], and has a launch mass of around 5000&amp;nbsp;kg. It is positioned in [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 63 degrees west.

==Music video==

The [[music video]] for this single was fully directed by [[Paul Isola]]. It was filmed at three different locations along the southern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. These included [[Rio Tinto (river)|Río Tinto]] in [[Huelva]], [[Tarifa]] in [[Cádiz]] (both in [[Spain]]) and finally [[Europa Point]] in [[Gibraltar]]. [[Tinto river|Río Tinto]] is a river which carries blood red waters due to its high mineral content, which provided the video with striking visuals. The famous sand dunes of [[Tarifa]] provides the video with a desert-like background, giving it a sense of scorching heat which is felt throughout the video. The [[Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque]] at [[Europa Point]] in [[Gibraltar]] can be clearly seen in the background as the band is seen playing their music and displaying a [[flag of Gibraltar]] as they do on stage at their [[concert]]s. This location holds a special meaning to the band as it is a place where they would hang out for hours during their teenage years.

'''USA-54''', also known as '''GPS II-7''' and '''GPS SVN-20''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the seventh of nine [[GPS Block II|Block II]] GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to fly.

USA-54 was launched at 02:45:01 UTC on 26 March 1990, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D193, flying in the 6925 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-54 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2.htm|title=GPS-2 (Navstar-2)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1990, USA-54 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20089|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20268|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.84 minutes, and 55 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a mass of {{convert|840|kg}}, and generated 710 watts of power.&lt;ref name="NSSDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1990-025A|title=Navstar 2-07|publisher=US National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; however following problems with the satellite switching between timing standards, the satellite was declared unusable on 21 May 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was decommissioned on 13 December.
