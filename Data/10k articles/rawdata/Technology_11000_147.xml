      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6687">The '''Bellman pseudospectral method''' is a [[pseudospectral method]] for [[optimal control]] based on [[Bellman equation|Bellman's principle of optimality]]. It is part of the larger theory of [[pseudospectral optimal control]], a term coined by [[I. Michael Ross|Ross]].&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Karpenko | first2 = M. | year = 2012 | title = A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578812000375 | journal = Annual Reviews in Control | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The method is named after [[Richard E. Bellman]].  It was introduced by [[I. Michael Ross|Ross]] et al.&lt;ref name="Ross1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Gong | first2 = Q. | last3 = Sekhavat | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Low-Thrust, High-Accuracy Trajectory Optimization | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 921–933 | doi=10.2514/1.23181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross2"&gt;I. M. Ross, Q. Gong and P. Sekhavat, The Bellman pseudospectral method, AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference and Exhibit, Honolulu, Hawaii, AIAA-2008-6448, August 18–21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
first as a means to solve multiscale optimal control problems, and later expanded to obtain suboptimal solutions for general optimal control problems.

==Theoretical foundations==
The multiscale version of the Bellman pseudospectral method is based on the spectral convergence property of the [[Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method]]s. That is, because the Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method converges at an exponentially fast rate, pointwise convergence to a solution is obtained at very low number of nodes even when the solution has high-frequency components.  This [[aliasing]] phenomenon in optimal control was first discovered by Ross et al.&lt;ref name = "Ross1" /&gt;  Rather than use signal processing techniques to anti-alias the solution, Ross et al. proposed that Bellman's principle of optimality can be applied to the converged solution to extract information between the nodes.  Because the Gauss–Lobatto nodes cluster at the boundary points, Ross et al. suggested that if the node density around the initial conditions satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]], then the complete solution can be recovered by solving the optimal control problem in a recursive fashion over piecewise segments known as Bellman segments.&lt;ref name="Ross1" /&gt;

In an expanded version of the method, Ross et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ross2" /&gt; proposed that method could also be used to generate feasible solutions that were not necessarily optimal.  In this version, one can apply the Bellman pseudospectral method at even lower number of nodes even under the knowledge that the solution may not have converged to the optimal one.  In this situation, one obtains a feasible solution.

A remarkable feature of the Bellman pseudospectral method is that it automatically determines several measures of suboptimality based on the original pseudospectral cost and the cost generated by the sum of the Bellman segments.&lt;ref name="Ross1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross2" /&gt;

==Computational efficiency==
One of the computational advantages of the Bellman pseudospectral method is that it allows one to escape Gaussian rules in the distribution of node points.  That is, in a standard pseudospectral method, the distribution of node points are Gaussian (typically Gauss-Lobatto for finite horizon and Gauss-Radau for infinite horizon).  The Gaussian points are sparse in the middle of the interval (middle is defined in a shifted sense for infinite-horizon problems) and dense at the boundaries. The second-order accumulation of points near the boundaries have the effect of wasting nodes.  The Bellman pseudospectral method takes advantage of the node accumulation at the initial point to anti-alias the solution and discards the remainder of the nodes.  Thus the final distribution of nodes is non-Gaussian and dense while the computational method retains a sparse structure.

==Applications==
The Bellman pseudospectral method was first applied by Ross et al.&lt;ref name="Ross1" /&gt; to solve the challenging problem of very low thrust trajectory optimization.  It has been successfully applied to solve a practical problem of generating very high accuracy solutions to a trans-Earth-injection problem of bringing a space capsule from a lunar orbit to a pin-pointed Earth-interface condition for successful reentry.&lt;ref name="Yan1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = H. | last2 = Gong | first2 = Q. | last3 = Park | first3 = C. | last4 = Ross | first4 = I. M. | last5 = D'Souza | first5 = C. N. | year = 2011 | title = High Accuracy Trajectory Optimization for a Trans-Earth Lunar Mission | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 1219–1227 | doi=10.2514/1.49237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Yan2"&gt;H. Yan, Q. Gong, C. D. Park, I. M. Ross and C. N. D'Souza, High-Accuracy Moon to Earth trajectory optimization, AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bellman pseudospectral method is most commonly used as an additional check on the optimality of a pseudospectral solution generated by the Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral methods.  That is, in addition to the use of [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]] in conjunction with the solutions obtained by the Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral methods, the Bellman pseudospectral method is used as a primal-only test on the optimality of the computed solution.&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleming | first1 = A. | last2 = Sekhavat | first2 = P. | last3 = Ross | first3 = I.

The '''Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|d}}), often referred to as the '''Broad Institute''', is a biomedical and [[genomic]] research center located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The institute is independently governed and supported as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Report for BROAD INSTITUTE INC.|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/26-3428781/broad-institute.aspx|website=GuideStar.org|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute-MIT &amp; Harvard|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmn4bcl/broad-institute-mit-harvard|publisher=Manta Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is partners with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], and the five Harvard [[teaching hospitals]].

== History ==

The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Broad Institute created: Links Harvard, M.I.T., and others in interdisciplinary initiative in genomics and medicine
|url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/07.17/11-broad.html

|date = 2003-07-17
|accessdate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of [[Whitehead Institute]] at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the [[Human Genome Project]]. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002–2003 among philanthropists [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edythe Broad]], MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]).

The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Facilities ==

The Broad Institute's facilities at 320 Charles Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], house one of the largest genome [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] centers in the world. As [[WICGR]] (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the [[Human Genome Project]].

In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broad.mit.edu/info/visiting.html|title=Contact - Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seven-story {{convert|231000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Pearle|title=Broad plans extension in Cambridge Center|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N9/broad.html|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square-foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge’s [[Kendall Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute celebrates opening of new building|url=https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/5748|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new facility has 15 floors, 11 of which are occupied, and has [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] gold certification. As of July 2014, it has around 800 occupants.

==Funding==
Between 2009 and 2012, the operating revenue of the institute was approximately $200 million, with 55% of that coming from federal grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute Annual Report 2012|url=https://www.broadinstitute.org/files/news/media-kit/2012_broad_institute_ar.pdf|publisher=Broad Institute|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broad Foundation (Eli and Edythe Broad) has provided $700 million in funding to the Broad Institute as of February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHILANTHROPY 50 - No. 15: Eli and Edythe Broad|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/No-15-EliEdythe-Broad/144457/|publisher=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9131">[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] System '''I''' is an analog broadcast [[television]] system. It was first used in the [[Republic of Ireland]] starting in 1962 as the [[625-line]] broadcasting standard to be used on [[VHF]] [[Band I]] and [[Band III]], sharing Band III with [[405-line]] [[CCIR System A|System A]] signals radiated in the north of the country. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] started its own [[625-line]] television service in 1964 also using System I, but on [[UHF]] only - the UK has never used VHF for 625-line television except for some cable relay distribution systems.

Since then, System I has been adopted for use by [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Africa]]. The Republic of Ireland has (slowly) extended its use of System I onto the UHF bands.

As of late 2012, analog television is no longer transmitted in either the UK or the Republic of Ireland. South Africa expects to discontinue System I in 2013, and Hong Kong by 2020.

== Specifications ==

Some of the important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System I (VHF and UHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System I (VHF and UHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the audio and video carriers is 5.9996 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The total '''RF bandwidth''' of System I (as originally designed with its single FM audio subcarrier) was about 7.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, allowing System I signals to be transmitted in 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels with an ample 600&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zone between channels.

In specs, sometimes, other parameters such as vestigial sideband characteristics and gamma of display device are also given.

=== Colour TV ===
System '''I''' has only been used with the [[PAL]] colour systems, but it would have been technically possible to use [[SECAM]] or a 625-line variant of the [[NTSC]] color system. However, apart from possible technical tests in the 1960s, this has never been done officially.

When used with PAL, the colour subcarrier is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz and the sidebands of the PAL signal have to be truncated on the high-frequency side at +1.066&amp;nbsp;MHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz). On the low-frequency side, the full 1.3&amp;nbsp;MHz sideband width is radiated. ( This behaviour would cause some U/V crosstalk in the NTSC system, but delay-line PAL hides such artefacts. )

Additionally, in order to minimise beat-patterns between the chrominance subcarrier and the sound subcarrier, when PAL is used with System I, the sound subcarrier is moved slightly off the originally-specified 6.0&amp;nbsp;MHz to 5.9996&amp;nbsp;MHz. This is such a slight frequency shift that no alterations needed to be made to existing System I television sets when the change was made.

No colour encoding system has any effect on the bandwidth of system '''I''' as a whole.

=== Improved Audio===
Enhancements have been made to the specification of System '''I''''s audio capabilities over the years. Starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s it became possible to add a digital signal carrying [[NICAM]] sound. This extension to audio capability has completely eaten the guard band between channels, indeed there would be a small amount of analogue-digital crosstalk between the NICAM signal of a transmitter on channel N and the vestigial sideband of a transmission on channel N+1. Good channel planning means that under normal situations no ill effects are seen or heard.

The NICAM system used with System I adds a 700&amp;nbsp;kHz wide digital signal, and needs to be placed at least 552&amp;nbsp;kHz from the audio subcarrier.

† Officially these channels "don't exist", being between UHF [[Band IV]] and [[Band V]] and were supposed to be reserved for radio astronomy. However, from 1997 until the finish of analog TV in the UK in 2012, the UK used channels 35 through 37 for analog broadcasts of [[Five (TV channel)|Channel 5]].

The '''cap torque tester''' is used in the packaging industry to measure the opening or closuring torque of the screwing cap. It is a specific quality control equipment that can be placed on the production line or into the laboratory.

==Packaging development==
A [[torque tester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at2e.com/category/cap-torque-testers/ |title=Torque Tester &amp;#124; Manual or Automatic |publisher=AT2E |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is required during the packaging design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goarticles.com/article/Why-to-Use-a-Torque-Meter-in-Packaging-Industry/6993548/ |title=Why to Use a Torque Meter in Packaging Industry? - Technology |publisher=Goarticles.com |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-10-20 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be used as a destructive tester to identify if there is any material weakness of the packaging during the screwing process. It also allows to define the torque tolerances of the capping machine. The lower [[torque]] limit is considered as the minimum pressure of the cap to avoid any leak of the product. This torque test needs to be combined with a leak test with secure seal analyzer. The higher torque limit is the maximum torque the customer can apply to open or close the product's cap.

==Production line control==
Once torque tolerances have been defined, the cap torque tester is used as a torque control device on the final product. If the measurement are out of the limits, the capping machine needs to be adjusted. Depending on the production process, it could be necessary to control the opening torque, 24hours after the packaging process. Temperature variations can modify product characteristic with a result of different torque measurement.

'''Capaware''' is a 3D general purpose virtual worlds viewer. It is a free software project which began in 2007, released for the purpose of promoting the development of [[free software]] in the Canary Islands by its Government. Capaware allows interaction with 3D virtual terrain [[map]]ping, and is distributed under license [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. It provides access to information that fits the specifications of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]. 

It was developed in [[C++| C++ programming language]]. At present it works under [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. Capaware uses OpenSceneGraph as graphics engine, achieving extremely{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} high frames per second rates. Capaware's architecture has a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] interface allowing new plugins.

==Plugins==

At present there is only a half-developed plugin as an example of the potential of Capaware:

'''''Carex nebrascensis''''' is a species of [[Carex|sedge]] known as '''Nebraska sedge'''.

==Distribution==
This sedge is native to the central and [[Western United States]] and north into central Canada. It grows in [[wetland]]s at various elevations, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Mojave Desert]] [[sky island]]s. ''Carex nebrascensis'' tolerates [[alkali soil|alkaline soils]] and submersion for long periods of time.

==Description==
''Carex nebrascensis'' produces upright, angled, spongy stems up to about 90 centimeters tall. The waxy, bluish leaves form tufts around the base of each stem. The root system is a very dense network of [[rhizome]]s. The [[inflorescence]] includes a few narrow [[stamen|staminate]] spikes above some wider [[gynoecium|pistillate]] spikes on short [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]]. The fruit is covered in a tough, slightly inflated sac called a perigynium which sometimes has a pattern of red spotting.

==Uses==
Uses for this sedge, ''Carex nebrascensis'', include: 
*[[Forage]] for livestock and [[wildlife]]
*[[Ornamental grass]] ("grasslike") plant in [[Natural landscaping|natural]], [[California native plants|native plant]], and [[habitat garden]]s
*[[Erosion control]] and [[soil compaction]] remediation.
*[[Restoration ecology]]
**[[Riparian zone restoration]] 
**[[Stream restoration]]
**[[Wetland]] restoration   
*[[Phytoremediation]] in natural and [[constructed wetland]]s for [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] by [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov/pubs/idpmcfscane2.pdf Wetland Plant Fact Sheet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321045924/http://plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov/pubs/idpmcfscane2.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">A '''colloid mill''' is a machine that is used to reduce the particle size of a [[solid]] in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in a [[liquid]], or to reduce the droplet size of a liquid suspended in another liquid.  Colloid mills work on the rotor-stator principle: a rotor turns at high speeds (2000 - 18000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;).  The resulting high levels of [[hydraulic]] [[stress (physics)|shear]] applied to the process liquid disrupt structures in the fluid. Colloid mills are frequently used to increase the stability of suspensions and [[emulsion]]s, but can also be used to reduce the particle size of solids in suspensions&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;. Higher shear rates lead to smaller droplets, down to approximately 1 [[micrometre|µm]]&lt;ref name=FoodEmul /&gt; which are more resistant to emulsion separation.

Colloid mills are used in the following industries:
* Pharmaceutical&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;
* Cosmetic&lt;ref name=cosmetic /&gt; 
* Paint
* Soap
* Textile
* Paper
* Food&lt;ref name=FoodEmul /&gt;

A '''concrete step barrier''' is a [[safety barrier]] used on the [[central reservation]] of [[motorways]] and [[dual carriageways]] as an alternative to the standard steel [[crash barrier]].

The barrier has contained all vehicles up to {{convert|13.5|tonnes}}.&lt;ref name=ian60&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[Highways Agency]] | title= Interim Advice Note 60/05 | date= 20 January 2005 | url= http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/ians/pdfs/ian60.pdf |format= PDF | accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M8 cashel cutting.jpg|thumb|upright|The concrete step barrier in the under construction M8 motorway in Ireland (August 2008)]]
With effect from January 2005 and based primarily on safety grounds, the UK [[Highways Agency]] policy is that all new motorway schemes are to use high-containment concrete barriers in the central reserve. All existing motorways will introduce concrete barriers into the central reserve as part of ongoing upgrades and through replacement when these systems have reached the end of their useful life. This change of policy applies only to barriers in the central reserve of high-speed roads and not to verge-side barriers. Other routes will continue to use steel barriers.&lt;ref name=ian60/&gt; Government policy ensures that all future crash barriers in the UK will be made of concrete unless there are overriding circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051108/text/51108w02.htm | publisher= [[Hansard]] | title= Written Answers to Questions | date= 8 November 2005 | accessdate= 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
The usage of the concrete step barrier has become widespread in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. As of 2017, {{convert|530|km|mi}} of motorways use this barrier. Some motorways such as parts of the [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8]] and [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]] have had the crash barrier since their original construction. Other motorways had it installed as part of their upgrade (M50).

[[File:ASR cracks concrete step barrier FHWA 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Typical crack pattern associated with the [[Alkali Silica Reaction|alkali-silica reaction]] affecting a [[Jersey barrier]] on a US highway]]

Various types of [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] may undergo chemical reactions in concrete, leading to damaging expansive phenomena. The most common are those containing reactive silica, that can react with the alkalis in concrete. Amorphous silica is one of the most reactive mineral components in some aggregates containing e.g., [[opal]], [[chalcedony]], [[flint]]. Following the [[Alkali Silica Reaction|alkali-silica reaction]] (ASR), an expansive gel can form, that creates extensive cracks and damage on structural members.

[[File:Chaco Canyon ruins.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Core-and-veneer walls at Chaco Canyon]]
'''Core-and-veneer''', '''brick and rubble''', '''wall and rubble''', '''ashlar and rubble''', and '''emplekton''' all refer to a building technique where two parallel walls are constructed and the core between them is filled with [[rubble]] or other infill, creating one thick wall.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Vitruvius|authorlink=Vitruvius|chapter=II.8.7|title=[[De architectura]] (On Architecture)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, and in later poorly constructed walls, the rubble was not consolidated. Later, mortar and cement were used to consolidate the core rubble and produce studier construction.

Modern [[masonry]] still uses core and veneer walls; however, the core is now generally concrete block instead of rubble, and moisture barriers are included.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Weber, Richard A.|date=19 February 2013|title=Building Envelope Design Guide&amp;nbsp;– Masonry Wall Systems|work=Whole Building Design Guide|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences|url=http://www.wbdg.org/design/env_wall_masonry.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314154143/http://wbdg.org/design/env_wall_masonry.php|archivedate=14 March 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often such walls end up as [[cavity walls]] by the inclusion of space between the external veneer and the core in order to provide for moisture and thermal control.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt;

==History==

===Greeks and Phoenicians===
Both the early Phoenicians and Greeks used rubble-filled masory walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sharon, Ilan|year=1987|title=Phoenician and Greek Ashlar Construction Techniques at Tel Dor, Israel|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|pages=21–42|jstor=1356965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Monuments and Archaeological Sites (Lesvos, Greece)|year=2011|url=http://www.petrifiedforest.gr/NEW%20pf/application/MONUMENTS%20&amp;%20ARCHAEOLOGICAL%20SITES.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004923/http://www.petrifiedforest.gr/NEW%20pf/application/MONUMENTS%20%26%20ARCHAEOLOGICAL%20SITES.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''emplekton'' was borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἔμπλεκτον and originally meant "rubble" but came to apply to the construction technique as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schofield, Richard V.|year=2009|chapter=Glossary: emplekton|title=On architecture by Vitruvius|location=London|publisher=Penguin|pages=171–172|isbn=978-0-14-144168-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romans===
The Romans started with basic emplekton masonry walls,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennis, George|authorlink=George Dennis (explorer)|year=1848|chapter=Emplecton masonry|title=The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/_Periods/Roman/Archaic/Etruscan/_Texts/DENETR*/4.html#App.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but developed the technique one step further using temporary walls (forms), that were removed after the cemented rubble (concrete) had cured.  This Roman technique was called ''[[opus caementicium]]'', and eventually led to modern [[ferroconcrete]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Caviasca, Massimiliano|year=2008|title=L'evoluzione della tipologia e la materia costruttiva: il muro a emplecton|language=Italian|publisher=Politecnico di Milano ([[Polytechnic University of Milan]])|url=http://docenti.polimi.it/caviasca/caviasca/lez4.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502020531/http://docenti.polimi.it/caviasca/caviasca/lez4.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings of the [[Taj Mahal]] are constructed with walls of brick and rubble inner cores faced with either marble or sandstone locked together with iron [[dowel]]s and clamps. Some of the walls of the mausoleum are several metres thick.{{Cite book| last = Koch | first = Ebba |year=2006| title = The Complete Taj Mahal: And the Riverfront Gardens of Agra|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson| location = London| page = 97| isbn = 978-0-500-34209-1}}

In the large complexes at [[Chaco Canyon]], the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] used the wall and rubble technique, with walls of carefully shaped sandstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Reed, Paul F.|year=2008|title=An Overview of the Archaeology of Chaco Canyon|editor1=McManamon, Francis |editor2=Cordell, Lind |editor3=Lightfoot, Kent |editor4=Milner, George |encyclopedia=Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia|volume=3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=arfWRW5OFVgC&amp;pg=RA2-PA72 72]|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-33187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancestral Puebloans used mud as their mortar, both with the veneer and to consolidate the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Masonry of the Southwest|publisher=United States National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/chcu/slideshow/masonry/masonintro.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619180608/http://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/chcu/slideshow/masonry/masonintro.html|archivedate=19 June 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This core and veneer technique was also used at other Ancestral Puebloans sites outside of Chaco Canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Cameron, Catherine|title=The Bluff Great House and the Chaco Phenomenon|publisher=Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society|url=http://www.az-arch-and-hist.org/2010/09/catherine-cameron-the-bluff-great-house-and-the-chaco-phenomenon/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501230413/http://www.az-arch-and-hist.org/2010/09/catherine-cameron-the-bluff-great-house-and-the-chaco-phenomenon/|archivedate=1 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later pueblos used mud bricks (adobe) for the veneer.

===Mayan===
In the [[Puuc|Puuc region]], and as far south as at least [[Tikal]], the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] developed core-and-veneer walls to the point where, by the classic period, they were filled with concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Yant, Anna Catesby|year=2011|title=Powerful buildings: The evolution of non-domestic architecture and social interaction in the Puuc|series=Dissertations|publisher=Vanderbilt University|page=133|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03222011-144930/unrestricted/YantDissertation2011.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501231157/http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03222011-144930/unrestricted/YantDissertation2011.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Andrews, George F.|year=2012|title=Architectural survey Tikal, Guatemala: the great temples|url=http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/15343/txu-aaa-gfa00352.txt?sequence=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501231606/http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/15343/txu-aaa-gfa00352.txt?sequence=3|archivedate=1 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Andrews, George F.|year=1999|title=Pyramids, Palaces, Monsters and Masks: The Golden Age of Maya Architecture, Volume 1, Architecture of the Puuc region and the northern plains areas|publisher=Labyrinthos Press|location=Lancaster, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Traditional core-and-veneer walls suffered from moisture migration and thermal expansion and contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Martinez, M.  |author2=Carro, G.|year=2007|title=Ancient building requirements and the evaluation of different lime-cement mortars compositions|work=2º Congresso Nacional de Argamassas de Construção|publisher=Associação Portuguesa dos Fabricantes de Argamassas de Construção|location=Lisbon|url=http://www.apfac.pt/congresso2007/comunicacoes/Paper%2081_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a low tensile strength, hence a poor resistance to twisting or stretching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Valcárcel, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4258">'''Corn gluten meal''' ('''CGM''') is the principal protein of corn ([[maize]]) [[endosperm]] consisting mainly of [[zein]] and [[glutelin]].&lt;ref name="21CFR184.1321"&gt; {{CodeFedReg|21|184|1321}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a byproduct of corn processing that has historically been used as an animal feed. Despite the name, "corn gluten" does not contain true [[gluten]], which is formed by the interaction of gliadin and glutenin proteins.

== Uses ==

=== Herbicide ===

In 1985, Dr. Nick Christians of [[Iowa State University]] discovered that CGM displayed pre-emergent [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] effects during a series of [[turf grass]] experiments.&lt;ref name="IAS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.iastate.edu/gluten/ |title=Corn Gluten Meal Research Page | publisher=Iowa State University of Science and Technology | accessdate=2008-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711074738/http://www.hort.iastate.edu/gluten/ |archive-date=2008-07-11 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of corn gluten meal as an herbicide was patented in 1991,&lt;ref name ="IAS1"/&gt; but, like many food-related substances used for gardening, is not regulated in the US.&lt;ref name="EPA_Exempt"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/1996/March/Day-06/pr-577.html | title=Exemption of Certain Pesticide Substances From Federal  Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Requirements | author=Environmental Protection Agency | journal=Federal Register | volume=61 | issue = 45 | pages=8876–8879 | date=1996-03-06  |accessdate=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CGM targets a range of plants including small-seeded annual and perennial herbs. It is most frequently used in lawns,&lt;ref name ="EPAFS"/&gt; but may be applied to gardens and fields as well. Large-seeded weeds seem unaffected.

The corn gluten meal breaks down over time as an organic nitrogen source ([[NPK rating]] of 10-0-0).&lt;ref name="uwisc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wihort.uwex.edu/turf/CornGluten.htm |title=Turf:Corn Gluten Meal |accessdate= 2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proteins in CGM inhibit root formation on newly germinated seeds, killing the plant. Applications must be timed so that the CGM is present and effective as seeds are germinating.

Subsequent research has not been conclusive regarding the effectiveness of corn gluten as a preemergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardozo|first1=Anna|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74113.html |title=Weed Management in Lawns Guidelines--UC IPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Application ====

CGM is applied using a spreader or even by hand: the material is essentially harmless if not inhaled, and is, in fact, edible (though not particularly palatable).  On lawns, CGM is applied in early spring (usually timed phenologically by the blooming of [[crocus]] or [[forsythia]]), and again in the autumn. If the lawn is overseeded, CGM should either be applied at least six weeks before sowing, or two weeks afterwards.

==== Precautions ====
Though very safe to use and nontoxic,&lt;ref name = "EPAFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_100137.htm |title= EPA Fact Sheet |accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; CGM should not be applied to areas where it is likely to wash directly into watersheds (it is a nitrogen source). Otherwise it is ecologically safe.

=== Animal feed ===

CGM is used as an inexpensive protein source for [[pet food]]s. CGM is an especially good source of the amino acid cysteine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalcanin.us/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=72,66,63,17,1,Documents&amp;MediaID=1303&amp;Filename=Corn_in_Pet_Food.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127075611/http://royalcanin.us/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=72%2C66%2C63%2C17%2C1%2CDocuments&amp;MediaID=1303&amp;Filename=Corn_in_Pet_Food.pdf |date=2010-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but must be balanced with other proteins for lysine. 

It is commonly used as livestock feed, including poultry and fish. It is a good source of protein, energy and pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Sauvant D., Renaudeau D., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2015. Corn gluten meal.

'''Corvida Raven''' is a writer, technological artist, entrepreneur and public speaker who lives and works out of [[New York City]], New York. She has been garnering national attention since the age of 19 for her blog, shegeeks.net, and other projects aimed at making technological skills and information accessible to the public at large, and particularly to youth, people of colour, women and marginalized communities.&lt;ref name="Hello Beautiful"&gt;{{cite journal|title=25 Women To Know: Corvida Raven|journal=Hello Beautiful|url=http://hellobeautiful.com/2011/03/30/25-women-to-know-corvida-raven//|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the grio"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Keosha|title=TheGrio's 100: Corvida Raven, self-proclaimed 'Oprah of the web'|journal=the grio|date=30 January 2012|url=http://thegrio.com/2012/01/30/2012-corvida-raven/|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Raised in [[Miami]], Florida, Raven began blogging in eighth grade. She majored in Computer Science at [[Hampton University]] while working at Blockbuster before taking a sabbatical and moving to [[Atlanta]], Georgia. Her trademark plain-language approach to blogging about tech is informed by her experiences teaching family members how to resolve computer problems.&lt;ref name="In Her Shoes Blog"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fly Female Entrepreneur: Corvida Raven|journal=In Her Shoes|date= 24 January 2012 |url=http://www.inhershoesblog.com/fly-female-entrepreneur-corvida-raven/|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the challenges of being a black woman in a largely male dominated field, Raven has said: 
“I do my best to let my passion [for working] with new technology speak for me. I also make a point of highlighting and recommending other women — black, white, Latina and Asian — within my network, because the change starts with me. Sometimes you have to expose others to the things you’re already exposed to. That’s what helps you become successful in an office, boardroom and on the Web.”&lt;ref name="Rolling Out"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corvida Raven Founder, SheGeeks.net|journal=Rolling Out|date= 4 March 2012 |url=http://rollingout.com/2012/03/04/corvida-raven-founder-shegeeks-net/|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Raven’s blog, shegeeks.net, is her main platform for educating others about navigating social media, the internet and technological devices. Since founding the site in 2008, Raven has worked as a social media advisor for [[Intel]] and for General Motors' ChevyVolt Unplugged Tour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7645">{{commons category|Engines by cylinder layout}}
'''Engine configuration''' is an [[engineering]] term for the layout of the major components of a [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston]] [[internal combustion engine]].  These components are the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s and [[crankshaft]]s in particular but also, sometimes, the [[camshaft]](s).

Many apparently 'standard' names for configurations are historic, arbitrary, or overlapping.  For example, the [[flat engine|180° V engine]] is so named because the [[crankshaft]] is related to a V engine more closely than it is related to other [[opposed-piston engine]]s such as the boxer. Others would consider it a [[flat engine]] because of its shape.

The names ''[[W engine]]'' and ''[[rotary engine (disambiguation)|rotary engine]]'' have each been used for several unconnected designs.  The ''[[Flat-4|H-4]]'' and ''[[Flat-6|H-6]]'' engines produced by [[Subaru]] are not [[H engine]]s at all, but [[boxer engine]]s.  The Subaru H-4 and H-6 designs are so named because they are horizontally opposed pistons.

==Categorisation by piston motion==
{{See also|Multi-cylinder engine}}
Engine types include:
* [[Single-cylinder engine]]s
* [[Inline engine (aviation)|Inline engine]] designs:
** [[Straight engine]], with all of the cylinders placed in a single row
*** [[U engine]], two separate straight engines with crankshafts linked by a central gear.
**** The '''square four''' is a U engine where the two straight engines have two cylinders each.
** [[V engine]], with two banks of cylinders at an angle, most commonly 60 or 90 degrees.
** [[Flat engine]], two banks of cylinders directly opposite each other on either side of the crankshaft.
*** [[H engine]], two separate flat engines with crankshafts linked by a central gear.
** [[W engine]]. Combination of V and straight, giving 3 banks, or two V's intertwined giving 4 banks.
** [[Opposed piston engine]], with multiple crankshafts, an example being:
*** [[Delta engine]]s, with three banks of cylinders and three crankshafts
** [[X engine]].
* [[Radial engine|Radial]] designs, including most:
** [[Rotary engine]] designs. Almost only seen on World War I aircraft.
* [[Pistonless rotary engine]]s, notably:
** [[Wankel engine]].

The standard names for some configurations are historic, arbitrary, or both, with some overlap. For example, the cylinder banks of a [[flat engine|180° V engine]] do not in any way form a V, but it is regarded as a V engine because of its [[crankshaft]] and [[big end]] configuration, which result in performance characteristics similar to a V engine. But it is also considered a [[flat engine]] because of its shape. On the other hand, some engines which have none of the typical V engine crankshaft design features and consequent performance characteristics are also regarded as V engines, purely because of their shape. Similarly, the [[Volkswagen Group]] [[VR6 engine]] is a hybrid of the [[V engine]] and the [[straight engine]], and can not be definitively labeled as either.

==Other categorizations==

===By valve placement===
The majority of four stroke engines have [[poppet valve]]s, although some aircraft engines have [[sleeve valve]]s.  Valves may be located in the cylinder block ([[side valve]]s), or in the cylinder head ([[overhead valve]]s).  Modern engines are invariably of the latter design.  There may be two, three, four or five valves per cylinder, with the intake valves outnumbering the exhaust valves in case of an odd number.

===By camshaft placement===
Poppet valves are opened by means of a [[camshaft]] which revolves at half the crankshaft speed.  This can be either chain, gear or toothed belt driven from the crankshaft, and can be located in the crankcase (where it may serve one or more banks of cylinders) or in the cylinder head.

If the camshaft is located in the crankcase, a valve train of [[pushrods]] and [[rocker arm]]s will be required to operate overhead valves.  Mechanically simpler are [[side valve]]s, where the valve stems rested directly on the camshaft  However, this gives poor gas flows within the cylinder head as well as heat problems and fell out of favor for automobile use, see ''[[flathead engine]]''.

The majority of modern automobile engines place the camshaft on the cylinder head in an [[overhead camshaft]] (OHC) design.  There may be one or two camshafts in the cylinder head; a single camshaft design is called [[overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC).  A design with two camshafts per cylinder head is called [[overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] (DOHC).  Note that the camshafts are counted per cylinder head, so a V engine with one camshaft in each of its two-cylinder heads is still an SOHC design, and a V engine with two camshafts per cylinder head is DOHC, or informally a "quad cam" engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Camshaft Basics|url = http://www.oregoncamshaft.com/cam-basics.html|website = www.oregoncamshaft.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OHV, OHC, SOHC and DOHC (twin cam) engine  - Automotive illustrated glossary|url = http://www.samarins.com/glossary/dohc.html|website = Samarins.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With overhead camshafts, the [[valvetrain]] will be shorter and lighter, as no pushrods are required.  Some overhead camshaft designs still have [[rocker arm]]s; this facilitates adjustment of mechanical clearances.

A four valves per cylinder design usually has two valves for intake and two for exhaust, which requires two camshafts per cylinder bank. If there are two camshafts in the cylinder head, the cams can sometimes bear directly on cam followers on the valve stems (tappets).  The cam followers aid in noise reduction, dampened vibration, shock absorption and the carrying of axial load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Car Engines Work|url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/engine4.htm|website = HowStuffWorks|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cam Follower Bearings On Emerson Bearing|url = http://products.emersonbearing.com/category/cam-followers-yoke-rollers|website = products.emersonbearing.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter arrangement is the most inertia free, allows the most unimpeded gas flows in the engine and is the usual arrangement for high performance automobile engines.  It also permits the spark plug to be located in the center of the cylinder head, which promotes better combustion characteristics. Beyond a certain number of valves, the effective area covered ''decreases'', so four is the common-most number. Odd numbers of valves necessarily means the intake or exhaust side must have one valve more. In practice this is invariably the intake valves - even in even-numbered head designs, inlet valves are often larger in size than exhaust.

Very large engines (e.g. [[Marine propulsion|marine engine]]s) can have either extra camshafts or extra lobes on the camshaft to enable the engine to run in either direction. Furthermore, other manipulations of valves can be used for e.g. engine braking, such as in a [[Jake brake]].

A disadvantage of overhead cams is that a much longer chain (or belt) is needed to drive the cams than with a camshaft located in the cylinder block, usually a tensioner is also needed.  A break in the belt may destroy the engine if pistons touch open valves at [[top dead center]].

A '''film holder''' is a device that holds one or more pieces of [[photographic]] film, for insertion into a [[camera]] or optical scanning device such as a dedicated film scanner or a flatbed scanner with film scanning capabilities. The widest use of the term refers to a device that holds [[sheet film]] for use in [[large format]] cameras, but it can also refer to various interchangeable devices in [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] or even [[135 film]] camera systems.

== Sheet film holders ==
[[Image:holders.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Graflex 4×5 Sheet Film Holders.]]
The most common instance of film holder is the sheet film holder. Also referred to as a ''dark slide'' or ''double dark slide'', they are flat devices, slightly larger than the films they hold, which commonly hold one sheet of film on each side. The plate holder, which is a very similar device, holds [[Photographic plate|glass plates]] instead of sheet film. A dark slide, from which the device derives its alternate name, is simply a dark cover that slides into a recess in the holder to protect the film (or plate) from exposure to light. Many dark slides have differently colored bands or handles on each side, one usually light and the other dark, so the photographer can distinguish between exposed and unexposed film.

Traditionally, sheet film and glass plate holders have been made out of wood. Wooden holders, properly treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible warpage, many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new sheet film holders are now made out of plastic.

When using a sheet film holder, the device is inserted into the camera, often a [[view camera]], and the dark slide is withdrawn, making the film available for exposure. After the exposure has been made, the dark slide is reinserted into the film holder, and the device is removed from the camera for later processing of the exposed film.

=== Multi-sheet holders ===
[[Image:grafmatic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grafmatic "45" Film Holder.]]
Some film holders can hold more than two sheets. One of the most common is the Grafmatic, manufactured by [[Graflex]], which holds six sheets of film in individual septums. They were available in "23" and "45" models, corresponding to 6×9&amp;nbsp;cm (2¼×3¼ inches) and 4×5 inch sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graflex.org/speed-graphic/grafmatic/|title=Grafmatic Sheet Film Holder|website=Graflex.org|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes little effort to quickly cycle through all six sheets, which makes the Grafmatic ideal for [[press camera]] usage.  [[Burke &amp; James]] produced a similar device called the Kinematic, which holds 10 sheets, though was only available in 4×5 inch format.

Graflex also produced the Film Magazine. It is commonly referred to as a "bag magazine" (or "bag mag"), and uses a leather bag that hangs on the side of the frame to exchange the septums from front to back. It is a much more manual device than the Grafmatic, as exchanging a septum is done manually through the bag, rather than by a simple manipulation of the magazine's dark slide. They were sold in separate versions for film and glass plates, and held 12-18 sheets/plates, depending on the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graflex.org/old-helpboard/messages/4428.html|title=Re: Your film back|website=Graflex.org|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in 3×4, 4×5, and 5×7 inch formats.

Though all are superficially similar (a "bag mag" film (not plate) septum is the same thickness as a Grafmatic septum, but has slightly different width and length; a Kinematic septum appears almost identical to a Grafmatic septum but is in fact considerably thinner) in fact use of a septum from a different type of holder in any of these multi-sheet holders is very likely to jam the entire magazine and bend internal parts, which can then damage yet another holder if used with it. As replacement parts are no longer available one must be careful not to interchange pieces of different types of multi-sheet holders.

[[Fujifilm|Fuji]] created a 4×5 system in the late 1990s called QuickChange, which is somewhat similar to a Grafmatic in principle. It is made of plastic rather than metal, making it lighter, and less prone to bent septums, but also less durable. It can hold 8 shots, and inserts are purchased already loaded with film. Though not sold as such, these inserts can be reloaded a limited number of times with standard sheet film. Because, like Grafmatic or "bag mag" holders, the Fuji holders used sheet film of normal thickness, they offered higher image quality than the older "film packs" (see below), but never became widely popular before [[digital imaging]] brought much production of traditional large-format materials to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f32.net/Services/Equipment/Accessories/quickchange.html |title=f32 Large Format Equipment - Accessories - Fuji QuickChange |website=f32 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021104215709/http://www.f32.net/Services/Equipment/Accessories/quickchange.html |archive-date=4 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film pack holders ===
[[Graflex]] and [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] produced film pack holders that could be loaded in subdued light. Film packs were available from various film manufacturers in 12 and 16-sheet units. The classic film pack consisted of several "sheets" of film (actually much thinner than standard sheet film, as they were cut from large-format roll film, for economy and physical flexibility) taped together and wound in a series of S-bends around a metal frame. To "advance" the film, the user pulled a paper tab that protruded from the side of the film pack. The tab was attached—facing the opposite direction—to the junction of each sheet and its intervening section of tape. The thin film and only slight tension this system provided resulted in poor film flatness, and negatives are often sharp enough only for [[contact printing]]. They were primarily used by press photographers, and demand fell off dramatically as photojournalists converted to [[roll film]] cameras.

According to former Kodak employees at the [[Eastman House]] photographic museum, Kodak stopped producing film packs when the last employee trained to assemble them (which required working with the very sharp metal frame in total darkness) retired in the 1980s. This rendered all traditional film pack holders in the world obsolete at once. Polaroid film packs, though mechanically similar, are not (and never were) available in standard film sizes. The Fuji QuickChange system was sometimes referred to as a film pack system but, as noted above, was a mechanical multi-sheet holder.

=== Instant film holders ===
Polaroid produced the widest range of [[instant film|instant sheet and pack film]], but discontinued all production in 2008, leaving Fujifilm as the only producer of instant film and backs. The Polaroid 545, the lighter and more modern 545i, and the 545 Pro backs were 4&amp;times;5 inch instant sheet film holders that many photographers used. New55 Holdings, LLC started producing a black and white P/N film for the 545 and 545i backs. This new instant sheet film produces a black and white negative and a positive image. The older Polaroid 550 packfilm back can take Fuji FP-100C film (3.25x4.25 inches), which was the last product of this type and was discontinued in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fujifilm.jp/information/articlead_0384.html|title=インスタントカラーフィルム「FP-100C」販売終了のお知らせ : お知らせ - 富士フイルム|website=Fujifilm.jp|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polaroid also produced 8&amp;times;10 inch film holders and films. Polaroid produced 10-sheet 4&amp;times;5 inch instant film packs and holders.

===Preloaded systems===
Some 4&amp;times;5 inch films come in light-tight envelopes that can be loaded into a special holder in daylight. The envelopes are much smaller and lighter than a dark-slide loaded with film, so a photographer can carry a larger quantity of film than the same amount of film in dark-slides. [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] Quickload TM film and holders, and [[Kodak]] Readyload TM film and holders, are of this type. These have not been manufactured for several years, although old stock may sometimes be sold online. New55 Holdings, LLC has started producing a variety of Ready Loads called 1SHOT TM for the preloaded systems, these include Black and white negative, color negative and color slide films.

===Rollfilm holders===
Film holders that adapt rollfilm to sheet film cameras are usually called ''film backs''. Film backs for 4&amp;times;5 inch cameras are particularly common&amp;mdash;there is little point in taking 6&amp;times;9&amp;nbsp;cm pictures on a {{convert|20|x|25|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} camera.  [[Komamura Corporation|Horseman]], [[Linhof]], [[Graflex]], and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6&amp;times;7, 6&amp;times;8, 6&amp;times;9, 6&amp;times;12, and 6&amp;times;17&amp;nbsp;cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet film holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.

== Medium format film holders ==
Film holders are available as accessories for some [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[camera]]s. The most usual case is the ''[[Instant film|Polaroid]] back'' taking instant film, often used to check exposure values, color rendition, etc. before taking final photographs on conventional film.

Several of the types of holders made for large format film, including darkslide sheet holders, Grafmatic multi-sheet holders, the Graflex bag mag, and film packs were also manufactured in medium format sizes, almost always 2{{fraction|1|4}}"&amp;times;3{{fraction|1|4}}" (6&amp;times;9&amp;nbsp;cm). [[Press camera]] manufacturers often produced smaller versions of their 4&amp;times;5 cameras in this size, often called "23", and while later versions of these cameras could use rollfilm adaptors, these were not widely available until almost 1950, and were expensive in their first years of production.

Sheet film or glass plate holders for medium format rollfilm cameras can be found, but are of mainly historical interest. Some rollfilm cameras have interchangeable backs to accommodate different film types. Some [[135 film|35mm]] [[camera]]s have motorised backs that hold longer than normal film lengths, with a mechanism that automatically advances the film after each exposure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1475">The '''Flame Jet Drill''' is a type of [[drilling rig|drilling equipment]] whereby there is no contact with the drilling surface, therefore the drill never wears down.

The tool expels an ultra hot hydrogen flame (~4000 °C)&lt;ref name="ngc_deepdrill" /&gt; which causes small inconsistencies&lt;!--better name?--&gt; in the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] to [[fracture]] and fly away and thus "drill" surface.

Another prototype drill called a Hydro Jet Drill is able to work in hot damp conditions by [[Superheater|superheating]] [[water]] and spraying the rock with the fluid.

The devices were featured in a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary "MegaStructures: Deep Earth Drillers" about [[geothermal energy]]. &lt;ref name="ngc_deepdrill"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Channel Australia and New Zealand - Megastructures|url=http://natgeotv.com.au/Programmes/EpisodeGuide.aspx?Id=674}} 080712 natgeotv.com.au List of National Geographic MegaStructures series.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">The South African '''Food and Canning Workers' Union''' was established in 1941 by [[Rachel Simons]]. It was a founder member of the [[South African Congress of Trade Unions]]. 

It  spread through the fruit canning industry of the [[Boland, Western Cape]] and up the west coast among fishing communities.  Many of the members were women.

In 1945 it obtained a Wage Determination for the fish canning industry which improved wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About FAWU|url=http://www.fawu.org.za/index.php?include=about/main.html|website=Food and Allied Workers Union|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oscar Mpetha]] became the General Secretary in 1951.

In 1979 it organised a successful consumer boycott. At that time it had about 25000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiloh|first1=Margaret|last2=Sibeko|first2=Archie|title=A Fighting Union|date=2000|publisher=Ravan Press|location=Randburg|isbn=0869755277|page=73}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the members of the [[Federation of South African Trade Unions]] established in 1979.

In 1982 Dr Neil Aggett was the leader of the union, though unpaid.  He was detained on 27 November 1981 and died in detention.

It amalgamated with the [[Sweet, Food and Allied Workers' Union]] and the [[Retail and Allied Workers' Union]] to form the [[Food and Allied Workers Union]]

==History==
Genpact began in 1997 as a unit within [[General Electric]]. Its charter was to provide business process services to GE's businesses. During the eight years that followed, Genpact began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses.

In January 2008, Genpact became an independent company and began to serve clients outside of GE. The company name, Genpact, is designed to convey the business impact it generates for its clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. Since then the company has grown from 32,000 employees and revenue of US$823 million, to 77,000+ employees and revenues of US$2.57 billion (2016).

[[Bain Capital]] became the firm's largest shareholder in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genpact.com/about-us/our-history|title=Our History {{!}} About Us {{!}} Genpact|website=Genpact|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Genpact launched a joint venture with Indian company [[NDTV]] to offer outsourcing services for the media industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Genpact and NDTV in 2006. http://www.genpact.com/docs/pr/pr_-genpact_ndtv_032906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genpact Cora ==
In June 2017, Genpact unveiled Genpact Cora, an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI)-based platform for enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://financialit.net/news/infrastructure/genpact-launches-artificial-intelligence-based-platform-genpact-cora|title=Genpact Launches Artificial Intelligence-Based Platform “Genpact Cora”|work=Financial IT|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform has an [[Application programming interface|application program interface]] (API) design and [[open architecture]] that includes Genpact’s own intellectual property as well as other providers, integrating three areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insidebigdata.com/2017/07/02/genpact-launches-artificial-intelligence-based-platform-genpact-cora/|title=Genpact Launches Artificial Intelligence-Based Platform, “Genpact Cora” - insideBIGDATA|date=2017-07-02|work=insideBIGDATA|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Data Analytics''': advanced visualization, data engineering, big data, and [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT);
* '''Artificial Intelligence''': conversational AI, computational linguistics, computer vision, [[machine learning]] and data science AI.
Genpact Cora's claimed benefits include deciphering large chunks of data, seamless customer service, faster financial reporting, and increasing speed to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fintech.finance/01-news/genpact-launches-artificial-intelligence-based-platform-genpact-cora/|title=Genpact Launches Artificial Intelligence-Based Platform, “Genpact Cora”|date=2017-06-29|work=Fintech Finance|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisitions ==
Genpact completed the acquisition of Endeavour Software Technologies, an enterprise mobility software company, based out of Austin TX, in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genpact-to-acquire-mobile-digital-solutions-provider-endeavour-to-enhance-digital-transformation-capabilities-300151299.html|title=Genpact to Acquire Mobile Digital Solutions Provider Endeavour to Enhance Digital Transformation Capabilities|first=Genpact|last=Limited|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Genpact-acquires-Endeavour-Software-Technologies/articleshow/49275123.cms|title=Genpact acquires Endeavour Software Technologies - Times of India|author=|date=|website=indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2017, Genpact acquired TandemSeven, a [[Boston]]-headquartered company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genpact.com/about-us/media/press-releases/2017-genpact-acquires-digital-customer-experience-consulting-firm-tandemseven|title=Genpact Acquires Digital Customer Experience Firm TandemSeven|website=Genpact|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genpact then acquired OnSource in September 2017. OnSource, headquartered in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree, Mass.]], is a provider of an Inspection-as-a-Service (IaaS) product for [[property and casualty]] (P&amp;C) insurance carriers and their customers. OnSource uses technologies such as real-time browser-based communication, self-service applications, and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] to put consumers in control of their insurance claims. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genpact.com/about-us/media/press-releases/2017-genpact-redefines-the-insurance-claims-experience-with-acquisition-of-onsource|title=Genpact Redefines Insurance Experience with OnSource Acquisition|website=Genpact|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilmour Space Technologies''' (also known as Gilmour Space, Gilmour Space Tech or GSpaceTech) is an Australian private space company with a subsidiary in [[Singapore]]. Headquartered in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], the company is developing new hybrid-engine rockets and associated technology to support the development of a low-cost space [[launch vehicle]].&lt;ref name=blackbird&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afr.com/technology/blackbird-shoots-for-the-moon-and-mars-with-gilmour-space-investment-20170526-gwe9rq/|title= Blackbird shoots for the moon and Mars with Gilmour Space investment |publisher=Australian Financial Review |author=John Mcduling |date=30 May 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated mission is to provide affordable space launch services to the region’s fast-growing small satellite industry&amp;nbsp;– beginning with a commercial [[sounding rocket]] in 2019, and small satellites up to 400 kg to [[Low Earth Orbit]] by the end of 2020.&lt;ref name=gilmour-leo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gspacetech.com/launch-vehicles |title=Gilmour space launch services: 2020 to LEO |publisher=Gilmour Space Technologies |access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the company is also looking to provide low-cost space access for human [[spaceflight]] and exploration.&lt;ref name=five_questions&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx?_afrLoop=55786498327023&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D55786498327023%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D12mjd378fz_4|title= five questions with Gilmour Space Technologies |publisher= The Straights Times |author= Samuel Chan |date=27 February 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Gilmour Space was founded in 2012 in Singapore by former banker, Adam Gilmour. In 2013, the Australian CEO &amp; Founder set up similar operations in Queensland, Australia with his brother James Gilmour.&lt;ref name=Potts2017&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/business/gold-coast-company-aims-for-stars-at-pimpama/news-story/c3c9da864427df0081b6f2fabd1e3bb4|title= Gold Coast company aims for stars at Pimpama |publisher= Gold Coast Bulletin |author=Andrew Potts |date=17 June 2016 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s first project in 2013 was to design and manufacture high-fidelity spaceflight [[simulators]] and replicas for a number of space-related exhibits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bundaberg.qld.gov.au/news/2015/05/25/fly-bert-new-hinkler-hall-exhibition|title= Fly like Bert with new Hinkler Hall exhibition |publisher= Bundaberg Regional Council |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and education centers, including Spaceflight Academy Gold Coast, Australia’s first astronaut training center&lt;ref name=Potts2017 /&gt;. It began its rocket development program in 2015; and within 18 months, successfully launched Australia and Singapore’s first privately developed hybrid test rocket using proprietary 3D printed fuel.&lt;ref name=Harbour&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/gold-coasts-first-suborbital-rocket-successfully-launched/news-story/8c11f8059f6f996939605caad9fdfe0d|title= Gold Coast’s first suborbital rocket successfully launched |publisher=Gold Coast Bulletin |author=Jack Harbour |date=29 July 2016 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gilmour brothers have also met with [[NASA]] officials at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] to discuss launch opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/kennedy/2016/04/11/prospective-partners-attend-partnership-landscape-forum-at-nasas-kennedy-space-center/

==Technology==

===Rocket Archetype===
[[File:Rasta Launch.png|thumb|Rasta Launch]]
Gilmour Space employs a proprietary hybrid rocket motor technology. A [[hybrid-propellant rocket]] utilises a mixture of solid and liquid fuel. Advantages of hybrid rockets include acceptably high [[specific impulse]] values with relatively very low complexity and associated risks. In general, hybrid rocket engines are the safest of the three major rocket engines &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100009666.pdf
|title= Nitrous Oxide/Paraffin Hybrid Rocket Engines |publisher= NASA Tech Briefs |author= Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama |date=March 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– e.g. as compared to a [[solid-propellant rocket]] which is typically propelled by an explosive compound; and a [[liquid-propellant rocket]] which typically requires [[cryogenic]] fuel storage and complex [[turbine]] systems to provide sufficient [[combustion chamber]] pressure.

===Engine Development===
Gilmour Space was listed as a [[List of private spaceflight companies |commercial launch vehicle provider]] when it successfully &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/departments/several-hybrid-rocket-technologies-hit-advanced-test-stages/|title= Several hybrid rocket technologies hit advanced test stages |publisher= Aerospace America |author= Orie Cecil and Joseph Majdalani |date=December 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched its first test vehicle, at Westmar, Queensland on June 2016.&lt;ref name=Harbour /&gt; The RASTA launch vehicle flew to an altitude of 5 km and was reportedly among the first successful demonstrations of 3D printed rocket fuel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/3d-printing-taking-off-in-emerging-space-in-singapore |title=3D Printing taking off in emerging ‘space’ in Singapore |publisher= The Straits Times |author= Irene Tham|date=3 Aug 2017|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then, the Queensland-based company has conducted a series of orbital-class engine test fires, including a 12-second test in May 2018 that recorded 75 kN (16,900 lbs) of thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defenceconnect.com.au/intel-cyber/2354-queensland-rocket-company-prepares-for-suborbital-hybrid-rocket-launch|title=Queensland rocket company prepares for suborbital hybrid rocket launch|last=McMahon|first=Amelia|date=2018-05-29|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second test launch is scheduled in third quarter 2018, and the engine is then expected to propel the ARIEL commercial sounding rocket in 2019. In the next phase, multiple engine will be combined in a multi-stage orbital launch vehicle called ERIS, which is expected to deliver payloads up to 400 kg to LEO by fourth quarter 2020.&lt;ref name=gilmour-leo /&gt;

===Deep Space &amp; Exploration Research===
Gilmour Space has also supported a number of proof-of-concept technology projects related to the development of a long-term [[space habitat]]. An example is the M.A.R.S (Mars Aqua Retrieval System) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://newatlas.com/mars-water-mining-robot/39060/|title= Designing a rover to mine for water on Mars |publisher= New Atlas |author= Eric Mack |date=25 August 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rover project, a collaborative educational project at [[Singapore University of Technology and Design | SUTD]] which received an award at the 2016 [[ASME ]] international student competition &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://idc.sutd.edu.sg/news/grand-prize-winner-team-mars-asme-dec-2016/ |title= Grand prize winner for Team MARS at ASME |publisher= SUTD-MIT International Design Centre |author= SUTD-MIT IDC
|date= 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. and was featured in [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]’s Exploring Mars exhibit in Singapore. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/five-things-try-experience-mars-showcase |title= Five things to try at the Experience Mars showcase |publisher= The New Paper |author=Mohamed Firdaus Al-amin
|date=11 Nov 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The company is also working on an in-space cubesat propulsion system, which could potentially be used to send a 1U cubesat from Earth’s orbit to that of other moons or planets in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacetechasia.com/gilmour-space-completes-first-four-tests-for-worlds-first-interplanetary-cubesat-propulsion-system/|title=Gilmour Space completes first of four tests for world’s first interplanetary CubeSat propulsion system {{!}} SpaceTech Asia|date=2017-08-02|work=SpaceTech Asia|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Feb 2018, it signed a reimbursable Space Act Agreement with [[NASA]] to collaborate on various research, technology development and educational initiatives, including the testing of its MARS rover at [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/aussie-rocket-brothers-ink-nasa-deal-as-local-space-agency-wait-continues-20180219-p4z0w0.html|title=Aussie rocket brothers ink NASA deal as local space agency wait continues|last=Grubb|first=Ben|date=2018-02-19|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaceflight Simulators===
The company has earlier developed a number of unique high-fidelity spaceflight simulators and replicas, including a 6 degree-of-freedom space plane simulator, space capsule simulator, fighter cockpit trainers, low gravity climb, mission control simulators, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.gspaceflightacademy.com/|title= Space Flight Academy|
accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, the Design Business Chamber of Singapore awarded Gilmour Space with the Singapore Good Design Mark (SG Mark 2017) for excellence in design and quality of its simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sgmark.org/winners-2017/|title= Singapore Good Design 2017 |publisher= Bundaberg Regional Council |author= Design Business Chamber of Singapore|date= 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and Awards==
In fourth quarter 2016, its Singapore business was awarded a grant by the country’s National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) to develop aerospace-related [[additive manufacturing]] capabilities with the Singapore University of Technology and Design ([[Singapore University of Technology and Design | SUTD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=e5a1b6a7-ca7a-423c-be43-46244482c076|title= National cluster helps companies tap on new 3D printing technologies |publisher= NTU News Releases |author= Lester Kok
 |date=23 Jan 2017|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Gilmour Space Tech secured AUD 5 million in [[Series A round]] funding to develop and launch a low-cost [[launch vehicle]] for the small payload market. The lead investor was Australian venture capital firm Blackbird Ventures, with co-investors including global venture capital firm [[500 Startups]] and other private investors.&lt;ref name=blackbird /&gt;&lt;ref name=five_questions /&gt;

The company has also been awarded other grants by Advance Queensland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2017/9/3/advance-queensland-support-for-new-rocket-propulsion-technology|title=Advance Queensland support for new rocket propulsion technology|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, and the [[Singapore Economic Development Board]].

In June 2018, it received the Australian Trade &amp; Investment Commission Innovation Award by the [[Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry|Australian Chamber of Commerce]], Singapore "for the individual or organisation that has demonstrated innovation through bringing progressive and new ideas to business in priority sectors". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.austcham.org.sg/resource/resmgr/rica/may/june/austcham_singapore_business_.pdf|title=AustCham President's Lunch &amp; Business Awards 2018|last=|first=|date=June 8, 2018|website=https://www.austcham.org.sg/default.aspx|archive-url=https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.austcham.org.sg/resource/resmgr/rica/may/june/austcham_singapore_business_.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2018|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the Japanese annual design awards|the U.S/European design awards|Good Design Awards (Chicago)}}
The {{Nihongo|'''Good Design Award'''|グッドデザイン賞|Guddo-dezain-shō}} is Japanese comprehensive [[design]] evaluation and commendation system, operated by the [[Japan Institute of Design Promotion]] (formerly known as the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization). The system has its origins in the “Good Design Selection System” (known as the “G-Mark System”) instituted by the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] of Japan in 1957.

The award system was established based on the belief that good design is essential and indispensable to everyday life of people after the [[Pacific war]], and that the good design shall give people prosperous lives through the eminent power of good designs. More than 1,000 companies and designers submit entries for consideration for the Good Design Awards each year. These entries are screened by distinguished design experts who are selected by JIDPO from various industries for assessing those worthy of the Good Design Awards. The main deciding factor for the Award selection is always based on whether or not product can bless and enrich society and people's lives through its design.

Approximately 35,000 awards have been given since the inception.

The '''Improvised Explosive Device Countermeasure Equipment (ICE)''' is a vehicle-mounted electronics-based jamming system that uses low-power [[radio frequency]] energy to thwart enemy [[Improvised explosive device|improvised explosive devices (IEDs)]]. The radio frequency energy it emits blocks the signals broadcast by radio-controlled detonators, such as cell phones and cordless telephones, that would otherwise trigger the hidden IED to explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Clay|date=November 21, 2007|title=Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Iraq and Afghanistan: Effects and Countermeasures|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA475029|journal=CRS Report for Congress|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE was developed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] at [[White Sands Missile Range]] and the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL) at [[New Mexico State University]] in 2004 to counter the rising IED threat in Iraq. Due to the urgent demand for counter-IED equipment, ICE was designed and built within three weeks and was provided to troops in less than six months after the project started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/field-report-putting-the-ice-on-ieds-0916/|title=Field Report: Putting the ICE on IEDs|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2005|work=Defense Industry Daily|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://researchmag.nmsu.edu/2006/03/02/putting-the-ice-on-ieds/|title=Putting the ICE on IEDs|last=Hill|first=Karl|date=March 2, 2006|work=New Mexico State University Research and Resources|access-date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICE was designed to be adaptable to future adjustments in order to keep up with  changing IED technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/60428/new-us-army-device-counters-ieds-(jul-22).html|title=New Device Counters Terrorism, Keeps Troops Alive|last=|first=|date=July 21, 2005|website=www.defense-aerospace.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was simple enough for soldiers to repair it at the unit level. Researchers later developed a portable version of ICE called Dismounted IED Countermeasures Equipment (DICE), which allowed soldiers to carry the jamming system in a backpack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://defensesystems.com/articles/2008/11/army-puts-fcs-network-through-paces-in-demo.aspx|title=Army Puts FCS Network Through Paces in Demo|last=Carr|first=David|date=November 17, 2008|work=Defense Systems|access-date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICE proved to be largely successful against the IED threat and several thousand ICE systems were deployed to U.S. military personnel. In 2005, it was recognized as one of the U.S. Army’s "Top Ten Greatest Inventions of 2004," and the award was shared between those who spearheaded the project, ARL’s Shane Cunico, PSL’s Sam Mares, and Maj. Raymond Pickering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/NMSU_Physical_Science_Laboratory_Helps_Put_The_ICE_On_Explosives_In_Iraq.html|title=NMSU Physical Science Laboratory Helps Put The ICE On Explosives In Iraq|last=|first=|date=September 15, 2005|website=www.spacewar.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simorgh==
[[Iran]] Software &amp; Hardware Company's digital information management package for companies and libraries. Simorgh is an n-tier program based on .NET framework. Simorgh uses three databases in order to effectively store information. the first server is an indigenous [[Database Management System]] built by NOSA that can efficiently support right to left and left to right text functionality and search options while storing document and book information. Second server is an SQL repository of all digital media files and documents with in document search engine. Simorgh's third server is also based on SQL and stores user and system information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jist.irandoc.ac.ir/browse.php?a_code=A-10-1-51&amp;slc_lang=en&amp;sid=1&amp;printcase=1&amp;hbnr=1&amp;hmb=1 | title=Consolidation of Library Softwares for Creation of Non-Farsi Union Catalog Case Study: Union Catalog of Agricultural Publications | author=Tayabeh Shahmirzadi, Sirous Davoodzadeh | journal=Journal of Information Sciences and Technology | year=2007 | volume=22 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simorgh is used in hundreds of libraries and companies around Iran,&lt;ref&gt;

Simorgh can be used as a repository of digital documents and provide them to clients. The latest version of Simorgh incorporates [[radio-frequency identification]], and was covered by news agencies including the [[Islamic Republic of Iran News Network|Iranian News channel]], the Iranian Technology news&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://itmen.ir/main1.asp?a_id=18021 | title=معرفي کتابخانه ديجيتال نوسا و مديريت منابع الکترونيک | accessdate=1 March 2011 | date=November 2008 | publisher=Iranian Technology News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iranian Students News Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://isna.ir/Isna/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1251976&amp;Lang=P | title=پژوهشگران ايراني موفق به تهيه و راه‌اندازي نرم افزار كتابخانه ديجيتال فارسي شدند | accessdate=April 1, 2011 | date=November 2008 | publisher=Iranian Students News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NOSA Books==
With arising needs of scholars to use digital sources for research and the desire of publishers and libraries to safely share such copyrighted sources online, NOSA created NOSA Books. This Project uses an artificial intelligent [[cloud computing]] server called Brain Center to match available metadata and document information across all of Simorgh's network of 100+ libraries and intelligently match them with reference libraries such as [[Library of Congress]], [[National Library of Medicine]] and [[National Library of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0264-1615&amp;volume=38&amp;issue=2&amp;articleid=1863838&amp;show=html&amp;view=printarticle&amp;nolog=782978&amp;PHPSESSID=2ad9n2ik1rnumm4jqmsse7e547 | title=The development of union catalogues in Iran: the need for a web based catalogue | author=Afshin Mousavi Chelak, Fereydoon Azadeh | journal=Interlending &amp; Document Supply | year=2010 | volume=38 | issue=2 | pages=118–125 | doi=10.1108/02641611011047196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israel Stoughton''' (1603?-1644) was an early English colonist in [[Massachusetts]] and a colonial commander in the [[Pequot War]].  Returning to England, he served as [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] officer in the [[First English Civil War]].

==Life==
Born in England, a younger brother of [[John Stoughton (clergyman)|John Stoughton]], Stoughton emigrated to the [[Massachusetts Colony]] in 1632. He settled at [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] near [[Richard Callicott (New England colonist)|Richard Callicot]]'s trading post. Stoughton was admitted as a freeman at Dorchester on 5 November 1633. Stoughton was chosen as a representative for Dorchester in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1634 and 1635. In 1634 Stoughton was allowed to build the first mill on the [[Neponset River]] in what is now the [[Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=679 &lt;/ref&gt; Stoughton had several apprentices and servants, including [[John Whipple (settler)|John Whipple]].&lt;ref&gt;Captain John and Sarah Whipple of Dorchester, Massachusetts &amp; Providence, Rhode Island, Charles M. Whipple, Jr., Ph.D., Ed.D., Litt.D.  https://whipple.org/charles/johnandsarah/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the height of the [[Antinomian Controversy]] in the colony, Stoughton wrote a book that attacked the colony's constitution.  The book offended some members of the General Court, which barred Stoughton from holding any colony offices for three years. Stoughton later petitioned that the book be ‘forthwith burnt, as being weak and offensive.’ Despite this reversal, the General Court maintained their ban until 1636. In 1637, the General Court allowed Stoughton to become an assistant.

In 1636, war broke out between the [[Pequot]] tribe and the three New England colonies and their Native American allies.  Appointed commander of the Massachusetts Colony militia, Stoughton reportedly employed brutal tactics against the Pequots. In 1637 Stoughton transported Pequot prisoners to Massachusetts to serve as servants, and Stoughton requested "the fairest and largest" of the Pequot female prisoners to be his servant.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Ellen Newell, ''Brethren by Nature,'' (Cornell University Press) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He also had African American slaves, including the well known, Dorcas the Blackmore, who joined the [[First Parish Church of Dorchester]], and evangelized Stoughton's Native American servants and eventually attempted to gained her freedom with the help of the local church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpast.org/aah/dorcas-blackmore-ca-1620&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop's Journal, "History of New England," 1630-1649 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New England's First Fruits&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1639 Stoughton and  [[John Endecott]] acted as commissioners on behalf of Massachusetts Colony to settle a boundary dispute with [[Plymouth Colony]].
 
Toward the end of 1643, Stoughton made a brief trip to England, returning home by the beginning of 1644.  In late 1644 he went to England again, never to return to Massachusetts.

With the advent of the First English Civil War, the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] appointed Stoughton as a lieutenant colonel in their army.  Stoughton died very soon afterwards in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]].

Stoughton's children included [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], best known as the chief magistrate of the [[Salem witch trials]] in Massachusetts.

[[File:Jar opener.jpg|right|thumb|A Jar Opener]] A ''jar opener'' is a kitchen device which is used to open [[glass jars]]. Many people can remove the lids of glass jars by hand. Some people cannot and others prefer to use a jar opener. 

A traditional jar opener will have two handles, leading up to two concentric grooved rings which can be used to fit different jars. It also sometimes has a device to open a bottle on it.

'''Mary Ellen Weber''' (born 1962) is an American executive, scientist, aviator, speaker, and a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].

==Education==
Weber was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and raised in [[Bedford Heights, Ohio]]. She graduated from [[Bedford High School (Ohio)|Bedford High School]] in 1980; received a B.S. in 1984 in chemical engineering (with honors) from [[Purdue University]], where she was a member of [[Phi Mu]] sorority;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phimu.org/content.aspx?item=To%20Be%20Determined/Famous%20Phi%20Mus.xml |title=Famous Phi Mus |publisher=Phi Mu |accessdate=2007-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928084658/http://phimu.org/content.aspx?item=To%20Be%20Determined%2FFamous%20Phi%20Mus.xml |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1988; and received an M.B.A. from [[Southern Methodist University]] in 2002.

==Pre-NASA career==
As an undergrad, Weber was a chemical engineering intern at [[Ohio Edison]], [[Delco Electronics]], and [[3M]]. In her doctoral research at Berkeley, she explored the physics of chemical reactions involving silicon. At [[Texas Instruments]] she researched new processes and revolutionary equipment for making computer chips, with [[SEMATECH]] and [[Applied Materials]]. She holds one patent and published nine papers in scientific journals.

==NASA career==
Weber was selected by NASA in the fourteenth group of astronauts in 1992. During her ten-year career with NASA, she held several positions. She worked extensively in technology commercialization, and as part of a team reporting to NASA's chief executive, she worked directly with a venture capital firm to successfully identify and develop a business venture leveraging a space technology. In addition, Weber was the Legislative Affairs liaison at NASA Headquarters in [[Washington D.C.]], interfacing with Congress and traveling with NASA's chief executive. Prior to this appointment, she was Chairman of the procurement board for the Biotechnology Program contractor, and she also served on a team that revamped the $2 billion plan for Space Station research facilities. Weber's principal technical assignments within the Astronaut Office included Shuttle launch preparations at the [[Kennedy Space Center]], payload and science development, and development of standards and methods for crew science training. A veteran of two space flights, [[STS-70]] and [[STS-101]], she was among the youngest to fly in space and she logged over 450 hours. She is the recipient of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. She resigned from NASA in December 2002.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-70 [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]] (July 13–22, 1995), a mission that successfully delivered to orbit a critical $200 million NASA communications satellite, TDRS-G to its 22-thousand-mile orbit above the equator. Weber deployed the satellite and also performed pioneering biotechnology experiments, growing colon cancer tissues never before possible to later become a leading NASA biotechnology spokesperson in this field. She was the prime spacewalk crewmember in the event a malfunction required a spacewalk, crew medical officer, and flight deck crew member for landing. STS-70 was known for its "All-Ohio crew" and for its last-minute launch delay due to woodpeckers, becoming the "Woodpecker flight." The STS-70 mission was completed in 142 orbits of the Earth, after traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours and 20 minutes.

STS-101 [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]] (May 19–29, 2000), the third Shuttle mission devoted to [[International Space Station]] construction—a critical mission, with no mission to the fledgling Station in over a year and batteries failing. The crew repaired and installed electrical and life-support components, both inside and out, and boosted the Station to a safe orbit. Weber was a flight deck crew member for launch, landing and Station rendezvous, drove Atlantis' 60-foot robotic arm to maneuver spacewalk crewmembers along the Station surface, and directed the logistics and transfer of over three thousand pounds of equipment. She also developed new crew checklists for engine failures during ascent and new procedures for robotic arm operations. The STS-101 mission—the subject of an A&amp;E documentary, Mission Possible—was accomplished in 155 orbits of the Earth, after traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 9 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/weber.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Mary Ellen Weber 10/04|website=www.jsc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After NASA==
Weber is currently (January 2014) with STELLAR Strategies, LLC, providing consulting services in strategies for operations in high-stakes business ventures, technology communications, and legislative strategy. She is also a speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822082831/http://www.stellarkeynotes.com/|title=Stellar Keynotes - HOME|last=|first=|date=2012-08-22|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over twenty years of experience with a wide range of audiences and venues.

Prior to STELLAR Strategies, Weber was Vice President for Government Affairs and Policy for nine years at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].

==Personal==
Weber is married to Dr. Jerome Elkind—founder of Stellar Generation, LLC, an alternative energy technology company—who is originally from [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].

Having logged nearly 5,000 skydives, Weber is an active skydiver, with 13 silver and bronze medals to date at the U.S. National Skydiving Championships and a world record in 2002 for the largest freefall formation with 300 skydivers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In addition, she is an instrument-rated pilot, a skier, and a scuba diver.

'''Mathletics''' is an online, educational website launched in 2005 by 3P Learning, specialising in the improvement of mathematical literacy and ability for both [[Primary school|Primary]] and [[Secondary school|High School]] students. Specifically, Mathletics bases and functions their learning strategies from various international educational curricula, initially beginning solely with the [[Australian Curriculum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/|title=Mathletics: powering maths learning across Australia|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website places an emphasis upon [[Web 2.0]] technologies to foster an interactive learning style which is designed to replicate the use of a personal tutor as to "address the balance between teacher-led instruction and independent, student-driven learning".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/teachers|title=Mathletics teacher tools|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathletics operates through a subscription-based system, offering access at an individual level as well as collectively as a school. Online users, acknowledged by the website as 'Mathletes', have access to math quizzes and challenges, and can participate in a real-time networked competition known as 'Live Mathletics'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nansen, Bjorn &amp; Chakraborty, Kabita &amp; Gibbs, Lisa &amp; Vetere, Frank &amp; MacDougall, Colin. (2012). ‘You do the math’: Mathletics and the play of online learning. New Media &amp; Society. 14. 1216-1235. 10.1177/1461444812442926.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathletics provides a customisable avatar for each individual user, which visually represents the player in the 'Live Mathletics' competitions. Alongside these learning interfaces, Mathletics grants individual users with the capacity to customise their avatar's clothing and general aesthetic, which are fuelled by credits awarded to the user through the completion of quizzes and tasks.

As of 2018, Mathletics caters to 4.1 million users worldwide and 17,000 schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3plearning.com/|title=3P Learning - Transforming lives through a love of learning|website=www.3plearning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Mathletics was established as a [[Personal Learning Environment]] (PLE) application in 2005 by 3P Learning, catering for Australian schools. The website is structured to facilitate an engagement with students from K-12 educational level, and offers various visual resources in their interactive and online [[Web 2.0]] appropriation of the [[Australian Curriculum]]. Though initially based around this curriculum, by 2012 Mathletics had broadened its offices as well as its student and teacher audiences to various other countries residing in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East; adapting to those regions' various school curricula. The US and Canadian version of the website aligns with state-based educational standards including the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and [[Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills|Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)]] from Kindergarten into High School. The UK version of the website follows the various National Curricula within Britain, comprising Foundation Stage to Key Stage 5. Both the Middle Eastern and Asian versions of the website adopt and reflect International Curricula, and offer an entire translation of the English course.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Mathletics is one of numerous projects created by 3P Learning, and is a sister website to Spelladrome, ReadingEggs and IntoScience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

== Content ==

=== Web 2.0 Interface ===
Mathletics draws from the Web 2.0 technologies to foster their website as an "interactive e-learning resource, for schools, parents and children". Mathletics accredits the interactive aesthetic and function of their website to Web 2.0 format, which is typically characterised by its fluid accessibility to user-content creation and editing without prior knowledge of HTML programming language. With this, Mathletics takes from the features of Web 2.0 and implements them into their interface to assure that the website content can remain dynamic and regularly updated, and provides users with the option to edit and personalise their online profiles within the site without programming skills, as well as facilitate online competitions with other profiles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

==== Primary Students ====
Mathletics functions via an emphasis upon the bilateral capabilities of [[Web 2.0]], which concerns interface and user interactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1773830/wikisblogsweb2blue.pdf|title=Wikis, Blogs and Web 2.0 Technology|publisher=University of Melbourne|date=|website=www.unimelb.edu.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;Mathletics heavily anchors their teaching styles within the "Primary" section of their website through the lens of 'visual learning'; employing a vast array of colours combined with cartoon imagery to create a "captivating" website aesthetic in an effort to appease the juvenile temperament of students under twelve years old. The site offers animated tutorials and learning support that display animated adolescent characters offering mathematic tips and answers to questions. The website currently offers 1200 unique questions, that have been individually tailored to suit each user's mathematic comprehension. Students are encouraged to participate in Mathematic activities which host up to 20 questions related to a certain topic.  Once a student answers a question, the website recognises its completion and then adapts to the "student's progress in understanding", leading to questions that may be more complex in difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/primary|title=Mathletics for primary maths students|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;At the completion of each topic, students are offered the opportunity to take a 'Topic Test' which summates the hardest questions in the past activities. 

A certificate award is presented to a student once they have earned 1000 points within a week. 10 points are awarded per correct activity answer in a regular activity. 20 points are awarded per correct answer in a 'Topic Test'. 

The 'Primary Section' of the website is accessible via Tablet device, and is available for offline use if the user doesn't have sufficient [[Wi-Fi]]. All points garnered whilst on offline will be synchronised onto online servers once the individuals access the website online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/mobile|title=Mathletics for tablet devices|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Secondary Students ====
Mathletics believes that "secondary school is a whole new world and a new school demands an older, more study-focused interface for new students". As a result, the "Secondary" section of the website available to students doesn't reflect the juvenile decor that saturates the "Primary" section of the website, replacing it with a "more study-based" interface. Further, this "Secondary" area of the website exclusively promotes the use of a student progress system through use of a 'Traffic Light System', which categorises a user's understanding of a mathematical topic into three, colour-based, identifiable sections:

# Green = 85% to 100% correct marks.
# Orange = 50% to 84% correct marks.
# Red = 0% to 49% correct marks.

Alongside this colour-coded progress guide secondary students have access to "adaptive practice activities with animated support, plus interactive and video content" as well as a library of various printable eBooks. Secondary Students also are offered the option to personally customise the website's interface from a range of differing backgrounds, in an effort to suit their "learning needs". The collection of backgrounds encompass pictures of natural environments, sporting fields, pictures of live animals and vibrant pattens of colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/secondary|title=Mathletics for secondary maths students|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alike to the "Primary' section, accumulative points are awarded for the completion of questions in activities. Secondary Students also have access to 'Topic Tests' which summate the most difficult questions of the topic.  

The "Secondary Students" section of the website is also reachable on a Tablet device, and can be accessed for offline use. The same process of offline synchronisation to the online profile is also applied in the 'Secondary Students" section of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/mobile|title=Mathletics for tablet devices|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early Learners ====
The 'Early Learners Numeracy' section of the site offers a series of multimedia resources that are designed to support students aged from four to seven. The section's mascot feature animated 'Numbeanies', drawn and designed to appeal to infants. These 'Numbeanies' present younger users with a series of flash cards that represent numbers as "collections, numerals and words".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/early-learners|title=Numeracy for Early Learners from Mathletics|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The overall purpose of the Early Learners section is to be entertaining, and provide the basic foundations of mathematics through the guise of interactive games and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.mathletics.com/early-learners|title=Numeracy for Early Learners from Mathletics|website=au.mathletics.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Baby Mathletics ====
'Baby Mathletics' caters to users 6-24 months old, and is independent to the Mathletics website. 'Baby Mathletics' is an [[iOS]] based application is designed to "help build confidence for when they start learning Mathematics at school". The application is a video tour of a fictional story that includes animated animals and shapes, which "poses questions, stimulate reactions and spark new interests in learning". The purpose of the application is ultimately to foster a sense of confidence in regards to numerical learning in young toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babymathletics.com/|title=Home|website=Baby Mathletics|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teachers ====
Users that identify as teachers have access to a 'Mathletics Teacher Console' which manages their classroom's collective progress, as well as providing insight into each individual student's progress also. The teacher console delineates live data analysis of each student's progress, represented via colour-coded visuals, in an attempt to provide teachers greater agency in assigning "targeted and personalised learning pathways" for the class. The teacher console provides teachers with tools and instruments to manage classes, create custom mathematical learning courses to suit different and various learning groups, and bestow students with multimedia sources that will assist them answer the questions assigned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Teachers have the option to select mandatory assignments and activities to be completed by their students. These assignments must be completed before a student participate in games of Live Mathletics or other activities. 

The teacher console is multi-platformed and available on various media devices including [[Tablet computer|Tablet]] and [[Mobile phone|Mobile]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==== Avatar ====
Each individual subscriber of Mathletics must create an identifiable [[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]. The customisable Avatar template provided by Mathletics is a portrait-view shot of a head and face in the foreground, combined with an animated environment in the background. This online persona is known as the user's 'Mathlete'. The avatar does not have to represent a user's actual facial features, however the avatar's design will represent the user against others in competitions of 'Live Mathletics'. The Avatar can be updated/altered through the 'Face Maker' interface via purchasing upgrades with credits that have been earned from completing tasks and competitions of 'Live Mathletics'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mathletics operates via a credits-based incentive system, awarding students who have completed quizzes or competitions of 'Live Mathletics' with in-app online credits that replicate virtual currency, and can be used to purchase aesthetic upgrades to their 'Mathlete'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Mathletics website will award an obligatory 10 credits to user for participation in a quiz or competition, as an added bonus to their base gained score.  

==== Live Mathletics ====
The option to participate in real-time, live networked mathematic competitions known as 'Live Mathletics' are offered to users on the Mathletics Website. The primary objective to win is for users to complete as many [[addition]], [[subtraction]] and [[multiplication]] problems as possible before the one-minute timer ends. Users must select which difficulty level they wish to compete in, which vary on a difficulty scale from 1-10 (1 being the easiest, 10 being the hardest) that dictates the complexity of the questions asked by the website. The user who answers the most correctly, wins. It is possible for a user to 'strike-out' and forfeit their position in the game if they incorrectly answer more than two problems. A total of 5 credits are awarded to users for winning a game of Live Mathletics, and a total of 10 credits are awarded to any user who beats their previous score on any difficulty level.      

'Live Mathletics' incorporates a "Who's Online" panel which allows users to read a live feed of other students in their class that are currently online and engaged with 'Live Mathletics'. Each student listing is accompanied by a high score rating, and an option that directly requests and challenges said student to a game of 'Live Mathletics'. In addition, there is a panel that displays the students that are offline, whom can also be challenged to games of 'Live Mathletics'. Offline students who are challenged are replaced by a computer that emulates the offline individual's average game completion speed.       

Students are also assigned an individual 'ability' ranking that operates on a scale from "Raging Rookie to Human Calculator". Mathletics determines this ranking based upon the student's overall high score.        

== Reception ==
The overall reception of Mathletics as an educational software has been generally positive. Technology-based reviewer TeachWire appraised Mathletics, calling it an "intuitive and engaging resource; one that's bound to improve the learners' skills, knowledge and ability in maths, especially in numerical skills and speed"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teachwire.net/products/mathletics-review|title=Mathletics review {{!}} Teachwire Educational Product Reviews|work=Teachwire|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. EducationWorld named Mathletics a "tremendous resource" and an educational website that "injected(ed) a little competitions into lessons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/site-reviews/mathletics.shtml|title=Site Review: Mathletics {{!}} Education World|website=www.educationworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Critically, [[Macquarie University|Macquarie University's]] leading mathematic education expert, Dr Michael Cavanagh described Mathletics to [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]] as a "drill and practise" learning software. He believes that "this type of program needs to be complemented - and this is when the teacher comes in, to develop a deeper and broader understanding". He then substantiates his belief that Mathletics is only "one piece of the puzzle" in regards to mathematical informative learning with "If all students do is stuff on Mathletics then that's a pretty shallow approach"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/a-private-tutor-at-their-fingertips-20110814-1it5s.html|title=A private tutor at their fingertips|date=2011-08-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*[[Digital audio player|MP3 players]]

=== Former ===
* Maycom '''Merit MP-100''' [[MP3 players]] licensed from its OEM customer, [[United States]]-based '''I-Jam Entertainment.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itreviews.co.uk/hardware/h116b.htm Merit MP-100 review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124215238/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/hardware/h116b.htm |date=2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merit was sold only in the [[UK]] and Asia as I-Jam sold its player in North America.
* Maycom licensed an MP3 player reference design from [[United States]]-based [[e.Digital Corporation]] in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200001/ai_mark01986207 e.Digital And Maycom Announce Licensing Agreement For e.Digital's Portable Internet Music Player Design - January 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  The companies jointly announced the launch of the player, called the '''MP2000''', in October 2000 "in time for the holiday shopping season"&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Oct_6/ai_65788249 e.Digital and Maycom Announce the Launch of MP2000 Digital Music Player - Oct. 6, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; but the product never went into retail channels and e.Digital eventually offered them through their online store in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/e.Digital+Announces+Consumer+Availability+of+MP2000+Internet+Music...-a080604148 e.Digital Announces Consumer Availability of MP2000 Internet Music Player -  Dec. 6. 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contract manufacturing ==
Maycom has also manufactured products as an [[OEM]] for other companies.

* I-Jam Entertainment LLC, of Schaumburg, Illinois (now defunct) contracted with Maycom to manufacture its '''I-Jam''' "'''IJ-100'''" MP3 player, one of the earliest on the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/ijam.html '''Review: The I-Jam''' - MP3 Newswire, 12/07/99]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hardware.dmusic.com/reviews/ij-100/printer.php Review of IJ-100 by I-Jam MultiMedia - 7/23/2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819171101/http://hardware.dmusic.com/reviews/ij-100/printer.php |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/CompanyDetail.aspx?CompanyID=52154385&amp;cs=QEDG9AR7k I-Jam Entertainment LLC on zoominfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[e.Digital Corporation]] contracted with Maycom to build its branded '''MXP 100''' [[digital audio player]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2001/mxp100.html e.Digital Releases MicroDrive MP3 Player You Talk To - 11/02/01]&lt;/ref&gt; and later, '''[[digEplayer|digEplayer 5500]]''' [[portable media player]]s for e.Digital's customer, [[digEcor]].

== Legal dispute ==
In March 2006, [[e.Digital Corporation|e.Digital]] informed its shareholders that Maycom was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries it had placed to fulfill an order from its customer, [[digEcor]], in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edigital.com/shal032306.htm e.Digital SHAREHOLDER ALERT, 03/23/06] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412123305/http://www.edigital.com/shal032306.htm |date=April 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

digEcor had fully paid e.Digital and e.Digital had fully paid Maycom.  In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of the pre-paid order and other matters seeking actual damages of $793,750 and consequential damages of not less than  $1,000,000.  Maycom eventually delivered the players to e.Digital and e.Digital to digEcor without batteries in October 2006. e.Digital and digEcor entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $98,846 for undelivered batteries, with consequential damages still to be proven at trial (scheduled for January 2009).  e.Digital claims it will seek any damages it is required to pay from Maycom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886328/000114420407034402/v079461_10k.htm eDigital Corporation Annual Report (10-K), 6/29/2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3749">'''Nanocomputer''' refers to a [[computer]] smaller than the [[microcomputer]], which is smaller than the [[minicomputer]].

[[Microelectronics|Microelectronic]] components that are at the core of all modern electronic devices employ semiconductor [[transistor]]s.  The term nanocomputer is increasingly used to refer to general computing devices of size comparable to a [[credit card]].  Products sometimes referred to by this term include:

* [[Arduino]]
* [[BeagleBoard]]
* [[Olinuxino]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olimex.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Odroid]]
* [[Miracast dongle]]s
* All the [[PC-on-a-stick]] ([[Android Mini PC MK802|MK802 series]]...)
* [[Raspberry Pi]]
* [[CuBox]] from SolidRun&lt;ref&gt;https://www.solid-run.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future computers smaller than 10 nanometers ==
[[Die shrink]] has been more or less continuous since around 1970. A few years later, the [[6 µm process]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; allowed the making of [[desktop computer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, known as microcomputers. [[Moore's Law]] in the next 40 years brought features 1/100th the size, or ten thousand times as many transistors per square millimeter, putting [[smartphones]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; in every pocket. Eventually computers will be developed with fundamental parts that are no bigger than a few [[Nanometre|nanometers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] |place = London |year = 2007 | pages = 173–176 |isbn = 1847040020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are several ways nanocomputers might be built, using mechanical, electronic, biochemical, or [[quantum]] technology. Consensus among hardware developers has been that is unlikely that nanocomputers will be made out of [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, as they seem to perform significantly less well when shrunk to sizes under 100 nanometers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellenbogen, J.. (1998). A Brief Overview of Nanoelectronic Devices. Retrieved August 3, 2006 from http://www.mitre.org/tech/nanotech/ourwork/nano_papers.html#nanoelectronics&lt;/ref&gt; Although developers have reduced [[microprocessor]]s to 22&amp;nbsp;nm as of April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kelion |first = Leo |title = Intel's Ivy Bridge chips launch using '3D transistors' |publisher = [[BBC]] |year = 2012 |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17785464 |accessdate = 19 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Intel's [[5 nanometer]] technology outlook predicts 5&amp;nbsp;nm feature size by 2022. The [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] gives an industrial consensus on feature scaling following [[Moore's Law]].

Note that a Silicon-Silicon [[bond length]] is 235.2&amp;nbsp;pm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webelements.com/silicon/atom_sizes.html&lt;/ref&gt; which means that a 5&amp;nbsp;nm-width transistor would be 21 silicon atoms wide.

'''Olive mill pomace''' is a by-product from the [[olive oil]] mill [[olive oil extraction|extraction process]]. Usually it is used as fuel in a [[cogeneration]] system or as organic fertiliser after a composting operation.

Olive mill pomace [[compost]] is made by a controlled biologic process that transforms organic waste into a stable [[humus]]. Adding composted olive mill pomace as organic fertiliser in olive orchards allows the soil to get nutrients back after each olive crop.

==Two-phase pomace==
In crude olive oil production, the traditional system, i.e. pressing, and the three-phase system produce a press cake and a considerable amount of waste water while the two-phase system, which is mainly used in Spain, produces a paste-like waste called "alperujo" or "two-phase pomace" that has a higher water content and is more difficult to treat than traditional solid waste. The water content of the press cake, composed of crude olive cake, pomace and husk, is about 30 percent if it is produced by traditional pressing technology and about 45–50 percent using [[decanter]] [[centrifuge]]s. The press cake still has some oil that is normally recovered in a separate installation. The exhausted olive cake is incinerated or used as a soil conditioner in olive groves.

'''Packard Bell''' is a Dutch-based computer manufacturing subsidiary of [[Acer Inc.|Acer]].  The brand name originally belonged to an American radio set manufacturer, [[Packard Bell (1926)|Packard Bell]], founded by Herbert "Herb" A. Bell and Leon S. Packard in 1933. Some websites use 1926 as the founding date when Herbert Bell was an executive with Jackson Bell Company, [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhope.com/comp/pb.htm Source: Computerhope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: Computer History Museum, [http://www.computerhistory.org/brochures/companies.php?alpha=m-p&amp;company=com-42bc2154667f3] in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Israeli investors bought the brand from [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]], in order to name their newly formed [[personal computer]] manufacturing company producing discount computers in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In the late 1990s Packard Bell became a subsidiary of [[NEC]]. In 2000, Packard Bell stopped its North American operations whilst expanding overseas and becoming a leading brand in the European PC markets. In 2008 it was acquired by the [[Taiwan]]ese consumer electronic firm Acer in the aftermath of its takeover of [[Gateway, Inc.]] Gateway products are now sold in the Americas and Asia, while Packard Bell products are sold in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

==History==
[[File:Pb logo 1990s.svg|thumb|right|The Packard Bell logo in the 1990s]]
In 1986, [[Beny Alagem]], Larry Metz and a group of other Israeli investors bought the American former radio and television set brand from Teledyne&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betanews.com/article/NEC_Sells_Packard_Bell_to_Calif_Investor/1157747309 BetaNews | NEC Sells Packard Bell to Calif. Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedium.co/2016/12/27/packard-bell-multiple-brand-history/ Packard Bell Branding History --Tedium]&lt;/ref&gt; and resurrected it as a manufacturer of low-cost [[personal computer]]s. Their computers were among the first [[IBM PC compatible]]s sold in retail chains such as [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/06/12/203837/index.htm|title=Packard Bell sells more PC's in the U.S. than anyone, so just who are these guys?|last=Sprout|first=Alison L.|last2=Coxeter|first2=Ruth M.|date=June 12, 1995|work=Fortune|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]], Packard Bell sometimes benefited from misplaced name recognition, with consumers (especially first-time computer buyers) and even some salespeople erroneously associating the company with others of a similar name, such as [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Pacific Telesis|Pacific Bell]], and [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. The confusion was further facilitated by Packard Bell's then-current slogan, "America grew up listening to us. It still does."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The company also sold nearly identical systems under different names, making comparison difficult.
[[File:Packard Bell Multimedia D160.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A Packard Bell Multimedia D160 manufactured in the mid-1990s]]

Aside from low price and brand confusion, Packard Bell's success in number of units sold may have come from two areas of innovation: 1) branding and industrial design, provided by the San Francisco offices of [[frog design inc.|frog design]]; and 2) its boot-up shell [[Packard Bell Navigator]], created by The Pixel Company in Seattle. They targeted a huge section of consumers who were inexperienced using computers. Frog design gave the look of quality and utilized innovations such as color-coding cable connectors (first seen on the IBM PS/2), while Navigator provided the ability for users to launch installed programs by clicking on-screen buttons, and then later a house metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toastytech.com/guis/pbnav.html|title=Packard Bell Navigator Version 1.1|last1=Lineback|first1=Nathan|website=Toasty Technology GUI Gallery|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, returns dropped from 19% to 10%, and sales grew exponentially.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} 

In late 1995 to early 1996 [[Microsoft]] forced boot-up shells off OEM computers by updating its Microsoft Windows distribution agreement (OPK 2) and Packard Bell, without a clear on-shelf differentiator, saw sales begin to decrease.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Also in 1995, [[Compaq]] sued Packard Bell for not disclosing that Packard Bell computers incorporated used parts. This practice was, in fact, widespread in the computer industry, including Compaq itself.  However, unlike its rival companies, Packard Bell was judged not to have advertised the practice sufficiently in its warranties (Compaq, for instance, disclosed it in the warranty statement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Packard Bell Suing Compaq|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-11/business/9510110338_1_compaq-computer-corp-packard-bell-electronics-unfair-competition-and-defamation|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=11 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Packard Bell acquired [[Zenith Data Systems]] from [[Groupe Bull]] in a deal which saw Groupe Bull and [[NEC]] taking a larger stake in Packard Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berley|first=Max|title=Groupe Bull Quits PCs in 3-Way Deal|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/02/08/bull.t.php|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=8 February 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025202330/http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/02/08/bull.t.php|archivedate=25 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create a $4.5 billion company. The company then became integrated with [[NEC|NEC Computers]]. Its 15% market share made it the largest PC manufacturer, in terms of units shipped, in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} However, Compaq overtook it in retail sales in mid-1996, and cemented its lead the next year with the release of a $999 PC in March 1997.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Packard Bell posted losses totaling more than $1 billion in 1997 and 1998.  In the U.S., price pressure from Compaq and, later, [[eMachines]], along with continued poor showings in consumer satisfaction surveys made it difficult for the company to remain profitable and led to Alagem's departure in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  In 1999, NEC began withdrawing the Packard Bell name from the U.S. market, while keeping it in Europe, where the brand was untainted by allegations of sub-standard quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,2074884,00.htm NEC disables Packard Bell NEC], ZDNet, November 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Andrea palladio fourth book image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A villa with a superimposed portico, from Book IV of Palladio's ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'', in an English translation published in London, 1736.]]
[[File:PalladioRotondaPlan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Plan for Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]]. Features of the house were to become incorporated in numerous Palladian style houses throughout Europe over the following centuries.]]

'''Palladian architecture''' is  a European style of [[architecture]] derived from and inspired by the designs of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architect [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580). That which is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of Palladio's original concepts. Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. From the 17th century Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism. It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century.

Palladianism became popular briefly in [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]] during the mid-17th century, but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the [[English Civil War]] and the imposition of austerity which followed. In the early 18th century it returned to fashion, not only in England but also, directly influenced from Britain, in [[Prussia]]. Count [[Francesco Algarotti]] may have written to Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to [[Frederick the Great]] the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England&lt;ref&gt;James Lees-Milne, ''The Earls of Creation'' 1962:120.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff|Knobelsdorff]]'s opera house on the Unter den Linden, based on Campbell's [[Wanstead House]], had been constructed from 1741. Later in the century, when the style was falling from favour in Europe, it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America, highlighted by examples such as [[Drayton Hall]] in South Carolina, the [[Redwood Library]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the Morris-Jumel Mansion in [[New York City]], the [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and [[Poplar Forest]] in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/timeline-Palladianism.html "Palladio and English-American Palladianism."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The style continued to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings. From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the [[Gothic revival]] in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]], remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed it too pagan for [[Anglican]] and [[Anglo-Catholic]] worship.&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve; its [[pediment]]s, symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today.

== Palladio's architecture==
[[Image:Palladio Villa Godi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"True Palladianism" in [[Villa Godi]] by Palladio from the ''[[Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]''. The extending wings are agricultural buildings and are not part of the villa. In the 18th century they became an important part of Palladianism—see photograph of [[Woburn Abbey]] below.]]
Buildings entirely designed by [[Palladio]] are all in [[Venice]] and the [[Veneto]], with an especially rich grouping of palazzi in [[Vicenza]]. They include [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto|villas]], and [[church architecture|churches]] such as [[Il Redentore|Redentore]] in Venice. In Palladio's architectural [[treatise]]s he followed the principles defined by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] architect [[Vitruvius]] and his 15th-century disciple [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who adhered to principles of [[Roman architecture|classical Roman architecture]] based on mathematical proportions rather than the rich ornamental style also characteristic of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio always designed his [[villa]]s with reference to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, [[facade]]s were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, [[portico]]s were built on all sides so that occupants could fully appreciate the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many [[United States|American]]-style [[porch]]es of today. Palladio sometimes used a [[loggia]] as an alternative to the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements.  Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.&lt;ref name="Copplestone, p.251"&gt;Copplestone, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio would often model his villa elevations on [[Roman temple]] facades. The temple influence, often in a [[cruciform]] design, later became a [[trademark]] of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated [[basement]] or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the [[piano nobile]] accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref name="Copplestone, p.251"/&gt;

Palladio deeply considered the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy [[merchant]] owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping away from them to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by [[colonnade]]s, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended to be part of the main house, and it is the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, pp.251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio's Four Books of Architecture was first published in 1570, This architectural treaty contains descriptions and illustrations of his own architecture along with the Roman building that inspired him to create the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-palladianism/|title=Style Guide: Palladianism|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Digital Media|website=www.vam.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio reinterpreted Rome's ancient architecture and applied it to all kinds of buildings from grand villas and public buildings to humble houses and farm sheds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34143566|title=Palladio: The architect who inspired our love of columns|last=Kerley|first=Paul|date=2015-09-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Venetian window ==
[[File:Claydon House - geograph.org.uk - 1285177.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Claydon House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] (begun 1757); here the [[Venetian window]] in the central bay is surrounded by a unifying blind arch. This house was intended to be one of two flanking wings to a vast Palladian house; the scheme was never completed.]]
{{main|Venetian window}} 
The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window features largely in Palladio's work and is almost a trademark of his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] consisting of a small [[entablature]], under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are [[pilasters]]. In the library at Venice, [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]] varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by [[Donato Bramante]]&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Jaaes S. (1994). ''Palladio'' (series "Architect and Society")&lt;/ref&gt; and later mentioned by [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book ''[[Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva]]'' expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that first appeared in the [[triumphal arch]]es of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] in [[Vicenza]]. It is also a feature of his entrances to both [[Villa Godi]] and [[Villa Forni Cerato]]. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the [[Veneto]] that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Palladio, Caroline Constant. ''The Palladio Guide''. [[Princeton Architectural Press]], 1993. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Lees-Milne]], its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of [[Burlington House]], London, where the immediate source was actually in [[Inigo Jones]]'s designs for [[Whitehall Palace]] rather than drawn from Palladio himself.&lt;ref&gt;"The earliest example of the revived Venetian window in England", Lees-Milne, ''The Earls of Creation'', 1962:100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to [[Vincenzo Scamozzi|Scamozzi]]. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of [[Tottenham House|Tottenham Park]] in [[Savernake Forest]] for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of [[Holkham Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lees-Milne 1962:133f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Palladianism ==
[[Image:Queens House.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Inigo Jones]] was the designer of the [[Queen's House]], Greenwich, begun in 1616, the first English Palladian house.]]

In 1570 Palladio published his book, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'', which inspired architects across Europe.

During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various [[climate]]s, [[topography|topographies]] and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism throughout the world were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and later [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.252&lt;/ref&gt; In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of [[Baroque architecture]] that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]] (1657–1737)&lt;ref&gt;Rossi built the new façade for the rebuilt [[San Stae|Sant'Eustachio]], known in Venice as San Stae, 1709, which was among the most sober in a competition that was commemorated with engravings of the submitted designs, and he rebuilt [[Ca' Corner della Regina, Venice|Ca' Corner della Regina]], 1724–27 (Deborah Howard and Sarah Quill, ''The Architectural history of Venice'', 2002: 238f).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrea Tirali]] (1657–1737).&lt;ref&gt;His façade of [[San Vidal, Venice|San Vidal]] is a faithful restatement of Palladio's [[San Francesco della Vigna]] and his masterwork is [[San Niccolò Tolentino, Venice|San Niccolò Tolentino]], 1706–14 (Howard and Quill 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommaso Temanza]], their biographer, proved to be the movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tavernor, ''Palladio and Palladianism'' Thames &amp; Hudson, 1991:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential follower of Palladio anywhere, however, was the Englishman [[Inigo Jones]], who travelled throughout Italy with the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, annotating his copy of Palladio's treatise, in 1613–14.&lt;ref&gt;Hanno-Walter Kruft. ''A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present''. Princeton Architectural Press, 1994 and Edward Chaney, Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The "Palladianism" of Jones and his contemporaries and later followers was a style largely of facades, and the mathematical formulae dictating layout were not strictly applied. A handful of great country houses in England built between 1640 and c. 1680, such as [[Wilton House]], are in this Palladian style. These follow the great success of Jones' Palladian designs for the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]], the uncompleted royal palace in [[London]] of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Palladian designs advocated by Inigo Jones were too closely associated with the court of Charles I to survive the turmoil of the civil war. Following the Stuart restoration Jones's Palladianism was eclipsed by the [[baroque]] designs of such architects as [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and Sir [[John Vanbrugh]], [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], and even Jones' pupil [[John Webb (architect)|John Webb]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Palladian==

=== English Palladian architecture ===

The [[baroque]] style, popular in continental Europe, was never truly to the English taste and was considered excessively flamboyant, catholic and 'florid'. It was quickly superseded when, in the first quarter of the 18th century, four books were published in Britain which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture. These were:
#''[[Vitruvius Britannicus]]'' published by [[Colen Campbell]], 1715 (of which supplemental volumes appeared through the century)
#''Palladio's Four Books of Architecture'' translated by [[Giacomo Leoni]], published from 1715 onwards.
#[[Leone Battista Alberti]]'s ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', translated by Giacomo Leoni, published 1726.
#''The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs'', published by [[William Kent]], 2 vols., 1727 (A further volume, ''Some Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones and Mr. William Kent'' was published in 1744 by the architect [[John Vardy]], an associate of Kent.)

The most popular of these among the wealthy patrons of the day was the four-volume ''Vitruvius Britannicus'' by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an architect and a publisher. The book was basically a book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from [[Vitruvius]] to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after architects of the era. Due to his book ''Vitruvius Britannicus'', [[Colen Campbell]] was chosen as the architect for banker [[Henry Hoare (banker)|Henry Hoare I]]'s [[Stourhead]] house (''illustration above''), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.

[[File:WoburnAbbey02.JPG|thumb|left|275px|English Palladianism. [[Woburn Abbey]], designed by Burlington's student [[Henry Flitcroft]] in 1746. Palladio's central temple is no longer free standing, the wings are now elevated to near equal importance, and the cattle sheds terminating Palladio's design are now clearly part of the façade.]]

At the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic "architect earl", [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed [[Chiswick House]]. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism.
In 1734 [[William Kent]] and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with [[Holkham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]]. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance. Kent attached them to the design, banished the farm animals, and elevated the wings to almost the same importance as the house itself. These wings were often adorned with porticos and pediments, often resembling, as at the much later  [[Kedleston Hall]], small [[country houses]] in their own right. It was the development of the flanking wings that was to cause English Palladianism to evolve from being a pastiche of Palladio's original work.

Architectural styles evolve and change to suit the requirements of each individual client. When in 1746 the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] decided to rebuild [[Woburn Abbey]], he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect [[Henry Flitcroft]], a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of [[state room]]s replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given [[Palladian window]]s, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir [[Aston Webb]] for his refacing of [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very far removed from the designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.

English Palladian houses were now no longer the small but exquisite weekend retreats from which their Italian counterparts were conceived. They were no longer [[villa]]s but "power houses" in Sir [[John Summerson]]'s term, the symbolic centres of power of the Whig "squirearchy" that ruled Britain. As the Palladian style swept Britain, all thoughts of mathematical proportion were swept away. Rather than square houses with supporting wings, these buildings had the length of the façade as their major consideration; long houses often only one room deep were deliberately deceitful in giving a false impression of size.

=== Irish Palladianism ===
[[File:Russborough-House Part-of-the-facade.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Russborough]], Co. Wicklow: a notable example of Irish Palladianism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iarc.ie/exhibitions/previous-exhibitions/andrea-palladio-1508-1580/|title=Andrea Palladio 1508–1580|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|date=2010|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Palladian revival period in [[Ireland]], even quite modest mansions were cast in a neo-Palladian mould. Palladian architecture in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.

One of the most pioneering Irish architects was Sir [[Edward Lovett Pearce]] (1699–1733), who became one of the leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir [[John Vanbrugh]], he was originally one of his pupils, but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in [[France]] and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. His most important Palladian work is the former [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of [[Drumcondra House]] in 1725 and [[Summerhill House]] in 1731, which was completed after Pearce's death by [[Richard Cassels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sir Edward Lovett Pearce 1699–1733: the Palladian architect and his buildings|first=Pat|last=Sheridan|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=67|issue=2|year=2014|pages=19–25|jstor=24615990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearce oversaw the building of [[Castletown House]], near [[Dublin]], designed by the Italian architect [[Alessandro Galilei]] (1691–1737). It is perhaps the only Palladian house in Ireland to have been built with Palladio's mathematical ratios, and one of the three Irish mansions which claim to have inspired the design of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

Other examples include [[Russborough]], designed by Cassels, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and [[Florence Court]], [[County Fermanagh]]. Irish Palladian [[Country houses]] often feature robust [[Rococo]] plasterwork, frequently executed by the [[Lafranchini brothers]], an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin was built in the 18th century that it set a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin was one of the few cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.

[[File:University of Virginia Rotunda in 2006.jpg|225px|thumb|right|American Palladianism: [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]] at the [[University of Virginia]], designed in the Palladian manner by [[Thomas Jefferson]].]]

=== North American Palladianism ===
Palladio's influence in North America&lt;ref&gt;A brief survey is Robert Tavernor, "Anglo-Palladianism and the birth of a new nation" in ''Palladio and Palladianism'', 1991:181–209; Walter M. Whitehill, '' ''Palladio in America'', 1978 is still the standard work.&lt;/ref&gt; is evident almost from the beginning of architect-designed building there though the Anglo-Irish philosopher, [[George Berkeley]], may have been America's pioneering Palladian. Acquiring a large farmhouse in Middletown, near Newport in the late 1720s, Berkeley dubbed it "Whitehall" and improved it with a Palladian doorcase derived from William Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' (1727), which he may have brought with him from London;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gaustad, ''George Berkeley in America'' (Yale University Press, 1979): "Berkeley's one architectural achievement in the New World" (p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio's work was included in the library of a thousand volumes he amassed for the purpose and sent to [[Yale College]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaustad, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 [[Peter Harrison (architect)|Peter Harrison]] adopted the design of his [[Redwood Library and Athenaeum|Redwood Library]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], more directly from Palladio's ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura|Quattro Libri]]'', while his Brick Market, also in Newport, of a decade later is also Palladian in conception.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/patternbooks.html "Building America."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (''illustration'') is an example of Palladian architecture in the United States. It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in [[Andrea Palladio]]’s ''Quattro Libri''. The house was designed by the architect [[William Buckland (architect)|William Buckland]] in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of [[Anne Arundel County]], [[Maryland]]. It was modeled on the design of the [[Villa Pisani (Montagnana)|Villa Pisani]] in [[Montagnana]], [[Italy]] in Book II, Chapter XIV of ''I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura.''

The politician and architect [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's '' Quattro Libri'' as his [[bible]]. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs for his own beloved [[Monticello]],&lt;ref&gt;Fiske Kimball, ''Thomas Jefferson, Architect'', 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[James Barbour]] [[Barboursville (James Barbour)|Barboursville]] estate, [[Virginia State Capitol]], and the [[University of Virginia]] were based on drawings from Palladio's book.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Nichols, ''Thomas Jefferson's Architectural Drawings'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is quite clearly based on Palladio's [[Villa Capra]], however, with modifications, in a style which is described in America today as [[Colonial Georgian]]. Jefferson's [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], or [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]], at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Palladio's Architecture and Its Influence: A Photographic Guide|year=1980|page=107|author=Joseph C. Farber, [[Henry Hope Reed Jr.|Henry Hope Reed]]|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-23922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Virginia]] and [[The Carolinas|Carolina]], the Palladian manner is epitomised in numerous [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater]] [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]]s, such as [[Stratford Hall Plantation|Stratford Hall]] or [[Westover Plantation]], or [[Drayton Hall]] near [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. These examples are all classic American [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] examples of a Palladian taste that was transmitted through [[engraving]]s, for the benefit of masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American [[colonial architecture]]. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by [[pilaster]]s, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a [[porte-cochere]]; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.

One house which clearly shows this Palladian-Gibbs influence is [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Mount Airy]], in [[Richmond County, Virginia]], built in 1758–62.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Leland M., ''A Concise History of American Architecture'', Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, NY, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Westover Plantation|Westover]] the north and south entrances, made of imported [[Portland stone]], were patterned after a plate in William Salmon's ''Palladio Londinensis'' (1734).&lt;ref&gt;Severens, Kenneth, ''Southern Architecture: 350 Years of Distinctive American Buildings'', E.P. Dutton,  NY 1981 p 37; specifically, both doors seem to have been derived from plates XXV and XXVI of ''Palladio Londinensis'', a builders guide first published in London in 1734, the very year when the doorways may have been installed. (Morrison, High, ''American's First Architecture: From the First Colonial Settlements to the National Period.'' Oxford University Press, NY  1952  p. 340).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Province House (Nova Scotia).jpg|300px|thumb|[[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Nova Scotia Legislature Building]], sandstone, 1819.]]

The distinctive feature of [[Drayton Hall]], its two-storey portico, was derived directly from Palladio.&lt;ref&gt;Severens, Kenneth, ''Southern Architecture: 350 Years of Distinctive American Buildings'', E.P. Dutton,  NY 1981 p 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoclassical presidential mansion, the [[White House]] in Washington, was inspired by Irish Palladianism. Both Castle Coole and Richard Cassel's [[Leinster House]] in Dublin claim to have inspired the architect [[James Hoban]], who designed the executive mansion, built between 1792 and 1800. Hoban, born in [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]], [[County Kilkenny]], in 1762, studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built c. 1747) was one of the finest buildings at the time. The White House is more neoclassical than Palladian; particularly the South façade, which closely resembles [[James Wyatt]]'s 1790 design for [[Castle Coole]], also in Ireland. Castle Coole is, in the words of the architectural commentator Gervase Jackson-Stops, "A culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson-Stops p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America was that the piano nobile now tended to be placed on the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the tradition in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.

The only two houses in the United States—from the English colonial period (1607–1776)—that can be definitively attributed to designs from the ''Four Books of Architecture'' are architect William Buckland's [[Hammond-Harwood House]] (1774) in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], and Thomas Jefferson's first Monticello. The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at [[Montagnana]] (Book II, Chapter XIV), and for the first Monticello (1770) the design source is [[Villa Cornaro]] at [[Piombino Dese]] (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and pristine example of direct modeling in America today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondharwoodhouse.org/index.php?id=33|title=The Palladian Connection|publisher=Hammond-Harwood House Association|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its later development, Palladian architecture in Canada is rare. One notable example is the [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Nova Scotia Legislature building]], completed in 1819.  Another example is [[Government House (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Government House]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]].
 
[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a non-profit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio’s influence in the United States.

== Legacy ==
 
By the 1770s, in Britain, such architects as [[Robert Adam]] and Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] were in huge popular demand, but they were now drawing on a great variety of classical sources, including ancient [[Greece]], so much so that their forms of architecture were eventually defined as [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] rather than Palladian. In Europe, the Palladian revival ended by the end of the 18th century. In North America, Palladianism lingered a little longer; Thomas Jefferson's floor plans and elevations owe a great deal to Palladio's ''Quattro Libri.'' The term "Palladian" today is often misused, and tends to describe a building with any classical pretensions. There was, however, a revival of Palladian ideas amongst the colonial revivalists of the early 20th century, and the strain has been unbroken, even through the modernist period.

In the mid-20th century, the originality of the approach of the architectural historian [[Colin Rowe]] had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged the Palladian architecture as an active influence. In the later 20th century, when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design. If "the presence of the past" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] to [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Oswald Matthias Ungers]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Michael Graves]] and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional "rules" in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar "rules" in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches.&lt;ref name="Other Essays 1976"&gt;''The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa and Other Essays'', MIT Press, Main essay reprinted in collected works volume, (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical assessment of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but side by side in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Other Essays 1976"/&gt;

A number of different techniques are applicable, almost all of which are adaptations of [[acid gas removal]] processes used in the chemical and [[petrochemical]] industries. Many of these techniques existed before World War II and, consequently, post combustion capture is the most developed of the various carbon-capture methodologies.

A '''programmable thermostat''' is a [[thermostat]] which is designed to adjust the temperature according to a series of programmed settings that take effect at different times of the day. Programmable thermostats may also be called '''setback thermostats''' or '''clock thermostats'''.

== Benefits ==
[[File:ThermostatinBurkesOutlet.jpg|thumb|[[Honeywell]] electronic thermostat in a store]]
Heating and cooling losses from a building (or any other container) become greater as the difference in temperature increases. A programmable thermostat allows reduction of these losses by allowing the temperature difference to be reduced at times when the reduced amount of heating or cooling would not be objectionable.

For example, during cooling season, a programmable thermostat used in a home may be set to allow the temperature in the house to rise during the workday when no one will be at home. It may then be set to turn on the air conditioning before the arrival of occupants, allowing the house to be cool upon the arrival of the occupants while still having saved air conditioning energy during the peak outdoor temperatures. The reduced cooling required during the day also decreases the demands placed upon the electrical supply grid.

Conversely, during the heating season, the programmable thermostat may be set to allow the temperature in the house to drop when the house is unoccupied during the day and also at night after all occupants have gone to bed, re-heating the house prior to the occupants arriving home in the evening or waking up in the morning. Since most people sleep better when a room is cooler and the temperature differential between the interior and exterior of a building will be greatest on a cold winter night, this reduces energy losses.

Similar scenarios are available in commercial buildings, with due consideration of the building's occupancy patterns.

According to ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' magazine, programmable thermostats can reduce energy bills by about $180 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/thermostats/buying-guide.htm|title=Best Thermostat Buying Guide – Consumer Reports|work=consumerreports.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
While programmable thermostats may be able to save energy when used correctly, little or no average energy savings has been demonstrated in residential field studies.  Difficulty with usability in residential environments appears to lead to lack of persistence of energy savings in homes.  According to the US EPA regarding residential programmable thermostat, "Available studies indicate no savings from programmable thermostat (PT) installation. Some studies indicate slight increased consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shiller|first1=David|title=Programmable Thermostat Program Proposal|url=https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/thermostats/Proposal_011106.pdf|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is supported with studies by Nevius and Pigg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Energy and Housing in Wisconsin(A Study of Single-Family Owner-Occupied Homes) |url=http://www.ecw.org/ecwresults/199-1.pdf |accessdate=23 September  2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402211946/http://www.ecw.org/ecwresults/199-1.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross and Judd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.cee1.org/content/automassachusettstic-setback-thermostats-measure-persistence-and-customer-behavioregon/|title=Automatic Setback Thermostats: Measure Persistence and Customer Behavior|work=cee1.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others and Peffer et al.&lt;ref&gt;http://eec.ucdavis.edu/files/How_people_use_thermostats_in_homes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has a recent review of the topic.

In addition to potential increased energy consumption, digital programmable thermostats have been criticised for their poor usability. Several studies have found that digital programmable thermostats are difficult for users to programme&lt;ref name="Combe et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Combe|first=Nicola|title=Assessing the number of users who are excluded by domestic heating controls|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19397038.2010.491563|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and older people in particular can struggle to use them (see Combe et al.&lt;ref name="Combe et al."&gt;{{cite web|last=Combe|first=Nicola|title=An investigation into usability and exclusivity issues of digital programmable thermostats|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09544828.2011.599027|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

It has been noted that the use of programmable thermostats is hampered by misconception about the setback feature, reducing the amount of heating or cooling in a building needs for a short time (e.g. at night or when it is unoccupied). The belief is that if the building is allowed to change temperature, its heating or cooling system has to "work harder" to bring it back to a comfortable temperature, counteracting or even exceeding the energy saved during reduced heating or cooling. Actually the setback and recovery feature can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent as the [[heat transfer]] between a structure and its environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermostats U.S. Department of Energy/energy.gov, Home » Thermostats]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.achrnews.com/articles/98114-programmable-thermostat-myths-know-the-facts-and-boost-your-profits Programmable thermostat myths: Know the facts and boost your profits, The Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration NEWS/achrnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction and features ==

=== Clock thermostats ===
[[File:OfficeThermostat.jpg|thumb|[[Honeywell]] office thermostat]]
The most basic clock thermostats may only implement one program with two periods (a hotter period and a colder period), and the same program is run day after day. More sophisticated clock thermostats may allow four or more hot and cold periods to be set per day. Usually, only two distinct temperatures (a hotter temperature and a colder temperature) can be set, even if multiple periods are permitted. The hotter and colder temperatures are usually established simply by sliding two levers along an analogue temperature scale, much the same as in a conventional (non-clock) thermostat.

This design, while simple to manufacture and relatively easy to program, sacrifices comfort on weekends since the program is repeated each of the seven days of the week with no variation. To overcome this deficit, a push-button is sometimes provided to allow the user to explicitly switch (once) the current period from  hot period to a cold period or vice versa; the usual use of this button is to over-ride a "set back" that takes place during the workday when the home is normally unoccupied.

The clock mechanism is electrical. Two methods have commonly been used to operate it:

[1] A separate, continuous source of [[Volt|24 volts alternating current]] (24 VAC) is provided to the thermostat.

[2] A [[Nickel–cadmium battery|rechargeable battery]] in the thermostat operates the clock. This battery charges when the thermostat is not calling for heat and 24 VAC is available to it. It discharges to operate the clock when the thermostat is set for heating or cooling.

=== Digital thermostats ===
[[Image:A touch-screen programmable thermostat.jpg|right|thumb|A touch-screen programmable thermostat in programming mode.]]
Digital thermostats may implement the same functions, but most provide more versatility. For example, they commonly allow setting temperatures for two, four, or six periods each day, and rather than being limited to a single "hotter" temperature and a single "colder" temperature, digital thermostats usually allow each period to be set to a unique temperature. The periods are commonly labeled "Morning", "Day", "Evening", and "Night", although nothing constrains the time intervals involved. Digital thermostats usually allow the user to override the programmed temperature for the period, automatically resuming programmed temperatures when the next period begins. A function to "hold" (lock-in) the current temperature is usually provided as well; in this case, the override temperature is maintained until the user cancels the hold or a programmed event occurs to resume the normal program. More-sophisticated models will allow for the release of the hold to take place at a set time in the future.

As with clock thermostats, basic digital thermostats may have just one cycle that is run every day of the week. More-sophisticated thermostats may have a weekday schedule and a separate weekend schedule (so-called "5-2" setting) or separate Saturday and Sunday schedules (so-called "5-1-1" settings), while other thermostats will offer a separate schedule for each day of the week ("7 day" settings).  The selection of which days are defined as the "weekend" is arbitrary, depending on the user's heating and cooling schedule requirements. Often, a manufacturer will sell three similar thermostats offering each of those levels of functionality, and there is no obvious difference in the thermostats other than the factory programming and the price.&lt;ref&gt;Operation as a 5-2, 5-1-1 or 7-day thermostat is fixed by design and cannot be altered by the end user.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most digital thermostats have separate programs for heating and cooling, and may feature a digital or manual switch to turn on the furnace blower for air circulation, even when the system isn't heating or cooling. More-sophisticated models may be programmed to run the circulating fan for a brief 5- to 10-minute period in the event a heating or cooling cycle has not taken place during the previous hour. This is particularly useful in buildings subject to stratification where without frequent air circulation, hot air rises and separates from the cooler air that falls.

Digital thermostats may also have a user-programmable air filter change reminder; this counts the accumulated run-time of the heating/cooling system and reminds the user when it is time to change the filter. The feature often displays the accumulated run-time either as an aggregate of both heating and cooling or displaying each time separately.

Some digital thermostats have the capability of being programmed using a touch-tone telephone or over the [[Internet]], such as the [[Nest Learning Thermostat]].

Digital thermostats are usually powered one of three ways:
* A sophisticated power circuit operates from the 24 VAC supply when the thermostat is ''not'' calling, and operates from the current flowing in the thermostat circuit when the thermostat ''is'' calling. A battery is used to provide back-up during power failures.
* A rechargeable battery operates the thermostat just as in the clock thermostat, charging when the thermostat is not calling and discharging while the thermostat is calling.
* A non-rechargeable battery always powers the thermostat. To limit the amount of power drawn from the battery, such thermostats use an [[impulse relay]] that does not require the continuous application of power to the relay's coil. These thermostats can be used on millivolt circuits, as well as conventional 24 VAC circuits.  Battery life is typically one to two years.

===Digital thermostats with PID controller===
More expensive models have a built-in [[PID controller]], so that the thermostat learns how the system will react to its commands. Programming the morning temperature to be 21° [[Celsius|C]] at 7:00 AM, for instance, makes sure that at that time the temperature will be 21&amp;nbsp;°C. A standard programmable thermostat would simply start working toward 21° at 7:00 AM. The PID controller decides at what time the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time. It knows this by remembering the past behavior of the room, and the current temperature of the room. This is called optimal start.

Process control or industrial thermostat also makes sure that the temperature is very stable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartpid.com/smart-thermostat/|title=Smart PID controller}}&lt;/ref&gt;(for instance, by reducing first overshoot and fluctuation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/blog/temperature-controllers-using-hysteresis|title=Temperature Controllers Using Hysteresis}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of the heating cycle) so that the comfort level is increased.

=== Commercial thermostats ===

In commercial applications, the thermostat may not contain any clock mechanism. Instead, another means may be used to select between the "hotter" and "colder" settings. For example, if the thermostat uses [[Pneumatics|pneumatic controls]], a change in the air pressure supplied to the thermostat may select between the "hotter" and "colder" settings, and this air pressure is determined by a central regulator. With electronic controls, a specific signal may indicate whether to operate at the "hotter" or "colder" setting.

'''Relationship Management Application''' ('''RMA''') is a service provided by [[SWIFT]] to manage the business relationships between financial institutions.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=57203 | title=RMA – Taking relationship management to a new level | publisher= S.W.I.F.T.

RMA operates by managing which message types are permitted to be exchanged between users of a SWIFT service:&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;
* the receiver specifies which message types are permitted, and sends this permission data to the sender,
* the sender checks the message type against the permission data before sending a message to the receiver.

RMA uses a [[SWIFTNet InterAct Store and Forward]] service to exchange the permission data between financial institutions.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=61595 | title=RMA Planning Guide | publisher= S.W.I.F.T.

'''Scotlandite''' is a [[sulfite]] mineral first discovered in a mine at [[Leadhills#Mining|Leadhills]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], an area known to [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] and [[geologist]]s for its wide range of different mineral species found in the veins that lie deep in the mine shafts. This specific mineral is found in the Susanna vein of [[Leadhills]], where the crystals are formed as chisel-shaped or bladed.&lt;ref name=earthwise /&gt; Scotlandite was actually the first naturally occurring [[sulfite]], which has the ideal chemical formula of [[Lead|Pb]][[Sulfur|S]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The mineral has been approved by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, IMA, to be named scotlandite for Scotland.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scotlandite is found in association with [[pyromorphite]], [[anglesite]], [[lanarkite]], [[leadhillite]], [[susannite]], and [[barite]]. It occurs in cavities in massive [[barite]] and [[anglesite]], and is closely associated with [[lanarkite]] and [[susannite]]. Scotlandite represents the latest phase in the crystallization sequence of the associated lead secondary minerals.  It can often be found in the vuggy [[anglesite]] as yellowish single crystals up to 1 millimeter in length that sometimes arrange in a fan-shaped aggregates.  [[Anglesite]] can usually be recognized in a very thin coating on scotlandite which is used to protect the [[sulfite]] from further oxidation.  A second variety of scotlandite can also occur in discontinuously distributed cavities between the [[anglesite]] mass containing the first variety and the [[barite]] matrix. This variety is characterized by tiny, whitish to water-clear crystals, and crystal clusters less than one millimeter in size, which encrust large portions of the interior of the cavities. Scotlandite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scotlandite is a pale yellow, greyish-white, colorless, transparent mineral with an adamantine or pearly luster. It exhibits a hardness of 2 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]].&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scotlandite occurs as chisel-shaped or bladed crystals elongated along the c-axis, with a tendency to form radiating clusters. Its crystals are characterized by the {100}, {010}, {011}, {021}, {031}, and {032}.  [[Miller Index|faces]]. Scotlandite shows perfect cleavage along the {100} plane and a less good one along the {010} plane. The measured density is 6.37 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scotlandite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. The mineral is optically [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], 2V&lt;sub&gt;meas.&lt;/sub&gt; 35° 24'(Na). The refractive indices are: α ~ 2.035, β ~ 2.040, and γ ~ 2.085 (Na). Dispersion is strong, v &gt;&gt; r. The extinction is β//b, and α [001] = 20° (γ [100] = 4° in the obtuse angle β. H(Mohs) &lt; 2. D = 6.37 and calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.40 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;  The [[infrared spectrum]] of scotlandite shows conclusively that it is an anhydrous [[sulfite]], with no OH groups or other polyatomic anions being present. It is also proven by [[electron microprobe]] analysis and [[infrared spectroscopy]] that scotlandite must be a polymorph of lead sulfite.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scotlandite is a [[sulfite]] compared with chemically related compounds, it is very close to the value of [[anglesite]] (6.38 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;), but distinctly different from that of [[lanarkite]] (6.92 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Orthorhombic]] lead sulfite is of higher density (D&lt;sub&gt;meas&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.54, calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.56 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), and has the same chemical properties as well.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The empirical chemical formula for scotlandite calculated on the basis of Pb+S = 2, is Pb&lt;sub&gt;l.06&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.94&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2.94&lt;/sub&gt; or more ideally PbSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt;

|}&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
A small crystal of scotlandite, showing some cleavage faces, was examined using Weissenberg and precession techniques. Scotlandite is in the [[monoclinic]] crystal system. The only systematic extinctions observed from the single crystal patterns were 0k0 where k was odd. Thus the possible [[space group]] is either P2 or P2/m. The unit cell parameters obtained from the single crystal study were used to index the X-ray powder pattern and were then refined with the indexed powder data.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The results are: a = 4.505&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]], b = 5.333&amp;nbsp;Å, c = 6.405&amp;nbsp;Å; β= 106.24°; Z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. If the present a and c axes are interchanged, the unit cell of scotlandite is very similar, isotypic, to that of [[molybdomenite]], PbSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Lead is coordinated to nine oxygen atoms with Pb-O&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;=2.75 Å, and possibly further to one sulfur atom with Pb−S=3.46 Å.  The average S−O distance in the pyramidal SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group is 1.52 Å.&lt;ref name=springer /&gt;

'''Spinosad''' is an [[insecticide]] based on chemical compounds found in the bacterial species ''[[Saccharopolyspora spinosa]]''. The genus ''[[Saccharopolyspora]]'' was discovered in 1985 in isolates from crushed [[sugarcane]] which produce yellowish-pink aerial [[hyphae]], with bead-like chains of spores enclosed in a characteristic hairy sheath.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mertz|first=Frederick|author2=Raymond C.

''S. spinosa'' was isolated from soil collected inside a nonoperational sugar mill rum still in the Virgin Islands. Spinosad is a mixture of chemical compounds in the spinosyn family that has a generalized structure consisting of a unique tetracyclic ring system attached to an [[amino sugar]] (&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-forosamine) and a neutral sugar (tri-''Ο''-methyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-rhamnose).&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qiao|first=Meihua|author2=Daniel E.

Spinosad is highly active, by both contact and ingestion, in numerous insect species.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertlein|first=Mark|author2=Gary D. Thompson |author3=Bhadriraju Subramanyam |author4=Christos G.

It affects certain species only in the adult stage, but can affect other species at more than one life stage. The species subject to very high rates of mortality as larvae, but not as adults, may gradually be controlled through sustained larval mortality.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;  The mode of action of spinosoid insecticides is by a neural mechanism.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Nailah|author2=Andrew J. Shaffner |author3=Kimberly Richey |author4=Gary D. Crouse |title=Novel mode of action of spinosad: Receptor binding studies demonstrating lack of interaction with known insecticidal target sites|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|date=30 April 2009|volume=95|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spinosyns and spinosoids have a novel mode of action, primarily targeting binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the insect nervous system that are distinct from those at which other insecticides have their activity. Spinosoid binding leads to disruption of acetylcholine neurotransmission.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Spinosad also has secondary effects as a γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter agonist.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; It kills insects by hyperexcitation of the insect nervous system.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Spinosad so far has proven not to cause cross-resistance to any other known insecticide.&lt;ref name=six&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Thomas|author2=Gary D crouse |author3=Gregory Durst |title=Natural products as insecticides: the biology, biochemistry and quantitative structure-activity relationships of spinosyns and spinosoids|journal=pest manag sci|date=30 March 2001|volume=57|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Spinosad has been used around the world for the control of a variety of insect pests, including [[Lepidoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Thysanoptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Orthoptera]], and [[Hymenoptera]], and many others.&lt;ref name=eight&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Thomas|author2=James E. Dripps |author3=Gerald B Watson |author4=Doris Paroonagian |title=Resistance and cross-resistance to the spinosyns- A review and analysis|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|date=6 November 2012|pages=1–10|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/pest|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first registered as a pesticide in the United States for use on crops in 1997.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt;  Its labeled use rate is set at 1 ppm (1&amp;nbsp;mg a.i./kg of grain) and its maximum residue limit (MRL) or tolerance is set at 1.5 ppm. Spinosad’s widespread commercial launch was deferred, awaiting final MRL or tolerance approvals in a few remaining grain-importing countries. It is considered a natural product, thus is approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous nations.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; Two other uses for spinosad are for pets and humans. Spinosad has recently been used in oral preparations (as Comfortis) to treat ''[[Ctenocephalides felis|C. felis]]'', the cat flea, in canines and felines; the optimal dose set for canines is reported to be 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=four /&gt;

Trade names include Comfortis and Trifexis (which also includes [[milbemycin oxime]]) (both brands treat adult fleas on pets; the latter also prevents [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworm disease]]), and Natroba (for human head lice).   It is commonly used to kill [[thrips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/spinosad.html |title=Spinosad - brand name list from |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vmth/small_animal/dermatology/newsletters.cfm |title=UC Davis School of Vet Med: |publisher=Vetmed.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/biting-stinging/others/ent-3001/ |title=Safer Flea Control &amp;#124; Insects in the City |publisher=Citybugs.tamu.edu |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinosyn A==
Spinosyn A does not appear to interact directly with known insecticidal-relevant target sites, but rather acts via a novel mechanism.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; Spinosyn A resembles a GABA antagonist and is comparable to the effect of [[avermectin]] on insect neurons.&lt;ref name=five /&gt; Spinosyn A is highly active against neonate larvae of the tobacco budworm, ''[[Heliothis virescens]]'', and is slightly more biologically active than spinosyn D. In general, spinosyns possessing a methyl group at C6 (spinosyn D-related analogs) tend to be more active and less affected by changes in the rest of the molecule.&lt;ref name= six /&gt; Spinosyn A is slow to penetrate to the internal fluids of larvae; it is also poorly metabolized once it enters the insect.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; The apparent lack of spinosyn A metabolism may contribute to its high level of activity, and may compensate for the slow rate of penetration.&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

==Safety and ecotoxicology==
Spinosad has high efficacy, a broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and a good environmental profile, a unique feature of the insecticide compared to others currently used for the protection of grain products.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; It is regarded as [[natural product]]-based, and approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous national and international certifications.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}
Ecotoxicology parameters have been reported for spinosad, and are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entomology.tfrec.wsu.edu/jfbhome/growerarticles/newchems/newchems.pdf|title=Codling Moth and Leafroller Control Using Chemicals|publisher=Entomology.tfrec.wsu.edu|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11311">'''The Open Group''' is an industry consortium that seeks to "enable the achievement of business objectives" by developing "[[Open-source model|open]], vendor-neutral technology standards and certifications". It has over 625 members and provides a number of services, including strategy, management, innovation and research, standards, certification, and test development.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.opengroup.org/aboutus|website=The Open Group|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1996 when [[X/Open]] merged with the [[Open Software Foundation]].

The Open Group is the certifying body for the [[UNIX]] [[trademark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/ |title=The Open Brand |publisher=Opengroup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishes the [[Single UNIX Specification]] technical standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/ |title=The Online Single UNIX Specification |publisher=Unix.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extends the [[POSIX]] standards. The Open Group also develops and manages the [[TOGAF]] standard, which is an industry standard [[enterprise architecture framework]].&lt;ref name="opengroup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/ |title=TOGAF |publisher=Opengroup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The over 625 members include a range of IT buyers and vendors as well as government agencies, including, for example, [[Capgemini]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HPE]], [[Orbus Software]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Huawei]], [[Philips]], [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]].

== History ==

By the early 1990s, the major UNIX system vendors had begun to realize that the standards rivalries (often called the "[[Unix wars]]") were causing all participants more harm than good, leaving the UNIX industry open to emerging competition from [[Microsoft]].  The [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] initiative in 1993 can be considered to be the first unification step and the merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] (OSF) and [[X/Open]] in 1996 as the ultimate step in the end of those skirmishes. OSF had previously merged with [[UNIX International]] in 1994, meaning that the new entity effectively represented all elements of the Unix community of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050601125916588 |title=The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin|last=Salus|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H. Salus|publisher=Groklaw.net |date= |accessdate= 2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1997, the responsibility for the [[X Window System]] was transferred to The Open Group from the defunct [[X Consortium]]. In 1999, X.Org was formed to manage the X Window System, with management services provided by The Open Group. The X.Org members made a number of releases up to and including X11R6.8 while The Open Group provided management services. In 2004, X.Org and The Open Group worked together to establish the newly formed [[X.Org Foundation]] who then took control of the x.org domain name, and the stewardship of the X Window System. (See [[X Window System#History|the history of the X Window System]].)

== Programs ==

=== Certification ===
The Open Group's best-known services are their certification programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/ |title=Certifications |publisher=The Open Group |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; including certification for products and best practices: [[POSIX]], [[Lotteries in the United States|North American State Lotteries Association]] (NASPL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/services-to-consortia |title=Certification For Consortia and Associations |publisher=The Open Group |accessdate=2014-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNIX]].

The Open Group offers certifications for IT professionals. In addition to [[TOGAF]] certification which covers tools, services and people certification, The Open Group also administers the Open Group Certified Architect (Open CA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.opengroup.org/certifications/professional/open-ca |title=Certified Architect (Open CA) Program |publisher=The Open Group |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; program and the Open Group Certified IT Specialist (Open CITS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.opengroup.org/certifications/professional/open-cits |title=Certified IT Specialist (Open CITS) Program |publisher=The Open Group |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; certification program; the latter are skills and experience based certification programs.
The Open Group also offers certification for [[ArchiMate]] tools and people, as well as people certification for [[Open FAIR]] and [[IT4IT]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8519">'''Thermal Work Limit''' (TWL) is defined as the limiting (or maximum) sustainable metabolic rate that well-hydrated, acclimatized individuals can maintain in a specific thermal environment, within a safe deep body core temperature (&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{convert|38.2|°C|°F|disp=or}}) and sweat rate (&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{convert|1.2|kg|lb|disp=or|abbr=on}} per hour).{{r|Brake Bates 2002}} The index is designed for self-paced workers and does not rely on estimation of actual metabolic rates, a process that is difficult and subject to considerable error. The index has been introduced into the [[United Arab Emirates]]{{r|UAE}} and [[Australia]], resulting in a substantial and sustained fall in the incidence of heat illness in the latter.{{r|Miller Bates 2007}}

== History ==
The idea of a thermal work limit (TWL) was developed by Dr. Graham Bates and Dr. Derrick Brake in 1997.{{r|98 Paper}} Over the past 80 years, many heat stress indices have been developed to assist with the management of heat stress problems. Some of these have been developed for particular industries and empirically derived such as ISO 7933 and [[Wet Bulb Globe Temperature|WBGT]]. {{r|97 Handbook}}{{r|ISO 7933}} These indices required estimation of metabolic rate but failed to consider the direct measurement of wind speed, reduction of work rate, location and time shift during work and removal of clothing, making these indices not accurate for self-paced and acclimatized workers.{{r|Hansen}}{{r|Bricknell}}
The need for a heat stress index designed primarily for self-paced workers has led to the development of the thermal work limit (TWL). TWL and its accompanying management protocols have been introduced into several industrial operations where workers are subject to thermal stress. Approximately 1400 persons work in these locations with over 10 million man-shifts being worked between 1965 and 1995 at wet bulb temperatures in excess of {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Since the introduction of TWL-based policies in the Australian mining industry, the amount of [[man-hour]]s lost due to serious heat illness has fallen from 12 million to 6 million, and the amount lost due to all heat illness incidences has fallen from 31 million to 18 million.{{r|Brake Bates 2000}}

== Theory ==
The basic purpose of the thermal work limit index is to calculate the maximum metabolic rate, in watts of metabolic heat per square meter of body surface area, that can be continuously expended in a particular thermal environment, in order to keep the body within safe physiological limits. The TWL is an integrated measure of the dry bulb, wet bulb, wind speed and radiant heat. From these variables, and taking into consideration the type of clothing worn and acclimatization state of the worker, the TWL predicts the maximum level of work that can be carried out in a given environment, without workers exceeding a safe core body temperature {{convert|38.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and sweat rate. In excessively hot conditions, the index can also determine the safe work duration, thus providing guidelines for work/rest cycling. Sweat rates are also calculated, so the level of fluid replacement necessary to avoid dehydration can be established.
The thermal work limit algorithm builds on work originated by Mitchell and Whillier,{{r|Mitchell Whillier}} who developed an index “specific cooling power,” which subsequently became known as “air cooling power” (ACP). 
[[File:TWL working zone.png|thumbnail|TWL calculation sheet, Abu Dhabi]]

== Methodology ==
To determine TWL the following must be measured{{r|UAE}}:
*	[[Dry bulb temperature|Dry Bulb Temperature]] (ambient air temperature) (in degrees °C)
*	[[Wet-bulb temperature|Wet Bulb Temperature]] (determined by the humidity/evaporation) (in degrees °C)
*	[[Mean radiant temperature|Globe Temperature]] (determined by the radiant heat) (in degrees °C)
*	[[Wind speed]] in meters per second
The thermal environment can be classified on the basis of TWL into the working zones shown in the adjacent image.

The TWL heat stress index is the heat stress index that has been included in the Abu Dhabi EHSMS code of practice for the management of Heat Stress.{{r|EHSMS}} TWL gives a measure of the maximum safe work rate for the environmental conditions present at a worksite. If TWL is too low then even low rates of work cannot safely be carried out continuously and extra rest breaks and other precautions are needed to ensure worker safety.{{r|Brake Bates 2000}}

'''Thermo Electron Corporation''' ([[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]: TMO) (incorporated 1956) was a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains. It was co-founded in 1956 by [[George N. Hatsopoulos]], an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] PhD in [[mechanical engineering]], and [[Peter M. Nomikos]], a [[Harvard Business School]] graduate.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/founders/Thermo.html Company founding&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Northeastern University in 1959 [[John Hatsopoulos]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=760477&amp;privcapId=30029621&lt;/ref&gt; (brother of George) joined the company as CFO. [[Arvin Smith]] joined the company in 1970, and was President from January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1122456&amp;privcapId=29977788&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], its successor, had revenues of over $11 billion, and employed 37,000 people.

On May 14, 2006, Thermo and [[Fisher Scientific]] announced that they would [[Mergers and acquisitions|merge]] in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The merged company became [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].

It is found in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Europe]].

==Description==
''Thlaspi caerulescens'' is a low biennial or perennial plant that has small basal rosettes of stalked elliptic–lanceolate leaves with entire margins. The one or more flowering stems have small stalkless, alternate leaves clasping the stem. The inflorescence is a dense raceme which continues to lengthen after flowering. The individual flowers are regular, with white or pinkish petals and are about {{convert|5|mm|1|abbr=on}} wide. Each has four sepals, four petals, six stamens (four long and two short) with violet anthers, and a single carpel. The fruit is many-seeded and narrowly spatulate and has a notched tip. This plant flowers in late spring.&lt;ref name=NatureGate/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
In Europe it is found in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], in all but the most northerly regions. It is also found in the [[Alps]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Pyrenees]], eastern [[Norway]], southern [[Germany]], and northern [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/brassica/thlas/thlacae.html |title=Backskärvfrö |author= |date=25 October 2004 |work=Den virtuella flora |publisher=Naturhistoriska riksmuseet |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a plant of dry hillside meadows, forest margins, banks, gardens, lawns, pastures, field margins, yards and bare places.&lt;ref name=NatureGate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/kukkakasvit/alpine-pennycress |title=Alpine Pennycress |publisher=NatureGate |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phytoremediation==
Alpine pennycress has been cited in [[phytoremediation]] to have special [[phytoextraction]]al properties and is known to absorb [[cadmium]] with very good results and in certain instances is said to have absorbed [[zinc]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Comis, D. |year=2000 |title=Phytoremediation: using plants to clean up soils |publisher=Agricultural Research |accessdate=4 March 2006 |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jun00/soil0600.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">A '''three-way hybrid''' set-top box is a hybrid device typically used by Pay TV operators and Telecommunications service providers to converge content delivered via three different video transport networks – [[satellite]], [[Cable television|terrestrial]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [managed or public Internet].  Three-way Hybrid [or tribrid] Set-Top Boxes enable consumers to navigate between a wide range of content quickly and intuitively, and view it all on the main household TV set.

One of the first operators to deploy a tribrid platform is ITI Neovision's [[n (Poland)|n]] in [[Poland]], which rolled out their Turbo Dekoder HD in December 2009 using [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]]'s ADB-5720SX.  The n deployment won the 2010 IP TV World Forum award for Best Interactive TV service and "best in show" awards.

A '''toy program''' is a small [[computer program]] typically used for educational purposes. Toy programs are generally of little practical use, although the concepts implemented may be useful in a much more sophisticated program.

A toy program typically focuses on a specific problem, such as computing the Nth term in a sequence, finding the roots of a [[quadratic equation]] and testing if a number is [[prime number|prime]].

Toy programs  are also used for a developer trying out a new programming language, to test all of the language's syntax and coding methods.

In an effort to reduce mounting traffic congestion problems and improve environmental conditions, a number of Chinese mega-cities, including [[Beijing]] and [[Shenzhen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cervero|title=The Transit Metropolis|date=2007|publisher=Chinese Architecture and Building Press|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transit Metropolis Forum shapes sustainable transport trends for China’s urban future [http://www.wrirosscities.org/news/transit-metropolis-forum-shapes-sustainable-transport-trends-china%E2%80%99s-urban-future]&lt;/ref&gt;, have embraced the transit metropolis model for guiding urban growth and public-transport investment decisions.

Around the world, mass transit have been struggling to compete with private automobile and in many places its market is eroding.  Transit metropolis and [[Transit-oriented development|TOD]] are among the planning strategies being introduced to help reserve ridership losses and advance more sustainable patterns of urban development.

Transit metropolises recognize that one or two [[Transit-oriented development|TODs]] as islands in a sea of automobile-oriented development (AOD) will do little to get people out of cars and into trains and buses.  Only when [[Transit-oriented development|TODs]] are organized along linear corridors, as in [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]] and [[Curitiba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suzuki|first1=Hiroaki|last2=Cervero|first2=Robert|last3=Iuchi|first3=Kanako|title=Transforming Cities with Transit: Transit and Land Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development|date=2013|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington|isbn=9780821397459}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rede Integrada de Transporte|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Integrada_de_Transporte|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or inter-connected by high-capacity transit at a regional scale can they significantly reduce car-dependence and improve environmental conditions.

==Description==
Semiconductor films need low dielectric constants (k-values) for optimal [[thermal conductivity]], to ensure [[semiconductor scaling]].  Newer dielectric films used to insulate modern chips can be easily damaged, causing them to lose their insulating capacity.  Specialized treatments applied with ultraviolet light improve chip performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_dissertations/1028/ |title=Photo-thermal Processing of Semiconductor Fibers and Thin Films|publisher=clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tungsten halogen lamps are the sources used for traditional rapid thermal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/70/13/10.1063/1.118674 |title=Low temperature shallow junction formation using vacuum ultraviolet photons during rapid thermal processing  |publisher=scitation.aip.org |date=1996-05-13 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SD3JZG6eAFMC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=uv+thermal+processing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KrNvc5uto2&amp;sig=zqPn70b0Wkis48o4ZOuJFCh_7Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTlYbDj8HMAhVCWCYKHX70DlUQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=uv%20thermal%20processing&amp;f=false |title=Rapid Thermal Processing for Future Semiconductor Devices |publisher=Elsevier Science B.V. |date= |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1879">'''Unmanned aircraft system traffic management''' (UTM) is an air traffic management ecosystem under development for autonomously controlled operations of [[unmanned aerial system]]s (UAS) by the [[FAA]], [[NASA]], other federal partner agencies, and industry. They are collaboratively exploring concepts of operation, data exchange requirements, and a supporting framework to enable multiple UAS operations beyond visual line-of-sight at altitudes under 400 ft above ground level in airspace where FAA air traffic services are not provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM)|url=https://www.faa.gov/uas/research/utm/|website=www.faa.gov|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en-us}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UTM is separate from but complementary to the FAA's Air Traffic Management ([[air traffic management|ATM]]) system. UTM development will ultimately identify services, roles/responsibilities, information architecture, data exchange protocols, software functions, infrastructure, and performance requirements for enabling the management of low-altitude uncontrolled UAS operations.

A Research Transition Team (RTT) has been established between the FAA, NASA and industry to coordinate the UTM initiative. Areas of focus include concept and use case development, data exchange and information architecture, communications and navigation, and sense and avoid. Research and testing will identify airspace operations requirements to enable safe visual and beyond visual line-of-sight UAS flights in low-altitude airspace. FAA published a UAS Traffic Management Research Plan in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/uas/research/utm/media/FAA_NASA_UAS_Traffic_Management_Research_Plan.pdf UAS Traffic Management Research Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''W64''' [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]] was the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Laboratory]]'s entry into a brief competition between [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]] and Los Alamos to design an "enhanced-radiation" nuclear warhead (i.e., a "[[neutron bomb]]") for the [[United States Army]]'s [[MGM-52 Lance]] tactical [[surface-to-surface missile]]. In July 1964, both Livermore Labs and Los Alamos started developing competing warheads for the Lance. The Los Alamos design, the W64, was canceled in September 1964 in favor of Livermore's W63. In November 1966, the [[W63]] was canceled in favor of the [[W70]], the model that finally entered production.

ENSCI–Les Ateliers, the '''École nationale supérieure de création industrielle''', is a [[France|French]] design school located in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]]. As a [[Établissement public à caractère industriel et commercial|public commercial and industrial establishment]] under authority of both the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] and the [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Ministry of Industry]], it is the first and only French national institute exclusively devoted to the advanced studies in [[design]]. It is a member of the [[Hautes Études-Sorbonne-Arts et Métiers]] cluster and of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles]].

The school was founded in 1982 under the sponsorship of [[Jean Prouvé]] and [[Charlotte Perriand]], and have been established in the same building that once housed the ''Ateliers Saint-Sabin'' of the [[Maison Jansen]], hence its name; its premises are open 24 hours a day and seven days a week, enabling students to work according to their own production schedules and patterns. It has been classed number one design school in the Americas &amp; Europe region by the 2011 [[Red Dot|Red Dot Award: Design Concept]] ranking,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/4769.html Red Dot press release]&lt;/ref&gt; and the best design school in France by the 2012 L'Étudiant ranking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/ecoles-specialisees/design-le-classement-des-pros-14378.html {{Fr}} ''Banc d'essai 2012 des écoles de design : 23 formations comparées'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the 60 best design schools in the world according to the 2007 [[Businessweek]] D-Schools list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/talenthunt.html ''D-Schools: The Global List'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degrees and programmes==
