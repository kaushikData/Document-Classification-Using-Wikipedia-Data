      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">'''Adduct purification''' is a technique for preparing extremely pure simple [[organometallic]] compounds, which are generally unstable and hard to handle, by purifying a stable [[adduct]] with a [[Lewis acid]] and then obtaining the desired product from the pure adduct by [[thermal decomposition]].

Epichem Limited is the licensee of the major patents in this field, and uses the trademark EpiPure to refer to adduct-purified materials; Professor Anthony Jones at [[Liverpool University]] is the initiator of the field and author of many of the important papers.

The choice of Lewis acid and of reaction medium is important; the desired organometallics are almost always air- and water-sensitive. Initial work was done in [[ether]], but this led to [[oxygen]] impurities, and so more recent work involves tertiary [[amine]]s or [[nitrogen]]-substituted [[crown ethers]].

'''Alismatid monocots''' ('''alismatids''', ''basal monocots'') is an informal name for a group of early branching (hence basal) [[monocots]], consisting of two orders, the [[Acorales]] and  [[Alismatales]]. The name has also been used to refer to the Alismatales alone. Monocots are frequently treated as three informal groupings based on their branching from ancestral monocots and shared characteristics:  alismatid monocots, [[lilioid monocots]] (the five other non-commelinid monocots) and [[commelinid monocots]]. Research at the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew]] is organised into two teams I: Alismatids and Lilioids and II: Commelinids. A similar approach is taken by Judd in his Plant systematics. They also organise their monocot research into two teams I: Alismatids and Lilioids, and II: Commelinids.{{sfn|ps=none|RBG|2010}} A similar approach is taken by [[Walter S Judd|Judd]] in his ''Plant systematics''.{{sfn|ps=none|Judd et al.|2007}}

The term '''original combination''' or '''protonym''' is used in the same way in [[zoology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[Bacteriology]] uses a similar term, '''basonym''', spelled without an ''i''.&lt;ref name="Tindall"&gt;{{Citation  | doi =10.1099/00207713-49-3-1313 | last =Tindall | first =B.

==Use in botany==
The term "basionym" is used in botany only for the circumstances where a previous name exists with a useful description, and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' does not require a full description with the new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Turland, N. |year=2013 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155 |title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books  |isbn=978-3-87429-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A basionym must therefore be [[nomen illegitimum|legitimate]]. Basionyms are regulated by the code's articles 6.10, 7.3, 41, and others.&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6|chapter=Glossary |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=glo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Combinatio nova'' ===
The basionym of the name ''[[Picea abies]]'' (the Norway spruce) is ''Pinus abies''. The species was originally named ''Pinus abies'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Later on, botanist [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten]] decided this species should not be grouped in the same genus (''Pinus'') as the [[pine]]s, so he transferred it to the genus ''[[Picea]]'' (the spruces). The new name ''Picea abies'' is ''[[combinatio nova]]'', a new combination (abbreviated ''comb. nov.'').

=== ''Status novus'' ===
In 1964, the subfamily name Pomoideae, which had been in use for the group within family [[Rosaceae]] that have [[pome]] fruit like apples, was no longer acceptable under the code of nomenclature because it is not based on a genus name. Claude Weber did not consider the family name Malaceae &lt;small&gt;[[John Kunkel Small|Small]]&lt;/small&gt; to be taxonomically appropriate, so he created the name [[Maloideae]] at the rank of subfamily, referring to the original description of the family, and using the same [[Type (biology)|type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Weber, C. |year=1964 |title=The genus ''Chaenomeles'' (Rosaceae) |journal=Journal of the Arnold Arboretum |volume=45 |pages=161–205, 302–345 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/33621#page/165/mode/1up}} Page 164, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; This change of rank from family to subfamily is an example of ''status novus'' (abbreviated ''stat. nov.''), also called a "name at new rank".

[[File:Bibliotheca Botanica 1736.jpg|thumb|upright|225px|Title page of Linnaeus's Bibliotheca Botanica, 1736.]]
'''''Bibliotheca Botanica''''' ("Bibliography of botany", Amsterdam, 1736, Salomen Schouten; 2nd edn., 1751) is a [[botany]] book by Swedish [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97132d.image.f2 Full scan of original text of ''Bibliotheca Botanica'']&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written and published in Amsterdam when Linnaeus was twenty-eight and dedicated to the botanist [[Johannes Burman]] (1707–1779). The first edition appeared in 1735 with the full title ''Bibliotheca Botanica recensens libros plus mille de plantis huc usque editos secundum systema auctorum naturale in classes, ordines, genera et species''; it was an elaborate classification system for his catalogue of books.

The Preface, dated 8 August 1735, on pages 2–19 contains Linnaeus's extended account of botanical history in the form of a botanical analogy; in pages 2–3 Linnaeus lists previous bibliographers and then gives his account of botanical history leading to a golden age lasting from 1683 to 1703 (see also ''Incrementa Botanices'', Biuur 1753 and ''Reformatio Botanices'', Reftelius, 1762, for other historical notes by Linnaeus).&lt;ref&gt;Heller p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The Preface mentions that ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' was the first part of a planned ''Bibliotheca medica'' (which he did not produce).

A digest of ''Bibliotheca Botanica'', which elaborated on the first chapter of the ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'', is given in Aphorisms 5–52 of the ''Philosophia Botanica''.

Linnaean authority [[Frans Stafleu]] describes the book:

{{cquote|''The Bibliotheca is a concise history of botany in a dry, enumerative, but very efficient style. Linnaeus describes the development of botanical science by subdividing the authors in various categories and by adding several statements on the main events in human affairs without which the growth of botany as a science cannot be understood. The often enlightening and amusing names for the various categories of botanists show not only a good knowledge of the literature, but also an awareness of the fact that botanical history is human history.''}}&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanical bibliographies==
[[File:Bibliotheca Botanica 1736 System.jpg|thumb|upright|225px|Linnaeus's method for classifying the elements of ''Bibliotheca Botanica''.]]
The term “methodists” (methodici, equivalent to present-day systematists) was coined by Linnaeus in his ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' to denote the authors who care about the principles of classification in contrast to the collectors who are concerned primarily with the description of plants paying little or no attention to their arrangement into genera etc. For Linnaeus the important early Methodists were Italian physician and botanist [[Andrea Caesalpino]], the English naturalist [[John Ray]], German physician and botanist [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]], and a French physician, botanist, and traveller [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]].&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu pp. 36, 39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical bibliography effectively began, as did bibliography in general, with the work of the sixteenth-century Swiss natural historian and polymath Conrad Gesner (1516–65). His ''Bibliotheca Universalis'', a general compendium of some 12,000 items in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew arranged by authors’ forenames, appeared in 1545 as an attempt to bring some order into the rapidly increasing range of literature consequent to the Renaissance and the introduction of printing.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' was the first botanical bibliography arranged by subject. The titles were arranged hierarchically into 16 classes or chapters, each with one or more ordines or sections. Applying this ''methodus naturalis'' to books and people was a mark of his ‘scholastic’ view of the world. Most subsequent classifications of botanical literature, including geographical entities, would be more or less empirically based highlighting a recurrent conflict between [[essentialism]], [[empiricism]], [[nominalism]] and other doctrines in the theory and practice of any kind of classification.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heller notes the incomplete coverage of material, incorrect dating of books, and many minor errors in his book descriptions. Also, that his “natural method” of classifying books was “not very practical”.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, pp. 407-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chappuis absorption''' refers to the [[Absorption band|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by [[ozone]], that is especially noticeable in the [[ozone layer]], which absorbs a small part of sunlight in the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The Chappuis absorption bands occur at [[wavelength]]s between 400 and 650&amp;nbsp;[[Metre|nm]]. Within this range are two absorption maxima of similar height at 575 and 603&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Bogumil"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Bogumil|first=Konstanze|title=Absorptionsspektroskopie von Ozon und anderen, wichtigen, atmosphärischen Spurengasen mit dem SCIAMACHY-Satellitenspektrometer im ultravioletten bis nahinfraroten Spektralbereich.|date=2005|degree=|publisher=University of Bremen|url=http://www.iup.uni-bremen.de/~weber/ozone_papers/Diss_KBogumil_051106.pdf|doi=}} pp. 21-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brion|first=J.|last2=Chakir|first2=A.|last3=Charbonnier|first3=J.|last4=Daumont|first4=D.|last5=Parisse|first5=C.|last6=Malicet|first6=J.|date=1998|title=Absorption Spectra Measurements for the Ozone Molecule in the 350–830&amp;nbsp;nm Region.|url=http://igaco-o3.fmi.fi/ACSO/files/brion_et_al_1998.pdf|journal=Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry|volume=30|pages=291–299|via=|bibcode=1998JAtC...30..291B|doi=10.1023/A:1006036924364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the absorption of ultraviolet light by the ozone layer, known as the Hartley and Huggins absorptions, Chappuis absorption is distinctly weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qLuVCJtRTV0C&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Earth as a Distant Planet: A Rosetta Stone for the Search of Earth-Like Worlds|last=Vázquez|first=M.|last2=Pallé|first2=E.|last3=Rodríguez|first3=P.

== History ==
[[James Chappuis]] was the first researcher (in 1880) to notice that light passing through ozone gas has a blue tint. He attributed this effect to absorption in the yellow, orange, and red parts of the light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hautefille|first=P.|last2=Chappuis|first2=J.|date=1880|title=Sur la liquéfaction de l’ozone et sur la couleur à l’état gaseux|url=|journal=Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|volume=91|pages=552-525|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French chemist [[Auguste Houzeau]] had already shown in 1858 that the atmosphere contains traces of ozone, so Chappuis presumed that ozone could explain the blue color of the sky. He was certainly aware that this was not the only possible explanation, since the blue light that can be seen from Earth's surface is [[Polarization (waves)|polarised.]] Polarization cannot be explained by light absorption by ozone, but can be explained by [[Rayleigh scattering]], which was already known by Chappuis's time. Contemporary scientists thought that Rayleigh scattering was sufficient to explain the blue sky, and so the idea that ozone could play a role was eventually forgotten.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the early 1950s, [[Edward Olson Hulburt|Edward Hulburt]] was conducting research on the sky at dusk, to verify theoretical predictions on the temperature and density of the upper atmosphere on the basis of scattered light measured at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulburt|first=E. O.|date=1938-07-01|title=The Brightness of the Twilight Sky and the Density and Temperature of the Atmosphere|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-28-7-227|journal=JOSA|language=EN|volume=28|issue=7|pages=227–236|doi=10.1364/JOSA.28.000227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea was that after the Sun passes under the horizon, it continues to illuminate the upper layers of the atmosphere. Hulburt wished to relate the intensity of light reaching the Earth's surface through Rayleigh scattering to the abundance of particles at each altitude, as the sunlight passes through the atmosphere at different heights over the course of sunset. In his measurements, performed in 1952 at Sacramento Peak in [[New Mexico]], he found that the intensity of measured light was lower by a factor of 2 to 4 than the predicted value. His predictions were based on his theory, and on measurements that were made in the upper atmosphere only a few years before by rocket flights launched not far from Sacramento Peak. The magnitude of the deviation between prediction and photometric measurements made on Sacramento Peak precluded mere [[Error|measurement error]]. Until then, theory had predicted that the sky at the zenith during sundown should appear blue-green to grey, and the color should shift to yellow during dusk. This was obviously in conflict with daily observation that the blue color of the sky in the zenith at dusk changes only imperceptibly. As Hulburt knew about the absorption by ozone, and as the spectral range of Chappuis absorption had been more precisely measured only a few years before by the French couple Arlette and Étienne Vassy, he made an attempt to account for this effect in his calculations. This brought the measurements completely into agreement with the theoretical predictions. The results of Hulburt were repeatedly confirmed in the following years. Indeed, not all color effects at dusk in clear sky can be explained by the deeper layers. To this end it is probably necessary to account for spectral [[Absorbance|extinction]] by [[aerosols]] in theoretical simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Raymond L.|last2=Meyer|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Hoeppe|first3=Götz|date=2011|title=Atmospheric ozone and colors of the Antarctic twilight sky|url=https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/raylee/papers/RLee_O3_twilights_paper.pdf|journal=Applied Optics|volume=50|pages=F162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of Hulburt, the French meteorologist Jean Dubois had proposed a few years before that Chappuis absorption had an effect on another color phenomenon of the sky at dusk. Dubois worked on the so-called "[[Earth's shadow]]" in his doctoral thesis in the 1940s, and he hypothesized that this effect could also be attributed to Chappuis absorption.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this conjecture is not supported by more recent measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Raymond L.|date=2015-02-01|title=Measuring and modeling twilight’s Belt of Venus|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-54-4-B194|journal=Applied Optics|language=EN|volume=54|issue=4|pages=B194–B203|doi=10.1364/AO.54.00B194|issn=2155-3165|bibcode=2015ApOpt..54B.194L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical basis ==
Chappuis absorption is a continuum absorption in the wavelength range between 400 and 650&amp;nbsp;nm. It is caused by the [[photodissociation]] (breaking-apart) of the ozone molecule. The absorption maximum lies around 603&amp;nbsp;nm, with a [[Cross section (physics)|cross-section]] of 5.23&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A second, somewhat smaller maximum at ca. 575&amp;nbsp;nm has a cross-section of 4.83&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Absorbance|absorbance energy]] in the Chappuis bands lies between 1.8 and 3.1&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]. The measured values imply that absorption mechanism is barely temperature-dependent; the deviation accounts for less than three percent. Around its maxima, Chappuis absorption is about three orders of magnitude weaker than the absorption of ultraviolet light in the range of the Hartley bands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grebenshchikov|first=S. Yu.|last2=Qu|first2=Z.-W.|last3=Zhu|first3=H.|last4=Schinke|first4=R.|date=2007-04-27|title=New theoretical investigations of the photodissociation of ozone in the Hartley, Huggins, Chappuis, and Wulf bands|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b701020f|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=9|issue=17|doi=10.1039/b701020f|issn=1463-9084|bibcode=2007PCCP....9.2044G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Chappuis absorption is one of the few noteworthy absorption processes within the visible spectrum in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/PB/PBFB/Periodika/Promet/PDF/promet__15__2-3,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/promet_15_2-3.pdf|title=Wechselwirkung zwischen Strahlung und Erdatmosphäre: Absorption und Emission|last=Fischer|first=Herbert|date=|website=|archive-url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/list/2010/http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/PB/PBFB/Periodika/Promet/PDF/promet__15__2-3,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/promet_15_2-3.pdf|archive-date=2010|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaid on the absorption spectrum of the Chappuis bands at shorter wavelengths are partly irregular and diffuse bands caused by [[molecular vibrations]]. The irregularity of these bands implies that the ozone molecule is only for an extremely short time in an [[excited state]] before it dissociates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During this short excitation it is mostly undergoing symmetrical stretching vibrations, although with some contributions from bending vibrations.&lt;ref name="Bogumil" /&gt; A consistent theoretical explanation of the vibration structure that is in line with the experimental data was for a long time an unsolved problem; even today, not all details of the Chappuis absorption can be explained by theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Like when it absorbs ultraviolet light, the ozone molecule can decompose into an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and an O atom during Chappuis absorption. Unlike the Hartley and Huggins absorptions, however, the decomposition products do not remain in an excited state. Dissociation in the Chappuis bands is the most important photochemical process involving ozone in the Earth's atmosphere below an altitude of 30&amp;nbsp;km. Over this altitude, it is outweighed by absorptions in the Hartley band. However, neither the Hartley nor the Chappuis absorptions cause significant loss of ozone in the stratosphere, despite the high potential photodissociation rate, because the elemental oxygen has a high probability of encountering an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and recombining back into ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/11/032/1103246.pdf|title=Erster Zwischenbericht der Enquete-Kommission "Vorsorge zum Schutz der Erdatmosphäre."|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/list/2010/http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/11/032/1103246.pdf|archive-date=2010|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Diseases from Space''''' is a book published in 1979 that authored by astronomers [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], where they propose that many of the most common diseases which afflict humanity, such as [[influenza]], the common cold and [[whooping cough]], have their origins in extraterrestrial sources.

The claim connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens was rejected by the scientific community.

== Overview ==

[[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] spent over 20 years investigating the nature and composition of [[interstellar dust]]. Though many hypotheses regarding this dust had been postulated by various astronomers since the middle of the 19th century, all were found to be wanting as and when new data on the gas and dust clouds became available. probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Wickramasinghe first proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely [[Organic compound|organic]] (containing carbon and nitrogen),&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', vol: 252,  462, 1974; and ''Nature'', Vol 268, 610, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed this up with other research confirming the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Wickramasinghe, D. T. &amp; Allen, D. A. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v287/n5782/abs/287518a0.html ''The 3.4-µm interstellar absorption feature.''] Nature 287, 518−519 (1980). Allen, D. A. &amp; Wickramasinghe, D. T. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v294/n5838/abs/294239a0.html ''Diffuse interstellar absorption bands between 2.9 and 4.0 µm.''] Nature 294, 239−240 (1981). Wickramasinghe, D. T. &amp; Allen, D. A. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00653492 ''Three components of 3–4 μm absorption bands.''] Astrophys. Space Sci. 97, 369−378 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Wickramasinghe also proposed and confirmed the existence of polymeric compounds based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] and Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175A.,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200A interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] molecules in space.

Hoyle and Wickramasinghe went further and speculated that the overall [[spectroscopic]] data of cosmic dust and gas clouds also matched those for desiccated bacteria. This led them to conclude that diseases such as [[influenza]] and the [[common cold]] are incident from space and fall upon the Earth in what they term "pathogenic patches." Hoyle and Wickramasinghe viewed the process of [[evolution]] in a manner at variance with the standard [[Darwinian]] model. They speculated that [[genetic material]] in the form of incoming [[pathogens]] from the [[cosmos]] provided the mechanism for driving the evolutionary engine.&lt;ref name="kirjasto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/dust.html |title=Cool Cosmos |publisher=Coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoyle passed away in 2001, and Wickramasinghe still advocates for these views and beliefs.

'''Dynamic simulation''' (or dynamic system simulation) is the use of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by [[ordinary differential equations]] or [[partial differential equations]]. As [[mathematical model]]s incorporate real-world constraints, like gear [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] and rebound from a hard stop, equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A [[numerical simulation]] is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval, and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Some methods can use different time steps in different parts of the simulation model. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power, steam turbines, 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling, electric motors, econometric models, biological systems, robot arms, mass spring dampers, hydraulic systems, and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in [[process control]] and [[mechatronic]] systems for tuning the [[automatic control]] systems before they are connected to the real system, or for human training before they control the real system.
Simulation is also used in computer games and animation and can be accelerated by using a [[physics engine]], the technology used in many powerful [[computer graphics]] [[software]] [[computer program|programs]], like [[3ds Max]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Lightwave]], and many others to simulate physical characteristics. In computer animation, things like [[hair]], [[cloth]], [[liquid]], [[fire]], and [[wiktionary:particles|particles]] can be easily modeled, while the human [[animator]] animates simpler objects. Computer-based dynamic animation was first used at a very simple level in the 1989 [[Pixar]] [[short film]] ''Knick Knack'' to move the fake snow in the snowglobe and pebbles in a fish tank.

== Example of dynamic simulation ==
[[Image:TRUE_Procedural_Animation.gif|right|[[Piston motion equations]]|frame]]
This animation was made with a software system dynamics, with a 3D modeler. The calculated values are associated with parameters of the rod and crank. In this example the crank is driving, we vary both the speed of rotation, its radius and the length of the rod, the piston follows.

== Description ==
Enhydro agates are made up of banded [[microcrystalline]] or [[cryptocrystalline]] [[quartz]]'''.'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agate has a hollow center, partially containing water. Enhydro agates can also contain debris or [[petroleum]].  Because the cavity is not full, the agate can produce sound from being shaken. Agates vary in size. The largest recorded agate was found in Fuxin City, China, with a diameter of 63&amp;nbsp;cm and weighing 310&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rocksinmyheadtoo.com/Enhydros.htm|title = What is an Enhydro ~ Fluid Inclusion? Illustration, Photos, &amp; Viewing Tips Below|last = Styer-gold|first = Jan|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
[[File:Inclumed.gif|thumb|A microscopic picture of a fluid inclusion (non-porous enhydro) showing a dark vapor bubble trapped in quartz.]]
Enhydros are formed when water rich in [[Silica Mineral|silica]] [[Percolation|percolates]] through volcanic rock, forming layers of deposited [[mineral]]. As layers build up, the mineral forms a cavity in which the water becomes trapped. The cavity is then layered with the silica-rich water, forming its shell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unlike fluid inclusions, the chalcedony shell is [[Porosity|porous]], allowing water to enter and exit the cavity very slowly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The water inside of an enhydro agate is most times not the same water as when the formation occurred. During the formation of an enhydro agate, debris can get trapped in the cavity. Types of debris varies in every agate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Falsterbo Lighthouse''' ({{lang-sv|Falsterbo fyr}}) .  To the north-east of the lighthouse is the city of [[Skanör-Falsterbo]], to the south-east of the lighthouse are some of the finest sandy beaches in [[Sweden]] and surrounding the lighthouse is the [[golf course]] of the Falsterbo Golf Club.

== History ==
The sea route past the Falsterbo Headland has always been dangerous, because of the moving sand banks hidden under the sea. In 1230 the Dominikans from Lübeck sent a letter to the Danish king Valdemar with a request that a "mark" should be built to warn seafarers. There is no evidence that it was ever built. Most likely is that a prominent house at Falsterbo and The Church of Santa Maria were used as seamarks.

In 1636, a [[lever light]] known as a "swape" light was built nearby at Kolabacken. An iron basket full of burning coal was hoisted up and down by a balanced bar, hence the light was moving and easier to detect. The coal fire was intensely red and could not be mistaken for a star or ship lantern. The remains of the beacon are still visible as a small hillock of ashes and coal, "Coal Hill" ({{lang-sv|Kolabacken}}). Towards the end of the 18th century the lever light was moved to the site of the present lighthouse, closer to the new shoreline.

The lighthouse was built in 1793-96 and the "light" was a coal fire at the top. In 1842-43 the uppermost crenellated parts were replaced with the present lantern. Coal was replaced with rapeseed oil. The oil was very inflammable and the lighthouse keepers had to watch the lamp all night. To make a periodic light; a screen was moved around the lantern by heavy weights. Around 1850 a house for the keeper was built next to the lighthouse. At the end of the 19th century another house was built for the assistants to the lighthouse keeper.

Also when the oil was replaced with paraffin and, later gas, the screen still had to be moved around. When electric light was installed in 1935 the screen was removed and so were most of the staff. Only one lighthouse keeper remained. In 1972 the lighthouse was automated and the last keeper retired.

The lighthouse is {{convert|25|m}} high and {{convert|12|m}} broad. Nowadays it has no importance as a navigation mark and therefore the light is not very strong (ca. 4000 [[candela]]). It was totally turned off 1990-93. The interval of the light is intermittent: 4 seconds on, 1 second off, repeated.

== Present activities ==
Even though the lighthouse is managing itself nowadays, there are still lots of activities around it. Falsterbo is one of twenty synoptic [[weather station]]s in Sweden still manned. Every three hours weather data (wind, temperature, air pressure, visibility, cloud cover etc.) are reported to the [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]. In earlier days the weather observations were carried out by the lighthouse keepers.

The lighthouse garden is the ringing site of the [[Falsterbo Bird Observatory]]. Falsterbo is a premier site in [[Europe]] to watch autumn bird migration. Several millions of birds pass every autumn en route to wintering areas in [[Africa]] or southern Europe.  Annually, about 25,000 small birds are trapped and ringed.

Every year on the last Sunday of August it is "Lighthouse Day". Then the lighthouse is open to the public.  Visitors are shown not only the lighthouse itself but also bird ringing and the weather station.

==Life==
Guido Pontecorvo was born on 29 November 1907 in [[Pisa]] into a family of wealthy Italian industrialists. He was one of eight children. He was a brother to [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] and [[Bruno Pontecorvo]].

He was dismissed from his post in Florence in 1938, due to his Jewish heritage.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He then fled to Britain in 1939 with his new wife Leonore Freyenmuth (of German descent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Institute of Genetics building at the [[University of Glasgow]] was re-named as the '''Pontecorvo Building''' in 1995 in honour of Guido Pontecorvo and to celebrate 50 years of the institute in Glasgow.  The Pontecorvo Building is part of the Anderson College complex located on Dumbarton Road in the West End of Glasgow. The building has been vacant since 2011 awaiting redevelopment. Until then it housed one of the few still operational [[Paternoster]] elevators in the UK. 

He has also lent his name to the annual '''Pontecorvo Award''', presented to the final year undergraduate student in the department with the highest grades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">'''Infectious pancreatic necrosis''' (IPN) is a severe [[viral disease]] of [[Salmonid|salmonid fish]]. It is caused by '''infectious pancreatic necrosis virus''', which is a member of the '''[[Birnaviridae]]''' family.  This disease mainly affects '''young salmonids''', such as [[trout]] or [[salmon]], of less than six months, although adult fish may carry the virus without showing symptoms.&lt;ref name="urlFisheries Research Services"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frs-scotland.gov.uk/FRS.Web/Delivery/display_standalone.aspx?contentid=738 |title=Fisheries Research Services |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance to infection develops more rapidly in warmer water. It is highly contagious and found worldwide, but some regions have managed to eradicate or greatly reduce the incidence of disease. The disease is normally spread [[Horizontal transmission|horizontally]] via infected water, but spread also occurs [[Vertical transmission|vertically]]. It is not a [[zoonosis]].

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
A sharp rise in mortality is often seen (depending on the [[virulence]] of the disease). Other clinical signs include [[abdomen|abdominal swelling]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], abnormal swimming, darkening of the skin, and trailing of the feces from the [[cloaca|vent]]. On [[Autopsy|necropsy]], internal damage (viral [[necrosis]]) to the [[pancreas]] and thick mucus in the [[intestine]]s often is present.&lt;ref name="urlFisheries Research Services"/&gt;  Surviving fish should recover within one to two weeks.

Diagnostic methods for the detection of the disease include: characteristic [[histology|histological]] [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[lesion]], [[PCR]], [[Indirect fluorescent-antibody|indirect fluorescent antibody testing]], [[ELISA]], and virus [[cell culture|culture]]. High virus [[titer]]s can be isolated from carrier animals.

==Treatment and control==
Currently, no treatment is available. However in certain territories vaccines are available for prevention of the disease e.g. Winvil 3 Micro &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/SPC_Documents/SPC_659675.DOC&lt;/ref&gt;

Good husbandry measures, such as high water quality, low stocking density, and no mixing of batches, help to reduce disease incidence. To eradicate the disease, very strict protocol with regards to movement, water sources and stock replacement must be in place – and still it is difficult to achieve and comes at a high economic cost.

In [[social studies]] and [[social policy]], '''intervention theory''' is the analysis of the [[decision making]] problems of intervening effectively in a situation in order to secure desired outcomes. Intervention theory addresses the question of when it is desirable not to intervene and when it is appropriate to do so. It also examines the effectiveness of different types of intervention. The term is used across a range of social and medical practices, including health care, child protection and law enforcement. It is also used in [[business studies]].

Within the theory of nursing, intervention theory is included within a larger scope of practice theories. Burns and Grove point out that it directs the implementation of a specific nursing intervention and provides theoretical explanations of how and why the intervention is effective in addressing a particular patient care problem. These theories are tested through programs of research to validate the effectiveness of the intervention in addressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Burns and Grove, ''Understanding Nursing Research'', 2007, pp 281-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Intervention Theory and Method'' Chris Argyris argues that in [[organization development]], effective intervention depends on appropriate and useful knowledge that offers a range of clearly defined choices and that the target should be for as many people as possible to be committed to the option chosen and to feel responsibility for it. Overall, interventions should generate a situation in which actors believe that they are working to internal rather than external influences on decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Argyris, ''Intervention Theory and Method: A Behavioral Science View'' (Addison-Wesley series in social science and administration), Addison-Wesley, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of 5 days, the Block D was thus ignited three times to raise the initial ~190 km × ~300 km × 51.6° orbit to a final 2577 km × 5082 km × 55.87° orbit. The Block-D stage was fitted with cameras in the tanks to monitor the fuel and oxidizer behaviour in weightlessness and during acceleration  &lt;ref&gt;http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/zond_l1e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Langdon Winner''' (born August 7, 1944) is Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Department of [[Science and Technology Studies]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Troy, New York]].

Langdon Winner was born in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] on August 7, 1944. He received his B.A. in 1966, M.A. in 1967 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1973, all in [[political science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His primary focus was political theory.

He has been a professor at [[University of Leiden|Leiden]], [[MIT]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Since 1985 he has been at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]; he was a visiting professor at [[Harvey Mudd College]] (2000) and Colgate University (2001).  In 2010 he was a Fulbright Fellow visiting the Universidad Complutense in Madrid.

Winner lives in upstate New York. He is married to Gail P. Stuart and has three children. His interests include [[science]], [[technology]], American [[popular culture]], and theories of [[sustainability]].

Winner is known for his articles and books on science, technology, and society. He also spent several years as a reporter, rock music critic, and contributing editor for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/about/|title=About: Brief Biography|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and politics==
In 1980 Winner proposed that technologies embody social relations, i.e. power.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in ''Daedalus'', Vol. 109, No. 1, Winter 1980. Reprinted in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] and Judy Wajcman (London: Open University Press, 1985; second edition 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; To the question he poses "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", Winner identifies two ways in which artifacts can have politics.  The first, involving technical arrangements and social order, concerns how the invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts or the larger system becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community.  This way "transcends the simple categories of 'intended' and 'unintended' altogether", representing "instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and crushing setbacks by others" (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;25-6, 1999).  It implies that the process of technological development is critical in determining the politics of an artifact; hence the importance of incorporating all stakeholders in it. (Determining who the stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are other questions entirely.)

The second way in which artifacts can have politics refers to artifacts that correlate with particular kinds of political relationships, which Winner refers to as inherently political artifacts (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;22, 1999).  He distinguishes between two types of inherently political artifacts: those that require a particular sociological system and those that are strongly compatible with a particular sociological system (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;29, 1999).  A further distinction is made between conditions internal to the workings of a given technical system and those that are external to it (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;33, 1999).  This second way in which artifacts can have politics can be further articulated as consisting of four 'types' of artifacts: those requiring a particular internal sociological system, those compatible with a particular internal sociological system, those requiring a particular external sociological system, and those compatible with a particular external sociological system.

Certain features of Winner's thesis have been criticized by other scholars, including [[Bernward Joerges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2628379/Do_Politics_Have_Artefacts_1999_ An attempted rebuttal to Winner’s argument is Bernward Joerges’ “Do Politics have Artefacts?” (Requires sign-in)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such criticisms are often narrowly focused upon particular cases in Winner's essays, the height of the bridges built by Robert Moses on the Long Island Parkway, for example, and tend to overlook his general arguments about the interweaving of political institutions and technological devices.

==Music==
Winner contributed piano and backing vocals to the hoax album [[The Masked Marauders]] created by ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"&gt;{{citation | title = The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings | publisher = Rhino Records | accessdate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of educational technologies ==
Over the years one focus of Winner's criticism has been the excessive use of technologies in the classroom, both in K-12 schools and higher education. Winner's critique is well explained in his article "Information Technology and Educational Amnesia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=2009-12-01|title=Information Technology and Educational Amnesia|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/other-writings/2017/6/13/information-technology-and-educational-amnesia|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=7|issue=6|pages=587-591|doi=10.2304/pfie.2009.7.6.587|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed in his satirical lecture, "The Automatic Professor Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/videos-and-music/|title=Videos and Music|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposition in [[probability theory]] known as the '''law of total expectation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neil A. |last=Weiss |title=A Course in Probability |location=Boston |publisher=Addison–Wesley |year=2005 |isbn=0-321-18954-X |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=p-rwJAAACAAJ |page=380 }} |pages=380–383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the '''law of iterated expectations''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/law-of-iterated-expectation/|title=Law of Iterated Expectation {{!}} Brilliant Math &amp; Science Wiki|website=brilliant.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''tower rule''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cme001/handouts/changhan/Refresher2.pdf|title=Probability and Statistics|last=Rhee|first=Chang-han|date=Sep 20, 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Adam's law''',  and the '''smoothing theorem''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall10/sta205/lec/topics/rn.pdf|title=Conditional Expectation|last=Wolpert|first=Robert|date=November 18, 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other names, states that if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] whose expected value &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is any random variable on the same [[probability space]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} (X) = \operatorname{E} ( \operatorname{E} ( X \mid Y)),&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., the [[expected value]] of the [[conditional expected value]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the expected value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

One special case states that if &lt;math&gt;{\left\{A_i\right\}}_i&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[countable set|countable]] [[partition of a set|partition]] of the [[sample space]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} (X) = \sum_i{\operatorname{E}(X \mid A_i) \operatorname{P}(A_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
Suppose that two factories supply [[light bulb]]s to the market. Factory &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bulbs work for an average of 5000 hours, whereas factory &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bulbs work for an average of 4000 hours. It is known that factory &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; supplies 60% of the total bulbs available. What is the expected length of time that a purchased bulb will work for?

Applying the law of total expectation, we have:

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} (L) = \operatorname{E}(L \mid X) \operatorname{P}(X)+\operatorname{E}(L \mid Y) \operatorname{P}(Y) = 5000(.6)+4000(.4)=4600&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} (L)&lt;/math&gt; is the expected life of the bulb;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(X)={6 \over 10}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(Y)={4 \over 10}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(L \mid X)=5000&lt;/math&gt; is the expected lifetime of a bulb manufactured by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(L \mid Y)=4000&lt;/math&gt; is the expected lifetime of a bulb manufactured by &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus each purchased light bulb has an expected lifetime of 4600 hours.

==Proof in the finite and countable cases==
Let the random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, defined on the same probability space, assume a finite or countably infinite set of finite values. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt; is defined, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\min (\operatorname{E}[X_+],  \operatorname{E}[X_-]) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of the probability space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} (X) = \sum_i{\operatorname{E}(X \mid A_i) \operatorname{P}(A_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E} \left( \operatorname{E} (X \mid Y) \right) &amp;= \operatorname{E} \Bigg[ \sum_x x \cdot \operatorname{P}(X=x \mid Y) \Bigg] \\[6pt]
&amp;=\sum_y \Bigg[ \sum_x x \cdot \operatorname{P}(X=x \mid Y) \Bigg] \cdot \operatorname{P}(Y=y) \\[6pt]
&amp;=\sum_y \sum_x x \cdot \operatorname{P}(X=x, Y=y).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If the series is finite, then we can switch the summations around, and the previous expression will become
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_x \sum_y x \cdot \operatorname{P}(X=x, Y=y)&amp;=\sum_x x\sum_y \operatorname{P}(X=x, Y=y)\\[6pt]
&amp;=\sum_x x \cdot \operatorname{P}(X=x)\\[6pt]
&amp;=\operatorname{E}(X).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If, on the other hand, the series is infinite, then its convergence cannot be [[Conditional convergence|conditional]], due to the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\min (\operatorname{E}[X_+], \operatorname{E}[X_-] ) &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;  The series converges absolutely if both &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X_+]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X_-]&lt;/math&gt; are finite, and diverges to an infinity when either &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X_+]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X_-]&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.  In both scenarios, the above summations may be exchanged without affecting the sum.

==Proof in the general case==
Let &lt;math&gt; (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\operatorname{P}) &lt;/math&gt; be a probability space on which two sub [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebras]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{G}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt; are defined. For a random variable &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; on such a space, the smoothing law states that if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt; is defined, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;\min(\operatorname{E}[X_+], \operatorname{E}[X_-])&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_2] \mid \mathcal{G}_1] = \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_1]\quad\text{(a.s.)}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''. Since a conditional expectation is a [[Radon–Nikodym theorem|Radon–Nikodym derivative]], verifying the following two properties establishes the smoothing law:

* &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_2] \mid \mathcal{G}_1] \mbox{ is } \mathcal{G}_1&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable]]
* &lt;math&gt; \int_{G_1} \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_2] \mid \mathcal{G}_1] d\operatorname{P} = \int_{G_1} X d\operatorname{P},&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;G_1 \in \mathcal{G}_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these properties holds by definition of the conditional expectation. To prove the second one, note that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min\left(\int_{G_1}X_+\, d\operatorname{P}, \int_{G_1}X_-\, d\operatorname{P}\right) &amp;\leq \min\left(\int_\Omega X_+\, d\operatorname{P}, \int_\Omega X_-\, d\operatorname{P}\right)\\[4pt]
&amp;=\min(\operatorname{E}[X_+], \operatorname{E}[X_-]) &lt; \infty,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_{G_1}X\, d\operatorname{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined (not equal &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty&lt;/math&gt;).

The second property thus holds since
&lt;math&gt;G_1 \in \mathcal{G}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{G}_2 &lt;/math&gt; implies
:&lt;math&gt;
   \int_{G_1} \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_2] \mid \mathcal{G}_1] d\operatorname{P}
= \int_{G_1} \operatorname{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}_2] d\operatorname{P}
= \int_{G_1} X d\operatorname{P}.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary.''' In the special case when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_1 = \{\empty,\Omega \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_2 = \sigma(Y)&lt;/math&gt;, the smoothing law reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
  \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}[X \mid Y]] = \operatorname{E}[X].
&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of partition formula==
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum\limits_i\operatorname{E}(X\mid A_i)\operatorname{P}(A_i)
&amp;=\sum\limits_i\int\limits_\Omega X(\omega)\operatorname{P}(d\omega\mid A_i)\cdot\operatorname{P}(A_i)\\
&amp;=\sum\limits_i\int\limits_\Omega X(\omega)\operatorname{P}(d\omega\cap A_i)\\
&amp;=\sum\limits_i\int\limits_\Omega X(\omega)I_{A_i}(\omega)\operatorname{P}(d\omega)\\
&amp;=\sum\limits_i\operatorname{E}(XI_{A_i}),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of the set &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If the partition &lt;math&gt;{\{A_i\}}_{i=0}^n&lt;/math&gt; is finite, then, by linearity, the previous expression becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}\left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^n XI_{A_i}\right)=\operatorname{E}(X),
&lt;/math&gt;

and we are done.

If, however, the partition &lt;math&gt;{\{A_i\}}_{i=0}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, then we use the [[dominated convergence theorem]] to show that

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}\left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^n XI_{A_i}\right)\to\operatorname{E}(X).
&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, for every &lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{i=0}^n XI_{A_i}\right|\leq |X|I_{\mathop{\cup}\limits_{i=0}^n A_i}\leq |X|.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since every element of the set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; falls into a specific partition &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;, it is straightforward to verify that the sequence &lt;math&gt;{\left\{\sum_{i=0}^n XI_{A_i}\right\}}_{n=0}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; [[pointwise convergence|pointwise-converges]] to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. By initial assumption, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}|X|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the dominated convergence theorem yields the desired.

[[Galileo Galilei]]'s '''Letter to Benedetto Castelli''' (1613) was his first statement on the authority of scripture and the [[Catholic Church]] in matters of scientific enquiry.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|66}} In a series of bold and innovative arguments, he undermined the claims for Biblical authority which the opponents of [[Copernicus]] used. The letter was the subject of the first complaint about Galileo to the Inquisition in 1615.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|66}}

==Background==
In 1610 Galileo had published ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''The Starry Messenger'') which made him famous across Europe. This work prompted many debates as to whether the earth really was the centre of the universe.&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finocchiaro |first1=Maurice |title=The Galileo Affair |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |location=London, England |isbn=0-520-06662-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} Galileo usually avoided referring to scripture in his arguments about the universe,  while the Aristolelian scholars who opposed [[Copernicus]] cited the Bible in support of their views - for example [[Lodovico delle Colombe]] in his 1611 work  ''Contra il Moto della Terra'' (''Against the Motion of the Earth'') explicitly challenged anyone defending Copernicus to answer the charge that he was going against what the Bible taught.

This presented Galileo with a dilemma - if he did not respond, he effectively conceded that the biblical text confirmed the Aristotelian view despite the fact that the Church had no firm position on the Copernican question; on the other hand if he tried to engage in arguments based on scripture, he allowed himself to be drawn into a field where the Church regarded its authority as absolute.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|59-61}} Indeed an earlier venture into this form of argument by Galileo had been stopped by the Church. In the manuscript for ''[[Letters on Sunspots]]'' (1613), he argued that [[Letters on Sunspots#'Flaws' in the sun|"flaws" in the Sun]] demonstrated that the heavens were not immutable, as had previously been thought.  A paragraph in which Galileo supported this by claiming that the scriptures supported the mutability of the heavens was removed by the [[Letters on Sunspots#Censorship by the Inquisition|Inquisition censors]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackwell |first1=Richard |title=Galileo, Bellarmine and the Bible |date=1991 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=London |isbn=0-268-01027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58-59}}

On 14 December 1613 Galileo's friend and former pupil [[Benedetto Castelli]] wrote to him to say that at a recent dinner in [[Pisa]] with the Grand Duke [[Cosimo II de' Medici]] a conversation had taken place in which [[Cosimo Boscaglia]], a professor of [[philosophy]], argued that the motion of the Earth could not be true, as it was contrary to the [[Bible]].  Castelli had disagreed with him and maintained, as Galileo held, that the Earth's motion was possible. After the dinner, Castelli had been called back by the [[Christina of Lorraine|Dower Duchess Christina]] of Tuscany to answer points she raised from scriptural arguments against the motion of the Earth.  Castelli had responded and Boscaglia had remained silent.&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=John Dietz|title=Galileo's Letter to Christina: Some Rhetorical Considerations|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=1983|volume=36|issue=4|pages=547–576|doi=10.2307/2860733|url=http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4740/29590_151541.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castelli wished to alert Galileo to this exchange, and advised Galileo that their mutual friend [[Niccolò Arrighetti]] would come to [[Florence]] and explain matters further.  This Arrighetti did.&lt;ref name=Rome&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shea |first1=William |last2=Artigas |first2=Mariano |title=Galileo in Rome |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-517758-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}

Galileo felt that it was important for him to set out an argument to show how scripture could not be used as the basis for scientific enquiry.&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro" /&gt;{{rp|27}} He did so with great speed, replying with a letter to Castelli in less than a week, on 21 December 1613.&lt;ref name="Preface"&gt;{{cite web |last1=De la Fuente |first1=Pere |last2=Granados |first2=Xavier |last3=Reus |first3=Francisco |title=Letters from Galileo Preface |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Galileo_Letters.html |website=history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Letter to Benedetto Castelli was not published, but was circulated widely in manuscript form.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|66}}  As the debate about its arguments continued, Galileo thought it advisable to review and expand the arguments he had set out.  This was the basis of his subsequent [[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]], which expanded the eight pages of his letter to Castelli to forty pages.&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

==Key arguments==
In his letter to Benedetto Castelli, Galileo argues that using the Bible as evidence against the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] involves three key errors.  Firstly, claiming that the Bible shows the earth to be static and concluding that the earth therefore does not move is arguing from a false premise; whether the earth moves or not is a thing which must be demonstrated (or not) through scientific enquiry.  Secondly, the Bible is not even a source of authority on this kind of question, but only on matters of faith - thus if the Bible happens to say something about a natural phenomenon, this is not sufficient for us to say that it is so. Thirdly, he shows by deft argument that it is open to question whether the Bible, as his opponents claimed, even contradicted Copernicus' model of the universe.  Indeed, Galileo argues, a key passage in the Bible which was held by his opponents to support the view that the sun moves round the earth supports his own views much better.&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the Bible [[Book of Joshua#Entry into the land and conquest (chapters 2–12)|Joshua]] 10:12 is an account of how God commanded the Sun to stand still so that Joshua could defeat his enemies.  According to those opposed to Copernicus, this showed clearly that the Sun (and not the earth) moved.  Galileo argued that this passage could not be used to support the traditional earth-centred view of the universe at all.  If we assume the universe to be as it was described by [[Claudius Ptolemy]], the sun's annual motion was a slow movement towards the East, so if God had commanded it to stop, the daily movement towards the West would no longer have been counteracted and as a result the day would actually have got slightly shorter rather than longer. However if we assume the universe to be as Copernicus described it, the sun is at the centre and its rotation drives the rotation of all the planets.  Thus if God had ordered the Sun to stop turning, everything would have stopped and the day would have been longer, just as the Bible described.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|68}}

==Analysis==
Two aspects of Galileo's letter are particularly worthy of note.  First, his boldness in venturing into the field of [[exegesis]], where he was bound to upset many theologians who would not welcome his contributions. Second, his rhetorically brilliant argument was based on a fundamental contradiction; he began by arguing that faith and science were distinct, and that the Bible could not be used as the basis for arguments about science; he then went on to show, according to some novel and clever arguments, that actually the Bible supported his own scientific views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberto Buonanno|title=The Stars of Galileo Galilei and the Universal Knowledge of Athanasius Kircher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6-8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=2014-01-31|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00300-9|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His letter argues a position on scriptural authority which is very similar in substance, if not in tone, to that set out set out by the Catholic Church itself centuries later, in [[Leo XIII]]'s  1893 [[encyclical]], ''[[Providentissimus Deus]]''. Emphasising that the Bible makes use of figurative language and is not meant to teach science, this argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...here is the rule also laid down by St. Augustine, for the theologian: "Whatever they [i.e. scientists] can really demonstrate to be true of physical nature, we [i.e. theologians] must show to be capable of reconciliation with our Scriptures; and whatever they assert in their treatises which is contrary to these Scriptures of ours, that is to Catholic faith, we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false, or at all events we must, without the smallest hesitation, believe it to be so." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Providentissimus Deus |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18111893_providentissimus-deus.html |website=vatican.va |publisher=Vatican |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, Galileo accepted that the Bible was infallible in matters of doctrine, but he agreed with [[Caesar Baronius|Cardinal Baronius]]'s observation that it was "intended to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."  He also pointed out that both [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] had taught that scripture had not been written to teach a system of astronomy, citing St. Augustine’s comment that "One does not read in the Gospel that the Lord said: I will send you the Paraclete who will teach you about the course of the sun and moon. For He willed to make them Christians, not mathematicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cerrato |first1=Edoardo Aldo |title=“How to go to Heaven, and not how the heavens go” |url=http://www.oratoriosanfilippo.org/galileo-baronio-english.pdf |website=oratoriosanfilippo.org |publisher=Oratorio San Filippo |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Roman Inquisition==
In late 1614 or early 1615, [[Niccolò Lorini]] obtained a copy of Galileo's letter, some parts of which he and his fellow Dominicans at the [[Museo Nazionale di San Marco|convent of San Marco]] in Florence adjudged to be "suspect or rash".{{refn|Finocchiaro's translation&lt;ref name="Finocchiaro"/&gt;{{rp|134}} of "sospette o temerarie".&lt;ref name="Favaro"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Favaro |editor-first=Antonio |editor-link=:it:Antonio Favaro |date=1890–1909 |title=Le Opere di Galileo Galilei, Edizione Nazionale |url= |trans-title=The Works of Galileo Galilei, National Edition |language=Italian |place=[[Florence]] |publisher=Barbera }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[https://archive.org/details/agh6462.0019.001.umich.edu/page/297 vol.19, p.97]}} }}&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sim Johnston |first1=George |title=The Galileo Affair |url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~svanhave/The_Galileo_Affair.html |website=d.umn.edu |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore forwarded it to Cardinal [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrati]] at the [[Congregation of the Index]], together with a covering letter dated 7 February 1615, calling for the matter to be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Niccolò Lorini |url=https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/NiccoloLorini.html |website=Scientific Itineraries in Tuscany |publisher=brunelleschi.imss.fi.it |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Treccani"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lorini, Niccolò |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/niccolo-lorini/ |website=Treccani.it |publisher=Treccani |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|70}}

The Holy Office examined Lorini's copy of Galileo's letter to Castelli on 25 February 1615 at the house of [[Robert Bellarmine]].&lt;ref name=Rome /&gt;{{rp|61}} It was clear to them that Lorini's version was not the complete letter, as it was obvious that an introductory section was missing.&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|71}} (Lorini's version also included the phrase 'Scripture does not refrain from perverting its most important dogmas...'  whereas Galileo's original had said 'Scripture accommodates itself to the capacity of uncouth and uneducated people').&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|197}} For whatever reason, the Holy Office wished to make certain that it had an accurate version before proceeding with its investigation, so [[Giovanni Garzia Mellini|Cardinal Garzia Mellini]], secretary of the Inquisition, wrote to the archbishop of Pisa, where Castelli taught at the university, and asked him to provide the original letter.&lt;ref name=Rome /&gt;{{rp|70}}

By now Galileo had apparently realised that some kind of investigation was underway, so he asked Castelli to return the original of the letter to him.  He made a copy of it and sent this version to his friend Archbishop [[Pietro Dini|Piero Dini]] in Rome, protesting at the “wickedness and ignorance” of his enemies, and expressing concern that the Inquisition “may be in part deceived by this fraud which is going around under the cloak of zeal and charity”.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

The Holy Office submitted Galileo's letter to an unnamed theological adviser for examination.  That adviser's report, undated, concluded that there were three places where Galileo had used language which was offensive, but 'although this document sometimes uses words improperly, it does not deviate from the narrow path of Catholic expression.'&lt;ref name="Blackwell" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

==Discovery of the original manuscript==
Until 2018 two versions existed of the Letter to Bedenetto Castelli - the Lorini version held in the Vatican archives and the Dini version. The general scholarly view was that Lorini’s version was not authentic and that Lorini had amended it to show Galileo in the worst possible light, while the Dini version was generally held to be true.

In August 2018 the original manuscript of the letter was discovered in the archives of the [[Royal Society]]. This is the letter Galileo sent to Castelli and later asked Castelli to return to him. It shows the edits Galileo made in his own handwriting as he prepared the Dini version, replacing words and phrases that the Inquisition might object to with words less likely to offend. None of the arguments were changed, but the tone of the letter was altered considerably.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbott |first1=Alison |title=Discovery of Galileo’s long-lost letter shows he edited his heretical ideas to fool the Inquisition |journal=Nature |date=21 September 2018 |volume=561 |issue=7724 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06769-4 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is thus certain that the Lorini version was in most respects authentic, while the Dini version was not, as Galileo claimed, a true copy of his original letter.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

[[File:Camp Dubois reconstruction 034.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of [[Camp Dubois]] is on the grounds of the historic site.]]
The '''Lewis and Clark State Historic Site''' opened in 2002 and is owned and operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Division of Historic Preservation (formerly [[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]]).  The site, located in [[Hartford, Illinois]], commemorates [[Camp Dubois|Camp River Dubois]], the camp of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] from December 1803 to May 1804.  The site is National Trail Site #1 on the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]] and is located directly off the Confluence Bike Trail, part of the [[Confluence Greenway]].  The site is at the southern end of the [[Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Route]].

The Lewis and Clark State Historic Site is situated on the dry side of the Chain of Rocks Levee, approximately 1/4 mile from the [[Illinois]] shore of the [[Mississippi River]].  The site replaced Lewis and Clark State Park, which is no longer in existence.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

Main attractions at the site include a {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} interpretive center and an outdoor replica of [[Camp Dubois|Camp River Dubois]].  The interpretive center contains a theater, multiple hands-on exhibits and displays, and a {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} full-scale cutaway keelboat.

This is a list of [[Catholic]] churchmen&lt;ref&gt;This list includes priests, bishops (including popes), deacons, monks, abbots, and those who received minor orders in the Church&lt;/ref&gt; throughout history who have made contributions to science. These churchmen-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others listed below. The Catholic Church has also produced many [[List of Catholic scientists|lay scientists and mathematicians]].

The [[Jesuits]] in particular have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0691128073}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Woods|2005|p=109}} The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century."{{Sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|p=154}} According to [[Jonathan Wright (historian)|Jonathan Wright]] in his book ''God's Soldiers'', by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had "contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on [[Jupiter]]’s surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn’s rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon effected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light."{{Sfn|Wright|2004|p=200}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Oil and gas industry reserves by nation.png|thumb|Countries by natural gas and oil proven reserves (2015) |alt=oil and gas Industry Reserves by Nation]]
[[File:World Gas Reserves.png|thumb|World natural gas proven reserves 1960–2012 (OPEC)]]
[[File:Gas Reserves - Top 5 Countries.png|thumb|Trends in the five countries with largest proven reserves of natural gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration]]

This is a '''list of countries by [[natural gas]] [[proven reserves]] ''' based on [[The World Factbook]] (when no citation is given).&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html Rank Order - Natural gas - proved reserves]. Retrieved June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or other authoritative third-party sources (as cited). Based on data from [[BP]], at the end of 2009, proved gas reserves were dominated by three countries: [[Energy in Iran|Iran]], [[Energy in Russia|Russia]], and [[Energy in Qatar|Qatar]], which together held nearly half the world's proven reserves.&lt;ref name=TI2011&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf 2011 report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue Transparency] [[Transparency International]] 2011 page reserves 113&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA (47.6 trillion cubic meters),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html Natural gas - proved reserves]. Retrieved 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the US Energy Information Administration (49 tcm),&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/todayenergy/detail.cfm?id=23472]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}. Retrieved 23 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and OPEC (48.81 tcm).&lt;ref name="opec.org"&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T32.HTM Table 3.2 Natural gas proven reserves by country]. Retrieved 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, BP credits Russia with only 32.9 tcm,&lt;ref&gt;BP, [http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013.html BP Statistical Review of World Energy], June 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206080516/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013.html |date=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would place it in second place, slightly behind Iran (33.1 to 33.8 tcm, depending on the source).

Due to constant announcements of [[shale gas]] ''recoverable'' reserves, as well as drilling in Central Asia, South America and Africa, [[deepwater drilling]], estimates are undergoing frequent updates, mostly increasing. Since 2000, some countries, notably the US and Canada, have seen large increases in proved gas reserves due to development of [[shale gas]], but shale gas deposits in most countries are yet to be added to reserve calculations.

'''Near-field optics''' is that branch of [[optics]] that considers configurations that depend on the passage of [[light]] to, from, through, or near an element with [[subwavelength]] features, and the coupling of that light to a second element located a subwavelength distance from the first.  The barrier of spatial resolution imposed by the very nature of light itself in conventional [[Optical microscope|optical microscopy]] contributed significantly to the development of near-field optical devices, most notably the [[near-field scanning optical microscope]], or NSOM.

==Size constraints==
The limit of [[optical resolution]] in a conventional [[microscope]], the so-called [[diffraction limit]], is in the order of half the [[wavelength]] of the  light used to [[Optical imaging|image]].  Thus, when imaging at visible wavelengths, the smallest resolvable features are several hundred [[nanometer]]s in size (although point-like sources, such as quantum dots, can be resolved quite readily).  Using near-field optical techniques, researchers currently resolve features in the order of tens of nanometers in size.  While other imaging techniques (e.g. [[atomic force microscopy]] and [[electron microscopy]]) can resolve features of much smaller size, the many advantages of optical microscopy make near-field optics a field of considerable interest.

==History==
The notion of developing a near-field optical device was first conceived by [[Edward Hutchinson Synge]] in 1928 but was not realized experimentally until the 1950s when several researchers demonstrated the feasibility of sub-wavelength resolution.  Published images of sub-wavelength resolution appeared when Ash and Nichols examined [[Diffraction grating|gratings]] with line spacing less than one [[millimeter]] using [[microwave]]s of 3&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength.  In 1982 Dieter Pohl at [[IBM]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], first obtained sub-wavelength resolution at visible wavelengths using near-field optical techniques.

Although the projects share the common name they are not related at the [[source code]] level.

== Olex ==
Olex program is designed for the analysis of extended structural networks. It only runs on Windows systems and source code is available only on request. It allows packing the structure, constructing the topological network and the evaluation of the networks [[Schläfli symbol|Schläfli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Three-Dimensional Nets and Polyhedra |author=Wells, A. F. |year=1977 |publisher=New York: John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Vertex symbols for zeolite nets |author1=O'Keeffe M. |author2=Hyde S.T. |journal=Zeolites |year=1997 |volume=19 |pages=370–374 |doi=10.1016/s0144-2449(97)00133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; symbols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Topological analysis in Olex |url=http://www.iucr.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/6358/iucrcompcomm_nov2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to produce [[Raster graphics|raster]] pictures of the model visible on screen. This kind of the topological network analysis is normally done to find relevance of considered structures and possibly to predict physical properties of the investigated material.

Olex2 is a relatively new, open source software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olex2 at SourceForge |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/olex2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olex2 at Ohloh|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/olex2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[BSD licence]] which provides tools from the crystallographic structure solution to the final report preparation. It is still in the stage of active development. Olex2 platform independent GUI is provided by wxWidgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=wxWidgets|url=http://www.wxwidgets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olex2 has an extended [[HTML]] based interface, enhanced by Pillow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The friendly PIL fork|url=https://python-pillow.github.io}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[OpenGL]] graphics. Olex2 provides numerous tools for the structure analysis and publication, including [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] maps and voids calculation and visualisation, space group determination, calculation of esd's for almost any possible geometrical parameters, [[Common Intermediate Format|CIF]] translation to HTML and other documents, [[hydrogen atom]] placement and many others. Olex2 provides the final picture output as raster images or [[PostScript]], Ortep&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ortep III |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ortep/ortep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;-like or [[POV-Ray]] output. The software is provided as pre-build binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux as well as in the source code form. Several build scripts ([[SCons]], [[CMake]] and [[make (software)|make]]) are provided to help with the Olex2 development - but only SCons is supported throughout and used for each release update and any problems have to be addressed to the supporters. Olex2 is now supported by OlexSys Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OlexSys Ltd|url=http://www.olexsys.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a GUI Olex2 is built from two components - the Olex2 core, written in C++ and exposing underlying model to the GUI, mostly based on the Python code. This segregation allows extending Olex2 with custom scripts and exploiting its functionality by the user at various levels - miller index operations, file manipulations and many others.

Olex2 provides a set of commercial extensions:
* 3DPlus: provides a way to output STL, VRML and PLY files for 3D printing
* ReportPlus: professionally looking structure determination reports including the possibility to combine structures

The '''United States's Julin nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 7 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1991–1992. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite paper|first=V.

 |+ United States' Julin series tests and detonations
 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions – Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 – 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''[[Voyager 1]]'' approached the Jupiter system in March 1979, it acquired numerous images of the planet and its four largest satellites, including Io.  One of the most distinctive features of these distant images of Io was a large, elliptical, footprint-shaped ring on the satellite's trailing hemisphere (the side facing away from the direction of motion in a synchronously-rotating satellite like Io).&lt;ref name="VoyagertoJupiter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=David.; Samz, Jane |title=Voyager to Jupiter |date=1980 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |isbn= |pages=74–102 |chapter=The First Encounter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the encounter itself on March 5, 1979, ''Voyager 1'' acquired high-resolution images of the footprint-shaped region.  At the center of [[bow tie]]-shaped dark region in the middle of the ring was a depression partially filled with dark material, {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observations and temperatures of Io's Pele Patera from Cassini and Galileo spacecraft images |journal=Icarus |last=Radebaugh |first=J. |display-authors=etal |pages=65–79 |volume=169 |issue= 1|date=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.019 |bibcode=2004Icar..169...65R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This depression, later found to be the source of the Pele volcano, is at the northern base of a rifted mountain later named Danube Planum.  With the other dramatic evidence for volcanic activity on the surface of Io from this encounter, researchers hypothesized that Pele was likely a [[caldera]].&lt;ref name="VoyagertoJupiter"/&gt;

On March 8, 1979, three days after passing Jupiter, ''Voyager 1'' took images of Jupiter's moons to help mission controllers determine the spacecraft's exact location, a process called optical navigation. While processing images of Io to enhance the visibility of background stars, navigation engineer [[Linda A. Morabito|Linda Morabito]] found a {{convert|300|km|adj=on}} tall cloud along the moon's [[wikt:limb|limb]].&lt;ref name="Morabito1979"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Discovery of currently active extraterrestrial volcanism |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |last=Morabito |first=L.

The feature was determined to be a volcanic plume {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, generated by active volcanism at Pele.&lt;ref name="Strom1979"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volcanic eruption plumes on Io |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |last=Strom |first=R.

When ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flew through the Jupiter system in July 1979, its imaging campaign was modified to observe Io's plumes in action and to look for surface changes.  Pele's plume, designated Plume 1 at the time as it was the first of Io's volcanic plumes to be discovered, was not seen by ''Voyager 2'' four months later.  Surface monitoring observations revealed changes with the red ring surrounding Pele.&lt;ref name="Smith1979b"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Galilean Satellites and Jupiter: Voyager 2 Imaging Science Results |journal=Science |last=Smith |first=B. A. |display-authors=etal |pages=927–50 |volume=206 |issue=4421 |date=1979 |doi=10.1126/science.206.4421.927 |pmid=17733910|bibcode = 1979Sci...206..927S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it was heart- or hoofprint-shaped during the ''Voyager 1'' encounter, it was now more elliptical with the notch in the southern part of the plume deposit now filled in, possibly due to changes in the distribution of plume sources within the Pele [[Volcanism on Io#Intra-patera eruptions|patera]].&lt;ref name="Smith1979b"/&gt;

Following the Voyager encounters, the [[International Astronomical Union]] [[Planetary nomenclature|officially named]] the volcano after the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian]] volcano goddess, [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], in 1979.&lt;ref name="PlanetaryNomenclature"/&gt;

===''Galileo'' and beyond===
[[Image:Pele Io I32.jpg|right|thumb|Infrared image showing night-time thermal emission from the lava lake Pele]]
''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' arrived at the Jupiter system in 1995 and, from 1996 to 2001, regularly monitored volcanic activity on Io through observations of Io's thermal emission at near-infrared wavelengths, imaging Io while it was in the Jupiter's shadow in order to look for thermal hotspots at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and imaging Io during most orbit in order to detect changes in the appearance of diffuse material and lava flows on the surface.&lt;ref name="McEwen1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen |first=A.

It was detected only twice by ''Galileo'' in December 1996 and December 2000.&lt;ref name="Geissler2008"/&gt;  In these two detections, the plume height varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|426|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Geissler2008"/&gt;  The plume was also detected  by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in October 1999 while ''Galileo'' was conducting a flyby of the moon.  The Hubble observations allowed for the detection of diatomic [[sulfur]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the first time on Io in Pele's plume.&lt;ref name="Spencer2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spencer |first=J.

During ''Galileo's'' [[Planetary flyby|encounters]] with Io between October 1999 and October 2001, the spacecraft observed Pele on three occasions using its camera and infrared spectrometers while the volcano was on Io's night-side.  The cameras revealed a curved line of bright spots along the margin of the Pele patera (a term used for volcanic depressions on Io, akin to calderas).  Within the east-west dark band along the southeastern portion of the patera, a large amount of thermal emission was observed, with temperatures and distribution consistent with a large, basaltic lava lake.&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"/&gt;

Thermal emission at Pele was also seen in December 2000 by the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft, in December 2001 from the [[W. M.

==Physical characteristics==

===Lava lake===
[[Image:Pele Labeled VGR1 c1639130.png|thumb|right|Highest resolution image of Pele taken by ''Voyager 1'' in March 1979]]
Pele has a volcanic crater, also known a patera, {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} in size,&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"/&gt; which lies at the base of the northern tip of the mountain Danube Planum.  The patera has multiple floor levels, with a higher north-eastern section and a lower section that consists of an east-west-trending [[graben]].&lt;ref name="IoVolcanismChap10"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=A. |title=Volcanism on Io: A Comparison with Earth |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-85003-7 |pages=178&amp;ndash;191 |chapter=The Lava Lake at Pele }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volcanic activity at Pele, as seen in images taken by ''Galileo'' in October 2001 while Pele was on Io's night side, appears to be limited to small thermal "hot-spots" along the margins of the patera and a more intense thermal emission source within a dark area in the southeast portion of the patera floor.&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"/&gt;  This distribution of activity, combined with Pele's stability as a hotspot in terms of temperature and power emitted, suggests that Pele is a large, active [[lava lake]], a combination of eruption style and intensity of activity not seen elsewhere on Io.&lt;ref name="IoVolcanismChap10"/&gt;  The small hotspots seen in the Galileo data represent areas where the crust of the lava lake breaks up along the margins of the patera, allowing fresh lava to become exposed at the surface.&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"/&gt;  The southeastern portion of the patera, an area of dark terrain in ''Voyager 1'' imagery, is the most active region of the Pele volcano, with the most extensive region of hot lava at Pele.  This area is thought to be a vigorously overturning lava lake, suggestive of a combination of a large mass flux of lava to the lake from a magma reservoir below the surface and a large mass fraction of dissolved volatiles like [[sulfur dioxide]] and diatomic [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="IoVolcanismChap10"/&gt;  Given Pele's brightness at near-infrared wavelengths, activity at this portion of the lava lake may also result in [[lava fountain]]ing.&lt;ref name="IoVolcanismChap10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Battaglia2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Io's theothermal (sulfur) - Lithosphere cycle inferred from sulfur solubility modeling of Pele's magma supply |journal=Icarus |last=Battaglia |first=S.M. |display-authors=etal |pages=123&amp;ndash;129 |volume=235 |issue= |date=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.03.019 | bibcode=  2014Icar..235..123B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lava temperatures measured using the [[Infrared|near-infrared]] [[emission spectrum]] of thermal hotspots observed at Pele are consistent with silicate basaltic lava erupting at the lava lake.  The measurements from ''Galileo'' and ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'' images of Pele suggest peak temperatures of at least 1250-1350&amp;nbsp;°C, while the near-infrared spectrometer on ''Galileo'' found peak temperatures of 1250-1280&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Keszthelyi2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New estimates for Io eruption temperatures: Implications for the interior |journal=Icarus |last=Keszthelyi |first=L. |display-authors=etal |pages=491–502 |volume=192 |issue= 2|date=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.008 |bibcode=2007Icar..192..491K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Pele's energy output and temperature remained consistent on the timescale of months to years throughout much of the ''Galileo'' missions, measurements of Pele's brightness using ''Cassini'' data taken during an [[eclipse]] of Io by Jupiter found considerable variations on the timescale of minutes.  This is consistent with variations in the distribution and size of lava fountains at Pele over that timeframe.&lt;ref name="Radebaugh2004"/&gt;

===Plume===
Pele's plume is the [[archetype|archetypal]] Pele-type plume: {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, producing a large reddish deposit that is concentric around the source vent.  The plume is created from the degassing of sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from erupting lava in the Pele lava lake.&lt;ref name="IoVolcanismChap10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Battaglia2014"/&gt; The persistence of degassed sulfurous compounds to Pele's plume is likely from a stable and consistent magma supply to its lava lake,&lt;ref name="Battaglia2014"/&gt; which could be the largest magma chamber of Io's volcanoes.&lt;ref name="Battaglia2015LPSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2015/pdf/1044.pdf |first1=Steven M. |last1=Battaglia |title=Io: The role of sulfide droplet nucleation in Pele-type volcanism |date=March 2015 |publisher=46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of the plume taken by ''Voyager 1'' revealed a large structure without a central column like the smaller, [[Prometheus (volcano)|Prometheus-type]] plumes, but instead having a filamentary structure.&lt;ref name="McEwen1983"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Two classes of volcanic plume on Io |journal=Icarus |last=McEwen |first=A.

'''Philippe Danfrie''' the elder (about 1532 in [[Cornouaille]] in [[Brittany]] - 1606 in [[Paris]]), was a designer and maker of [[mathematical instrument]]s in metal and paper, as well as a type-cutter, engraver, minter of coins and medals, publisher and author. Much is known about Danfrie's life and activities. He is probably best known as designer of the surveying instrument known as the [[graphometer]].

Danfrie went to Paris in the 1550s and set up as an engraver of letter punches. He produced a number of books in partnership with [[Richard Breton]] in 1558–60 and later with Pierre Haman and Jean Le Royer. He also made mathematical instruments, globes and astrolabes and dies for marking bookbindings. In 1571 he cut his first dies for [[jeton]]s. As Engraver-General of the French coinage from 1582, he provided the puncheons from which the dies used in every mint in France were taken. He also produced a number of medals (e.g. London, BM) commemorating the events of the first fifteen years of Henry IV’s reign.

Engraver and superintendent of the [[Paris Mint]], Philippe Danfrie was also an engineer and inventor of scientific instruments. Active in the second half of the sixteenth century, he built globes, astrolabes, and clocks. He invented a typeface that he used in his published writings. These include: ''Declaration de l'usage du Graphometre...'', printed in Paris in 1597 together with ''Traicte de l'usage du Trigometre, avec le quel on peut facilement mesurer sans subiection d'Arithmetique''.

His son '''Philippe Danfrie the younger''' (b. ?Paris, c. 1572; d. Paris, 1604) was appointed Controller-General of effigies in 1591. On his appointment it was claimed that he had demonstrated great skill in modelling portraits in wax and engraving puncheons. His most famous and only signed medal (e.g. London, BM) is cast rather than struck and celebrates the victory of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] over the [[House of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]] in 1600.

Cosmologists and astrophysicists who have evaluated plasma cosmology have rejected it because it does not match the observations of astrophysical phenomena as well as current cosmological theory. Very few papers supporting plasma cosmology have appeared in the literature since the mid-1990s.

The term ''plasma universe'' is sometimes used as a synonym for plasma cosmology,&lt;ref name="Peratt1992"/&gt; as an alternative description of the plasma in the universe.&lt;ref name=Alfven1990 /&gt;

|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Alfvén–Klein cosmology, sometimes called Klein–Alfvén cosmology, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]] with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic [[electromagnetic fields]] formed by [[Double layer (plasma physics)|double layers]], thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term ambiplasma for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of ambiplasma. According to Alfvén, such an ambiplasma would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of ambiplasma was developed further into the forms of heavy ambiplasma (protons-antiprotons) and light ambiplasma (electrons-positrons).&lt;ref name="Alfven1966" /&gt;

Alfvén–Klein cosmology was proposed in part to explain the observed [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, starting from an [[initial condition]] of exact [[symmetry]] between matter and antimatter. According to Alfvén and Klein, ambiplasma would naturally form pockets of matter and pockets of antimatter that would expand outwards as annihilation between matter and antimatter occurred in the double layer at the boundaries. They concluded that we must just happen to live in one of the pockets that was mostly [[baryon]]s rather than [[antibaryon]]s, explaining the baryon asymmetry. The pockets, or bubbles, of matter or antimatter would expand because of annihilations at the boundaries, which Alfvén considered as a possible explanation for the observed [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], which would be merely a local phase of a much larger history. Alfvén postulated that the universe has always existed &lt;ref name="Alfven1988"&gt;{{cite web

In 1993, theoretical cosmologist [[Jim Peebles]] criticized Alfvén–Klein cosmology, writing that "there is no way that the results can be consistent with the isotropy of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] and [[X-ray background]]s".&lt;ref name="Peebles1993"&gt;{{cite book

|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book he also showed that Alfvén's models do not predict [[Hubble's law]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|the abundance of light elements]], or the existence of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. A further difficulty with the ambiplasma model is that matter–antimatter [[annihilation]] results in the production of high energy [[photon]]s, which are not observed in the amounts predicted. While it is possible that the local "matter-dominated" cell is simply larger than the [[observable universe]], this proposition does not lend itself to observational tests.

== Plasma cosmology and the study of galaxies ==

Hannes Alfvén from the 1960s to 1980s argued that plasma played an important if not dominant role in the universe because [[electromagnetic force]]s are far more important than [[gravity]] when acting on interplanetary and interstellar [[charged particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Alfvén and C.-G. Falthammar, ''Cosmic electrodynamics''(2nd edition, Clarendon press, Oxford, 1963). "The basic reason why electromagnetic phenomena are so important in cosmical physics is that there exist celestial magnetic fields which affect the motion of charged particles in space ... The strength of the interplanetary magnetic field is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; gauss (10 [[nanotesla]]s), which gives the [ratio of the magnetic force to the force of gravity] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. This illustrates the enormous importance of interplanetary and interstellar magnetic fields, compared to gravitation, as long as the matter is ionized." (p.2-3)&lt;/ref&gt; He further hypothesized that they might promote the contraction of [[interstellar cloud]]s and may even constitute the main mechanism for contraction, initiating [[star formation]].&lt;ref name="Alfven1978" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | last2 = Carlqvist | first2 = P. | year = 1978 | title = Interstellar clouds and the formation of stars | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978Ap%26SS..55..487A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30728 | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 487–509 | bibcode=1978Ap&amp;SS..55..487A|doi = 10.1007/BF00642272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current standard view is that magnetic fields can hinder collapse, that large-scale [[Birkeland current]]s have not been observed, and that the length scale for charge neutrality is predicted to be far smaller than the relevant cosmological scales.&lt;ref name="Siegel2006" &gt;{{cite document |author= Siegel, E.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Alfvén and [[Anthony Peratt]], a plasma physicist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], outlined a program they called the "plasma universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | year = 1986 | title = Model of the Plasma Universe | url = http://www.plasmauniverse.info/downloads/ModelOfTPU_Alfv%C3%A9n.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = PS-14 | issue =  | page =  | doi = 10.1109/tps.1986.4316614 | bibcode = 1986ITPS...14..629A }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WI1&gt;A.

For example, Peratt proposed that the mainstream approach to galactic dynamics which relied on gravitational modeling of stars and gas in galaxies with the addition of dark matter was overlooking a possibly major contribution from plasma physics.

==Comparison to mainstream astrophysics==
Standard astronomical modeling and theories attempt to incorporate all known [[physics]] into descriptions and explanations of observed phenomena, with [[Gravitation|gravity]] playing a dominant role on the largest scales as well as in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[Stellar dynamics|dynamics]]. To that end, both [[Keplerian]] orbits and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] are generally used as the underlying frameworks for modeling astrophysical systems and [[structure formation]], while [[high-energy astronomy]] and [[particle physics in cosmology]] additionally appeal to [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] processes including plasma physics and [[radiative transfer]] to explain relatively small scale energetic processes observed in the [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. In conventional cosmology, [[plasma physics]] is not considered to be the dominant force on most large-scale phenomena, although much of the matter in the universe is thought to be ionised or exist as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. (See [[astrophysical plasma]] for more.)

Proponents of plasma cosmology claim electrodynamics is as important as gravity in explaining the structure of the universe, and speculate that it provides an alternative explanation for the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]]&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; and the initial collapse of interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name=Alfven1978 /&gt; In particular plasma cosmology is claimed to provide an alternative explanation for the flat [[galaxy rotation curve|rotation curves]] of spiral galaxies and to do away with the need for [[dark matter]] in galaxies and with the need for [[supermassive black holes]] in galaxy centres to power [[quasars]] and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Peratt1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; However, theoretical analysis shows that "many scenarios for the generation of seed magnetic fields, which rely on the survival and sustainability of currents at early times [of the universe are disfavored]",&lt;ref name=Siegel2006 /&gt; i.e. Birkeland currents of the magnitude needed (10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; amps over scales of megaparsecs) for galaxy formation do not exist.&lt;ref name="Colafrancesco2006" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colafrancesco | first1 = S. | last2 = Giordano | first2 = F. | year = 2006 | title = The impact of magnetic field on the cluster M - T relation | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 454 | issue = 3| pages = L131–134 | bibcode=2006A&amp;A...454L.131C | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20065404|arxiv = astro-ph/0701852 }} recount: "Numerical simulations have shown that the wide-scale magnetic fields in massive clusters produce variations of the cluster mass at the level of ~ 5 − 10% of their unmagnetized value ... Such variations are not expected to produce strong variations in the relative [mass-temperature] relation for massive clusters."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of the issues that were mysterious in the 1980s and 1990s, including discrepancies relating to the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the nature of [[quasars]], have been solved with more evidence that, in detail, provides a distance and time scale for the universe.

Some of the places where plasma cosmology supporters are most at odds with standard explanations include the need for their models to have light element production without [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], which, in the context of Alfvén–Klein cosmology, has been shown to produce excessive [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s beyond that observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 1985 | title = Big Bang Photosynthesis and Pregalactic Nucleosynthesis of Light Elements | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985ApJ...293L..53A | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 293 | issue = | pages = L53–L57 | bibcode=1985ApJ...293L..53A|doi = 10.1086/184490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | display-authors = etal   | year = 1976 | title = The origin of deuterium | doi = 10.1038/263198a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 263 | pages = 198–202|bibcode = 1976Natur.263..198E }} point out that if proton fluxes with energies greater than 500 MeV were intense enough to produce the observed levels of deuterium, they would also produce about 1000 times more gamma rays than are observed.&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma cosmology proponents have made further proposals to explain light element abundances, but the attendant issues have not been fully addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. 10 in "Galactic Model of Element Formation" (Lerner, ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' Vol. 17, No. 2, April 1989 [http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229074857/http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf |date=2006-12-29 }}) is J.Audouze and J.Silk, "Pregalactic Synthesis of Deuterium" in ''Proc.

He cites neither Audouze nor Epstein in this context, and does not explain why his result contradicts theirs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Eric Lerner published his alternative explanation for the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Eric | date = 1995 | title = Intergalactic Radio Absorption and the COBE Data | url = http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 227 | issue =  | pages = 61–81 | doi = 10.1007/bf00678067 | bibcode = 1995Ap&amp;SS.227...61L | access-date = 2012-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083205/http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that his model explained the fidelity of the CMB spectrum to that of a black body and the low level of anisotropies found, even while the level of isotropy at 1:10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is not accounted for to that precision by any alternative models. Additionally, the sensitivity and resolution of the measurement of the CMB anisotropies was greatly advanced by [[WMAP]] and the [[Planck satellite]] and the statistics of the signal were so in line with the predictions of the Big Bang model, that the CMB has been heralded as a major confirmation of the Big Bang model to the detriment of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spergel | first1 = D.

[[File:Null Island 2017.jpg|thumb|right|The "[[Null Island]]" buoy in 2017]]
The '''Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Atlantic''', also known as '''PIRATA''', is a system of [[mooring (oceanography)|moored]] observation [[buoy|buoys]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] which collect [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[oceanography|oceanographic]] data. The data collected by the PIRATA array helps scientists to better understand climatic events in the Tropical Atlantic and to improve weather forecasting and climate research worldwide. Climatic and oceanic events in the tropical Atlantic, such as the [[Tropical Atlantic SST Dipole]] affect rainfall and climate in both [[West Africa]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]]. The northern tropical Atlantic is also a major formation area for hurricanes affecting the West Indies and the United States.&lt;ref name="PBAMS"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernard Bourles|date=August 2008|title=The PIRATA Program, History, Accomplishments, and Future Directions.|work=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|accessdate=23 May 2013|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/PIRATA_2008.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the [[Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction|RAMA]] array in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project|TAO/TRITON]] network in the [[Pacific Ocean]], PIRATA forms part of the worldwide system of tropical ocean observing buoys.&lt;ref name=Phome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/|title=PIRATA Home Page |publisher=NOAA Pacific Marine Laboratory |year=2010|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
The project is a tripartite cooperation between [[Brazil]], [[France]] and the [[United States]]. The principal agencies involved are [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] in the United States, [[Institut de recherche pour le développement|IRD]] and [[Météo-France]] of France plus [[National Institute for Space Research|INPE]] and DHN from Brazil.&lt;ref name=Phome/&gt;

==PIRATA network==
The PIRATA buoy network consists of seventeen Autonomous Temperature Line Acquesition System, or ATLAS, buoys. Twelve buoys were originally deployed in 1997. Two of these buoys were decommissioned in 1999 because of vandalism by fishing craft. Three extensions of the original network have been added. Three buoys were deployed off the coast of Brazil in 2005 and four more in 2006/2007 to extend coverage to the north and the north-east. As a demonstration exercise one buoy was deployed to the south-east of the region, off the coast of Africa, between June 2006 and June 2007.&lt;ref name="PBAMS"/&gt;

In addition to the ATLAS buoys, PIRATA has three island based meteorological stations, one at [[Fernando de Noronha]], another on the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]] and one on [[São Tomé]]. A [[tidal gauge]] is also maintained at São Tomé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brest.ird.fr/pirata/pirata.php|title=PIRATA France |publisher=PIRATA France |year=2010|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated hydrographic cruises and annual buoy maintenance voyages are also undertaken under the auspices of the PIRATA project.

===ATLAS buoys===
Each ATLAS buoy measures
*wind speed and direction,
*air temperature,
*rainfall,
*humidity,
*solar radiation,
*pressure, temperature and conductivity to 500&amp;nbsp;metres below sea level.
In addition one buoy has an [[Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler]] fitted alongside to measure [[water current]] [[velocity|velocities]] and four buoys are equipped to measure net heat flux.&lt;ref name="PBAMS"/&gt;

Daily mean observations from the ATLAS buoys are received in near real time via both the [[Argos System]] and Brazilian satellites. The data is processed by the [[Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project|TAO Project Office]] of [[NOAA]] and also placed on the [[Global Telecommunications System]] for real time distribution to weather centres and other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/proj_over/gts.html|title=GTS data distribution|publisher=The TAO Project |year=2010|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency measurements are stored on the buoys and retrieved during maintenance operations. The array provides 4,000 to 4,500 unique hourly values per month.&lt;ref name="PBAMS"/&gt;

'''''Principles of Geology: being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation''''' is a book by the Scottish geologist [[Charles Lyell]] that was first published in 3 volumes from 1830–1833. Lyell used the theory of [[Uniformitarianism]] to describe how the Earth's surface was changing over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|last2=Morus|first2=Iwan Rhys|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=9780226068619|location=Chicago|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was in direct contrast to the geological theory of [[Catastrophism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many individuals believed in catastrophism to allow room for religious beliefs. For example, [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]] could be described thus as a real geological event as catastrophism describes the changing of the Earth surface as one-time, violent events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lyell challenged the believers of the catastrophic theory by studying [[Mount Etna]] in Sicily and describing the changes from one [[stratum]] to another and the fossil records within the rocks to prove that slow, gradual changes were the cause of the ever-changing Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lyell used geological proof to determine that the Earth was older than 6,000 years, as had been previously contested. The book shows that the processes that are occurring in the present are the same processes that occurred in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Lyell, Charles. ''The Principles of Ecology'', London: 1833.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==

&lt;!--need to explain context in a little more detail with Hutton, catastrophism, fire vs water etc--&gt;
Published in three volumes in 1830–33, the book established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist and popularized the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (first suggested by [[James Hutton]] in ''[[Theory of the Earth]]'' published in 1795).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The central argument in ''Principles'' was that "the present is the key to the past": that geological remains from the distant past could, and should, be explained by reference to geological processes now in operation and thus directly observable.

The book is notable for being one of the first to use the term "[[evolution]]" in the context of biological speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Peter J. (1975). ''The Changing Meaning of “Evolution”''. ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'' 36: 95-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, R. J. (1992). ''Evolution''. In Evelyn Fox Keller, Elisabeth Lloyd. ''Keywords in Evolutionary Biology''. Cambridge, Massachusetts. pp. 95-105. {{ISBN|978-0674503137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lyell's work, he described the three rules he believes to cause the steady change of the Earth. The first rule is that geologic change comes from slow and continual procedures that have been happening over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This rule is the basic ideal of Uniformitarianism and is easy to understand why this was a rule. The second rule is that all the forces that affect the geology of the Earth comes from the Earth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The third rule is that celestial cycles do not impact the patterns of Earth's geologic record.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rule two and rule three go together because Lyell thought that only forces on the Earth cause changes to Earth's geology, and nothing else.

Volume 1 introduces Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism. He develops and argues that the earthly processes that we see in the present were the same processes as in the past and caused the Earth to look like it does today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Geology|last=Lyell|first=Charles|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1990|isbn=9780226497945|editor-last=Rudwick|editor-first=Martin|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 2 builds off of the uniformitarianism theory in volume 1, but focuses more on the organic matter rather than the inorganic matter. This volume is what Darwin took with him on his voyage on the ''Beagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Principles of Geology|last=Lyell|first=Charles|last2=|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1991|isbn=9780226497976|editor-last=Rudwick|editor-first=Martin|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd volume, Lyell identifies four periods of the Tertiary: Newer Pliocene, Older Pliocene, Miocene, and the Eocene. Lyell used deposits and fossils from these periods to argue for uniformity during the Tertiary. This also talks about the grammar or syntax of the processes that occurred in the past in today's language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Geology|last=Lyell|first=Charles|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=9780226497990|editor-last=Rudwick|editor-first=Martin|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Lyell's interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a central theme in the ''Principles'', influenced the 22-year-old [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who was given Volume 1 of the first edition by [[Robert FitzRoy]], captain of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], just before they set out (December 1831) on their [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage on the ''Beagle'']]. On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]], Darwin found rock formations which -seen "through Lyell's eyes"- gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels. While in South America, Darwin received Volume 2, which rejected the idea of organic [[evolution]], proposing "Centres of Creation" to explain diversity and territory of species. Darwin's ideas gradually moved beyond this, but in geology he operated very much as Lyell's disciple and sent home extensive evidence and theorizing supporting Lyell's uniformitarianism, including Darwin's ideas about the formation of [[atoll]]s.

==Criticism==
Charles Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' was met with a lot of criticism when it was first published. The main argument against Lyell is that he took an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' approach in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Fate|first=V.J.|date=2011|title=Arguing for Uniformity: Rethinking Lyell's Principles of Geology|url=|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=19 |issue=2|pages=136–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that [[Charles Lyell]] was pulling from a theoretical idea instead of pulling from empirical evidence to explain what was occurring in the geological world. One opponent of ''Principles of Geology'' that agreed with this point was [[Adam Sedgwick]]. This opposition from Sedgwick comes from his thinking that evidence is all that is needed to support an idea, and that the evidence of geologic events points to a catastrophic event. The criticism of Lyell and his work continued into the 20th century. These arguments agreed with the ''a priori'' argument, but continued on to say that Lyell combined the empirical evidence with the scientific explanation of geology that was accepted at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Fate|first=V.J.|date=2011|title=Arguing for Uniformity: Rethinking Lyell's Principles of Geology|url=|journal=Perspectives of Science|volume=19 |issue=2|pages=140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''a priori'' argument is not the only argument that Lyell faced for his work. In 1812, [[Georges Cuvier|Baron Georges Cuvier]] argued against uniformitarianism with the results of his study of the Paris Basin.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampino|first=Michael|date=August 2017|title=Reexamining Lyell's Laws|url=|journal=American Scientist|volume=105|pages=224–231|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier and his colleagues found long period of consistent change with intermittent patterns of sudden fossil disappearance in the geologic record for the area, which is now known as [[Extinction event|mass extinction]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cuvier explained these sudden changes in the geologic record with catastrophic forces. Lyell responded to this argument, stating that the geologic record was "grossly imperfect" and that observations cannot be trusted if they go against "the plan of Nature".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In recent years, geologists have begun to question the laws of uniformitarianism Lyell laid out. There is now clear evidence of catastrophic change caused by volcanic eruptions, large earthquakes, and asteroid impacts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, there is evidence that certain cataclysmic occurrences that left marks in the geological and fossil records may correspond to the periodicity of the solar system's 26-million-year cycle of movement around the galactic core of the Milky Way. Even if catastrophes are rare, their magnitude may affect geology more than has been appreciated under Lyell's version of uniformitarianism. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Material on conveyor during commissioning (7548464136).jpg|thumb|Commissioning of a conveyor where equipment is being tested to its maximum rating and capacity of operation.]]

'''Project commissioning''' is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a [[building]] or [[industrial plant]] are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client. A commissioning process may be applied not only to new [[project]]s but also to existing units and systems subject to expansion, [[renovation]] or [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|revamping]].&lt;ref&gt; HORSLEY, D. Process Plant Commissioning, a User Guide, Institution of Chemical Engineering, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; FARES, F., MONTENEGRO, B., PRATES, A., ''Commissioning of Oil &amp; Gas Projects – Current Status, Evolution and Trends''. in: Rio Oil &amp; Gas 2010, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, set 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the commissioning process comprises the integrated application of a set of [[engineering]] techniques and procedures to check, inspect and test every operational component of the project, from individual functions, such as [[measurement instrument|instrument]]s and equipment, up to complex amalgamations such as [[Modular design|module]]s, [[subsystem]]s and [[system]]s.

Commissioning activities, in the broader sense, are applicable to all phases of the project, from the basic and detailed [[design]], [[procurement]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing|assembly]], until the final handover of the unit to the owner, including sometimes an [[assisted operation]] phase.

== Independent discipline ==
Commissioning of large civil and industrial projects is a complex and sophisticated technical specialty which may be considered as a specific and independent  [[:Category:Engineering disciplines|engineering discipline]]. As such, it can be as important as the more traditional ones, i.e. [[civil engineering|civil]], [[naval architecture|naval]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[instrumentation]], [[automation]], or [[telecommunications engineering|telecom]] engineering. Large projects for which this statement can be made include chemical and petrochemical [[plants]], [[oil platform|oil and gas platforms]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], metallurgical plants, paper and cellulose plants, coal handling plants, thermoelectric and hydroelectric plants, buildings, bridges, highways, and railroads.

However, there is currently no formal education or university degree which addresses the training or certification of a "Project Commissioning Engineer". Various short training courses and on-line training are available, but they are designed for qualified engineers. Commissioning for buildings is a specific discipline in itself, and there are qualifications available for this.

The International Association of Commissioning Engineers (IACE) was formed in 2015 by a group of Commissioning Professionals, and launched in January 2016. IACE is preparing accredited qualifications to fill the gap in the academic landscape for Commissioning Engineers.

== Objective and impact  ==

The main objective of commissioning is to affect the safe and orderly [[handover]] of the unit from the constructor to the owner, guaranteeing its [[operability]] in terms of [[performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], safety and information [[traceability]]. Additionally, when executed in a planned and effective way, commissioning normally represents an essential factor for the fulfillment of schedule, costs, safety and quality requirements of the project. &lt;ref&gt; BENDIKSEN, T., YOUNG, G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNOPuByI6eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Projects: The Manager's Handbook], AuthorHouse Publishers, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissioning management systems  ==

For complex projects, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, together with the need to guarantee adequate information traceability, normally leads to the use of powerful [[Information technology|IT]] tools, known as [[commissioning management systems]], to allow effective planning and monitoring of the commissioning activities.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Red Sky at Morning'' (Speth book)}}
[[James Gustave Speth]] authored the book '''''Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment''''', which [[Yale University Press]] [[Publishing|published]] in 2004. A central premise of the book is that environmentalism, so far, has been unsuccessful in protecting the [[natural environment]] on Earth. Deprecating the past efficacy of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], the [[White House]] [[Council on Environmental Quality]], and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] — as well as the actions of the former [[George W. Bush]] administration – Speth writes (as cited in the ''TIME'' article listed in the "References" section): "The climate convention is not protecting climate, the biodiversity convention is not protecting biodiversity, [and] the desertification convention is not preventing desertification." Potential for effective environmentalism, he says (as cited in the ''TIME'' article) now rests upon actions analogous to "[[Jazz#Improvisation|jazz]]": volunteerism and improvisation. He also notes, "Since the [[Montreal Protocol]], [the United States] has not accorded global-scale environmental challenges the priority needed." (''p.116'')

[[File:Sfera Armillare Santucci.jpg|thumb|300px|Hall III of [[Museo Galileo]]]]
[[File:Antonio santucci, sfrea armillare (la più grande esistente al mondo), firenze 1588-93, 06.JPG|thumb|300px|Detail of Santucci's [[armillary sphere]]]]

'''Santucci's armillary sphere''' is a Ptolemaic [[armillary sphere]] at the [[Museo Galileo]], the largest existing in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armillary sphere|url=http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/object/ArmillarySphere_n04.html|publisher=Museo Galileo|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begun on March 4, 1588, and completed on May 6, 1593, this large armillary sphere was built under the supervision of [[Antonio Santucci]] at the request of [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]]. The sphere represents the "universal machine" of the world according to the concepts developed by [[Aristotle]] and perfected by [[Ptolemy]]. The terrestrial globe is placed at the center, and it also displays territories that were still relatively little known at the time.

The device was restored in the 19th century but is now incomplete and some of its parts are mismatched. The wooden parts of the sphere are elaborately painted and covered with fine [[gold leaf]]. The sphere rests on a stand with four [[siren (alarm)|siren]]s.

This model is similar to a smaller one built by Santucci in 1582 for King [[Philip II of Spain]], now in the [[Escorial Library]].

In [[scientific visualization]] '''skin friction lines''' are used to visualize flows on 3D-surfaces. They are obtained by calculating the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] of a derived vector field on the surface, the [[wall shear stress]]. [[Parasitic drag#Skin_friction|Skin friction]]  arises from the friction of the fluid against the "skin" of the object that is moving through it and forms a vector at each point on the surface. A skin friction line is a curve on the surface tangent to skin friction vectors. A '''limit streamline''' is a streamline where the distance normal to the surface tends to zero. Limit streamlines and skin friction lines coincide.&lt;ref name="Délery"&gt;{{Citation | title=Separation in three-dimensional flow: critical points, separation lines and vortices | author=Jean Délery | date=2011 | url=http://www.onera.fr/conferences-en/3d-separation/Onera-3D-separation-jean-delery-2011-1a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines can be visualized by placing a viscous film on the surface.&lt;ref name="Délery"/&gt;

The skin friction lines may exhibit a number of different types of singularities: attachment nodes, detachment nodes, Isotropic nodes, Saddle points, and foci.&lt;ref name="Délery"/&gt;

'''Stanislaus Josef Mathias von Prowazek, Edler von Lanow''' (12 November, 1875 [[Jindřichův Hradec]], Bohemia – 17 February, 1915, [[Cottbus]]), born '''Stanislav Provázek''', was a Czech [[zoologist]] and [[parasitology|parasitologist]], who along with [[pathologist]] [[Henrique da Rocha Lima]] (1879-1956) discovered the [[pathogen]] of [[epidemic typhus]].

As a student at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|University of Prague]], he was influenced by the teachings of [[zoologist]] [[Berthold Hatschek]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach]]. Other important influences to his career were [[immunologist]] [[Paul Ehrlich]] at the Institute for Experimental Therapy in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (1901) and [[zoologist]] [[Richard von Hertwig]] at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=WN&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3227.html Stanislaus von Prowazek] @ [[Who Named It]]&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[radiologist]] [[Ludwig Halberstädter]], he described the [[inclusion bodies]] (Halberstädter-Prowazek bodies) of ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'', the agent that is the cause of [[trachoma]].&lt;ref name=WN/&gt;

In 1906 he succeeded his late friend, [[Fritz Schaudinn]], as director of the zoological section at the [[Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine|Institut für Schiffs- und Tropenkrankheiten]] in [[Hamburg]]. In 1908 he conducted research at the [[Instituto Oswaldo Cruz]], outside of [[Rio de Janeiro]], and from 1910, carried out investigations of infectious diseases in [[Sumatra]], [[German Samoa]], [[Yap]] and [[Saipan]].&lt;ref name=WN/&gt;

Prowazek studied epidemic typhus in [[Serbia]] (1913) and [[Istanbul]] (1914). Later, while Prowazek and Rocha Lima were working in a German prison hospital, they both became infected with typhus. Prowazek died soon afterwards on February 17, 1915. Rocha Lima named the infectious agent of epidemic typhus - ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' - after his colleague.

'''''The Sleeper Awakes''''' (1910) is a [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction]] novel by English writer [[H. G. Wells]], about a man who sleeps for two hundred and three years, waking up in a completely transformed London where he has become the richest man in the world. The main character awakes to see his dreams realised, and the future revealed to him in all its horrors and malformities.

The novel is a rewritten version of '''''When the Sleeper Wakes''''', a story by Wells that was serialised between 1898 and 1899.

==Publication history==
The novel was originally published, as ''When the Sleeper Wakes'', in ''[[The Graphic]]'' from 1898 to 1903 and illustrated by H. Lanos.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Alan K. ed. The Collector's Book of Science Fiction by H. G. Wells. Castle Books; New Jersey, 1978. Pg 364&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with its original form, Wells, who was an outspoken socialist and author of [[prophecy|prophetic]] writings, rewrote it in 1910. "Like most of my earlier work", he wrote in the 1910 edition's preface, "it was written under considerable pressure; there are marks of haste not only in the writing of the latter part, but in the very construction of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wells |year=1910 |title=The Sleeper Awakes |chapter=Preface |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/read/11017/27891/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "[[A Story of the Days To Come]]" (1897) is a forerunner of the novel, being a tale set within the same future society.

Graham, an Englishman  living in [[London]]  in 1897 takes drugs to cure  [[insomnia]] and falls into a coma.  He  wakes up in 2100. He later learns that  he has inherited huge wealth and that his money has been put into a trust. Over the years, the trustees, the "White Council", have used his wealth to establish a vast political and economic world order.

When he wakes Graham  is disoriented. The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads  that the "Sleeper" has  awakened. A mob gathers around  the building and   demands to see the fabled Sleeper.  The people around Graham will not answer his questions.  They place Graham  under [[house arrest]]. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world.

Rebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape.  They say that the people need Graham's leadership to  rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them.   Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers  have gathered to prepare for the revolution.  They  march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police.  In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries.  He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a [[plutocracy]] and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a  figurehead.  The old man   thinks that the Sleeper is  a made-up figure used to brainwash the population.

Graham meets  Ostrog, who says  that the rebels have won and that the people  are demanding that  the Sleeper should rule.   Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham  gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry;  and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life  ends when  Helen Wotton tells him  that for the lower class the revolution has changed nothing.  Graham  questions Ostrog  who  admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited but defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so.

Ostrog admits  that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council.  Ostrog has used a black  African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious  and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself.

Graham  visits London in disguise to see how the workers live.  Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers  toil in factories, paid in food for each day's work, with no job security. They  speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife.  Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade.  The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by "babble machines" which spread news and "pleasure cities" where unspecified joys are available.  "Euthanasy" is considered normal.

Graham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London.  Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help  Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London.

Ostrog  escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London.  His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks  Ostrog's aeroplane but fails.  Graham's aeroplane  crashes.

==Themes==
Themes include socialism; the betrayal of revolution; and how an elite can manipulate a population both by oppression and impoverishment on the one hand, and by the use of technology and provision of pleasure on the other. In this respect, the book has elements explored later both in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]].

==Reception==
[[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' said of ''The Sleeper Awakes'' despite the "impossibly timid" and outdated science, "The worth of the story lies in its human values ... This is 'Young Wells' at his non-Utopian best".&lt;ref name="gale196004"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Floyd C. |date=April 1960 |title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n04_1960-04#page/n71/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Aspects of the novel's storyline are similar to the plot of the [[Woody Allen]] 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Robert Parish, Michael R. Pitts. ''The great science fiction pictures: Volume 1'', Scarecrow Press, 1977. Pg. 298: "Iconoclastic film star /filmmaker Woody Allen turned his comedic genius to a satirical look into the future with a storyline that owes a nod of gratitude to HG Wells' When the Sleeper Awakes."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulp writer [[Harry Stephen Keeler]] took the idea further in a 1914 story called "John Jones' Dollar", in which a solar system's economy is built around a single silver dollar left to accumulate until the year 2921 to the "astounding" sum of $6.3 trillion, financing an interplanetary socialist paradise.

The ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[A Fishful of Dollars]]" is loosely based upon Wells's novel. Fry discovers that his bank account has continued to accrue interest over the course of a thousand years.

This '''timeline of eurypterid research''' is a chronologically ordered list of important [[fossil]] discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and [[Biological taxonomy|taxonomic]] revisions of [[Eurypterid|eurypterids]], a group of extinct aquatic [[Arthropod|arthropods]] closely related to modern [[Horseshoe crab|horseshoe crabs]] that lived during the [[Paleozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]].

The scientific study of eurypterids began in the early 19th century when [[James Ellsworth De Kay|James E. DeKay]] recognized a fossil that had previously been described as that of a fish as arthropod in nature. Though DeKay erronously believed the fossil to represent a [[crustacean]] and a missing link between [[Trilobite|trilobites]] and [[Branchiopoda|branchiopods]], the fossil became the type species of first ever eurypterid to be scientifically described, ''[[Eurypterus remipes]]'', in [[1825 in paleontology|1825]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Clarke, J. K., Ruedemann R. (1912) "[[wikisource:The_Eurypterida_of_New_York/Volume_1/Eurypteridae|The Eurypterida of New York]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first eurypterid fossil to be discovered is unearthed in rocks in [[New York (state)|New York]] of [[Silurian]] age. It is described by Dr. S. L. Mitchill as an example of the fish ''[[Silurus]]'', possibly due to the [[catfish]]-like appearance of its carapace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7733">In [[probability theory]] and in particular in [[information theory]], '''total correlation''' (Watanabe 1960) is one of several generalizations of the [[mutual information]].  It is also known as the ''multivariate constraint'' (Garner 1962) or ''multiinformation'' (Studený &amp; Vejnarová 1999).  It quantifies the redundancy or dependency among a set of ''n'' random variables.

==Definition==
For a given set of ''n'' [[random variable]]s &lt;math&gt;\{X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the total correlation &lt;math&gt;C(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] from the joint distribution &lt;math&gt;p(X_1, \ldots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt; to the independent distribution of &lt;math&gt;p(X_1)p(X_2)\cdots p(X_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) \equiv \operatorname{D_{KL}}\left[ p(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \| p(X_1)p(X_2)\cdots p(X_n)\right] \; .&lt;/math&gt;

This divergence reduces to the simpler difference of entropies,
:&lt;math&gt;C(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n) = \left[\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_i)\right] - H(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;H(X_{i})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[information entropy]] of variable &lt;math&gt;X_i \,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[joint entropy]] of the variable set &lt;math&gt;\{X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. In terms of the discrete probability distributions on variables &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\} &lt;/math&gt;, the total correlation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)= \sum_{x_1\in\mathcal{X}_1} \sum_{x_2\in\mathcal{X}_2} \ldots \sum_{x_n\in\mathcal{X}_n} p(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\log\frac{p(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)} {p(x_1)p(x_2)\cdots p(x_n)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total correlation is the amount of information ''shared'' among the variables in the set. The sum &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_i)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; represents the amount of information in [[bit]]s (assuming base-2 logs) that the variables would possess if they were totally independent of one another (non-redundant), or, equivalently, the average code length to transmit the values of all variables if each variable was (optimally) coded independently. The term &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots ,X_{n})&lt;/math&gt; is the ''actual'' amount of information that the variable set contains, or equivalently, the average code length to transmit the values of all variables if the set of variables was (optimally) coded together. The difference between
these terms therefore represents the absolute redundancy (in bits) present in the given
set of variables, and thus provides a general quantitative measure of the
''structure'' or ''organization'' embodied in the set of variables
(Rothstein 1952).  The total correlation is also the [[Kullback&amp;ndash;Leibler divergence]] between the actual distribution &lt;math&gt;p(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; and its maximum entropy product approximation &lt;math&gt;p(X_1)p(X_2)\cdots p(X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Total correlation quantifies the amount of dependence among a group of variables. A near-zero total correlation indicates that the variables in the group are essentially statistically independent; they are completely unrelated, in the sense that knowing the value of one variable does not provide any clue as to the values of the other variables. On the other hand, the maximum total correlation (for a fixed set of individual entropies &lt;math&gt;H(X_1), ..., H(X_n)&lt;/math&gt;) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_\max = \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_i)-\max\limits_{X_i}H(X_i),&lt;/math&gt;

and occurs when one of the variables determines ''all'' of the other variables. The variables are then maximally related in the sense that knowing the value of one variable provides complete information about the values of all the other variables, and the variables can be figuratively regarded as ''cogs,'' in which the position of one cog determines the positions of all the others (Rothstein 1952).

It is important to note that the total correlation counts up ''all'' the redundancies among a set of variables, but that these redundancies may be distributed throughout the variable set in a variety of complicated ways (Garner 1962). For example, some variables in the set may be totally inter-redundant while others in the set are completely independent. Perhaps more significantly, redundancy may be carried in interactions of various degrees: A group of variables may not possess any pairwise redundancies, but may possess higher-order ''interaction'' redundancies of the kind exemplified by the parity function. The decomposition of total correlation into its constituent redundancies is explored in a number sources (Mcgill 1954, Watanabe 1960, Garner 1962, Studeny &amp; Vejnarova 1999, Jakulin &amp; Bratko 2003a, Jakulin &amp; Bratko 2003b, Nemenman 2004, Margolin et al. 2008, Han 1978, Han 1980).

==Conditional total correlation==
Conditional total correlation is defined analogously to the total correlation, but adding a condition to each term.  Conditional total correlation is similarly defined as a Kullback-Leibler divergence between two conditional probability distributions,
:&lt;math&gt;C(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n|Y=y) \equiv \operatorname{D_{KL}}\left[ p(X_1, \ldots, X_n|Y=y) \| p(X_1|Y=y)p(X_2|Y=y)\cdots p(X_n|Y=y)\right] \; .&lt;/math&gt;

Analogous to the above, conditional total correlation reduces to a difference of conditional entropies,

:&lt;math&gt;C(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n|Y=y) = \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_i|Y=y) - H(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n|Y=y)&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses of total correlation==

[[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] and [[feature selection]] algorithms based on total correlation have been explored by Watanabe. Alfonso et al. (2010) applied the concept of total correlation to the optimisation of water monitoring networks.

{{main|Charles Spearman # Theory of Intelligence}}

[[Charles Spearman]] developed his '''two-factor theory of intelligence''' using [[factor analysis]].&lt;ref name= "Weiten"/&gt; His research not only led him to develop the concept of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g factor'']]  of general intelligence, but also the ''s'' factor of specific intellectual abilities.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; [[Louis Leon Thurstone|L. L. Thurstone]], [[Howard Gardner]], and [[Robert Sternberg]] also researched the structure of intelligence, and in analyzing their data, concluded that a single underlying factor was influencing the general intelligence of individuals. However, Spearman was criticized in 1916 by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who claimed that the evidence was not as crucial as it seemed.&lt;ref name= "Godfrey"/&gt; Modern research is still expanding this theory by investigating Spearman's law of diminishing returns,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and adding connected concepts to the research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spearman's two-factor theory of intelligence ==

In 1904,&lt;ref name="Kalat"&gt;Kalat, J.W. (2014). ''Introduction to Psychology, 10th Edition.'' Cengage Learning. pg. 295&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Spearman]] had developed a statistical procedure called [[factor analysis]]. In factor analysis, related variables are tested for correlation to each other, then the correlation of the related items are evaluated to find clusters or groups of the variables.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;Weiten, W. (2013). ''Psychology: Themes and Variations'' (9th ed.). Thomson Wadsworth Publishing. pg. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Spearman tested how well people performed on various tasks relating to [[intelligence]]. Such tasks include: distinguishing [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], perceiving weight and colors, directions, and mathematics.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; When analyzing the data he collected, Spearman noted that those that did well in one area also scored higher in other areas. With this data, Spearman concluded that there must be one central factor that influences our cognitive abilities. Spearman termed this general intelligence [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, D.G. (2009). ''Psychology: Ninth Edition in Modules.'' Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|1-4292-1638-7}}. pg. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = G.H. | year = 1947 | title = Charles Spearman. 1863-1945 | url = | journal = Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume = 5 | issue = 15| pages = 373–385 | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1947.0006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of intelligence debate ==

Due to the controversy of the structure of intelligence, other psychologists also published their relevant research. Other than [[Charles Spearman]], three others developed a hypothesis regarding the structure of intelligence. [[Louis Leon Thurstone|L. L. Thurstone]] tested subjects on 56 different abilities; from his data he established seven primary mental abilities relating to intelligence. He categorized them as: spatial ability, numerical ability, word fluency, memory, perceptual speed, verbal comprehension, and inductive reasoning. Other researchers, interested in this new research study, analyzed Thurstone's data, discovering that those that scored high in one category often did well in the others.&lt;ref name= "Myers"/&gt; This finding gives support that there is an underlying factor influencing them, namely [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']].

[[Howard Gardner]] suggested in his [[theory of multiple intelligences]] that intelligence is formed out of multiple abilities. He recognized eight intelligences: linguistic, musical, spatial, intrapersonal, interpersonal, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, and naturalist. He also considered the possibility of a ninth intelligent ability, existential intelligence.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Gardner proposed that individuals who excelled in one ability would lack in another. Instead, his results showed that each of his eight intelligences correlate positively with each other. After further analysis, Gardner found that logic, spatial abilities, language, and mathematics are all linked in some way, giving support for an underlying [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] that is prominent in almost all intelligence in general.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

[[Robert Sternberg]] agreed with Gardner that there were multiple intelligences, but he narrowed his scope to just three in his [[triarchic theory of intelligence]]: analytical, creative, and practical. He classified analytical intelligence as problem-solving skills in tests and academics. Creative intelligence is considered how people react adaptively in new situations, or create novel ideas. Practical intelligence is defined as the everyday logic used when multiple solutions or decisions are possible.&lt;ref name= "Myers"/&gt; When Sternberg analyzed his data the relationship between the three intelligences surprised him. The data resembled what the other psychologists had found. All three mental abilities correlated highly with one another, and evidence that one basic factor, [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']], was the primary influence.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

Not all psychologists agreed with Spearman and his general intelligence. In 1916,&lt;ref name= "Godfrey"/&gt; [[Godfrey Thomson]] wrote a paper criticizing Spearman's ''g'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The object of this paper is to show that the cases brought forward by Professor Spearman in favor of the existence of General Ability are by no means "crucial." They are it is true not inconsistent with the existence of such a common element but neither are they inconsistent with its non-existence. The essential point about Professor Spearman's hypothesis is the existence of this General Factor. Both he and his opponents are agreed that there are Specific Factors peculiar to individual tests, both he and his opponents agree that there are Group Factors which run through some but not all tests. The difference between them is that Professor Spearman says there is a further single factor which runs through all tests, and that by pooling a few tests the Group Factors can soon be eliminated and a point reached where all the correlations are due to the General Factor alone. (pp. 217)&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = G. H. | year = 1916 | title = A hierarchy without a general factor | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 271–281 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Development of Spearman's theory ==

=== Experimental Evidence ===
Spearman originally came up with the term General Intelligence, or as he called it, [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'']], to measure intelligence in his Two  Theory on Intelligence. Spearman first researched in an experiment with 24 children from a small village school measuring three intellectual measures, based on teachers rankings, to address intellectual and sensory as the two different sets of measure: School Cleverness, Common Sense A and Common Sense B.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fancher | first1 = R. E. | year = 1985 | title = Spearman's original computation of ''g'': A model for Burt? | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 341–352 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1985.tb01957.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His results showed the average [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] between intellectual and sensory measures to be +.38, School Cleverness and Commonsense to be at +0.55, and the three tasks intercorrelated at +0.25.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This data was looked at other populations including high school. Spearman proposed that intellectual and sensory measure be combined as assessment of general intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''g'' and ''s''===

Spearman proposed that his two-factor theory has two components. The general intelligence, ''g'', influences the performance on all mental tasks, while another component influences abilities on a particular task.&lt;ref name= "Thomson"/&gt; To explain the differences in performance on different tasks, Spearman hypothesized that this other component was specific to a certain aspect of intelligence. This second factor he named ''s'', for specific ability.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; Regarding ''g'', Spearman saw individuals as having more or less general intelligence, while ''s'' varied from person to person on a task.&lt;ref name= "Thomson"/&gt; In 1999, behavior geneticist [[Robert Plomin]] described ''g'' by saying: "''g'' is one of the most reliable and valid measures in the behavioral domain... and it predicts important social outcomes such as educational and occupational levels far better than any other trait."&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

To visualize ''g'', imagine a [[Venn diagram]] with four circles overlapping. In the middle of the overlapping circles, would be ''g'', which influences all the specific intelligences, while ''s'' is represented by the four circles. Though the specific number of ''s'' factors are unknown, a few have been relatively accepted: mechanical, spatial, logical, and arithmetical.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

Rising interest in the debate on the structure of intelligence prompted Spearman to elaborate and argue for his hypothesis. He claimed that ''g'' was not made up of one single ability, but rather two genetically influenced, unique abilities working together. He called these abilities "eductive" and "reproductive". He suggested that future understanding of the interaction between these two different abilities would drastically change how individual differences and cognition are understood in psychology, possibly creating the basis for wisdom.&lt;ref name= "Spearman"&gt;Spearman, C. (2005). The Abilities of Man: Their Nature and Measurement. The Blackburn Press. {{ISBN|1-932846-10-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on psychology ==

=== Intelligence testing ===

Many researches are currently using Spearman's form of intelligence testing in their current studies. Although not all of the studies are currently using Spearman's exact model for intelligence testing, they are adding some modern concepts to that study. Spearman described that there was a functional relationship between intelligence and Sensory Discriminatory Abilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sensory Discrimination, Working Memory and Intelligence in 9-Year-Old and 11-Year-Old Children |url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/icd.1803|journal = Infant and Child Development|access-date = 2015-04-12|doi=10.1002/icd.1803|volume=22|pages=523–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has determined that there is an overlap between [[Working Memory]], General Discriminatory Abilities, and [[Fluid Intelligence]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His work has been built on, expanded, and linked to many other factors related to intelligence.

Intelligence testing measuring the ''g'' factor has been studied recently to re-explore Spearman's law of diminishing returns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = M. R. | year = 2013 | title = Interpreting the g Loadings of Intelligence Test Composite Scores in Light of Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns | url = | journal = School Psychology Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 63–76 | doi = 10.1037/spq0000013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study investigates how ''g'' test scores will most likely decrease as ''g'' increases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has been done to investigate if ''g'' scores are made up of scores from [[Differential Ability Scales]], ''s'' factors, and how the law of diminishing returns compare to [[g factor (psychometrics)|Spearman's Law of diminishing returns]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the use of linear and nonlinear [[Confirmatory Factor Analysis]], it is showing that the nonlinear model best described the data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The nonlinear model suggests that as ''g'' increases, the ''s'' factor lowers the overall score and inaccurately represents general intelligence.

=== Modern psychology ===

This theory is still greatly present in today's modern psychology. Researchers are examining this theory and recreating it in modern research. The [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] is still frequently studied in current research. For example, a study could use and be compared with various other similar intelligence measures. Scales such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] has been compared with Spearman's ''g'', which shows that there has a decrease in statistic significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = H. | last2 = Oakland | first2 = T. D. | year = 2000 | title = Secular Declines in Spearman's g: Some Evidence From the United States | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 161 | issue = 3| pages = 337–345 | doi=10.1080/00221320009596716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has been adapted to incorporate modern psychological topics into Spearman's Two Factor Theory of Intelligence. [[Nature versus Nurture]] is one topic that has been cross studied with Spearman's ''g'' factor. Research shows that although [[environmental factor]]s influence the ''g'' factor differently, it has been found that it is affected if influenced early in life, rather than adulthood where there is little to no impact.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouchard | first1 = J. J. | year = 2009 | title = Genetic influence on human intelligence (Spearman's g): How much?. | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 527–544 | doi = 10.1080/03014460903103939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic influence has been documented to greatly influence ''g'' factor on intelligence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Urban ecosystems''' are the [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, and urban strips constructed by [[human]]s.

This is the growth in the urban population and the supporting built infrastructure has affected both [[urban environment]]s and also on areas which surround urban areas. These include semi or 'peri-urban' environments that fringe cities as well as agricultural and natural landscapes. Semi environments  can also be called peri-urban.

Nowadays scientists are developing ways to measure and understand the effects of [[urbanization]] on human and [[environmental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neighborhood- scale urban forest ecosystem classification|last = Steenberg|volume=163|journal = Journal of environmental management|publisher =|year = 2015|isbn =|location =|pages =134–145|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By considering urban areas as part of a broader [[Socioecology|social-ecological system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Urban ecosystem health assessment:A review|last = Meirong|first = Su|journal= The Science of the Total Environment|volume=408|issue=12|year = 2010|isbn =|location =|pages = 2425–2434|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists can investigate how urban landscapes function and how they affect other landscapes with which they interact. In this context, urban environments are affected by their surrounding environment but also affect that environment. Knowing this may provide clues as to which alternative development options will lead to the best overall environmental outcome.

CSIRO CSE's&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090708192523/http://www.csiro.au/org/cse.html&lt;/ref&gt; urban ecosystem research is focused on:

*Understanding how cities work as integrated social-ecological systems 
*Developing [[sustainable development|sustainable approaches to development]] of city fringe areas that reduce negative impact on surrounding environments 
*Developing approaches to [[urban design]] that provide for health and opportunity for citizens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6964">The '''Women of Outstanding Achievement Photographic Exhibition''' was an annual event organised by the [[UKRC]].&lt;ref name="wise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Outstanding Achievement|url=http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/wise-awards/wise-awards-2012/women-of-outstanding-achievement|website=www.wisecampaign.org.uk|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognised women within science, engineering and technology (SET). The exhibition was created in 2006. Between six and eight women were chosen each year to be photographed by Robert Taylor.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt; Nominations occur in the Autumn of each year and the recipients were announced at a ceremony in March of the following year.

Many of the portraits from previous years are on permanent loan to institutions such as the [[University of Oxford]], [[The Royal Society]] and The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/uks/uks100.html |title=RAEng hangs portraits promoting female engineers: News from UK Resource Centre for Women in SET |publisher=Laboratorytalk.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait of scientist [[Nancy Rothwell]] was purchased by the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/largerimage.php?LinkID=mp94207&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=0 |title=National Portrait Gallery - Large Image NPG x133002; Dame Nancy Jane Rothwell |publisher=Npg.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 the exhibition opened at The Royal Academy of Engineering.
